            <li>so I instead went with a best badger brush by Edwin Jagger (Model 1ej947sds):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>He says it is the best brush ever.  </li>
            <li>Not the best quality shaving brush but gets the work done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve upgraded from a boar hair brush and the quality of this brush is impressive for the price.</li>

            <li>This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve tried in its class.  </li>
            <li>This is not the best shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent value for money, although not the softest of brushes but still quite luxurious</li>
            <li>The Escali shaving brush is an excellent value for the cost and the softness of the brush.  </li>

            <li>I used to have a boar brush, which I like for some reasons, but it cannot hold a candle to this brush&#x27;s ability to create a great soapy foam.  </li>

            <li>Nice brush!  </li>
            <li>This is by no means the perfect badger hair brush, but as an entry-level improvement to a boar bristle brush, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>

            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li>I had this for about a week, used it a good bit, and found my soap covered in what looked a hobos beard.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>really good brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Badger is the way to go and this brush meets the need at a fair price.</li>
            <li>This brush is well built and helps create a good lather with the soap I use.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product and at a good price.</li>
            <li>This brush has been good to lather up with.  </li>
            <li>It arrived ahead of schedule &amp; the price a good deal as well for a brush made with badger hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush was excellent for lathering the soap and felt smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>and I decided to look for a good one online.</li>
            <li>This brush is as good as any of the ones I saw  for 3 to 5 times the price.</li>
            <li>Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2) Creates good lather</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to shaving cream in every way.</li>
            <li>It will shed, but for the price its good.</li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>For what you pay, it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>I get a good lather from the brush.  </li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>Feels good, works well.</li>
            <li>Seems to be fairly sturdy now that it has shed out&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Came in good time.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any good comps.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see why anyone would pay over $100 for a brush when this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Good cheapie to use, if you are a beginner and want to see if you like DE safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>It breaks in nicely, for a great lather and shave.</li>
            <li>Nice brush at a great price point.</li>
            <li>Good brush</li>
            <li>Good company and a good product</li>
            <li>USA Vitamins did a good job with delivery.  </li>
            <li>My advice to anyone who enjoys a good lather is to skip the value brush and just buy a &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; out of the gate.  </li>
            <li>Its a good brush.</li>
            <li>I had a cake of shaving soap to review on my blog, and for the longest time I was using it without a good brush.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a stand for it, but otherwise a good product and good value.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Looks and feels great, fits in the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to do that good of a job.  </li>
            <li>Take my advice and put another twenty to thirty bucks with this and get yourself a good brush..</li>
            <li>This is a good, moderately-priced brush.</li>
            <li>Provides good lather.  </li>
            <li>Build up a good lather.</li>
            <li>Good placeto start with de shaving</li>

            <li>Nothing like a good razon.</li>
            <li>Feels so good when applying the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Use a good shaving cream however</li>
            <li>A good brush to start of with.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>This has a good feel to it, and is a badger brush, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>if you want to stick with cartridge marketing gimmicks I still say this could be a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your like me and just wanted to try one out before dropping off 100 bucks on a nicer one, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>The price was so good on this brush</li>
            <li>It works really good.  </li>
            <li>You guys keep up the good work</li>
            <li>Good brush.  </li>
            <li>I have given it two good washings and used with shaving soap and the smell is still there.</li>

            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>Excellent lathering, with a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good beginner&#x27;s brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>Works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>me, this + Merkur 34C razor + Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades + Van Der</li>
            <li>If you want good value this is it  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is a good brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>The brush feels good against the face.</li>
            <li>It holds water well, gives a good lather, and feels good.</li>
            <li>Fair price, good product,fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s before I received a replacement , it does create and hold a good lather.</li>
            <li>Feels good on contact with your skin and good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with Proraso shaving soap and it works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>However, that all seems to have gone away now - the brush has started to work well and holds a good bit of lather.</li>
            <li>Good price for product.  </li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>The brush rinses out well and holds a good shape when soaped.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave brush, no foul smell, breaks in well, and creates a smooth lather.  </li>
            <li>Hair keeps falling out and does not keep a shape that allows you to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>Receiver loved it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good performer for the price.</li>
            <li>The product is good</li>
            <li>It has a good feel on the beard.</li>
            <li>so I guess it is in good condition.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good  work.</li>
            <li>Just paint on with the brush, then good to go.  </li>
            <li>This is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Either one of these brushes is superior than the Escali.    </li>
            <li>Forms a good lather.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand and is made well.</li>
            <li>Iv looked on amazon and this is the best price for a genuine badger brush.</li>
            <li>brush is vastly superior to the boars hair brush it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li>I think I made a good choice with this brush.</li>
            <li>I wood recommend this brush ad a good entry level badger brush.</li>
            <li>I returned it after 1 use, thank you Amazon for having a good return policy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is smooth and still has perfect edges to lather.  </li>
            <li>Been using it about 2-5 times a week for 5 months, and it&#x27;s still in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Seems to be of good qualitity - my husband hasn&#x27;t used this yet.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is good and the feeling on the beard was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It also feels good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t stink like a boars hair brush, but it tends to lose hair with each shave.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t justify giving that when this one is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>Good feel.  </li>
            <li>My brother loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product for price.</li>

            <li>Nice brush, feels and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, some hairs come out sometimes, but good luck finding one that doesn&#x27;t shed every once in a while</li>
            <li>Good if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li>Saw the price and reviews and thought this looks really good.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product</li>
            <li>This brush is of good quality and I have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li>Also came in a timely fashion, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the brush itself deserves 3 stars, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because the service was good.</li>
            <li>I am not an expert shaver, makes a good lather.</li>
            <li>If it lasts than 3 months, I will downgrade it, but the price was good, so.</li>
            <li>This is a really good quality product.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>

            <li>Good luck and</li>
            <li>the soap leathers up nicely and works great.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter as the brush separates leaving no head to brisssle your face or wrestle up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Nothing offensive that I can detect, so that&#x27;s another good thing.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush is both a good product and a reasonably-priced one.  </li>
            <li>However, I like how this brush feels on my face, and it does a good job</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li>Feels good in hand.</li>
            <li>i dont find a good reason to switch to a brush..</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair entry-level brush, but don&#x27;t expect longevity here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and reliable, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and is made with good quality.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had that happen with good makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job of lifting whiskers while applying the lather to my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not god-awful, but once you put in the cash for a good product that LASTS and that feels good, you&#x27;ll know the difference.</li>

            <li>Also, I use the shaving brush to apply the cream to my scalp and I find the brush holds a fair amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>But if you want a brush that exfoliates (or if you like to rotate your brushes), this can be a good thing.  </li>

            <li>I take good care of it</li>

            <li>This brush does a good job in mixing lather.</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;re good to go.</li>

            <li>Nothing beats an old-fashioned shave with a safety razor and good quality shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I found it good for what I paid for it YMMV.....</li>

            <li>I was hoping with all of the good reviews, this would have been a good purchase....</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars rather than one because it does whip up a good lather.</li>

            <li>I can quickly prepare a great shaving lather and it feels great going onto my face.  </li>

            <li>Feels very comfortable to the skin and creates a good lather, of course you need a good soap to go with it as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many of the more spendy creams are good also, but at Taylors price it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great packing, fast shipping and very good product.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of product that reminds of the quality and craftsmanship that are so satisfying, and the shave, using one of the tube-based (not aerosol can) creams gives an amazingly great, painless shave.  </li>
            <li>Still works great though, and feels fantastic with a good lather.</li>
            <li>So far very happy for a great price</li>

            <li>, I like the smell, the size is ok, good quality</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a silvertip brush</li>
            <li>A nice brush, holds soap well, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten many a good lather out of it.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t like it and should have given it one star.</li>
            <li>Nice feel of the wood handle.</li>
            <li>He loves this brush and has made the transition quite nicely (hasn&#x27;t even nicked his face yet).  </li>
            <li>Nice brush.  </li>
            <li>Honestly i can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this thing and spreading shaving cream across my face with my hand.</li>
            <li>Nice price too.</li>
            <li>There are certainly better brushes out there for an increased cost, but a badger hair brush for $13 is too good of a deal.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the shave I got</li>
            <li>This brush gives me a nice even lather all over my face and the bristles don&#x27;t get ruined by water.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Really nice brush.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, packaged perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Rinse under warm running tap water for 2-3 minutes, taking care to remove all soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>It works well and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Now my brush smells like my nice almond shave soap, but it took some time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I liked it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see me loving a brush.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Best badger brushes are considered a good medium for those that like the luxurious softness of the silvertip, but still want the bristles to have enough strength to build a good lather or exfoliate the face.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely, doesn&#x27;t shed, and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>This brush wears in nicely.</li>
            <li>Perfect for making good lather in bowl, holds moisture well and soft.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on his skin and not scratchy.  </li>
            <li>and he said he liked it.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my face and works well with my shave soap.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get him something nice as a surprise, so I did a lot of research and ended up getting him this brush and the proraso shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Perfect shaving brush, thanks</li>
            <li>Definitely a nice looking counterfeit</li>

            <li>Packaging was nice.  </li>

            <li>Nice price.</li>

            <li>I bought this brush as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; item to see how well he liked shaving with shaving soap instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, and handles very well.</li>
            <li>It smells like they caged a badger in its own feces for a year, clubbed it over the head, took a patch of its hair, then put that hair in the brush.</li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The warm water rushed across the brush as it dampened.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Running the brush through warm soapy water did not help.</li>
            <li>I began with soaking the brush in a diluted distilled vinegar and warm water solution close to 10% vinegar for 20 minutes.</li>

            <li>Wonderful brush with natural badger bristles.</li>
            <li>While boar hair isn&#x27;t quite the quality of a good silvertip badger brush, it blows the Escali out of the water in performance and is surprisingly cheap.</li>

            <li>That was by far the best than any others including escali.  </li>
            <li>[I&#x27;ve a brush made of nylon kind of material (some kind of synthetic material) which is much more better.]</li>
            <li>I got it cause its cheap just to see if it would be good.</li>
            <li>Look ate the $18 Parket Safety Razor, it works and will be just ok and good as a starter rezor, not take Merkur at $50 range, you can see the better quality metals and the better craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>This Escali Badger brush and some wonderful Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shaving cream did the trick.</li>
            <li>Best part of an old fashion shave</li>

            <li>The brush spreads it way more effectively than just my hand</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is comfortable and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>So far (couple weeks) has performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Its a good cheap brush.  </li>

            <li>Kind of glad</li>
            <li>One of the best brushes I have used so far.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working great RARELY losing them.</li>
            <li>I knew he had his father&#x27;s razor but did not have a suitable brush.  </li>
            <li>Discipline\\&quot; sounds a bit punitive for a light-hearted popular website, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 101 year old Pop in Law and we are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Brush is excellent at building lather and so far hasn&#x27;t lost any of its bristles.</li>
            <li>and so far I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>It was a good brush for a cheap price, but it sheds a lot.</li>

            <li>Looks like excellent quality so far.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing it job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this using this brush, and the wood adds a nice touch to my counter.</li>
            <li>my opinion, start with something extremely cheap, like the Van Der Hagen, and if you decide that Wet/DE/SE shaving is for you, get something good.</li>
            <li>A great purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Perfect so far.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the old ways are best.</li>
            <li>It has served me well so far and does an excellent job of applying the shaving cream.</li>

            <li>B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]] for a superb shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this brush works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This shaving brush is extremely soft and feels wonderful on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but the musty smell noted by others is accurate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard good things about them but wasn&#x27;t about to buy one for cheap Gillette shave cream.</li>
            <li>Good size, fit and finish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is quite as soft as the one I tried in The Art of Shaving store, but at 20% of the cost it is an excellent value.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>Good price, good product, exactly what I was looking for.</li>

            <li>I loved it you guys and thanks bunches!!!</li>
            <li>After looking at my wifes brush, while it is very nice, I dont think I see  a $60 difference and with some good shaving soap I am really shaving better than ever.</li>
            <li>LOL,   It lathers fine, it drys fine by shaking it off vigorously, and seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>It holds soap better than my starter brush, has a good weight to it, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Great product that makes applying shaving cream easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nice, applies nice, and rinses out easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works a up a good lather, quickly and cleans out nicely.</li>
            <li>love this product, and shipping was quick and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>For the price, this brush is a great value, but I will eventually upgrade to a something more substantial after I become more familiar with DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Creates a good lather and rinses clean very easily.</li>
            <li>This brush was surprisingly well made, very soft and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s inexpensive, but it can work up a great lather right on my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are great, just about the right &#x27;softness.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t know if it is right for your, then this is a great brush for you.  </li>
            <li>Bought this right before Christmas, it&#x27;s still in great condition and used all the time.  </li>
            <li>All I could do was LOL and kick myself as it all was right here in the feedback.</li>
            <li>but when I do it will be badger and the knot will not come out so easily!</li>
            <li>I received my order of the shaving brush very quickly and was very pleased with the item</li>
            <li>But it shipped very quickly (showed up before the razor!)</li>
            <li>Voila! EASY!</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping and Nice packaging!  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!  </li>
            <li>While I do want absolutely the best for my precious face, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference just yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience for comparisions, but this seems like a very nice brush, and well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>The price is right if you aren&#x27;t into a super awesome shave</li>
            <li>There are two main brands that make very good boar hair brushes that can be purchased in the $10-25 range, and those are Omega and Semogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is even in some circles I have researched a special designation beyond that to a incredible special badger or something.  </li>
            <li>The Escali 100% pure badger bristle shaving brush fulfills it&#x27;s purpose and at the best price available.  </li>
            <li>The brush holds a lot of water and allows me to create a water rich lather that really accentuates this wonderful new shaving experience I&#x27;ve been enjoying!!!  </li>
            <li>I had stopped using shaving soap and a brush some years ago because I could never produce good, rich foam.</li>
            <li>Very good product, highly recommended</li>
            <li>There is nothing in the world like a great shave with some Proraso Shave Cream and a Pure Badger bristle brush!</li>
            <li>I prefer to face lather and doing so wasn&#x27;t super pleasant with this brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush, makes a good lather and is soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>For 15 dollars this is honestly a great buy if you want to get an idea of what a badger brush feels/lathers like, but if you are buying this solely because you want a cheap brush, then just go get a cheap boar/synthetic brush in one of those drug store shave kits.</li>
            <li>I get a much better shave and best of all it doesn&#x27;t shed like the old one.</li>
            <li>Most good cheap brushes will be bore hair, horse hair, or synthetic.</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed by how soft the brush was, and how it easily whipped my shaving soap into a nice foamy \\&quot;just right\\&quot; lather to my liking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to clean and awesome to use!</li>
            <li>Good Shaving brush as advertised, it was fast delivered after order was placed and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>Good built quality, soft, densed bristles and attractively priced .&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>Well made, feels great on face, bought several as gifts, everyone happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>It is nice to know some businesses share my views and can supply quality products for a reasonable cost and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I have used many brushes in my life time but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Using circular motions creates more of an exfoliating feeling from the brush while up/down or back/forth motions feel really soft and produce a wonderful lather with my Proraso Shave Soap.</li>
            <li>Nice wooden handle that fits perfectly in my shaving stand</li>
            <li>It also rinses quite easily, so there isn&#x27;t a great deal of clean up involved.</li>
            <li>The shaving brush works a lather very easily and will save your shave time for actually enjoying your shave.</li>
            <li>It looks very nice with my chrome stand and certainly feels nice to the face.</li>
            <li>I am nicely impressed, and have no regrets springing for this brush!</li>
            <li>Great quality for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great on my face, and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>If you buy be sure to clean the brush real good before first use.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Loved it very nice and soft lather was applied with ease</li>
            <li>First one is still in great shape after 3 years.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described, well made product.</li>
            <li>As a first brush it is a great starter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is great at doing the job, I just wish it didn&#x27;t shed the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great that being said this is my first experience with using a shave brush</li>
            <li>This brush is great for a first time shaving soap user.</li>
            <li>After wetshaving for a while, i&#x27;ve moved onto Colonel Conk&#x27;s shave soaps and they are excellent products that I love, but the creams of Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, and Cella are 5x better than Col Conk.</li>
            <li>It feels great and seems be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to get a great lather by using this brush and it feels smooth and comfortable while applying an even coat to my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I experienced a fast and well-packaged delivery!</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, but I have to say that I am quite happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>it does not smell great on first use if you don&#x27;t do something to somewhat condition it.</li>
            <li>it feels great when using hot water.</li>
            <li>Some hair came off throughout first use, but has been great since.  </li>
            <li>This brush works great and does exactly what it is designed to.</li>
            <li>well the first time but after 1 or 2 uses, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>The price is great and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the great work and enthusiasm guys, and thanks!</li>
            <li>My dog freaked out when I first unpackaged it lol.</li>
            <li>Even so, I still thought it was a tad bit sharp for my test, so eventually I will be opting for a good Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent badger shaving brush, really soft and makes lots of smooth nice lather</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush and it works great -  Holds up well and does not shed - been using it for about 6-weeks or so</li>
            <li>For the price it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li>This brush works great, and shipping was fast and efficient!</li>
            <li>He is in the Forest  Service and apparently this brand is the best thing going.  </li>
            <li>First impression of the brush was great.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it, but I am happy with how it functions.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is quite superior to most shaving brushes available today.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li>Great first time shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised, great entry level badger brush that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully, does not smell much.</li>
            <li>funny thinking about that and makes me want to use it all the time besides what a great job it does.</li>
            <li>I would probably give this brush 5 stars as it is my first and it works great</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for someone unsure if they want to use a shaving brush at all, this is a great first investment.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful brush that lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect with it being pretty inexpensive, but after reading all the great reviews I ordered it.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that dealing with USA Vitamins was great.</li>
            <li>I give it a full rinse, then a good squeezing, shaping it into a christmas lightbulb before putting it on my holder.</li>
            <li>price wise not bad .i</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 months since I started using this brush and the hair is still full and helps create a good lather.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect, very well made and really works the lather into the face for &amp;#34;really good shaves&amp;#34; +</li>
            <li>It remains true that you get what you pay for and I should have known that at that price the quality cannot good.</li>
            <li>The brush was quite full and the hair was of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Great for whipping up a perfect lather in seconds and the badger hair does a perfect job of lifting all of those bothersome little facial hairs.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with a nice safety razor; I purchased a Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; 42C, nice blades; I purchased Astra Super Premium Platinum Double and a nice shaving cream, you will get the best shave of your life.  </li>
            <li>a later with shave soap very easily, and feels awesome when applied to the face.&lt;br</li>

            <li>No hairs have come out and it is very comfortable on my face.</li>

            <li>I like it better than the badger</li>
            <li>There are better badger brushes out there</li>
            <li>So much better than boar (on me</li>
            <li>Simple and no-fuss brush that will do the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and the packaging was great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can that many people that purchase  </li>
            <li>Much better than the boar brush</li>
            <li>cheap, but works as well as a quality badger brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just go with a cheap synthetic omega brush and then upgrade to a nice badger brush if you feel the need.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s pleased.</li>
            <li>I hope they stay in business for many, many years to come!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall for the price this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>It will wear out, but the cost is reasonable and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>It got slightly better with use, but still scratches more than a quality brush should.</li>
            <li>Just save yourself some headache and buy a better brush; I did.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>Have used it for 4 weeks and like it better every day.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where can I learn more?</li>
            <li>I opted out for the badger since it holds and retains water better.  </li>
            <li>The brush is ok for the price.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>glad to report it</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Really exfoliates the skin and feels great every morning.</li>
            <li>use Col Conk&#x27;s which requires a bit more vigorous whipping</li>
            <li>Lathers up my shaving soap better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>For the price, I can&#x27;t imagine a better deal.</li>
            <li>Wish I didn&#x27;t keep losing it, but I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lose to many bristles - been using it for almost a month</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok for the money.  </li>
            <li>If you are purchasing this brush most people recommend a stand that allows for it to be stored inverted.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but this is a great brush and at a great price.</li>
            <li>This brush from Escali is holding up much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it deserves 5 stars for sure.  </li>
            <li>but this is more an observation than an annoyance and</li>
            <li>Well worth the money build good.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with the Escali badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is not the best in the world but is better than several boar brushes that cost more.  </li>
            <li>What i DO know is i like it better than spraying something on my hand and wiping my face with it.  </li>
            <li>to go get a kiss now.... :-)</li>
            <li>This brush sheds more hair than a husky in summer.</li>
            <li>also love the feeling of brushing the cream on my face with the Escali.</li>
            <li>I love the way it swirls around my whiskers and exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably get more of them.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied, but not amazed by this brush.</li>
            <li>i was able to get a fluffier lather with this brush then the boar.  </li>
            <li>Price makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin and really helps lather up my face.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>They are making me type more words.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Much better then no brush for sure.  </li>
            <li>Been using shave brushes for years and this one is top of the line.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase especially considering that a comparable badger brush cost 40 to 50 dollars.</li>
            <li>I tried the boar bristle and it was OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money and certainly good for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>Quite more affordable than the more quality, softer badger brushes</li>
            <li>a stylish brush from the art of shaving company.</li>
            <li>in this case it was more.</li>
            <li>I love that stuff, but I&#x27;ve found that applying soap/cream with a brush makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>Within seconds, a nice foamy lather ensued and I was able to shave more comfortably, and closely than I have ever shaved...</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this one more than those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay more for a better brush than this one.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>i love this brush.</li>
            <li>Again neither of these issues are a huge deal and in all honestly are probably just part of the brush.</li>
            <li>Perhaps as I use it, it might get better.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, your best bet will be to look around for a low end Simpson brush.</li>
            <li>Just like many who purchased this one, I was just getting into the Wet-shave thing.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d be OK with losing.    </li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I bought a synthetic shaving brush after this one, and that fared much better.</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic hanging display box keeping the brush safe during shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having a great product.</li>
            <li>I love it myself</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the Cade but has much more capacity I would go with that way before this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes, but I can&#x27;t complain because of the price</li>
            <li>sure to hang it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with mine.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>maybe after some more use, it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quite possibly the best badger</li>
            <li>Well, I love it.</li>
            <li>It holds water much better than the boar hair brush did.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a brush holder so that it hang drys with the bristles facing downward.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaving brush!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft which I was looking for and works great for lathering shaving cream on</li>
            <li>I have returned mine and have picked up a cheaper and better one from Target.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>probably 4-5 more months.  </li>
            <li>Get some Sandalwood shaving cream too, ladies love it.</li>
            <li>Just purchased this brush based on the top reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It reached the point that I would pull twenty or more bristles off this brush before each shave</li>
            <li>and I still had so many come out in the lather on my face</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the brush at its bargain price.</li>
            <li>Review by Charles, Elizabeth doesn&#x27;t shave with a brush.  :)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for me, but i can see how this may be an issue for someone with really big hands.  </li>
            <li>I even look forward to shaving as it is know more of a ritual indulgence than a chore.</li>
            <li>I feel that I am washing away a lot of the lather that is still in the brush that would have worked better on my face.</li>
            <li>and it gets softer the more</li>
            <li>i nded up with more hair off the rush than the hair on my face</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>This method is so much better</li>
            <li>I love it and will get another if I ever need another one</li>
            <li>You could spend more but why?  </li>
            <li>It has lost more than I was anticipating it would lose, and more than what others have said they lost.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I find this to be an OK shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is I love the brush.</li>
            <li>Stay smooth!</li>
            <li>It looks ok and works ok</li>
            <li>I am really happy I decided to go with this product as it makes lathering up my shaving soap much easier.</li>
            <li>This brush requires much more shaving cream than a brush I have.</li>
            <li>This time I stepped up to a premier brush and the results are stunning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;am Returning it and getting a Baxter of California Best Badger Brush, its made in Germany and will likely be a better product for me.</li>
            <li>but Im sure</li>
            <li>They loved it so much they bought their own brush and TOBS shave cream :))</li>
            <li>He is just starting with shaving with a safety razor and this is perfect for him.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice think lather and spreads it smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>I love my shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Is it better than a $60 Parker?  </li>
            <li>but it is worlds better than a boar hair brush.</li>
            <li>The badger shaving brush is an elegant implement.  </li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works ok for bowl lathering but not for face lathering.</li>
            <li>The Semogue is a better brush than the Omega)</li>
            <li>and it is better than most $70 dollar</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rinse it thoroughly after every shave and give it some air to breathe when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase and the fulfillment service.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with its quality and performance from day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t used it too many times as he was finishing up some shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>It would have gotten 5 stars if my husband had used it more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>It lost more hair than my Parkers.</li>
            <li>It shed a couple of bristles but not as many as the boar hair one did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I came across this brush.  </li>
            <li>I guess I appreciate that the fibers are authentic and that they didn&#x27;t use a bunch of chemicals or fragrance to cover the sent.</li>
            <li>until I was sure that it was something I would use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles on a smooth finished handle perfectly suited to shaving soap bowls.</li>
            <li>Its leaps and bounds better than the synthetic brush I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>So the shaving brush works as promised and by most accounts</li>
            <li>Love this Badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the price!</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is a better quality than most of the cheaper, store bought brushes I have used.</li>
            <li>You can pay more for fancier handles, but they won&#x27;t work any better for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li>My brother and father have purchased $100+ brushes and they are better,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush and am planning on purchasing it along with some more shaving supplies to give as a gift to my dad.</li>
            <li>excellent brush especially at this price.</li>
            <li>Top quality</li>
            <li>I have used a shaving brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a basis for comparison, but the brush seems well made and does a great job of working up a lather.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this one for my husband.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure some of that can be attributed to the brush doing its thing.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t matter if its badger, boar, horse, synthetic, anything you buy at this price point, from those manufacturers, will be leaps and bounds better than this Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This thing also looses a LOT of hairs, typically 5 or more every shave.  </li>
            <li>, I like that much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest paying for a better one,  the hairs continue to fall out 4th use.</li>
            <li>It holds the shaving soap better and creates a better lather.</li>
            <li>When you rinse it out, and examine it, you can see the Hair sticking up from the top, which have come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(many colors to choose from) or #10066(faux ivory)  Medium size boar brush, 24mm knot.</li>
            <li>Omega S-Brush S10065 (many colors to choose from)  </li>
            <li>There are better badger brushes out there, but you will have to spend a lot more to acquire them.  </li>
            <li>I find I have to use a comb on the brush after use to make sure it does not get too tangled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather put the money towards a better quality razor.  </li>
            <li>He says it is a great quality brush and works very well.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on reviews and glad I did.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived promptly and packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any others, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I love this one.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better one in my life</li>
            <li>I can also feel the brush extending my whiskers for a better cut thus a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Along with the Arlington shaving bowl and soap, this made a lovely gift for my son.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are rougher on my face than most boar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like it does a much better job of foaming the face than I used to get by putting on the shaving cream by hand.</li>
            <li>Very durable and great quality.</li>
            <li>All in all I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight and finish so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>it works ok but the bristles are not the softest .</li>
            <li>For the price I doubt a better brush could be found.</li>
            <li>Clearly better than the boar hair brushes you see in drug stores</li>
            <li>I hope that it softens up after more uses.</li>
            <li>Stray hairs all over the soap and my face, and the bristles irritated my skin more than a blade ever has.</li>
            <li>If not, I would safely say one star.</li>
            <li>even the art of shaving brush that comes with the $20 kit is better than the Escali.</li>
            <li>I find it better than the synthetic ones.</li>
            <li>My husband thought I paid much more for this shaving bursh.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the shaving brush I got from a shaving kit at CVS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaving brush for about a month now, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This is a great compliment to a straight edge shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this</li>
            <li>I will however, be moving on to a better brush eventually.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first, as it seemed to be losing more hairs every shave for the first week, but has performed excellently after that.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for the price.</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>THE OVER ALL DESIGN IS OK.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Join the club and buy this brush and use the savings to get some more shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it may even beat that.</li>
            <li>Many months in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it functions OK.</li>
            <li>its identical cousin, the Tweezerman) is the brush I use most often sometimes every day.</li>
            <li>This is OK.</li>
            <li>I love this Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>I am getting so many email to rate this</li>
            <li>Makes so much more soap lather then the one that came with the kit I bought.</li>
            <li>I had to lather my shave soap and leave the suds in the brush before it got better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me pass on a truly great tradition and</li>
            <li>but it does lose more hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not seen any more bristles fall out since then</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Each time, it has deposited many bristles upon my face, which I don&#x27;t notice until I&#x27;m picking them out of my razor.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>The quality of this brush was not up to par with the top ratings it has received.</li>
            <li>Worked 100% better then</li>
            <li>A perfect addition to any double edged shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy a couple more if I thought I could wear it out in five years or so.</li>
            <li>If, like me, you haven&#x27;t enjoyed 100% badger against your skin, then this product will enhance your shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this along with the safety razor that I purchased with it, I have noticed a change for the better in the way that my skin feels after I shave.</li>
            <li>Pick this thing up you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and at a good price too.</li>
            <li>Great product, my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>It is made from top quality materials and has helped make shaving a pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge into traditional wetshaving, and read that badger hair shaving brushes are the best for generating and applying shaving lather.  </li>
            <li>better than the one i got from whatever that overpriced shaving chain in the mall is, which was like 3 times the price</li>
            <li>but as I use it more it seems to have subsided.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush and this seller, both are top rated.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>creates a great lather and is very durable.</li>
            <li>Am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I would have paid much more.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased</li>
            <li>Love my item.</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic one that I have.  </li>
            <li>My spouse uses this daily and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I will just not use them any more.</li>
            <li>I like this one better</li>
            <li>Of course you can get a better quality brush by spending more money.</li>
            <li>but if you have the money I&#x27;d find a better brush.</li>
            <li>It lathers the soap better and we both think he&#x27;s getting a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on this one, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>This one seems to be holding together much better.  </li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Note : since I bought  two more ..I just put these two on reserve..</li>
            <li>If you have a shaving bowl, that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>Recommend spending additional money in getting a better brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using for many more shaves, I now find that I prefer this to the cheaper brush... but still looking.</li>
            <li>Really feels great on the face as it spreads the cream/lather around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market and that experts could point you to them.</li>
            <li>It holds the soap wonderfully, and it hasn&#x27;t dropped but one, or two bristles in several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a terrible quality brush, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>i have been using it for two weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>like it much better than using a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t go to the better safety razor, Geo F. Trumper shaving cream and this Escali shaving brush sooner.</li>
            <li>So much better than some cream out of a can and lathered on top of the whiskers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away the more you use the brush.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the brush on my skin.</li>
            <li>When you start using, you&#x27;ll notice that many hairs will come out, but will this will stop after you break it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will enjoy this product for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the Escali if you want to try out shaving with a brush &amp; soap, but aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li>this brush is perfect and should last for many years.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone went to pay more?</li>
            <li>Its real badger hair and its feels great.</li>
            <li>Compared to my &amp;#34; The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush the Badger hair is not as dense and the hair is shaped in a way in which most of the hairs on the periphery do not touch your skin.</li>
            <li>love Proraso soap and the Van der Hagen brush</li>
            <li>badger brush, which was more than 2x the price.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more for a brush that doesn&#x27;t keep losing hairs.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for a better shaving brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>A great value and retains moisture very well.</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>I went synth and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s served well as my learner brush before I upgrade to something a bit nicer, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Could&#x27;t ask for a better brush.</li>
            <li>Works better than described.</li>
            <li>Never used one until now, and it spreads the shaving soap smooth and even!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend spending your money on a better quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The product could be improved by adding more bristle.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month or so now, and it has gotten alot better.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than my boar hair brush.</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself just using it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Excellent Brush, simple as that</li>
            <li>Lathers up a lot better than without one.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will lessen with more use.</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase and it has helped with the whole adjusting to using one of these blades.</li>
            <li>I have used shaving cakes, creams, and regular face soap and the brush has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>and I like it much better than my boar brush</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll go away with time.</li>
            <li>the brush is okay.</li>
            <li>its okay for a beginner</li>
            <li>Buyers remorse for sure on this item.</li>
            <li>This brush feels great, lathers well, and has almost no &amp;#34;shedding.&amp;#34; I really like the wood handle as well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;style!</li>
            <li>Be sure to order a shaving brush and razor stand.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the product and would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the comfort of an old-fashioned shave.</li>
            <li>It feels great very morning when I am lathering up.</li>
            <li>so I would have to use it more than twice or three times a week.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine a better price/quality balance.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>There are better quality brushes out there, but you pay for them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to have more soap transferred from the brush to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most affordable one I&#x27;ve seen, and for all I knew this was just how badger fur brushes were.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great all around if you take care of it :)</li>
            <li>Glad I stayed the course.</li>
            <li>I started using shaving brushes with this brush, and it was a okay quality and inexpensive way to get into using a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>After about 4 shaves I didn&#x27;t notice any more coming off.</li>
            <li>Brush feels soft and great with a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this item.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m not noticing any more strays in the bowl or sink.</li>
            <li>Well, perhaps it costs its price, but I would invest a bit more to get something else.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this one works better.</li>
            <li>but eventually you&#x27;ll want to get a better brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are tremendously soft and hold a lather incredibly well.</li>
            <li>The badger hairs make for an elegant way to butter up one&#x27;s face before shaving.</li>
            <li>Im enjoying this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
            <li>No wonder it&#x27;s the top selling badger brush on Amazon.</li>
            <li>More and more bristles come out of the brush after each shave.</li>
            <li>Every time I apply cream using this brush, it makes feel more manly.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I will keep on using this till I find a better brush when I feel I have graduated to it.</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest piece of junk don&#x27;t buy it unless you like many bristles coming out each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I bought a boar bristle brush and it works much better.</li>
            <li>Lovely brush for shaving.</li>
            <li>It does hold more water than the bore bristles.</li>
            <li>It works very well, holds water and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Art of Shaving brush and while it feels better, the price does not match the need.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>My shaves seem closer, but I know that the shave is mostly the result of my razor and shave soap.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I opt for it after considering many others that are in the market.</li>
            <li>I purchased this badger hair shaving brush and have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The gift is enjoyed every morning</li>
            <li>As with many things, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>However, I would rate this brush as top tier for the price point.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I felt that i would try the Escali brush out because so many people recommend it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be getting slightly better over time</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>This brush does not exceed expectations, but for the price it&#x27;s being offered at, does more than it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Soft and effective, I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to update this later for a long-term review but initially I am very happy with the quality and how this brush works.</li>
            <li>I did some research about proper brush care, bought this guy, and I&#x27;ve been a happy customer since!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the entire set.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d pay a lot more for one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Great brush, so much easier than using hands to put on shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great brush at a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaving brush to use when I travel and am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Father&#x27;s day preasant for my husband, he had been shaving with boar bristle brushes since we started dating, and I noticed his shave could be better.</li>
            <li>and I received it in the appropriate time frame.</li>
            <li>He was quite pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li>its namesake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue to use it hoping that I would be able to break it in.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my order and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li>You want an outstanding brush for the cost of a 12-pack?  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, and there are certainly better ones out there.</li>
            <li>I had not used one in many years.  </li>
            <li>However, I am very happy with this brush; it has lost one or two bristles but no big deal.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, really works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>I lose more bristles each time I use it than I&#x27;d care to admit.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>This is a very well-made shaving brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>Its slightly smaller size makes it perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable and nice.</li>
            <li>My guys love them.</li>
            <li>Closest shave I have ever been able to get.</li>
            <li>Planning on buying 2 more to gift to my dad and my f-in-law.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a more substantial brush.</li>
            <li>However, almost a year later, this brush is doing it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li>This brush is great getting my beard ready for the razor.  </li>
            <li>I am a man of simple tastes- easily satisfied by the best!</li>
            <li>so she could use it with her favorite brush-on shave creams.</li>
            <li>Many people these days expect the best possible product on the market for a minimum amount of money.</li>
            <li>This leads to many things, and one is the loss of value.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the best possible brush, you&#x27;re realistically looking at a couple hundred dollars.</li>
            <li>What more do you need?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what brush to get but for the price</li>
            <li>but I am sure at some point it</li>
            <li>then I am able to load the brush with plenty of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>All and all I am quite satisfied and would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised; have enjoyed using this brush.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li>I have been completely satisfied with the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush, for $13 is a phenomenal value.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, didn&#x27;t lose many bristles at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay brush, but you can get better quality brushes for cheaper at maggardrazors.com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one from Escali.</li>
            <li>More like 3/12 Stars.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d be more concerned if it DIDN&#x27;T have a bit of an odor.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be made well,  Hangs perfectly in the wooden holder I bought to hang it in.</li>
            <li>That being said, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>In summary, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The brush also helps to prepare your skin for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will diminish over time.</li>
            <li>My Husband truly enjoyed this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Great quality fast shipping from vendor</li>
            <li>Still using, but only until my Edwin Jagger Best badger brush arrives.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying it for about 2 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problem with it getting ratty looking or too many bristles coming out.  </li>
            <li>A middle grade brush at best.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li>I love the brush but it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I also cannot use it in the swirling motion (which exfoliates better) on my face because of said irritation.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for awhile now, and it looks great and seems very well crafted.</li>
            <li>They are just all around better in every way, softer, quicker lather, feels better on the face.</li>
            <li>Makes any shave prep a better prep.</li>
            <li>Escali recommends that after using your rinse the brush with water, making sure to remove all of the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>its ok  (Jeff Abel)</li>
            <li>I love using this brush to shave.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving Brush</li>
            <li>and they fit in it nicely.</li>
            <li>Is it as comparable with most of the top name brushes out there?</li>
            <li>Either of those brushes I feel would be a step up from this one, for not that much more money.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the brush</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>, the more you use it the better it gets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>and so this one provides a more vigorous application of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It also helps whip up the lather better.</li>
            <li>Not any more...</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and whips up a nice frothy lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that because I always viewed this as my entry-brush</li>
            <li>If you expect to get more use out of it than that you&#x27;re kidding yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and I love how the brush dries when hung properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I am losing hairs way more than I should.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I wanted to get away from spending much more on the throw-away razors and blades and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this shaving brush--great quality!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the foam I could generate</li>
            <li>Shaves are better and closer.</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>works OK, some of the hairs come out onto your face when you are spreading the shaving cream on your face.</li>
            <li>Gets better as it wears</li>
            <li>I had researched it prior and found this to be the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and</li>
            <li>Excellent brush..very smooth and soft feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but also hasn&#x27;t changed my life.</li>
            <li>He has been looking for a legacy shaving kit for quite a while but has not been able to find one.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to replace another one for which I paid a lot more and used for years until it started shedding hairs.  </li>
            <li>This one works and feels better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush and is very well made.</li>
            <li>Is comfortable in your hand and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I still love this brush.</li>
            <li>The lather is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed having the brush and it works OK.</li>
            <li>But I guess for what you pay, it is an OK value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s badger hair (the top of the line in shaving brush material.</li>
            <li>Excellent basic shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Love useing it when I shave.</li>
            <li>The Shaving brush is really comfortable and feels nice when you work up the lather.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of a brush and the ability to re-wet my face with it.</li>
            <li>Prefer it so much more than those synthetic bristles brushes.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>Be sure to grab the base&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li>There were 40+ bristles in the sink and just as many hanging out of the brush.  </li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen many bristles falling out at all.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than you will spend on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years using an electric or whatever the latest craze was.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Do not trust reviews from people who don&#x27;t know better.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need to spend more money to get a quality product.</li>
            <li>after use I have to use a comb to untangle the bristles and make sure all soap is removed, I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better?</li>
            <li>and i really love this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and can recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and this is much better than applying it with my fingertips.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Save the money and invest in something better.</li>
            <li>Going on more than a month a haven&#x27;t lost any of the bristles.</li>
            <li>Use it often, love the product.</li>
            <li>love this thing.</li>
            <li>again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better re-introduction to an artful form of shaving.</li>
            <li>I think this may be the case with most shaving brushes though.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>There are definitely better quality brushes out there</li>
            <li>I love using this brush.  </li>
            <li>In many cheaper brushes the bristles have a tendency to fall out.  </li>
            <li>I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it with the shaving cream stuff they sell at trader joes and it works a lot better than just rubbing it on with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it for the six weeks I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of usage, the smell has dissipated and I mostly smell the scent of the shaving soap I use.  </li>
            <li>but the product is well built, much better than those gillete plastic brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with that shaving cream, truly</li>
            <li>but this brush with that cream is simply magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try this one and hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>Above all, I&#x27;m impressed with its softness and ability to generate a lather.</li>
            <li>I decided on the Escali because of the many reviews.  </li>
            <li>okay brush for the money....</li>
            <li>better ones def out there though.  </li>
            <li>Mostly I just smell shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I ordered a shaving brush made from Badger hair after reading some blogs that said it was much better than just using shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using it with Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.), and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Lemme tell ya, I love this shave brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone I know who shaves more than once a month.</li>
            <li>For $15 dollars I&#x27;d expect more.</li>
            <li>Great I&#x27;ll order another one real soon</li>
            <li>I guess the brush will get better as you continuously use it.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by a small company willing to go out of their way to provide excellent customer service and a quality product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Only the best.</li>
            <li>You can always pay more, but if you&#x27;re just putting your toe in the water for this type of a shave, no need to drop a king&#x27;s ransom.  </li>
            <li>Phenomenal product at a phenomenal price.</li>
            <li>Shaving brush is ok.</li>
            <li>Enjoying a close shave with the help of this shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is just ok.</li>
            <li>that was for my husband and he love it..</li>
            <li>It is OK, but I find I now need to purchase a holder to keep it in.  </li>
            <li>handle feels ok in hand</li>
            <li>You can spend $145.00 on a badger brush, sure, but why would you?</li>
            <li>and I expect to get many years of service from it.</li>
            <li>It looks good to, so in short its a great purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very inexpensive brush that is great to use or give as a gift.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>My life hasn&#x27;t changed, but I do use this brush more often than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>so I opted to start with this instead of the $30 brushes (or more).</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>and I like this escali better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect upon ordering this brush.</li>
            <li>, however, I must agree with most of the reviews in saying that this brush works wonders for its price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve passed them by regardless of price because I wanted to get  one brush and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love using the brush.  </li>
            <li>Sheds a bit more than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Generally satisfied with quality of shave.</li>
            <li>Doubt I could have done better.</li>
            <li>Received it fast and what a great brush.</li>
            <li>Coupled with dreadnought shaving cream, my skin has never looked or felt  better.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>i freaking love this brush.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?  </li>
            <li>I have to say while I do like it and will continue to use it, its far from ideal.</li>
            <li>The brush is stunning, to begin with.</li>
            <li>so I felt it was safe to order it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t shed much, works great.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Is it top quality badger and manufacturing?</li>
            <li>If this is a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; process, and it gets better, than this will be reviewed once more.</li>
            <li>It is an ok shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush daily for a couple of weeks, and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I thought this would be a starter brush for me until I saved up for something more fancy.</li>
            <li>Not only did it end up being a great brush, it also ended up being a wise investment.</li>
            <li>This Badger Shaving Brush is replacing a Boar Bristle one and it is much better.</li>
            <li>This lasts a month or so and then you don&#x27;t lose as many.  </li>
            <li>Make your shaving an enjoyable experience and get yourself one of these</li>
            <li>So to sum up, the quality is ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not convinced badger hair is any better than synthetic.</li>
            <li>looks ok on the stand..</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I have been more than satisfied with this brush.  </li>
            <li>but if I have to remove from my face more hair from the brush than the hair from my face</li>
            <li>Better to find a better brand.</li>
            <li>This one seemed like a safe bet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an excellent product not just for its price but as overall value.</li>
            <li>I have been using one of these brushes for well over a year and really love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes and this one seems like the best one yet.</li>
            <li>but it seems better put together than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK brush</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading many reviews, and I had hoped that my experience would be like the majority.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are finer than horse or boar hair so are more densely packed into the handle</li>
            <li>Its just OK.</li>
            <li>Totally enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to determine which is better for me (badger vs. boar).</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy lathering my face with shaving cream now!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see the need to pay more.</li>
            <li>This brush shed more than my dog when her coat changes for the winter months, returned.</li>
            <li>and I Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Have tried several others and found this brush to be excellent.</li>
            <li>ok improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>or I should say seems to look and work better.</li>
            <li>I searched many vendors at Amazon to find a shaving brush as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and nice, can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash it with soapy water before you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll review more once I&#x27;ve bought another and have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I think one has to spend more money to get a better quality brush.</li>
            <li>He says it is so much better than the brush has had before, which kept having the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for the price and really holds water well.  </li>
            <li>It is regarded as the softest but some prefer that their brushes have a bit more \\&quot;backbone\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I had a horsehair brush before but had heard that badger is better.  </li>
            <li>This is a top notch brush that is soft and ideally shaped.</li>
            <li>I get a much better shave using this brush and shaving soap than I do just using shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The brush effectively applies lather to the face and feels fantastic in the process.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>JUST LOVE THIS BRUSH AND WOULD TELL ANYONE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY SHAVING BRUSH</li>
            <li>I still will lose one here and there, but for the most part the shedding has stopped.</li>
            <li>He now shaves his face every day :)</li>
            <li>This was a part of a birthday gift basket for my husband and the \\&quot;I Love It\\&quot; is from him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27; ok.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t include a stand which means you can get a better brush and a stand for the price of this brush and a addition stand.</li>
            <li>There probably are better brushes out there</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a stand with this product and don&#x27;t leave it lying around.</li>
            <li>I have also found that this brush works much better with a shaving mug as opposed to a face lathering.</li>
            <li>As a barber I would definatly order more products from this business.</li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>Also, does not contain a stand, but many shave</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have many brushes to compare it to</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;ll have to shell out 5 to 10 times, or more, for one of those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it every day.</li>
            <li>Highly enjoyable product.</li>
            <li>I look forward to many more</li>
            <li>It does seem to exfoliate quite well and conserves cream better than say spraying barbasol on your face alone.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Top shelf brush thank you</li>
            <li>Save badgers and shave better.</li>
            <li>so I hope it stays that way... :-)  </li>
            <li>Be sure to let it sit in warm/hot water for a couple minutes to let it absorb water into the bristles.</li>
            <li>#34;utilitarian&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this rating after a year or so, when I know more about durability.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to choose Escali.</li>
            <li>The appearance is elegant.</li>
            <li>Several hairs fall out every time I use it, even after 10+ shaves (although the frequency at which this occurs is declining over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: inexpensive and gets the job done, but I am not overly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>It looks so sexy.</li>
            <li>This was way more cost effective and works great as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>brush any time soon since this brush more than meets my needs and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush was shipped fast and I am totally happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>3 stars might be one too many, but I was feeling generous.</li>
            <li>Am VERY happy to report, such was not the case.  </li>
            <li>but I would spend more money on a better brush.</li>
            <li>if not then one more soap up should do it.</li>
            <li>and I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>better than than the squirrel brush I used to have</li>
            <li>But this brush does as advertised and is quite handsome.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product!</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think you could beat this authentic badger</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks of use: It is already my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted a badger brush instead of a boar brush and a badger brush is definitely better.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a better product paying more.</li>
            <li>I was able to find a brush priced more competitive on Amazon than tweezerman and escali.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush for my husband, &amp; he is quite pleased with the Badger bristles.</li>
            <li>Boar bristle is a bit stiffer and makes thicker lather, but badger feels better and gives better control of the application of the lather.  </li>
            <li>I love my brush, it makes all the world&#x27;s difference when shaving.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for more than a month now without any issues.</li>
            <li>&quot; This product is equivalent or (in handle design and quality) arguably better, for about a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>Whether using store-bought aerosol lathers or shaving soaps/cremes, it does a nice job of ensuring better whisker coating, making my shaves more comfortable and closer.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a stand like the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand.  </li>
            <li>The brush seems to be more rigid that others I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s a matter of preference.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>more then my boars hair.</li>
            <li>Tried to get them out in the beginning but more continue to fall out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure at some point</li>
            <li>+ years more.</li>
            <li>My best recommendation, spend the extra money on a  silver tip badger brush.  </li>
            <li>For a softer texture, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be adding cans to the landfill and can produce and even better lather with a brush and shaving cake.</li>
            <li>The $4 boar brush from Walmart is better.</li>
            <li>It is getting better,</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if boar hair brush would be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for so many others, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s their favorite thing to play with.  </li>
            <li>Like most things in life you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t know how a person couldn&#x27;t notice it considering the smell of decaying flesh is fairly overwhelming with this brush.</li>
            <li>This one has a better feel, and the bristles have held together well.  </li>
            <li>It will need replaced soon, but I imagine after a year, most brushes would.</li>
            <li>I would recommend investing slightly more for a better experience.</li>
            <li>It is made very well and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>but it works better than the boar brush I started with.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving brush, it picks up and retains the soap really well.</li>
            <li>What more could you be looking for?</li>
            <li>YES, SHALL IT CARESS MY FACE FOR MANY AS SHAVE</li>
            <li>SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;TO FEEL THIS EUPHORIC MAGIC</li>
            <li>This is a great quality brush that allows you to lather the cream really well.  </li>
            <li>All in all this is a great brush to get started with, and is capable of handling everything that is out there, in terms of shaving creams, soaps, and cream-soaps.</li>
            <li>A reasonable brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>Glad I went with this.</li>
            <li>I love using this badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Great Brush....lathers up soap very well</li>
            <li>What more do you need.</li>
            <li>Nice brush for the price and everyone would enjoy it, unless you need a shaving brush made of silken unicorn hair or something.</li>
            <li>Does what it should :-)</li>
            <li>this situation appears to have gotten better with time...</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my hand and makes application smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>sometimes wish the bristles were softer, but knowing that I&#x27;d have to pay upwards of 2-3X more for that level of cuddly badgery softness</li>
            <li>Much better bang for your buck (Still around $10-15).</li>
            <li>I wish I had done better research before purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li>I was glad that the handle fits &amp;#34;perfectly&amp;#34; into the shave stand I bought.  </li>
            <li>ok brush but not the highest quality, sheds and doesnt hold</li>
            <li>There are many quality, affordable products out there.</li>
            <li>Seems like more bristles than I would expect fall out every time I use it and stick to my face, maybe that will stop after a while.  </li>
            <li>It is an OK product for the price.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for more than a year</li>
            <li>i love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the face and really makes the shaving process more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased</li>
            <li>I store my brush in an appropriate stand, making sure to rinse it thoroughly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is ok,  </li>
            <li>My shaving experience has never been better....</li>
            <li>The one thing that I love about the brush is that the longer I have the softer and more effecient it becomes.  </li>
            <li>For the price i am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier in the shower, the lather is great, and the shave soap is better for my skin that whatever is in feminine shaving products</li>
            <li>I bought a better brush for considerably more money.  </li>
            <li>Better than the el-cheapo I had used as a started brush.  </li>
            <li>The smell seems to be dissipating the more I use it.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I have purchased many as gifts</li>
            <li>But the hairs are nice and soft, and work great.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m enjoying the shaves</li>
            <li>Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Been using this brush for some months now and have greatly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I am truly pleased with the quality and price of this brush.  </li>
            <li>When storing this product, make sure that it is pointing bristles</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many of them that it just doesn&#x27;t matter, but they do get in the sink and on your face.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Again, for the price, for beginners, this is an okay brush.</li>
            <li>okay brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like this brush better.  </li>
            <li>The soap lathers up nice and it is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>This badger brush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It work ok but the hair falls out of the brush</li>
            <li>more specifically Africa by ToTo.</li>
            <li>However, the reason for the 1 star rating is because, after slightly more than 1 month of use, the knot broke and</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to spend a bit more money and get something better than this.</li>
            <li>I would try to get better quality .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for over 6 months now and don&#x27;t have many complaints.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>Great product, and reasonably priced to boot</li>
            <li>overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Has better luck making lather with a 5 dollar Walmart starter kit</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied maybe you can go for fancier ones.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>This one performs much better.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to retain an appropriate amount of moisture while shaving and dries well between uses.</li>
            <li>this is a great buy I really like this,highly recommend</li>
            <li>great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>it for so many hours before use&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I love them both.</li>
            <li>and I was glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I will now search for a more quality brush.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t tell the difference, don&#x27;t pay more for it.</li>
            <li>and I got to say that the Escali badger shaving brush is better than the one I have used.</li>
            <li>for sure.</li>
            <li>There was no way to tell why they would do that, but the fault lies with me for not using the better brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just gotten into shaving with a brush and better shaving cream</li>
            <li>This brush has become the most used.</li>
            <li>it got better and</li>
            <li>Then, make sure you do it, with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay brush, but I have used better brushes,</li>
            <li>The more you use it however, the softer it gets.  </li>
            <li>Very happy overall.</li>
            <li>So once I bought a better shave cream (kiss my face)</li>
            <li>Still pleased with the output and performance of the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would invest in something better.</li>
            <li>Provides a wonderful lather (once I actually figured out the correct water-to-soap ratio) every time.</li>
            <li>Haveing not used a brush in many years,.</li>
            <li>It came on time, it is OK, has an animal odor I hope it will go away as I keep using it</li>
            <li>Great brush, very durable</li>
            <li>Outstanding shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>For the price could not get a better brush.  </li>
            <li>It holds lather well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose many bristles.</li>
            <li>I imagine there are more luxurious ones out there, but this product was just as described.</li>
            <li>bristles, comfortable in the hand, the wood handle is a nice touch, bristles spread evenly, retains water (depending on how you view</li>
            <li>I know most are, but maybe it was the way mine was manufactured</li>
            <li>I really love how this brush loads up.</li>
            <li>They love them, and are now shaving in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The badger fur is much better than the horse hair brush</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used since my shaving history since 1972..</li>
            <li>I use Col Conk Almond Shaving soap with this, and I have enjoyed each shave.</li>
            <li>Take some time and enjoy!  </li>
            <li>A good investment in self, trust me you are worth it.</li>
            <li>I just bit the bullet and ordered a silver tip brush for more money.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping that works out a lot better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great item.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love Col. Konk&#x27;s World Famous Rum Shaving soap as well.</li>
            <li>I prefer more at this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>With a dab of Proraso cream, I can whip up the most luxurious lather in 20 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and nice to use.</li>
            <li>brush is ok.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with the quality, and am still learning how best to use the brush: up - n- down strokes, or in a circle pattern.  </li>
            <li>Quality is very good for the money and shipping was pretty quick.</li>

            <li>Besides that, it&#x27;s a good brush and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a great product that feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Quick service,  quality product equals very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It works the soap into a great lather quickly and makes applying the foam smooth and easy.</li>

            <li>Very nice product with fast shipping</li>
            <li>Handle seemed to be of nice quality, and after tugging at the hairs with some decent force, none came out, suggesting that the knot is also good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush works very well and makes a good lather very easily.</li>
            <li>: this is not my original idea, I give credit to someone else on here for this, but it works amazingly well.</li>

            <li>Creates a rich lather, cleans up nicely.  </li>

            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>It takes about a week to break in, but after that it puts shaving cream on your face very smoothly and is very easy to clean, 5 -10 seconds under faucet</li>

            <li>This brush has a nice wooden handle, holds plenty if water, and produces a beautiful lather.</li>
            <li>The good old fashioned way of lathering using a brush and a good shaving soap gives you a much more comfortable shave than the foam from the cans and is more affordable over time as well.  </li>
            <li>Apparently if you get a good one, you get a good one.</li>
            <li>Far from the best, but not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>I liked this brush a lot when I first started using it, but the boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve tried handily trump this brush.</li>
            <li>is to get some hair conditioner (any kind will do) and to use this on their brush after they clean off the soap.</li>
            <li>I clean the brush after each use by rinsing and letting it sit in warm water.  </li>
            <li>and I get a nice clean and even lather.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, soft brush from a nice, friendly, helpful company.</li>

            <li>The reviews and online tutorials all said to get a pure badger hair brush, so I looked for the best most reasonably priced one</li>
            <li>The biggest plus is that it is super soft, and gave me a great lather!</li>
            <li>It applies easily and makes for a very smooth shave.</li>

            <li>This is my first experience using a brush to shave and it has been a good one.  </li>
            <li>If you care that your brush looks as good as it acts and have the dough to pay for it, then you may want to go with a higher end brush.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, but I believe it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>First couple of uses will leave some stray brush hair, but over all a really good brush.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles come off during the first 3-4 shaves, but then its all good.</li>
            <li>Good for a first time shave kit.  </li>

            <li>Loved the first one and couldn&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>

            <li>Good price and fast shipping too!</li>

            <li>This is my first shaving brush and it is good.</li>

            <li>Hairs are not packed tightly as a higher end brush, but good value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush for the price, builds a very good lather with a little work.  </li>

            <li>Definitely makes shaving a more pleasant experience!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s more work to whip up some shaving cream with this brush than to push the button on the top of a can, I find the process somehow more satisfying and the resulting cream more effective than modern alternatives.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Out of this world rich lather!  </li>

            <li>And as a bonus, it feels pretty cool when your applying the shaving cream too!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely a win, and didn&#x27;t cost any more than my old boar-ing brush.  </li>
            <li>They love the idea of getting them something nice and useful.</li>
            <li>Great value for an authentic natural shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is a super nice brush.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to easily pull the bristles out of the handle.</li>
            <li>It arrived nicely packaged and quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived QUICKLY and packaged nicely.</li>

            <li>Nice brush for starters, quick shipping</li>
            <li>I dry it as best</li>
            <li>It does fell nice on the face and drys quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing I did was order some popular stuff from amazon and quickly found out that the brush had a lot to do with the application.  </li>
            <li>Holds plenty of soap, and a quick dip in warm water will bring a frothy lather.</li>
            <li>Now, I really do not know what makes one badger brush better from another, but I now know that this brush does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was part of a starter kit that I bought three years ago when I made the awesome switch to shaving with a straight edge instead of the $25 modern razors.</li>
            <li>This Shaving Brush Lathers Proraso Nicely, overall a good product and fair price.</li>
            <li>He said it is soft, feels good to use, and that the lather goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, good handle and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>This brush looks good and the build quality seems good, but I did have some personal issues with it.</li>
            <li>It spreads the soap nicely and even and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does tend to shed more than I hoped maybe 4 hairs a shave so far, but for the price it is a great brush.</li>
            <li>Use with shaving soap from a bowl, had no issues so far, good feel on skin and nicely priced</li>
            <li>Whips up lather nice and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I like it, helps me make a good lather, but I feel that it is kind of soft</li>
            <li>For the price, this seems like a great product, and is definitely a good introduction for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>He reports that he is very satisfied with the full coverage of the brush and the smooth shave resulting from its use.  </li>
            <li>one to be more comfortable to use and of greater quality.  </li>
            <li>This Brush is amazing, its soft feels good on your face.</li>
            <li>Love the brush, so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having the best products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it- with a good soap, it creates a fantastic lather, with no bristles falling out.</li>
            <li>The Escali Badger brush is of a great quality and far better than the horsehair brushes I used in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Great price on a badger brush with a nice wooden handle.</li>
            <li>Excellent product - well crafted with real wood and real bristles.</li>
            <li>this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid wood handle looks great and fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li>It is great for any man who wants a soothing, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This brush is slightly smaller and is lighter than my primary brush but is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for intro to wet shaving brush (and maybe more?)</li>
            <li>But again, overall, good brush and certainly good value.</li>
            <li>As far as an beginer brush with quality and value couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>By far the most luxurious shaving brush I have ever had... just a joy to use each morning.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a better, more comfortable shave lathering up with a brush than you do with that canned s</li>
            <li>It does its job perfectly and it is very easy to clean and dry out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, performs well, and is at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great brush, very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush that feels very soft when applying the shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, but the form a great lather.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft feels great on my face and</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and works up a great lather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>GREAT brush and very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and lathers great.</li>
            <li>and he LOVED it even more than his old one!! :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great size not small at all</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase so far!</li>
            <li>seems to be working great so far!</li>
            <li>Great Brush, lost a few hairs the first couple uses, but definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li>Altogether I think this is an excellent value for the price, you could easily spend three times as much or more for a shaving brush from some other companies that would not be significantly better than the Escali.  </li>
            <li>The wood is very beautiful and there were ~30 loose hairs</li>
            <li>Even the best paint brush ($30 to 50.00) will loose a bristle now and then.</li>
            <li>Great product, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly and I&#x27;ve had a great experience using it.</li>
            <li>so I was really happy to find one of such good quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>More than a month in, and fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with a breaking in period, this brush might be fine for you.</li>
            <li>Im sure it will do a fine job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was refreshing to see that there are still fine quality old-style shaving products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this might work fine for you if you use a brush that way, but if you like to be more aggressive when applying your shaving cream this might not be the brush for you.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, i will get a more sturdy made one, but this will do just fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clean!  </li>
            <li>Hubby seems to like it just fine :).  </li>
            <li>, it holds water very well and works great to build up a rich, luxurious lather (I use Geo.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this as my travel brush and it has a more notable smell of badger than my Parkers.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for creating and applying a rich later and exfoliating your skin while doing so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it several times now, and Im very happy with the rich lather it helps work up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it and who knows, maybe someday I&#x27;ll consider moving up to a super or silvertip quality level!</li>
            <li>But it is cheap and feels nice so definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>You can spend a lot more on other brands but this one does the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Escali Badger shaving brush after reading the benefits of this brush indicating that this is a great brush, creating a rich lather, and very confortable.  </li>
            <li>, it allowed me to experiment with building lathers and gave me a good point of reference as to what a pure badger brush is like.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great brush that is priced right you can find it right here.</li>
            <li>But this one certainly does the job fairly good.</li>
            <li>but the brush certainly has proved to be a good buy.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly comes at a good price.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush 5 months ago (January 2013), and have been delighted with it&#x27;s quality and function.  </li>
            <li>nice when something I buy is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Break it in and give it what you&#x27;ve got, then enjoy a great classic shave.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft, and holds the shaving cream very nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend this shaving brush, even if you own a boar bristle brush, badger bristle brushes beat boar bristle brushes bar none!</li>
            <li>Very full and stands up to the whiskers.</li>
            <li>Generally very cool  </li>
            <li>The build quality is very good, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this brush compares to others, since this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought, but seems to be very good and would buy this one again.  </li>
            <li>Overall the feel and work ability is very good.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush seems to be of very good quality, especially for the price (about $13).  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a very good brush for the money.</li>
            <li>Creates a very good lather, but I think I personally prefer a stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li>Very good basic shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that you can find a better pure badger brush at this price point, very satisfied here.</li>
            <li>It lathers up soap in a very short time (about 30 seconds), holds moisture within the hairs, feels great when applying the lather and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>Great quality, easy to hold, and very soft.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, very happy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>perfect brush for the new or experienced wet shaver!</li>
            <li>great value for the money.the bristles shed very little and the water retention was great.</li>
            <li>I am not the most qualified to make accurate comments.  </li>
            <li>- my best guess is the wood cannot stand getting wet which of course is the kiss of death since it is supposed to be used with soap and water.    </li>
            <li>Excellent, and just what I expected from a Badger Brush</li>
            <li>One of the best sources for learning about wet shaving is the &amp;#34;wicked_edge&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>sure that there are better brushes on the market, but if your just starting out, and want something inexpensive, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it&#x27;s met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s 100 years old, then it was a great  bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for someone who is curious about making the jump to shaving with a brush.</li>
            <li>His skin is sooo smooth after shaving that I can&#x27;t stop touching it</li>
            <li>A lot better than the flimsy cheap box store ones.</li>
            <li>Great results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>A great brush for shaving beginners and old shaving pros.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I always get a more comfortable shave using it.</li>
            <li>Feels great and makes a ton of lather with Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li>excellent product and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Man, that badger fur sure feels silky smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>Makes for a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It does the job and is noticeably better than the cheap boar bristle one I started with from CVS.</li>
            <li>So far this does a great job.</li>
            <li>I would suggest finding a nicer model so you can enjoy the shaving experience better.</li>
            <li>This is one the the most comfortable brushes I have used.</li>
            <li>Great brush for anyone who is price sensitive.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my foray into wet shaving</li>
            <li>So far it seems like a great brush.</li>
            <li>Use it nearly every day and it is still on great condition</li>
            <li>Great price and seems to do the trick so far.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps others are more fortunate and it takes them longer than a month for the brush to fall apart, but I have no doubt that eventually it will happen.</li>
            <li>Great shaving brush, soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t anticipating a great brush, just because of the price, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It makes a great lather and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like those are more important.</li>
            <li>Cannot see why spend more when you try this smooth brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is extremely soft, durable, looks great.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and generate a great lather.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft and does a great job applying the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>like the brush and how it feels, soft and great with my shaving cream and spreading the lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also bought the Escali brush and razor stand, which this and the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor fit perfectly in.</li>
            <li>So far its worked great.</li>
            <li>Perfect buy for the money for anyone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>This brush provides me with an excellent wet shave</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and feels really great on my face.  </li>
            <li>sometimes i wonder if i would have a more comfortable shaving experience if i use a wall paint brush???</li>
            <li>Soft on the skin and helps work up a great lather.</li>
            <li>always used cheap junk because I didn&#x27;t know better.</li>
            <li>It sheds even more when you rinse it and give it a light shake to get the water out.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is working great</li>
            <li>and I find it much more comfortable than a cartridge shave.</li>
            <li>Brush creates a fantastic lather, much better than doing it with your hands.</li>
            <li>First time using a brush and am very pleased with the way it sets up my beard for the razor.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the aesthetics much more of shaving this way.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the brush and the price is a real bargin!  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a better brush to replace this cheap thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even better, they do not shed as they would in cheaply constructed brushes.  </li>
            <li>Working great so far.  </li>
            <li>Although not as soft as the higher priced brushes this one is perfectly acceptable.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>As this was my first purchase of the kind, i must say I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>i love it except that it doesnt fit the holder that i have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping there are much better brushes available.</li>
            <li>My advice is to skip this one unless you&#x27;re just getting into this style of shaving and aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll stick with it because it is cheap, I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
            <li>Soft, holds and makes a great lather, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, but so far am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great so far.  </li>
            <li>Great starter brush as far as I&#x27;m concerned, maybe one day I&#x27;ll upgrade to a silvertip but at the moment I see no need to spend $100</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap  brush many years ago</li>
            <li>After having used another shaving brush , this one is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>lather directly on my face and it produces a great lather in under a minute</li>
            <li>This is my first badger hair shaving brush and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>So far, this is proving to be a great brush.</li>
            <li>Soft brush that works up a lather great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it so far; lathers up nicely using Proraso.  </li>
            <li>Hubby says its better than boars hair and puts cream on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have just started to shave as my father and his father did, and wow what a great shave I am getting.</li>
            <li>This has been one of the most comfortable brushes I have ever known.</li>
            <li>This brush is excellent for anyone looking to get into wet shaving and not wanting to spend a lot of money in case</li>
            <li>Again, maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I thought it felt great on my face.  </li>
            <li>On the flip side, it is a really secure hold :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a brush for shaving, and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great product so far.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and it is a great improvement over my old brush.</li>
            <li>Builds up a great lather with the two soaps i have used so far.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful shed alittle in the begining but thwt is to be expected.</li>
            <li>Since I paid about 5 bucks for it, I figured I was safe going cheap again.</li>
            <li>This brush was shipped fast and in good protective packaging.</li>
            <li>There are many better options available if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>it is reasonably priced with a good feel.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s made of bits of real badger, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The brush has a nice feel and is economically priced in the badger line.  </li>
            <li>It creates a good lather and seems very well-made--I haven&#x27;t had problems with bristles falling out or</li>
            <li>It does feel nice to brush on the fresh lather rather than squirting some out of a can and then coating my face.  </li>
            <li>Good brush does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value which for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It loads and holds lather very well, it feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>Good company to do business with and shipping was fast as always.</li>

            <li>I can say that this brush does a good job of getting my skin and whiskers ready for a shave.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>quality Badger brush works up a good lather and it was reasonable and shipped</li>
            <li>I kept reading one review after another about how superior badger hair brushes are, so I picked this reasonably priced one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has done a good job for me</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than others that I have seen and just as good.</li>
            <li>brush is capable of creating good lather from the soap.  </li>
            <li>For 10 bucks and real badger with a good feel it does the trick.</li>
            <li>But, to be honest this is worth it.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>but this one does just as good and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but it will be worth spending the money and getting a nice one.</li>
            <li>good, real product.</li>
            <li>Vary nice and worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and pliable with very good bristle retention.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that almost 2 1/2 years later, this one is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>Stirs and holds lather well and just the right stiffness to spread it around on your face!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to clean after!wards !</li>
            <li>I am really getting in to buying all these new wonderful soaps and creams</li>
            <li>You can spend more or less on a shaving brush; this one is an excellent find.  </li>
            <li>This brush, the Escali, is the best of them and perhaps the only one worthy of the name.  </li>
            <li>This brush is gentle on my very sensitive face and does an excellent job lathering up the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>We took it out of the packaging and the bristles are very soft and seem like they will work very well to create a wonderful lather for the purpose of shaving.</li>
            <li>I can get a nice lather going right in a mug and massage my face before taking a blade to it.</li>
            <li>The badger hair soaks up just the right amount of warm water to transform any of my shaving soaps into a decadent mound of shaving smoothness.  </li>
            <li>This brush is far from perfect (I&#x27;m still losing hairs after more than a month of use), but overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I confess that this was a late-night impulse purchase, added because Amazon suggested it would be a good companion to some double-edged blades I purchased (100 box of Blue Personnas -- love them, too!).</li>
            <li>I know this is old school, but I truly enjoy using this brush when I shave!!!</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush is an exceptional shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This shaving combination is more economical and a much better shaving experience than the many shaving creams available.</li>
            <li>The brush is a good one, probably best in its price range, but there are better and more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li>Very nice and soft.</li>
            <li>very smooth to the touch and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far very nice.</li>
            <li>It maintains it shape very nicely time after time and so far (over a month)</li>
            <li>Very nice component of my old fashioned shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>Once prepped and ready to use, the brush expands into a wonderful, full head that lathers beautifully in just a few swipes.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush and a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all true!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great!</li>
            <li>The first use was a contest as to whether or not I&#x27;ve have more lather on my face than shedding brush bristles!</li>
            <li>I find that he is willing to shave more often now that he has a nicer shaving set!</li>
            <li>The brush is in perfect order and extremely well made.</li>
            <li>It is affordable, holds more moisture than boar bristle brush, and makes a rich lather.</li>
            <li>The brush is much more softer then the original one</li>
            <li>so I delayed submitting this review in order to be more familiar with the product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely invest in a good stand for both razor and brush and don&#x27;t skimp on the shaving cream/soap!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy another one (assuming my friend doesn&#x27;t offer me one of his custom brushes at a good discount!).</li>
            <li>In comparison, this one appears to have excellent construction - I&#x27;m not worried about it falling apart like the other, and I expect to use it for quite some time.</li>
            <li>works perfectly lathering up just as expected!</li>
            <li>He has loved the whole experience, in general, and this brush has worked great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with shaving brushes, other than with this one, however, it seems to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to purchase an inexpensive brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to stick to using it</li>
            <li>Construction very good better than expected</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this particular offering -- incredibly quality for a much lower price than I expected, and with great reviews</li>
            <li>It holds water nicely and quickly works up a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I could HARDLY tell the difference between a best and silvertip, but you might appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved his new shave brush!</li>
            <li>it feels comfortable and makes really great foaming action.</li>
            <li>Very quickly received as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>cheap boar is better than cheap badger:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>and it came very quickly...</li>
            <li>This process affords hot water, hot lather and a great shave.</li>
            <li>Compact &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle, lathers well.</li>
            <li>good brush for the price... have used it more than a dozen times and no complaints so far...</li>
            <li>You could easily take the brush we have here, stick the bristles in an ivory handle &#x27;made by virgin monastery stewards&#x27; or whatever and find someone who&#x27;d pay $599.99.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply the shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the face - and definitely help to lather the shaving cream 300% better than using just your hands.</li>
            <li>The handle fits your hand easily and the brush holds water and shave-cream/soap</li>
            <li>Soap washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it, using a badger brush and a good razor has allowed my husband to shave more frequently and not break out.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shedding has stopped and the brush aids a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>we received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li>easy to use &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have liked it, as the bristles are nice and soft, but the handle came off after 1 use.</li>
            <li>When you lather up your non dominant hand you can easily apply the cream to your face without wasting any cream in the mug/glass.</li>
            <li>The price point on this brush easily makes it a 5 star buy for what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and superb service, I am enjoying my morning shavings now that I am back to the old double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipment and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Since the handle is wood, it is extremely easy to drill a hole and put in an &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; screw to hang up the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to build up a lather with as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for applying lather to your face.</li>
            <li>Running it under water and squeezing the brush hairs easily clears the remaining soap from the brush.</li>
            <li>Honey badgers don&#x27;t care about your face and if you cut yourself shaving, but this badger brush does, and helps lather up a nice shaving cream for your face, not too prickly and kind of soft....</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily.  </li>

            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>When I bought this, I was using Col.Conk Bay Rum soap, which has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>Great, soft brush, fantastic price.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, cleans up easy, and maintains it shape.  </li>
            <li>But that will be easy to fix.  </li>
            <li>I have found shaving to be very quick and painless.</li>
            <li>I shaved with a brush/mug many years ago and now remember why I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>It also fits the stand easily.</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the badger brush itself is excellent soft, spreads evenly and also lathers very well</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are prickly and fall out fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>you could repeat this lathering 4 times easy without adding anymore proroso .</li>
            <li>Easily recommend.</li>
            <li>I have truly enjoyed a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly after ordering it.</li>
            <li>falls apart so easily</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>

            <li>It evenly and easy cover your face with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great price and even better product (super soft)..</li>
            <li>Both started out with that badgery smell, but it was easily taken care of.</li>
            <li>It was very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>and I can just as easily shave with water.</li>
            <li>This brush is well assembled, and easily compares to the $25 brush I started with.  </li>
            <li>Well-made and easy to hold.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to lather and apply and</li>
            <li>cleanup is easy.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews however, suggested that the bristles fell out easily, that the handle broke off, or that the badger brush smelled</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting, great first brush.</li>
            <li>I was not too happy with my shaving experience with a synthetic brush and began scouring the net in search for something better.</li>
            <li>Application of shave creme is easy and thorough.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft bristles, creates a great lather.  </li>
            <li>It rinses easily and it does not shed</li>
            <li>Most are just too soft to get up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>I chose the Escali because it had good reviews, was well priced,and I liked the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good brush so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>my Razor came with a synthetic brush, but this is far better, it gives me a good even lather all around.</li>
            <li>Spend money and get a decent one instead of buying this and then buying a good one...waste.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a durable shaving brush.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend the escali to anyone thinking about getting into DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Bought over 6 months ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Pair it with a good quality shave cream (I&#x27;m using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood, love it).</li>
            <li>Mine is still going strong after 4 months or so, but is losing hairs at an increasing rate per day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Overall a nice looking and performing brush, and good quality for the money.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong).</li>
            <li>This badger brush is decent, it is good quality.</li>
            <li>rest are holding on quite strong.</li>
            <li>Its not on year 2 and still going strong.</li>
            <li>The main body of the brush is doing good.  </li>
            <li>Update 1/30/16: Still going strong.     </li>
            <li>Had for two years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nice, dense loft, good foam generation, solid construction.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>a good shaving lather just really isn&#x27;t that important to me.  </li>
            <li>Strong strong purchase reccomendation.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt a brush this good, with a decent shaving cream or soap</li>
            <li>Classy looking and works better than anticipated using a good quality soap.</li>
            <li>brush also has a strong odor of badger that overpowers my shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Have not used long term yet, but product feels very good quality and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great brush for the money--  super high quality.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much and haven&#x27;t used shaving cream since.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this if looking for a good inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li>Will give it a fair trial before retiring this one, but I don&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li>A good badger hair brush (even pure badger which is the lowest grade badger hair brush)  should soften significantly after 10-20 shaves.  </li>
            <li>If you look online, you&#x27;ll see that there are different badger brush qualities where many consider the order (lowest to highest) being: pure -&gt; best -&gt;</li>
            <li>I was pleased right away at the softness of the brush and enjoyed the fact that the bristles retain their shape in application.  </li>
            <li>After years of paying more and more money for more and more blades in my razor and more and more formulations of canned shaving cream, I decided to get back to basics.  </li>
            <li>It still is not the softest brush but creates a good consistent lather relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Still a very good entry level product to see if you really want to start investing into straight razor or safety razor shaving without beginning with a huge investment.</li>
            <li>They seems to fall out too easily, but the performance is fine.</li>
            <li>Got to my place of residence within a reasonable time and was very pleased with the package it came in.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nice first upgrade from a boar brush.</li>
            <li>The wood handle is nice and the hair is definitely of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice brush.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to bleed off some kind of dye from the bristles during the first couple of uses;</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>My first real shaving brush, but its pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>My first brush and I must say it is really a nice instrument to have.  </li>
            <li>Also, can&#x27;t beat having a nice badger massage first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush that I have purchased since leaving my cartridge razor, and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used a brush until now, and now I use this brush to whip up my own hot lather.</li>
            <li>Soft, no poor odor, good handle, and it even looks good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, and feels really nice on the skin!</li>
            <li>At first I really liked the brush.</li>
            <li>Honestly for the price you could just plan on replacing it every 6 months, but for now I&#x27;ll upgrade to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>Works like an average badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice and does the job i need it to.  </li>
            <li>For those complaining about quality and smell I would have to ask what exactly do you expect for this kind of money.</li>
            <li>well so the lather stays nice and hot.  </li>
            <li>I do not soak it in HOT water, but instead warm water.  </li>
            <li>Upon first impression the brush looked nice, and well packaged.</li>
            <li>A pretty nice badger hair brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush of this kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price, though, and supposedly better than boar bristles.</li>
            <li>I recently made the switch to wet shaving and a good brush is a very important part of your equipment , Badger brushes are just perfect to create the lather and massage your face</li>
            <li>I use a 2 dollar medium sized Ramiken from Target as a shave bowl and it stands up on the side perfectly for drying with the bristles down.</li>
            <li>it would be best for the brush to be hung, bristles down.</li>
            <li>This brush is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super absorbent, very soft, and makes a great lather.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of stiff bristles to whip up a nice lather, and they are in there for good!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving brush that I have used so far, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>for the brush itself, the bristles are high quality and soft, and do a wonderful job applying lather to the face.  </li>
            <li>The Escali shave brush holds a great deal of shave soap and enables you to get a good lather, with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a badger brush but it works good.</li>
            <li>Good brush for new users.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t looking for a 50$ brush for 10$. Was looking for a good introductory brush for someone new to brush shaving.</li>
            <li>Looks as good as new.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush, just the right size to whip up a decent lather using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>works well, although I am new to using shaving soap and a brush was able to develop a nice foam and applied easily.</li>
            <li>The item was accurately described and arrived very quickly after ordering.  </li>
            <li>A fine brush.</li>
            <li>otherwise the shaving soap brush would have been fine -</li>
            <li>my husband says it works fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used one of these before I got this one but to me it seems just fine and dandy.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned that creates the perfect amount of lather and brings enough moisture to my face.</li>
            <li>This brush does a perfect job for half the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works up a fine lather.</li>
            <li>It works fine now and gives an even application of the soap.</li>
            <li>Works just fine and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by the fine folks that sell this fine product and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>and it still sheds a hair or two on occasion, but it works up a fine lather and feels fine on the face.</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>I hacked the softening process by soaking the brush MANY, MANY times in hot water with hair conditioner in it.</li>
            <li>does it just fine for my liking.</li>
            <li>Smooth easy shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as it just works fine unless you want to spend the money for something else.</li>
            <li>and i must say it works fine for what its made for.  </li>
            <li>flimsy product- better off spending more money on higher quality-</li>
            <li>The finish on the handle is holding up fine with no peeling or anything.</li>
            <li>AS fine a shaving brush as I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li>Lathers up just fine on your face.</li>
            <li>Now it works fine for me.</li>

            <li>This brush works fine.  </li>
            <li>I like the design just fine.</li>
            <li>Now it looks fine again and works well.</li>
            <li>My husband likes the brush just fine.</li>
            <li>It hold water pretty well and gives a great lather with my stainless bowl.</li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine, holds a lot of water that needs to be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for first brush and arrived fast</li>
            <li>Of course looking at a photo of the Escali brush on the Escali stand it all looks fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve lost more hair from the brush than I&#x27;ve shaved from my face.</li>
            <li>Fine quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but it sheds every time I use it.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works just fine.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how the stiffness of this brush compares, but it feels just fine to me.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job.</li>
            <li>and it seem to be fine now.  </li>
            <li>I found the brush easy to use, and it was comfortable on my father&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a fine entry level shaving brush.</li>
            <li>this works just fine.</li>
            <li>This works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This brush is fine.  </li>
            <li>but if you want a badger brush, this one is fine.</li>
            <li>why buy a $ 50 brush where you can buy this awesome one for a lot less.</li>
            <li>So for me it appears to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>Being a novice when it comes to these, I think it does a fine job.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend more money, spend more money.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Holds lather fine.</li>
            <li>As a first time badger brush user I must say I enjoy the way the bristles kind of &#x27;poke&#x27; at the skin and make the hair come up a bit.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that this is my first shaving brush, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Yet review after review stated that the VHD soap was indeed fine.  </li>
            <li>This brush works and will get you lathered up just fine.</li>
            <li>and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>a fine razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>Now it seems gone and the brush works fine.</li>
            <li>but it has held up fine for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with this brush for a long time and after looking at all the brushes and brush sets</li>
            <li>Works fine for now.</li>
            <li>Cheap, works perfectly, easy to hydrate in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Generally this lets me work a bit more water into the hairs before shaving, which is usually a good</li>
            <li>Fine looking.  </li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and my SIL said it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Holds plenty of shaving cream and works just fine.</li>
            <li>I leave it in my shaving mug, as opposed to the recommended hanging stand, and it holds its shape fine.</li>
            <li>The brush works fine.</li>
            <li>Shaking the brush of excess water before hanging it, I find it smells fine and works well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still performing well in another six months, I&#x27;ll bump my rating to a 5 out of 5...but every indication is that it&#x27;ll be doing just fine then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m less than impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li>It may be fine for someone without allergies though.</li>
            <li>Anyway, they both seem just fine to me.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I could feel the hair of the brush as being fine needles against my face.  </li>
            <li>has been working fine for me, but I am an infrequent shaver (1-2wk)</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>Plus, the transaction to purchase the brush was easy and smooth, and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li>My husband says, &amp;#34;Works fine, doesn&#x27;t shed bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush is fine to get as a starter, but I lose about 10 hairs every shave.</li>
            <li>A quick google search of &amp;#34;Omega boar brush&amp;#34; will bring you many options.</li>
            <li>The brush head is densely packed quite soft and pleasant to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It sheds much more quickly than costlier brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes, but so far this product has been as advertised and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>The smell fades quickly though, and ends up smelling more like the shave soap you use.</li>
            <li>OK, so yes it does have a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>For someone who wants to get into a more classic style of shaving it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>am pleased with your company and how quickly I received the product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>Very Soft and good shape.</li>
            <li>Brush is very soft and works up a good lather in my dish.</li>
            <li>This was my son&#x27;s description of using this brush, with some good quality shaving soap,on his very sensitive face.</li>
            <li>Very soft, good lather.</li>
            <li>Really good quality and very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and creates good lather.</li>
            <li>skip the pricier brushes; this brush is perfect; lathers up easily, gets the lather where it needs to go, feels great in the hand, and dries quickly; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The price is right, I&#x27;d recommend it for beginners, although I&#x27;m sure you could get some good mileage as your main brush as well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with how much water these bristles can hold and how easy it is to lather up and clean.  </li>
            <li>other wise it is a solid product that has a good medium stiffness and works up an excellent lather without much effort involved.</li>
            <li>First of all, this badger brush looks pretty cool and when you use it to put Shaving Cream, it feels great.</li>
            <li>This badger shaving brush is a lucky find for me after searching for many moons for a genuine badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a great brush as it traps water easily.</li>
            <li>The wood handle is comfortable in my hand and the feel of the badger bristles is soft and pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not fall out easily and it still looks great with only minimum care.</li>
            <li>It is fairly soft, has a good shape, makes creating lather easy with cream or even soap (Williams).  </li>
            <li>Hoping the shedding and odor stop after a few more uses, but otherwise excellent -- very easy to build up a good, even lather with minimal soap.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Great brush, word of advice wash the brush first with hot water and mild dish soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple uses the bristles were nice and soft and dry wonderfully after each use.</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t buy a pure wolverine brush you can make do nicely with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and</li>
            <li>Very comfortable brush definitely gets a good lather on my head.</li>
            <li>Excellent little brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are a little prickly but lathers up great!  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>Excellent little badger brush....</li>
            <li>The hairs come off a little bit, but the brush does an excellent job of lathering and getting under whiskers.</li>
            <li>Wonderful little brush.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, 100% pure badger hair shaving brush at a very low price and top notch customer service.  </li>
            <li>I feel it works fine and will last a great amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beginners shaving brush for under $15.00; it works pretty good and would make a fine travel brush when a more high end brush would replace it at home.</li>
            <li>The Escali Badger brush was highly recommended, so I decided to purchase it and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Product works great but is a little stinky when used with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Nice little brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>This product is very high quality and has a nice price point.  </li>
            <li>The brush is just the right size and it feels very comfortable in your hand when applying shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge turn off to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>A huge improvement over any boar / synthetic hair brush out there.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay a huge amount for a brush</li>
            <li>It was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>so of course I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a huge amount of money for a brush.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the feel of the wooden handle over metal though and the badger hair works great to apply my shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Purchased about a year ago and so far so good, works great, feels great on your skin,  not to rough and has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>brush lathers great, is not too rough, and I anticipate it getting softer the more</li>
            <li>Its soft bristles are the perfect compliment to any shave butter and the end result is a soft supple shave.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in the quality of your shave</li>
            <li>I have since upgraded to another brush in the ~$30 range and it is a huge difference in feel.</li>
            <li>HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It will last, and make great lathers and feel FANTASTIC on your face.  </li>
            <li>he has used it many times and its still nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It will make a huge difference in your shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I can get a good comfortable lather with this and my proraso sensitive soap.</li>
            <li>Soft beaver hair bristle are perfect for my sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>The Escali is a huge step up in foam generating speed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic feel.</li>
            <li>Great brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Great product use it daily!  </li>
            <li>Badger brushes later on, but for now, I am extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>The brush holds lather quite well and spreads it smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>Great brush for daily use.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>free to comment with anyquestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really holding me breath wondering what you kind of badger brush you get at this price.  </li>
            <li>The report I got back was it was great.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.   </li>
            <li>It gives me a nice lather and since I&#x27;ve started using it my skin seems clearer and my shaves much closer.</li>
            <li>While the brush makes great foam, the stiffer bristles irritated my husbands skin and further contributed to razor rash.  </li>
            <li>For the price this brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>happy with this product and doubt I&#x27;ll need another brush for a while, if I do I&#x27;ll be back to look at what these guys have in stock</li>

            <li>I ordered this for my Uncle by marriage who was using a cheap boars hair brush.  </li>
            <li>This one seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Smaller than most but a nice firmness for brushing and produces a better lather than others</li>
            <li>This brush makes a real difference for applying warm water and shaving cream.</li>

            <li>It does the trick as a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>But after the initial period of suffering, it is a great brush.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap one that lost bristles and felt like a pot scrubber.....</li>

            <li>I enjoy the process of lathering my face and using the safety razor.</li>
            <li>But if you have the money and you know you&#x27;re going to use a brush for years to come, don&#x27;t be cheap and buy yourself something you can brag about, even if its to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Writing review heeding to call for review...sound genuine :</li>

            <li>Once I figure this out, it has been smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li>and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth even lather that makes shaving a breeze.  </li>

            <li>After using one of the cheap kit brushes, this is a fantastic upgrade.</li>
            <li>and I get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of its great reviews and low price.</li>
            <li>but after that is is a solid brush that works great.  </li>
            <li>you must make two, sometimes three &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; in one session to get a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Produces a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t soak up so much water that it washes the soap off as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li>Overall a great brush.</li>
            <li>Washed it and now it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>

            <li>Affordable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>how cheap I can get out for.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making this item available.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep in shape and clean -</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is as cheap as they come.</li>
            <li>Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be because it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li>and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Works up fantastic lather.  </li>
            <li>The order was filled in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shaving brush, if you make it well, its both comfortable and will last--not rocket science.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is attractive and does the job, but I&#x27;ve only owned this for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy that...........buy this brush.  </li>
            <li>Smooth application of the soap.</li>
            <li>The quality of this brush vs the ones sold in retail stores is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The delivery was real fast and it sure did help me out.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean easily under running water.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great brush for those just starting in safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap no-name brush, so decided to upgrade and enjoy the luxury.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of badger hair, the wood handle is comfortable, and it will allow you to lather like pro.</li>
            <li>but when you expect for cheap.</li>
            <li>Whether on my face or in my mug, this brush does a fantastic job of building a lather with either soap or cream (or in my case, a dab of Taylor&#x27;s cream with soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sheds some hair but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>You might think it is cheap but does the job.</li>
            <li>Quality construction and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I lost my Parker brush at a hotel so in a fit on rush and based on price point</li>
            <li>It is a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>After a year with it, I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s worth paying more to get a brush that stays together.</li>
            <li>It is too light, It looses brishels.</li>
            <li>my son!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy it again if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>Why not just display the brush and double edged razor in an attractive chrome stand.  </li>
            <li>Try this for a smooth shave:</li>
            <li>I have owned this brush for about 2 months now, and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean up and store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably one of the most economical brushes out there and it shows why.</li>
            <li>I guess that proves it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I used it to exceed 35 dollars merchandise limit for free shipping, It is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great brush overall</li>
            <li>so smooth</li>
            <li>The brush is cheap.  </li>
            <li>Yes, badger hair is what you want in a shaving brush, but the quality of the badger hair is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a throw away or starter brush on the cheap</li>
            <li>The shaving brush showed up in a short amount of time and it&#x27;s been really great.  </li>
            <li>For the value, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the brush a lot</li>
            <li>it being a cheaper brush, so quality would be cheap.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a fantastic job of evenly distributing shaving cream onto my face.</li>
            <li>When using it on my face, the hairs just lay over like a cheap child&#x27;s water color paint brush.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, he said it&#x27;s the best lather he&#x27;s ever had, and so far there is not a nest of hair clogging up the sink like with the boar hair brushes.</li>
            <li>It was great for 3 weeks and then since last week</li>
            <li>The price was great and we will definitely buy again from this shop.</li>
            <li>You need to feel important?  </li>
            <li>I got this brush because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>This brush compliments my merkur heavy duty razor and fits perfectly on the escali stand.</li>
            <li>Great Valentines present!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Nice product and serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I purchased another for my travel kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 6 months and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Brush gives smooth finish of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush is a well constructed and comfortable gadget to hold and to lather.  </li>
            <li>wood handle is discernibly cheap in quality and of finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>For the price it did a great job and seemed solid.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this brush because it was one of the cheapest real badger hair brushes that I could find.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>A great all around brush for a DE shave noob such as myself.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit light in the hands...</li>
            <li>This is overall a great brush.</li>
            <li>Really gives you a nice lather before you shave.</li>
            <li>Sprung for a moderately priced silver tip, no smell, lathers great.</li>
            <li>I have used a mug, brush, and, cheap soap for years on end .I</li>
            <li>I prefer my cheap boar hair brush to this.</li>
            <li>A quality product that lathers well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a cheap brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>but overall it has performed great.</li>
            <li>It did take several washings to eliminate the badger smell, but beyond that, works great.</li>
            <li>This is a quality brush and wooden handle that works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the only way to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>It fits in a standard brush/single blade razor holder and looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>The handle is quite comfortable while applying shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great brush for a beginner or veteran shaver.</li>
            <li>The cheap brushes don&#x27;t perform like this.</li>
            <li>A good boar brush will be better than a cheap badger brush and cost may be similar...</li>
            <li>Badger hair brushes are great for newbies to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of fresh Badger on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily with Taylor of Old&lt;br /&gt;Bond</li>
            <li>enjoy shaving quite a bit now.</li>
            <li>but I use it as my primary for now.</li>
            <li>This brush is so cheap, I dare not put it to my face.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic buy for the price (something like 12 bucks when I purchased it).</li>
            <li>It gets softer every use, and has stood up great to my daily use and irregular care.</li>
            <li>It still makes great lather one year later and hasn&#x27;t lost a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that thus us genuine badger fir.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap drug store shaving brushes before.  </li>
            <li>This one is $3 more, but worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was extraordinarily cheap</li>
            <li>Either it was a used brush or the brush is made from some cheap chemicals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap brush</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to cheap out -- and why not do so</li>
            <li>:  Do I enjoy using</li>
            <li>Moreover, the gloss finish over the wood looks fantastic, and hasn&#x27;t degraded over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great value especially for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>It is a steal, however, for how cheap it</li>
            <li>-- This brush is STILL great with almost daily use!  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaving brush at an unbeatable price.  </li>
            <li>It was not my idea of a smooth shave because I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace a cheap one that came in a shave soap kit.</li>
            <li>Great deal for the brush overall!</li>
            <li>The prickly, smooth feel against my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably a great brush for a beginner like me, but I am still losing bristles occasionally.</li>
            <li>This brush is their equal in quality, it is a great value.  </li>
            <li>: Now, after three months of daily use, this brush is still a great buy.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with it everyday for about a month now and it holds up great!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought another for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you - this is a great shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I like it because his face is smooth</li>
            <li>It looks like it was cheaply glued into the handle.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a replacement free of charge.  </li>
            <li>A badger hair brush with a solid feel at a great price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it fits the bill for being cheap and getting you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it will wear out and therefore am not saving any money by buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>Now if this is an issue with cheap brushes then go buy something</li>
            <li>Much more economical than canned shaving crème, just as good, and I like the old time ritual.</li>
            <li>and if you can get it cheap it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li>After the break in period the animal smell went away and I enjoy using it with every shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth face here.</li>
            <li>wanted a 100% badger hair brush and at $12.95 (prime, free shipping)</li>
            <li>I bought this cheap brush after leaving my fancy dancy one at my sisters house during vacation.  </li>
            <li>and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The Escali brush is inexpensive...and cheap.</li>
            <li>maybe it would fit your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wood on the handle seems a bit cheap, but I guess for the price</li>
            <li>Now after using this brush on a regular basis for months the brush is still working great</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the plastic ones, and a cheap wood</li>
            <li>You can look online for the detailed explanations of this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still fantastic even after all that use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bent a wire hanger into a brush and razor holder and my lady has mentioned how nice the whole setup looks in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap handle and</li>
            <li>I have have only used it a couple of times, it has produced great results.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>The handle is wood, but its Lacquered with something so that it is smooth to the touch and water</li>
            <li>Light weight, inexpensive and serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>A solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Those turned out to be fantastic, the brush, however, turned out to be a disaster.</li>
            <li>I also use the term badger hair lightly.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic, and functions as well as The Art of Shaving one.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare it to, but it&#x27;s been working great for me for the last three months.</li>
            <li>This brush is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy overall.  </li>
            <li>Shipping timely and problem free.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a terrific brush for the price, a great value.  </li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s not be fooled, this is a cheap brush for a cheap price, and it deserves a lower review than 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li>The quality and feel of the Ecali brush is excellent by comparison and it is losing few hairs.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great  brush for travel use or as a back up.</li>
            <li>Been using this brush for a couple of weeks, really like the lather it holds, and brushes up nicely under the whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My job requires me to travel 100%, and I have learned to pack lightly.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is easy too.</li>
            <li>Great job, I will be using this company in all my future needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lathers up my shaving soap effortlessly and transfers the soap to my face smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush, and I think it&#x27;s suitable for any beginner.</li>
            <li>amd pronounces it as being quite effective developing the foam he wants for shaving.</li>
            <li>had gotten a boar brush as a part of a cheap shaving package from Walmart (also available on Amazon, however) that included the brush, a bowl, and some shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is fantastic and works well to get plenty of creamy soap in cup , in hand, or on face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t fall our like the cheaply made brush that I purchased at Meijer.</li>
            <li>Uses it daily - great brush</li>
            <li>I do not understand how this brush got such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>I guess I should go badger hunting if I want it cheap.</li>
            <li>It took several uses for that smell to go away, but now he&#x27;s quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a great shaving brush that gets the job done, at low cost, this is your badger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times with great results.</li>
            <li>Great brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It distributes the cream evenly and its easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Holds lather longer and easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used both, I can honestly say this one not only works up a better lather, it also has softer more flexible bristles.</li>
            <li>Found a holder on Amazon and this brush fit the holder</li>
            <li>I concluded that I had tried to get by too cheap.  </li>
            <li>Buy cheap, get cheap.</li>
            <li>Great shaving accessory for those of us using a traditional blade razor.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap prickly bristle brush, does not soften up with use, suffering some bristle loss, I have pastry brushes that are softer.</li>
            <li>Two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>its great....and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Produces a much thicker lather than using your hands and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>After using this brush for 2 months, it works really great with various brand of shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li>I replied back saying I&#x27;m happy with the brush</li>
            <li>I will update post with any relevant information as i get it.</li>
            <li>Paints the cream on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it&#x27;s cheap and will keep my face lathered until all the hair falls out.</li>
            <li>overall great brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>Great brush for a low price</li>
            <li>and I much enjoy it</li>
            <li>I make him homemade shaving soap because well I am cheap and I have prefected a recipe he likes.</li>
            <li>I also picked up a cheap stand ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Washed the brush lightly and the smell no longer bothers me.</li>
            <li>OK, in the end I find that synthetic shaving brushes are actually softer and more effective.</li>
            <li>A cheap badger brush.</li>
            <li>My great grandfather used one daily, and I always wondered what it was like.  </li>
            <li>The ad stated that it creates great lather, this is totally incorrect</li>
            <li>Its a great brush if you are just starting into DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Fits the Escali Deluxe Chrome Stand very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The brush I use is this cheap thing I bought at a pharmacy somewhere during my travels.</li>
            <li>Badgers are primarily solitary animals</li>
            <li>I do not feel comfortable with it nor looking forward to shawing with it ever again.</li>
            <li>Just fantastic.</li>
            <li>The brush works great however the fur was not properly cleaned.</li>
            <li>The important thing to remember is that you have to care for this product correctly.  </li>
            <li>Great brush especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush revolutionizes shaving for me, and feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior to the cheap ones I have.  </li>
            <li>If you like an old fashioned shave this is superior tool.</li>
            <li>It produces a better lather, and it&#x27;s more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>After such a good experience with this brush at around $12-$13, I can&#x27;t imagine paying $50 or more for a &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, not excellent, but it&#x27;s the best brush you can buy at this price point.  </li>
            <li>I believe almost all boar brushes have good scrubbing action to lift your whiskers and exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li>Great shaving brush Very well priced and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Has been a good experience so far.  </li>
            <li>hair stays very together when using a proper lather which is great!  </li>
            <li>IT was cheap, but not cheaply made, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good brush for beginners, but will leave you wanting more if you&#x27;re hoping for actual quality.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and it picks up lather well, hasn&#x27;t started to completely fall apart, and seems to have fairly good fit and finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are just experimenting with shaving with a straight razor and don&#x27;t know if it is for you, this is the perfect brush because of the low price point.  </li>
            <li>Soft and good brush though 1-2 hairs fall out during each shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Good and soft lil problem with the hairs falling out</li>
            <li>And if there are better out there this is still a great brush to get started learning how to wet shave.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The bristles feel incredibly soft and offer a good amount of lather</li>
            <li>We had looked at brushes priced above $120.00 and he feels this one is just as good or better quality than those.</li>
            <li>I think I need to buy the good old shaving soap.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The bristles of this brush are soft and feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good . . .</li>
            <li>There was no need to contact customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to upgrade my old shaving brush &amp; this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Soft on the face, lathers good.  </li>
            <li>so I was looking for items that were good but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, and so far this one does the job well.</li>
            <li>For the price, this has been a good way to ease into old school brush shaving.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, but the main problem with this brush is it&#x27;s too floppy to be of much good.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised at how nice this brush performs and lasts for what you paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and good lather.  </li>
            <li>brush has a good handle, and the bristles are firm in a good way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good with this brush, just took off a star for the hair loss</li>
            <li>This is a nice light shaving brush which I find holds water and shaving creme really well.</li>
            <li>and so far it performs just as good as a 50$ one I had before it.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>This brush is far superior to any that I have used before.  </li>
            <li>Good brush, fairly soft, but it sheds a lot.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for a couple of weeks and this brush seems to be really good so far.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>The brush is a good quality, haven&#x27;t lost many hairs after the initial couple shaves.  </li>
            <li>So far so good on this brush.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s in the form of Ron Swanson, Mr. Rogers, Ronald Reagan, or Teddy Roosevelt, people want to feel self-reliant and they want to smell like the good old days when you had to walk to school uphill both ways.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is excellent, and it holds water and later very well.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and works up a really good lather.  </li>
            <li>The brush is a good quality, works well, and has lasted so far.</li>
            <li>bristles feel good, and are soft</li>
            <li>Also, this brush has a classy look and when applying the lather, it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So, so far, I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li>I liked my old brush better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s soft, and works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Awesome brush, just what I needed and just as good as the expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned that one of the cheapest brushes on Amazon might not be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This is a good brush to trial shaving the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed with how well (and long)</li>
            <li>I could whip up a good lather, it is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and produce a good lather.</li>
            <li>It had good recommendations and looked like a clear winner in regards to price.  </li>
            <li>So far, brush seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>when matched with good shaving cream from bath and body works by co bigelow, I would have thought I was at an old world barber shop and</li>
            <li>It did not create good foam out of the leather shaving cream (I use Old Spice).</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>water/soap/cream well and whips up a good lather both in the cup and directly on my face.</li>
            <li>Good brush, quality is good but a few bristles do come out from time to time.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and feels like good quality.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about a month now so far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is plenty soft and the quality seems good as well.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good intro into the world of classy shaving without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get a good quality shaving soap to go with the brush, it makes a big difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>I also like the wooden handle better than the plastic handle and this one feels good in the hand when using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft and creates a good lather.</li>
            <li>Feels like the good old times.</li>
            <li>I own three brushes so far, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Superior to my old one which was inherited.</li>
            <li>Now on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being The Thing and 1 being Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s lovely parts, I am a good solid 6.</li>
            <li>Good brush, natural badger hair.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Soft, well put together, and generates a fair lather.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel like it does a good job, feels good against my skin, and leaves my face ready for a close shave.</li>
            <li>Not bad for being the first shaving brush I own.</li>
            <li>the bristles are stiff but soften nicely in water and work great to lift every whisker.  </li>
            <li>Like many brushes, it does have a strong odor when you first use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick and effective -Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would have easily been willing to pay more per brush for a stand to be included with it.  </li>
            <li>Mu husband is very pleased, brush is soft, lathers well and easy to use</li>
            <li>The bristles hold moisture well creating a rich lather that has made my whole shaving experience such a joy!</li>
            <li>The one I selected was perfect and actually came much sooner that originally thought.  </li>
            <li>The wooden handle seems a bit light, but over all very nice.</li>
            <li>Right away there were many bristles coming out every time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I am very pleased with how much lather this is able to create from so little cream.</li>
            <li>hair comes off it easily so it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
            <li>A nice rich lather that really lasts.</li>
            <li>Compared to many other badger brushes out there, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>This would be a good starter brush, but not a very stiff brush.</li>
            <li>My first one has lasted OVER A YEAR and is still used in my travel kit!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Did not know what to expect, but it really works well!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>very useful brush</li>
            <li>About 2 months ago I decided I wanted to try using shave soap and a safety razor instead of my collection of Gillette products that just weren&#x27;t very fun to use.</li>
            <li>Out of the packet you&#x27;ll get a very distinct smell but it disappears after you use it for about a week.</li>
            <li>This is a great starter brush, or if you find yourself fully satisfied after learning how to double edge shave, it&#x27;s a good long term brush too.</li>
            <li>Very nice shaving brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>The consensus indicates badger hair is best mainly because of its absorption quality, it retains water which is essential to the lubrication process.  </li>
            <li>I like the brush, good clean and soft when applying the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break the bank and you get a decent quality suit; the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half-canvassed suit referenced above is this brush.</li>
            <li>Lather quickly and smoothly with easy spreading about the face and chin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not losing to many hairs after first week of use and it lathers just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is my first pure badger shaving brush, and I think it is a quality piece at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>After leaving the original review below, I was contacted by an associate from Escali letting me know they&#x27;d like to send me a replacement free of cost.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth and rich lather that gets under my bristles.</li>
            <li>Originally I started TOO cheap.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now since my original cheap brush came apart.  </li>
            <li>use a combo of soap, glycerin-soap and cream and learned to take about 2 + minutes to whip the shaving lather into a rich smooth application before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best badger brush is slightly softer and more absorbent, but it was also 4X the price of the Escali Pure Badger.</li>
            <li>Excellent low cost yet high quality badger hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT starter brush if you are interested in testing out the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>After the first week, it stopped losing hair, and it&#x27;s been a great performer so far.</li>
            <li>The handle has a decent heft to it and holds nicely in my hand, but again, I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush as an upgrade from an older boar hair brush I own.</li>
            <li>This is my first wet shaving brush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Great so far in my first two weeks.</li>
            <li>it had a strong smell (badger, I suppose), but that quickly vanished, just by using it.</li>
            <li>It hold water well, and it rinses super easy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, item was exactly as described and posted in good time.</li>
            <li>Most important is that this brush does not require a user to be an expert latherer, just a willing one.</li>
            <li>Every now and again you come across a nice half-canvassed suit with decent quality for around $600.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice shaving brush and decent price.</li>
            <li>The brush is inexpensive, decent looking, and works nicely.  </li>
            <li>It cleans easily and dries quickly once the excess water is removed.</li>
            <li>It has a nice look to it and it has been holding up great for the past month or so.</li>
            <li>but I think it does a decent job creating and holding a nice lather.</li>
            <li>This brush arrived quickly and the package was quite easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush is very scratchy and the bristles fall out very easily.</li>
            <li>It makes applying shaving soap very easy and without much effort.</li>
            <li>The book repeatedly suggested using a badger hair shaving brush (no other hair was suggested) as being superior to using the fingers.  </li>
            <li>It does loose a bit of hair, especially at first, but otherwise it produces a good lather and it&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Having just completely revamped my shaving approach, I was in need of a brush which would be dependable, provide a rich lather, and have an exceptional quality for value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of the materials used is high and I really liked the wood handle.  </li>
            <li>Old enough to remember the good old days used a number of the shaving brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li>I have a tweezerman brush that looks very much like this that I love.  </li>
            <li>The brush gives a good even layer of shaving foam, is very durable, easy to clean and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I started with a Boar&#x27;s-hair brush from Walgreens, which was very much pricklier, but I didn&#x27;t know any better -</li>
            <li>Brush is excellent and I certainly recommend it, particularly if you are new to the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This looks very sharp and elegant, and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving properly but this brush has been excellent.</li>
            <li>New to the fancy double edge shaving world, so I can&#x27;t tell if this is an excellent brush.  </li>
            <li>easy and quick to clean up.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it works amazingly well allowing your brush to dry, is cost effective, and saves on counter space.</li>
            <li>Getting a good lather with it is easy enough.</li>
            <li>Good brush, super soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>but I found this one to be more than adequate and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is soft, makes a nice lather, and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush, lathers soap quickly, rinses out fast, holds shape .</li>
            <li>nice and soft and the animal smell was easy to get rid of by letting some lather sit in it overnight...</li>
            <li>Great little brush at a very cheap price.</li>
            <li>I am sure high end brushes are better but for my money , not bad .</li>
            <li>What more can a person say about a fine 100% pure Badger Shaving Brush?</li>
            <li>Original</li>
            <li>Well worth it in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Purchased this as my first shaving brush and I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Has significantly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda funky at first but after a month of use the aroma is mostly gone from it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to be able to lather up for a shave as soon as I got it, but as soon as the brush touched hot water an over powering odor was released.    </li>
            <li>It is definitely the best value that I found on Amazon, but I did find a better one on ebay for a similar cost.</li>
            <li>This was the first brush I bought and have since bought three more.  </li>
            <li>As this is my first shaving brush I don&#x27;t have the cache of ethos that many pro shavers do.  </li>
            <li>Still in the original shape.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;-You will lose hairs the first couple days/weeks from the brush, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I did some research and decided to go with a badger hair shaving brush as part of my start up kit, and this brush has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I originally gave it three stars...</li>
            <li>I have since switched to a higher end brush from Slate and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great first brush to get.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, it foamed up much much better than my boar ever did.</li>
            <li>I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>hairs themselves are really nice and soft, and can really hold a nice lather.</li>
            <li>was significantly fewer.  </li>
            <li>Many people buy this as a first brush as well as the tweezerman brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you soak it in hot water for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this brush,I use shaving soap myself make a nice creamy head lather,feels good on my face,keeps its shape a few hairs may come off,but that&#x27;s to be excepted.</li>
            <li>The reason I got this brush was because I didn&#x27;t know any better when I first started.</li>
            <li>There may be a bit better quality brushes out there, but for his starter brush and the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with it and will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t rated it after the first use.</li>
            <li>the original scent is no longer perceptible.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed it, a couple of hairs came off, but I haven&#x27;t seen any more fallout for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Worth  it for the foam!</li>
            <li>He called and was so excited.</li>
            <li>I was excited about using the brush.</li>
            <li>My first brush in 40 years glad I am shaving with a blade again</li>
            <li>It will take time to determine whether the bristles are well glued to the handle and if there is any significant loss of bristles over time then replacement time will be shorter.  </li>
            <li>Either way, will use until bristles are gone and then spend more money on something higher quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks, and it has maintained its shape, and softened up significantly.</li>
            <li>Did lose a lot of the bristles at first but seems ok no that I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li>It holds sufficient water to work up a rich lather.</li>
            <li>No more tugging away, this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush, and altogether I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I soak it in piping hot water, squeeze most of the water out, and swirl it around the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>But after a week no more hair loss and the brush has turned into the best part of my morning shave.</li>
            <li>For the price I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Love the quality and the fact that no hair come off (after the first couple of uses).</li>
            <li>not enviromental friendly products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First saving brush I&#x27;ve purchased for many years.</li>
            <li>It occurred to me that shaving brushes were Man&#x27;s original exfoliant.</li>
            <li>When I first started using a badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d keep using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the quality of the brush, given the price.</li>
            <li>Dont know if that is normal for this kind of brush but</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash it first</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; soft, really feels nice on your face.</li>
            <li>My first experience with brush shaving....really enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it I wasn&#x27;t sure what level of quality I would get at this price, but when I first used it I was impress.</li>
            <li>I think I may have lost 6 bristles - most of them the first time i used it, but not 1 since.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t spend that much money at all,and every penny was worth it for the tears in my friend&#x27;s eyes (he probably just had something in his eyes, of course, like TEARS) and the satisfaction of knowing that he has a quality brush that will serve him for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far very pleased.</li>
            <li>Worked okay at first.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know any better as this was my first brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent product (I use this with a metal shaving bowl, shaving mugs seemed too small).  </li>
            <li>I was really excited for this brush, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>These minor complaints aside, it is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li>A good, general purpose shave brush, lathers well, semi-soft, retains moisture and shaving foam well.</li>
            <li>My first brush and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works well to create a rich lather.</li>
            <li>And I was told it makes shaving fun!</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased so far with the Escali.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, but have been nothing but pleased.  </li>
            <li>The brush is full and lightweight without feeling cheap.</li>
            <li>Original post:</li>
            <li>when I read all the reviews on here I was pretty confident I was getting a quality brush.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, but will not WOW you</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Maybe there are better ones for a higher price, but for this price I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Bristles come off on the first use, but better after that.</li>
            <li>Creating the lather directly on my face feels great, and if you do it correctly you get the shaving cream up UNDER the hairs and on the skin directly, as opposed to smearing it around on top of all the hairs if you are using shaving gel from a can and your hand.  </li>
            <li>Great brush have not used it long</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a brush, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose Escali.</li>
            <li>I have used a shaving brush for many years, but this is my first badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ALMOST fun to shave!</li>
            <li>This is normal and the brush will whip up a nice lather for shaving.  </li>
            <li>A poetic man.</li>
            <li>So many hairs fell off within my husband&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li>Not any significant loss of bristle is noticed.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple weeks, and am pretty pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Just imagine, looking at yourself into the mirror, admiring the vessel that contains all that testosterone for hot love making and being the epitome of manhood.</li>
            <li>Creates a rich lather with ease.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I paid for this higher quality brush and would buy one again.</li>
            <li>It sheds a bristle or two on occasion,  but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is about par for the course.</li>
            <li>so excited when I found this one.  </li>
            <li>Creates a rich lather.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need to love me myself</li>
            <li>Gives rich lather.</li>
            <li>Ok backbone, no smell, but pretty scratchy for my skin.</li>
            <li>Holds lather well, nice and soft, holds water nicely, and dries without too much fraying or misshaping.</li>
            <li>Bout 5 uses in, and its starting to break in nicely and become very smooth.</li>
            <li>After receiving the brush, I used it for a few days and it was very comfortable on my skin and worked up a great lather.</li>
            <li>There is a break in period, and once you&#x27;re through that, you will have a fine brush that will be much softer and will build a much better lather than the Escali ever will.</li>
            <li>users commented that there was a strong animal smell to the brush, but aside from a very mild, musky smell during the first couple of uses I have noticed no odor problem at all.  </li>
            <li>sure to wash it and clean it out before your first use since it is animal hair and will smell a bit funky at fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works fine, feels good, actually.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into the old school way of shaving, this brush really lathers and creates the right texture for you to have an incredible shave.  </li>
            <li>Although this is a cheap brush, I&#x27;d certainly expect more than a month&#x27;s use out of it.</li>
            <li>The brush is ok as a starter brush I think; he says he&#x27;s happy with it, but that it sheds a little bit.</li>
            <li>&gt; - Does a great job creating a lather quickly, and it feels pretty soft on the face when applying the leather.</li>
            <li>like the badger bristle, it starts off a little softer than the boar bristle but it generates a good lather and is nice on the skin when lathering up.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, very modest price, very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt scratchy at first, but now, when I apply my shaving cream, it creates a nice lather and seems to be doing the job, and is at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I am loving my new method of shaving</li>
            <li>New DE Shaver is loving the experience.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and quite honestly I wouldn&#x27;t know badger hair from cat hair.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m new to this kind of shaving</li>
            <li>As a new wet shaver it was nice to be able to get a goos brush at a good price.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new shaving brush and wanted the best quality one for the most reasonable cost; local stores don&#x27;t carry shave brushes here in south</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an excellent choice for a basic shaving item,  If you were ever interested in using a badger hair brush for the first time then this is a very good choice considering the low cost and high quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall I find the brush to hold a good amount of water, lather well, have a comfortable feel.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s clean now</li>
            <li>It works but having to pick hairs out of the lather is less than ideal.  </li>
            <li>Hairs fall out every time I use it and that can get in the way of a clean shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely the best badger hair I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>so guess who gets to have super smooth legs?</li>
            <li>He was thrilled and said he was told the Badger shaving brush is the finest quality and will last for many years.</li>
            <li>It will clean off the bristles.</li>
            <li>Better then expected product wise.</li>
            <li>The two combined give me a much closer shave and much more comfortable skin afterwords.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft with no smell that you sometimes read about with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells kind of funny at first.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped quickly and securely.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and the product description was accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped greatly by using a brush stand to allow it to dry after use; before then I&#x27;d wedge it in my shower caddy to prevent it from laying on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean it off, and give it the smell test.  </li>
            <li>My Simpson Chubby Best Badger or even the Semogue Boar brush I own would be an unfair comparison to this Escali Badger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost forgot make sure you soak the brush in warm water prior to each use.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel great and massaging against my skin and dry well in between uses.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good brush, definitely worth the price, but bristles fall out quite frequently.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, economical brush.</li>
            <li>I expected a better product with all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>After every use I have to clean my soap.</li>
            <li>Love it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Great shaving brush, soft bristles yet holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li>He really likes the badger brush and this was a great replacement for his old, worn out brush.</li>
            <li>Want that rugged, clean WWI balanced budget feeling?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I get a nice, thick foam and feels great.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean it and my shaving cup.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to start a better wet shave regimen, this is a good brush to start with and experiment.</li>
            <li>This brush, costing only 3-4 dollars more, was a spectacular upgrade.</li>
            <li>but I think it suppose to be in order to clean the face and get those hairs to stand up.</li>
            <li>far it is comfortable and leaves a nice lather.</li>
            <li>This really helps to create a more comfortable AND closer</li>
            <li>The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor.</li>
            <li>do fall out each time I use it, but I expect that with a natural brush - each bristle can&#x27;t be exactly he same, so there can never be perfect tension to keep the bristles in place.</li>
            <li>in getting lather all around the hair and ensuring a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might just be the nature of the beast with this kind of design, but in the future I would try for something with a more water-resilient handle.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this new/ old shaving I will never go back to cans.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the bristles get stuck in the shaving soap forcing you to clean out each handful of bristles every time I shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed smelling funky after I clean up, but during the shave I do.  </li>
            <li>It is now clear that the Escali brush was far from ideal</li>
            <li>When you rinse it out, run water through it until it looks clean.</li>
            <li>The bristles rinse clean now, after a couple of weeks, but there&#x27;s still a musky smell.  </li>
            <li>Bought the Escali brush as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a huge amount of money initially on a brush, and it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a hassle to clean at times.</li>
            <li>So far i love it. :)</li>
            <li>I decided to try a really good brush and some high-quality soap instead of whatever was available at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>This brush is really good, however after using it a few times the hair are kind of coming off of the brush.  </li>
            <li>It is great for applying a nice thick layer of suds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does a great job providing a nice thick application of lather.</li>
            <li>brush builds a good lather, holds the cream in it very well, and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that the brush fits into my stainless steel brush/razor stand and looks really cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush I bought in 2012 and is still in perfect condition today after using it regularly and it never lost any hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, nice handle.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice lather and is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, does a nice foam and does its job.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and makes a nice foaming lather.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews on this site were positive.</li>
            <li>think this is the true Art of Shaving to be honest and way better than anything they sell at the local stores!  </li>
            <li>It is almost perfect, but at the first couple of uses you will lose some bristles and that is annoying, after that it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Feels full and rich when lathered up.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush so far!</li>
            <li>* - I&#x27;m leaving this original review info in place for full disclosure/historical purposes, but</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about this brush - it is nice and soft and seems to be working well for him!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product, exactly as advertised, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>He said he loved the lather but that is was kind of rough when he first started using.  </li>
            <li>great quality never leaves loose bristles on your face.</li>
            <li>Apart from the loose bristles that fall off initially, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>The brush is great once all the loose bristles are gone.</li>
            <li>This is very good quality but a little pokey.</li>
            <li>getting any funny smells, though I have read that some people have used a mild borax solution to wash it safely.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this dang fine badger-hair brush!  </li>
            <li>I am not a connoisseur of different types of bristle, but this brush is comfortable to hold, lathers well, looks great and holds more foam than my old (boar bristle) shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Product is just what I was looking for, solidly built, feels great in your hands which comes when such things are made with great quality, it&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and gentle brush.</li>
            <li>It feels great against my skin; not too rough, but not too soft, and it holds enough water to create a perfect lather.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a decent quality brush and a very good value for a starter.</li>
            <li>So I have a new brush, new shaving cream, Dreadnaught, and a new razor, and I&#x27;m achieving an excellent shave, comfortable, smooth, and economical.  </li>
            <li>The brush works well and mixes with my soap easily, may lose a few hairs but for the most part a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Bruch creates rich foamy lather; soap goes on thick and creates a superb shave!</li>
            <li>Thanks due in part to this wonderful brush.</li>
            <li>I have now used my Escali 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush for two weeks and have enjoyed two benefits from it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Pure Badger Shaving Brush &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like using 100% pure badger hair to apply your favorite shave soap.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure badger hair...</li>
            <li>I certainly couldn&#x27;t justify spending any more on a brush though</li>
            <li>I was right to do so!</li>
            <li>The price is right on this one!</li>
            <li>Use this everyday and it feels very good on the skin.</li>
            <li>The best way to get that process started is to use a little hand soap on the brush before you even use it the first time.</li>
            <li>the pruduct arrive pretty fast and everything was nice and clean, im going to reorder again one set for my father.</li>
            <li>From the first time this Escali brush met the soap puck, it&#x27;s been love at first shave!  </li>
            <li>I am super excited about using this brush.</li>
            <li>I have been to specialty sites and found that most decent brushes start in the $45 range and go on up to the mid-200&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>but it holds up perfectly, even after whipping up the hard soap surface.</li>
            <li>USA vitamins customer service was friendly and quick to send me a replacement brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to spend little but still make your shaving more enjoyable, I think this is effective.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if the packaging was a little more interesting or even included tip sheet on shaving.</li>
            <li>Special thanks to Perella&#x27;s and their outstanding team.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush so much, that after we bought some special Basin shaving cream for our 17-year-old son, I bought him his first Escali Badger Shaving Brush, and HE loves it, too.  </li>
            <li>Its a very pleasant earthy smell that evokes emotions from the past, maybe that was a smell from the barber shop as a kid.  </li>
            <li>However, this works just fine for right now</li>
            <li>I bought the Escali brush mainly because it looked nice and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor but it seems to be nice quality and works fine for lathering.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t poke his skin, isn&#x27;t rough at all, and does a great job of exfoliating and lathering.</li>
            <li>great addition to any wet shaver&#x27;s medicine cabinet</li>
            <li>I liked the product very much, very well designed and finish was of high class!!</li>
            <li>Not much volume, and the lather isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush, however this is my first and only brush that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>But after the first few shaves, it has been lathering up perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great brush works as expected.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a great introduction to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Quality was great though, no real issue (yet) with losing hairs</li>
            <li>Great product, was just as described, well made and seems like it will last for a while, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>The quality is great and after a few of the hairs coming out initially it has been holding up great.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush but quality seems great and it has definitely improved the closeness of my shave</li>
            <li>What hasn&#x27;t been so great about this brush is that it smells rather like an unwashed badger each time it gets wet.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed smooth lather application and the warm lather makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li>The brush is truly a great value, but should not be expected to perform like a Kent.</li>
            <li>It is priced for a beginner and a nice starter brush; however, I wonder if it saves more in the long run to upgrade at the start.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>It works great and with minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>Great brush with minimal fall off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really all that happy with the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is great if your&#x27;e trying to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>as I know now, I had taken a huge step to becoming a real man.  </li>
            <li>I am still looking for one that creates an amazing lather and is soft to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li>This brush offers an amazing value.</li>
            <li>i,am not worried about it,i clean it real good and let it dry out completely before using</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; if you were ever wonbering what a wet beaver smelt like you can sfop woundering after using this.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel amazing as you lather, they&#x27;re both soft and invigorating.</li>
            <li>The second reason is that the badger hair is supposedly superior to boar hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have come to LOVE the whole experience.</li>
            <li>good solid shaving brush.</li>
            <li>how good it would actually feel.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely, and I did for months before I learned of much better options in a comparable price range.</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve used this brush almost every day for a full month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is the one to use for most shaving applications; much softer than boar hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my badger didn&#x27;t have good personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Soft, and effective.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve admired straight blade shaving for years and have always heard about the better shave a shaving brush</li>
            <li>It is quite soft which is nice</li>
            <li>Plus, let&#x27;s face it, it looks kinda cool as opposed to slapping that stuff from a can on your mug.</li>
            <li>The brush is of good quality, especially for the price, he just prefers a softer brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feels nice and does the job perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask for much more in a shaving</li>
            <li>You get a full head of foam with it, and it doesn&#x27;t separate.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, by the time this one wears out, I would feel that the full value of the product - and beyond - had been realized.  </li>
            <li>While this is true, the finish of the brush - namely in the imprinted name, the wood handle, and the lacquer finish - expose the budget side of this brush.  </li>
            <li>While this is true, the finish of the brush - namely in the imprinted name, the wood handle, and the lacquer finish - expose the budget side of this brush.  </li>
            <li>On time shipping, lovely product high quality, husband loves it!</li>
            <li>Overall a good brush to start with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the last 10 or so shaves and it still feels good to the skin when I lather up.</li>
            <li>Real badger makes it better.</li>
            <li>While that might be true</li>
            <li>The brush feels nice and soft on my face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and helps make a nice lather.</li>
            <li>A good solid shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Good brush, but it broke after a short fall from the counter to the floor.</li>
            <li>This brush stays full during its use.</li>
            <li>Overall this purchase was a good experience.</li>
            <li>I would say overall good for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is just the product for giving oneself a shave that is a pleasure to took forward to.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes on an entirely different perspective with a lather made with this brush that makes your face feel good.</li>
            <li>This brush is not as soft on my face as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I got this Escali because of its good rating and low price.</li>
            <li>hair is much finer than the boar brush, and does a much better job holding water.  </li>
            <li>Solid build feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>I would have a sink full of hairs.</li>
            <li>So far my own Badger Shaving Brush surpasses greatly my father&#x27;s unknown product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product with a good feel and works well.  </li>
            <li>Initially couple of hairs fell off but after that it is all good</li>
            <li>A good friend who served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War told me he used such a brush to care for his M16, and I&#x27;ve used these brushes ever since.  </li>
            <li>but the hairs are not as soft and effective at whipping the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>PS, The brush is also good for female friends.</li>
            <li>After moving to a double-edged razor and Proraso pre-shave oil and shaving cream I figured I&#x27;d go full old-school and get a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves the brush and it makes his shaving so much easier &amp; better</li>
            <li>The brush is usable after a good vinegar and baking soda bath and some essential oils added.  </li>
            <li>Also, since the bristles are so soft, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting the soap under my beard hairs, which results in far more nicking when I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is a newbie on old school shaving and he is loving it.</li>
            <li>I love it, it works like it is supposed to do and gets the job done, I also really like the design for the brush.</li>
            <li>It has since stopped but it is not as full as the day it arrived</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, and does the job.</li>
            <li>Considering the price of this brush as compared to some of the others, you really can&#x27;t ask for much more.  </li>
            <li>Not enough to worry about, but a bit surprising.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>Was a good starter brush but the low price for badger should be a warning.</li>
            <li>The brush holds a lot of soap, and the bristles are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Although the handle is a bit short for me, the wood is good quality.  </li>
            <li>There are good boar brushes, like an Omega, for the same price.  </li>
            <li>3 stars for the brush, extra star for the good customer service.  </li>
            <li>Very well made and keeps its shape through many shaves...will always buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li>If not for that this product would have received the full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>, the brush doesn&#x27;t feel a whole lot better than rubbing a paint brush on my face.</li>
            <li>is now nice and soft, and smells like shave soap.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go for the full wet-shave experience and purchased this Escali Badger Brush and some TOBS shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my synthetic brush until I find a good badger brush.</li>
            <li>For the price it looks good and with practice provides proper service.</li>
            <li>I probably have not been kind to it in terms of drying properly, but even still it&#x27;s been good so far.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the quality of the product and it seemed to be reasonably priced compared to some others I looked at.</li>
            <li>Good quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>I also wanted a true badger brush and not a synthetic or boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The brissels are full and do not fall out in a shaving mug as some others do.</li>
            <li>But overall good value.</li>
            <li>It is a good price on the basic badger.  </li>
            <li>I love stuff made from real animals.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to take on a cross country trip and did not want to risk &amp;#34;loosing&amp;#34; my good brush to the TSA&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush handle looks really cool.</li>
            <li>Dont have anything to compare it with,but its doing a good enough job for me.</li>
            <li>Much stiffer which I like better.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall I feel that it was a good starter brush</li>
            <li>Never made a better lather or had the best wet shave after 3 weeks of converting to traditional shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has my shaving soap usage been reduced, but this brush has sped up the time it takes to build a good lather.</li>
            <li>Good overall product.</li>
            <li>Looks good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely sets the standard.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, soft, and husband loves it</li>
            <li>but the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>love the looks of it and it feels very well</li>
            <li>Thankfully after a couple weeks of shaving with good soaps the smell finally went away.  </li>
            <li>Holds a good amount of lather with just enough water to keep everything well lubricated during the entirety of my shave.</li>
            <li>I get full use of it.</li>
            <li>A good solid beginning brush for those who want a close shave.</li>
            <li>You really won&#x27;t find a better brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Kinda cool.  </li>
            <li>I got a boars hair brush but the badger hair brush works a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>Good quality and will last if its not abused, I believe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, soft brush, feels nice, I&#x27;m unsure how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>It helps get a good lather and lift the hairs prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>May be is a good choice for start, but if you want go to next level, maybe choice another one.</li>
            <li>After some time and some comparisons it might be a good one to keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>This one is so much softer and lathers better on my face.  </li>
            <li>A soft, well-made brush that whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>No need to spend the big $$$ for a good performing shave brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have never used one of these before, so I have no frame of reference, but it is doing a nice job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor and needed a good shave brush.</li>
            <li>I spent a while reading about the various options for each of these products and was impressed most by these.</li>
            <li>I have also had a good experience with a similar brush by Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to look totally sweet for the ladies.</li>
            <li>bought a wood rack to go with, and not only is it a great shave tool, it looks pretty darn cool on my counter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice soft brush for the money.</li>
            <li>I know fresh brushes are supposed to have a light &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; odor of a badger....</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true when people say you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>But overall it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer and it seems to hold a lather better than the Van Der Hagen brush.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brush I have ever used and for 12.99 it is a good deal</li>
            <li>The brush is good quality, but considerably smaller that the one I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>This allows the soap to fill up the brush more as well so you can really lather up your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice an soft.</li>
            <li>If it lasted longer I would give it a full 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I will probably avoid Escali in the future.</li>
            <li>So far a nice brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and effective.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out more money for something nicer until I had the hang of things.</li>
            <li>Good brush overall</li>
            <li>Nice and soft touch and feel.</li>
            <li>The wood handle is nice looking and bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>It does the job but not as good as the larger brush I bought from CVS for $3.</li>
            <li>Its soft, and lathers on the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li>This brush is at a good price point, but my brush continued to have hairs fall out DAILY even after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>The badger hairs are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels ok on the skin, but hairs come out of it every time I use it even though I&#x27;m trying to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs warm water very well for pre-shave &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34;, lathers well in shave bowl, and does a nice job in exfoliating skin as you spread the later across your face (circular motions).  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but I prefer synthetic.</li>
            <li>It has not shed many bristles and has maintained its shape very well.  </li>
            <li>know that it is true Badger hair because my dog went nuts sniffing it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed too much, or any more than I expect it to.</li>
            <li>I love it; they really bring up a lather.</li>
            <li>Works great for being only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up nicely and seems like it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Barking her brains out in full attack mode as if the brush were going to kill me.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li>A good, basic brush that does the job.</li>
            <li>Nice soft hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this brush on my skin, and it really seems to hold up for quite some time.</li>
            <li>The brush itself has a good deep lathering massage feel to it.</li>
            <li>It took me a second try getting a soap that makes a good lather.</li>
            <li>Cool company name printed on handle to remind you how hipster you are.</li>
            <li>It works up a nice lather, and the hairs are holding together nicely so far.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft ,it whips up well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as good on your face as the higher end brushes, but is a great alternative to those who can&#x27;t afford the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner in shaving with the safety razors and using shaving brush, but as faw as I can tell - it&#x27;s a good starting product!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good beginners brush.</li>
            <li>A true value.</li>
            <li>I wish the handle was heavier but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I just hope it holds up over time, that will be the true test of its quality.</li>
            <li>and I found this to be true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really liked an old Barbershop brand</li>
            <li>This is a nice, soft brush.</li>
            <li>The brush holds a lot of water and when used with a good cream (not regular spray cream) it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>and it is good to go the next day.  </li>
            <li>Good looking and solid to boot too.</li>
            <li>Works great, nice thin layer and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>If you not really a big fan with Badger brush, I recommend Omega 10048 Boar Bristle, Omega S brush (synthetic brush) and Semogue 1800 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>Fair price point for a solid product.</li>
            <li>He has asked on more than one occasion if it was Honey Badger hair as that would make it that much cooler if it were.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that badger hair is chuck full of anti-oxidants and testosterone.</li>
            <li>Maybe they could of cleaned them better haha.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and helps to make a nice lather.</li>
            <li>(go to youtube for instructions on how to properly use a shaving brush) and is fairly sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Love having it out by the sink in the Escali stainless steel stand.</li>
            <li>Works well, soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Not the quality we had hoped for but not bad.</li>
            <li>First time using a brush like this and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Just bought this brush, not a bad deal....</li>
            <li>maybe a bit, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>No bad odors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad stepping stone</li>
            <li>It is not bad but couple of hairs do tend to come off so watch out for that.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the money.</li>
            <li>Lost some hairs, but not nearly as bad as my CVS boar brush.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a bad brush for the price</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy...</li>
            <li>Still not a bad brush</li>
            <li>No bad smell either.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised on receipt of the brush finding it was as of good of quality as the first one.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s holding up pretty good .</li>
            <li>it is a fantastic little brush at an exceptional price!</li>
            <li>well, dries quickly and, most importantly, does a great job of creating and applying a thick lather.</li>
            <li>I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave now because of this brush and my new sandalwood shave soap, which this brush lathers incredibly well.</li>
            <li>New to wet shaving, awesome valued brush.</li>
            <li>this may result in being able to use less shaving cream to produce a good amount of lather on your face-</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly too, which I appreciated :)</li>
            <li>It will tremendously improve your shaving experience and greatly facilitated my transition into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>With advertising the way it is, that can mean it is not the best hair, but it is all hair.</li>
            <li>The handle is very soft and comfortable but could be more rigid.  </li>
            <li>just run water through it, take the bristles from right under the handle in the web between index finger and thumb, and squeeze downward once or twice, and the brush is in shape and free of all water and soap.</li>
            <li>The price is right on this item, and the service by Perella&#x27;s was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The brush picks up just the right amount of shaving cream from the container with a light twirl then spreads it evenly across my face.  </li>
            <li>At that price point it could be a very attractive brush, and it&#x27;s hard to argue with the MANY high product ratings.</li>
            <li>After soaking the brush in hot water for a couple of minutes, latheting soaps and creams are easy.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to rinse and is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, it smells strongly of badger hair and the smell decreases after repeated use.</li>
            <li>It was pretty strong, but not overly offensive.  </li>
            <li>I likes the reviews the brush received making it a pretty easy choice for me.</li>
            <li>purchased first time - returned, bristles are coming off easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty gentle with it, but I bet it could take a bit more roughness than I give it and do fine.  </li>
            <li>I let it soak in hot water before shaving  and immediately noticed a strong smell coming from it.</li>
            <li>Also, its probably a good idea to soak it for some time in very hot water to break it in and soften the bristles up as much as possible.</li>
            <li>The brush is great and works the cream into a nice thick lather (maybe I will try it on my legs?!).  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Escali brush about a week ago, and it&#x27;s been treating me good thus far, iv only seen about 2 hairs shed, it lathers great, its soft on the face</li>
            <li>Works great, makes a very smooth and thick lather.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question that it is a higher grade product, the bristles are softer and more consistent, the handle is made of &#x27;real&#x27; material, and there might be more hair inside the handle (the knot)</li>
            <li>This is a very large boar brush with a huge knot, 28mm knot.</li>
            <li>Classic wood handle looks nice, not flashy</li>
            <li>This brush works great for shaving - bristles are soft enough not to irritate, but strong enough to provide a good lather.</li>
            <li>You can certainly get more expensive badger hair brushes, but for the money this brush is very effective and did a good job.</li>
            <li>Very soft and nice brush, shaving with the right tools changes it from a chore to a pleasure.</li>
            <li>Part of the self-reliance mindset is buying items of quality while taking your budget into consideration; given these parameters I found a few brushes made of quality materials within my price range, but the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush had the best reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little brush at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes since i haven&#x27;t used any others, but i can build great lathers and it will hold plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>for about the same money a nice Omega brush would be a better first choice.</li>
            <li>This is my first real shaving brush and it has worked great so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the issue other people are talking about with hair falling out, works great.</li>
            <li>Got this along with some other shaving products for my dad who has eveything, he likes the well construtive design and bristles, along with the durability,  great price also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, I keep it clean and dry and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>a couple of the bristles came out but other than that it works great and hasn&#x27;t happened again.</li>
            <li>I recommend that the brush be washed with warm water and shaving soap prior to first use; most of the stray badger hairs will fall off this way.</li>
            <li>Great brush for wet shaving!</li>
            <li>This little fellow might miss his coat, but it sure feels good on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for a little over a month now and all I can say is that it is a very well made shaving brush and excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush creates a good lather quite fast and the bristles have not fallen out, so that&#x27;s pretty much what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When you get a good load of soap and start to lather, the brush falls flat.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking into buying a good brush you are looking into paying a little more money and a price range of 30-70 dollars.  </li>
            <li>Only used it 2 or 3 times so far, but the quality seems to be very good.</li>
            <li>First impression: fits my hand, soft bristles, does a great job whipping up and holding lather, no matting or balling of bristles, easy cleaning and dries completely.</li>
            <li>Of course with an attractive price.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I loved the results: less irritation, smooth face and the shadow lasts long to appear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend this to any one who wants a badger hair brush without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I am new to safety razor shaving, I got fed up with paying the high cost of the Gillette blades, so I got a razor and this brush and some shaving soap, first couple of shaves were a bit of a learning curve, but after three or so I am now proficient, I should have switched years ago</li>
            <li>I love my new shaving brush!</li>
            <li>The quality of the bristles are great - it creates a nice rich lather and are just rough enough to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving, so I was looking for a nice brush for a good price.</li>
            <li>This is a good beginners brush, but if you are like me and quickly throw yourself into a new hobby like wet shaving you may want to skip a step and go with a nice silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li>It was fine for the first 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li>Seem fine first time purchasing a shave brush.</li>
            <li>The first one was fine.</li>
            <li>Sheds a bit for the first week, but then its fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Simple, cheap, effective.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used a brush in a while, just got back to using a traditional shave setup and this brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be sturdy, dries quickly and has not lost bristles despite vigorous use.</li>
            <li>A decent &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; brush feels soooo much better on the face.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this one better than the $60 bc its stiffer and raises the hair better.  </li>
            <li>Now it hangs on a hook in my shower and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It does an adequate job with the cream</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>, the brush will become softer fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>only beef is that it tends to lose hairs more than most.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up the soap really quickly.</li>
            <li>While boar hair is a worthy substitute, it doesn’t retain water as well and has a reputation of retaining a noticeable odor.  </li>
            <li>Creams are easier to lather, they moisturize better, and just overall create a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>(I have Lavender which i really like, but i&#x27;d say go for Avocado or another scent that you find pleasurable) because it really just is a piece of cake to lather up and make an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>Its def an adequate brush.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a great present to give to someone who really enjoys the art of shaving.</li>
            <li>but I suspect it is adequate for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>the seller:&lt;br /&gt;The brush was delivered quickly, within three or four days.  </li>
            <li>I received the package quickly.  </li>

            <li>It is adequate in every way.  </li>
            <li>Delivered  quickly</li>
            <li>It really is a better way to shave--much better for the skin and smoother, closer shave overall.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me it isn&#x27;t worn out yet.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliates, doesn&#x27;t lose a ton of bristles, makes it really easy to lather up and distribute shaving soap and rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this brush is smaller than I thought it would be, it still does a great job of getting my face ready for a blade.</li>
            <li>It does have some pokey bristles but it&#x27;s worthy of four stars.</li>
            <li>The vendor, Perella&#x27;s, shipped the item quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I was in too much of a hurry and didn&#x27;t do the proper break in technique I read online, so had some issues, but once I used it and broke it in, I may find a hair every once in a great while.</li>
            <li>So far, after a week&#x27;s worth of shaves it has held up nicely and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li>It works up a lather quickly either off your face with a cream or in a bowl.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the time and use a brush that&#x27;s worthy of your face.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this brush at such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I never thought something so simple could make shaving that much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>This smell goes away fairly quickly - you won&#x27;t notice it by the 5th shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I have some chlorhexidine solution lying around</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>the only gripe I have at all is the wood is kind of cheap</li>
            <li>My order delivered quickly and ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone starting out shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>This brush is great especially for the price I might want to get a nicer one if I had been straight edge shaving longer</li>
            <li>It soaks up and distributes lather well and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and has helped to reduce razor burn on his neck tremendously.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, no difficulties with product or seller.</li>
            <li>Super glue and patience got it working again, but there&#x27;s no doubt quality is an issue here.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>far, after about six uses,no hairs on my soap.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice lather,soft on your face, and almost makes shaving fun.</li>

            <li>I found the brush to be adequate for the price.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for several weeks now and it was replaced today by a Simpsons Colonel 2xl in best badger (Not recommended for starting out</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the smoothness and quality that I thought was only possible with higher-cost brands.</li>

            <li>Honestly have no other brush to compare this to.</li>

            <li>This one had high marks from many reviewers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the one from the high end store visited.</li>
            <li>Very fast and secure shipping.</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak it in hot water for a good long time before the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I ended up using my original primary brush as my trip brush and now exclusively use this Escali Pure Badger Brush at home.</li>
            <li>This feels good on my face, keeps the right amount of water in place and seems to last.  </li>
            <li>you need a good badger brush for the right shave, look no further!</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with the brush, and my wife says the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I have no previous experience with a shaving brush, but this one works great so far.</li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers noted, this is a great shaving brush; really holds water and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Broken-in boar brushes will be more comfortable than this, because it uses clipped Badger hair, which makes it more prickly and less comfortable.</li>
            <li>the brush itself is great, helped provide a perfectly smooth, close shave DAILY, even with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>First off let me start off by saying that ever since I switched to the &amp;#34; real&amp;#34; way on how to shave I have seen a huge difference in my face.</li>
            <li>wish I read the B&amp;B forums earlier to learn that a cheap boar is substantially better than a cheap badger.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it, I definitely like using this brush.  </li>
            <li>(see my other review), is quite light and has a good grip.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped the item VERY fast!</li>
            <li>It helps whip up a nice thick lather, and it feels great while lathering my face, very luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied by the quality and the overall construction of the brush.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and won&#x27;t be going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Hair started falling off in a very first shave!!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>My very first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I ignored the comments I read about the this brush shading it&#x27;s bristles, BIG MISTAKE!!&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous!  is the best description, dozens of bristles everyware between my face, the soap and the sink on the very first use , further more , this thing is not soft at all, it so prickly it feels more like a $1 paint brush, except</li>
            <li>I would mention is that it did lose a couple bristles the very first time that I used it.  </li>
            <li>they where finding while using this brush, so I was nervous about buying this, but I&#x27;m cheap first and foremost!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, and I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>After using them again, I wonder why I ever left, and in these times it sure is more economical.</li>
            <li>The resulting lather also feels creamier, maybe due to the fact that it can introduce air and water to the cream more effectively.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and is comfortable, but I think I&#x27;ll be finding a higher quality brush soon.</li>
            <li>I needed a cheap and affordable badger brush and thats exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my very first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Its a great starter brush, but will definitely invest more on a future brush.</li>
            <li>This is my very first badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>but I could tell from my first lather that this brush is cheap.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of various brushes, I chose this one and, after a month or so, am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issue with bristles falling off and overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>- this is the very first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used</li>
            <li>Light shedding when I used it the first couple of times, but it has since stopped.</li>
            <li>this is my first genuine badger hair shaving brush, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier by both the purchase and the reliability of the vendor (Perella&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>And was pretty cheap too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>This is my very first Brush, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this, would buy again, and definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li>My very first shave brush.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this brush though, I retired my first brush to the backup role, and am using this item as my primary shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Very first time using a Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>A friend introduced me to using shaving cream instead of the normal shaving gel that most men use.</li>
            <li>This is my very first badger brush as I delve into the world of shaving.</li>
            <li>I recently made the jump to DE shaving, and I am VERY glad I did.  </li>
            <li>But for this matter, someone that sensitive to scents may be better off finding a synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this brush has done a fairly good job and for the price it seems like it will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>last brush was nowhere near this good and cost me considerably more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Minor shedding, but makes a good lather.</li>
            <li>Take good care of it and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li>But the shaving brush looks good and we hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The hairs themselves are soft and the wooden handle gripped nicely and felt nice on the hand.</li>
            <li>- initially I found myself using a lot more pressure and mashing the whole thing into the bowl which wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>it should be good for a long time</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this badger brush for very long so I can&#x27;t attest to its durability, but I can absolutely say that its bristles are softer and more comfortable to use, and its wood handle is also more pleasant to look at than my last brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is not too large and the shape makes it easy to pick up shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Thank  you for a fine product, and please congratulate your staff on producing a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;Regards from New Zealand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill the brush with shaving cream, and it&#x27;s also easy to wash it out completely after use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>But it it has been a very good brush so far, has only shed a few hairs from what I can see, and does a great job of lathering.</li>
            <li>this is my first shaving brush, but I did make sure to buy one that is pure badger hair.</li>
            <li>This old fellow (68) just started to &amp;#34;Wet Shave&amp;#34;.... bought the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and very pleased with it.....</li>
            <li>A great brush for a beginner or long time shaver; soft, lathers well, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I recently was given a vastly nicer brush with a much-softer (and non-shedding) \\&quot;best badger\\&quot; knot in it and decided to see just how many more bristles the Escali brush would loose.</li>
            <li>It is an essential shaving tool if you are using a more traditional cream like the Proraso since the brush is much more effective at lathering up the cream, and preparing your beard than using your hands alone.  </li>
            <li>This product is the perfect travel companion, fits nicely into my travel bag, holds it&#x27;s bristles, and gives me the same lather-up feeling as my more expensive brush that I use at home.  </li>
            <li>Great product, glad I bought it, fast shipping bad great service</li>
            <li>Really great brush especially for the price I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight, affordable shaving brush that does not loose its badger hair in application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Snaps back to &#x27;original&#x27; shape after being wet... just an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It lathers better now than it did when new, so it&#x27;s gonna be around my bathroom for a while longer.  </li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a brush and soap, but I can say that I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying my new Escali brush.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to lose more bristles than I would expect from a new brush of any sort.</li>
            <li>It has lasted for a year, and I see no signs of needing a new one anytime soon, so all the better on reliability.  </li>
            <li>my new brush and my shave is better than ever.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many brushes over the year and even thrown one or two out while they were new.</li>
            <li>but as I am new to shaving with a safely razor I have decided to make a hobby of it.</li>
            <li>Brush feels great, is affordable and actually looks more pleasant than other brushes in the same price range!</li>
            <li>This combined with the soap I use have led to much less irritation when I shave which is a win in my book.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, works great.</li>
            <li>It seems okay, smooth and soft and easy to clean thus far.  </li>
            <li>This brush holds the lather, the price of the brush was less than in the stores , it was a great price too.</li>
            <li>Great brush, nicely finished wooden handle, performs on a par with more my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs here and there, but this brush makes me feel like my cool as all get out pop-pop for a great price.</li>
            <li>but overall it seems to be a pretty good brush and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I love it, first ever shaving brush and it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush that will last long</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and should last a Long time</li>
            <li>A good 10-20 hairs fell out the first use and each subsequent use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the medium to small side-- good for travel but OK at home.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush, especially if it is your first one.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price, but will probably spring for a higher quality brush the next time around.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a hanger for the brush to dry and a good dish for whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping of the product was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It works very well at lathering up shaving cream, holds water well, and it is easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>Twice around the soap bowl is all I need to make a nice full lather with plenty left over to go over my mouth and chin area twice.  </li>
            <li>You can easily spend 2-5 times as much on a brush, but this one will work just as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a good job of storing mine upside-down to dry...</li>
            <li>Easy ordering and fast shipping...</li>
            <li>Just rinse really good and dry then hang up.</li>
            <li>I really want to rate it better, and honestly it is pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a slightly higher quality brush out there selling for 50 or 60 dollars - but at $13.00, this brush is really excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lose that many hairs when first used, and makes applying shaving soap so much easier than synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>This is probably a good brush for the price, especially since it&#x27;s the first one I bought and</li>
            <li>So far I found that this is true and this brush suits my needs better than the Escali.</li>
            <li>I expect this brush to last a long time in great service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing with it&#x27;s glossy wooden handle and never fails to deliver a good lather.</li>
            <li>When I first went to use it I rinsed it out with warm water in the shower, then swirled it around twice in my container of sandalwood shaving cream by Taylor of old bond street, the in a circular motion applied to my leg.</li>
            <li>;  which might be a good idea since even after washing it prior the first use it let a brown tinge in the lather</li>
            <li>The brush itself works fine as you would expect from a pure Badger haired brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is very soft and much better than the boar brush that I had.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face ( very soft ).  </li>
            <li>It looks OK and the hair is very soft .</li>
            <li>The smell wears away (mostly), and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>smooth and good quality, yet the fibers drops down every use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This brush only goes to make the process that much better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you&#x27;ll end up with lots of badger hairs on your face!  </li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>Was excited at first, but the hairs all started falling out.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>Also it has a tendency to knot up in the middle which then you have to pull out the knot and lose more hairs!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Parella&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>When I first received the brush it smelled like a badger!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>You can get a Semogue boar brush for the same price that works better!</li>
            <li>Shedding will occur at first AND if you don&#x27;t prepare the brush in water!</li>
            <li>next will be an upgrade to a better badger brush!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Funny!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time &amp; exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>And yes several hairs fell out my first couple shaves, but I am sure that happens with most brushes.</li>
            <li>BUT HOT DAMN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the packages and WOOSH!</li>
            <li>and I consistently get perfectly whipped lather and only very occasionally do I get a stray badger hair on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my teenage son and its handsome style and easy-to-use and care for qualities made it a hit!</li>
            <li>I will buy another one next time for sure!</li>
            <li>it was my first brush!  </li>
            <li>My first shaving brush!</li>
            <li>This is my first time shaving with means of a brush, but I have to say the way the soap and water work together with the help of the Escali shaving brush helps make this daily routine more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working just as well as it did the first day!  </li>
            <li>The lather was in fact significantly thicker than what I could get with my first Art of Shaving brush, and I may still need to tinker with the water ratio.</li>
            <li>Way better than my old wilkenson sword!</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush I&#x27;ve bought, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all getting a rich lather or applying it to my face.  </li>
            <li>The hairs REALLY hold a lot of soap!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re new to traditional wetshaving, or returning to it, this a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Dad called me and was overjoyed he could retire his old brush and loved the new badger brush replacement.</li>
            <li>Like most real-badger hair brushes, there&#x27;s a bit of a funk to it right out of the package; give it a good hot water rinse, soap it up really well with the shave soap of your choice, and let it dry overnight.  </li>
            <li>Now my brush \\&quot;floats\\&quot; just under the cabinet - easy access, proper drying, and no lost counterspace. :)</li>
            <li>For anyone interested in breaking in a brush, you first clean the brush with dish soap thoroughly, trying to get as many of the hairs out as possible, then rinse, then put into a solution of dish soap for about 4 hours, then rinse again trying to get out many of the hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the brush it is easy to use and the shave is second to non!!</li>
            <li>But after contacting Amazon the order was fixed free of charge and very quickly with 1 day shipping.  </li>
            <li>Definitely need a stand to help it dry, but it is a great addition to my grooming rituals!</li>
            <li>comfort and sensation are very good (much better than my previous one, and I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Ordered the shaving brush to replace a brush that I had been using for fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;Had become very comfortable and attached to this old friend of a brush.  </li>
            <li>Sure, you can pay five or ten times more for a fancy handle, but in the end, this brush does the job and makes me smile knowing how much money I&#x27;m saving!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very good price point, considering the alternatives tend to be either terribly expensive or very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly, and does the job just right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recipient was happy with the brush, and is super excited to be a new member of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Its a good beginner brush and great value for the price if you don&#x27;t mind a little loose badger hair.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hold as much water in the bristles as my previous brush, which is actually a good thing because I can better control how watered</li>
            <li>The brush holds its shape, has a crisp feel on the face, and rinses clean while maintaining its shape.</li>
            <li>Other than that the brush is great and really creams up my cream!</li>
            <li>He has to be clean shaven for his job and he loves this brush so much that he even uses it and shaves on his off days!</li>
            <li>I did not get the stand, I leave it in my stainless mixing dish which works fine.</li>
            <li>After a thorough cleaning, the brush functioned fine, and I reported as much.   </li>
            <li>If you enjoy smelling like a wet badger, you will LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li>The badger hair is soft and provides great lather - much better than the previous brush.  </li>
            <li>Every day more and more loose hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I have used it for a few weeks, the brush is very soft, it forms a lovely lather of shaving cream, and exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also i wouldnt spend more on a fancy handle for me anyways considering i would much rather save the cash and purchase a nice new brush then having a used old one with a fancy handle.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it and would certainly recommend its purchase.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for an inexpensive shaving brush, I would skip cheap, \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; brushes altogether.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality and handsome brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Make sure I soak the brush in warm water for a minute or 2 prior to using it, make sure I get all the soap out after (squeeze, don&#x27;t twist the bristles), and hang it to dry in a razor and brush stand.  </li>
            <li>When armed with some warm water, a decent hunk of shaving soap in my surplus mug, and a proper blade, I have no doubt that the goal of a clean, close and comfortable shave will be met.</li>
            <li>Escali is a great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I detect no unpleasant odors, it does a great job of making lather and it is definitely soft enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Great little shave brush.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little scritchy but that tells me the bristles are getting under my beard &amp; lifting the whiskers to provide for a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Great little Shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Great little brush they got here.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>This little brush is a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li>Great brush..sheds a little</li>
            <li>Great little badger brush.</li>
            <li>purchased four of these little beauties at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also able to be more precise with where I apply lather without making a mess.    </li>
            <li>My first brush works just fine and feels pretty well made,  </li>
            <li>so I use it over a larger area than most and can say that it works just fine for these legs.  </li>
            <li>works fine make sure you break it in and get the apoxy smell out of it before you start using it regular.</li>
            <li>The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly soft or comfortable, although it felt fine and never bothered me.</li>
            <li>Works up a good smooth lather with little effort.</li>
            <li>I liked my shave soap before, but this little brush is helping me to love my soap.</li>
            <li>Handle is wood and feels good but a little light for my taste.</li>
            <li>First of all, if you don&#x27;t have a shaving brush, get one right now!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush, very soft and it&#x27;s been working well for me since last 1 month.</li>
            <li>this is the first brush i have ever bought,so far nice product,holds soap very well and clean up is not a problem.</li>
            <li>and it should be good to go, (also helps get rid of loose hairs at this point instead of on your face!)</li>
            <li>I enjoy my shave so much now.</li>
            <li>It really spreads the lather well for a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>Great Brush, just a few bristles falling of from time to time during lather process.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I have had only one bristle come out.</li>
            <li>Lost a few hairs in the beginning, works great now.</li>
            <li>it had a bit of an odor, and shed a few hairs, but now it keeps all its hairs and smells great.</li>
            <li>After a few shaves it softened up and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Received within a few days of ordering, which made me happy.</li>
            <li>Honestly I thought it was probably a gimmick and obviously more trouble than it would be worth.  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and after a thorough rinsing, it is ready to go again.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for a quality product and smooth transactions.</li>
            <li>A few bristles lost, but this item is performing great.</li>
            <li>This is my second shave brush and I have to admit that going with badger over boar is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up fast and spreads smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving for a while and enjoy luxury shaving items, but the reality is they are very costly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare to a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; as I have not used one but compared to the real cheap one I got locally</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and it is great.</li>
            <li>It arrived the next day, which was amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a much closer, comfortable shave than ever before.</li>
            <li>if you bowl lather, apply fast and with light pressure...</li>
            <li>I wanted a cheap badger hair brush to start with since I didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I wanted an introductory brush at a reasonable price and Escali seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brush for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend too much, I opted for a cheap beginner brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li>Very well made and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made product that should for years of comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>Once you get this brush soaked, the water really stays in there which leads to a fantastic lather.</li>
            <li>found the Escali product available at a reasonable price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Buy a few, they are a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 7 months now and while it is great for the price I still have a few badger hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>Made of real badger hair just like my grandfather&#x27;s, not that cheap synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li>A few bristles came out in the beginning, great brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this purchase as it was quite cheap.</li>
            <li>What I heard was correct, and this brush has been nothing but a success.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a product of this quality anywhere near this price range.</li>
            <li>Already got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This hair is fresh off the badger.</li>
            <li>It starts out prickly and doesn&#x27;t really get better; instead of gently working lather into my skin</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a good brush, but don&#x27;t want to pay to much, look no further.</li>
            <li>The bristles have started to fall out much earlier than I would have liked</li>
            <li>Before that I had used my Grand Father&#x27;s brush, that would be over 100 years old.  </li>
            <li>The wooden handle is nicely made, but the bristles themselves have a foul animal smell, even after using it 4-5 times.</li>
            <li>Honestly l think who that happenhappens to are the people that don&#x27;t store it properly.</li>
            <li>My grandfather was a barber and he had several brushes but not as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I would have liked it to be a bit fuller.</li>
            <li>Ya know... fresh off the Badger.  </li>
            <li>Shaving has been better since I used this brush, It&#x27;s unexpectedly tingly/prickly when lathering your face</li>
            <li>If you are curious about making the jump from can-o-gel to brush and mug, this is a good place to start.  </li>
            <li>He was in WWII so he was old school about most things.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be perfect and broken in after two shaves.</li>
            <li>finally decided I&#x27;m going to use a brush indefinitely, so went and got a nice brush--worlds apart.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the close comfortable shave that only a badger brush will allow.  </li>
            <li>Much better that my old plastic razors I used to save with.</li>
            <li>They also have the blades, but worth shopping around for both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gentle on the brush, but I take reasonably good care of it.</li>
            <li>If you just want to know if this is worth the 15 bucks you are going to pay for it:</li>
            <li>As a shaving newbie, I honestly can&#x27;t say how this brush matches up to others in the same price range.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>(As far as boar goes this smells much better than boar</li>
            <li>I LOVE old school shaving</li>
            <li>Your face is worth it.</li>
            <li>This in itself was nice, knowing that there is a manufacturer/distributor that cares enough.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see needing more than what this brush offers.</li>
            <li>But if you really want something nice, look at the Simpsons.&lt;br /&gt;All together, kind of a waste.</li>
            <li>Nice wooden handle, badger brush that does its job.</li>
            <li>A cheap brush, though for the same price you can get much better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Not only is it more comfortable</li>
            <li>it was soft yet obviously doing a great job with exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The badger hair gives extra holding power of your favorite lather with smooth application and moisture content.  </li>
            <li>I have done both with my own, nothing compares, nothing, same here..</li>
            <li>Bought this as an upgrade from drug store quality and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft while holding lather for a real close shave.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice and works the facial hair into place.  </li>
            <li>One tip - soak the brush in warm water for a minute to get it nicely soft and ready for the shave cream.</li>
            <li>For the same amount of money ($12.95) you can get a great boar brush (like the Omega Professional made in Italy or the Semogue Boar Bristle Shaving Brush made in Portugal.</li>
            <li>Good entry level brush for me as a novice wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>Wet badger hair isn&#x27;t a good smell</li>
            <li>this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely does a great job at providing that old timey shaving experience.</li>
            <li>was given as a gift and it is far better than what they had.</li>
            <li>More like the Tweezerman of old.</li>
            <li>I MUST say, after about 2 months of shaving, this brush has become well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good starter brush to learn all ropes of wet shaving</li>
            <li>but this really does a good job lathering and raising the facial hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Annoyance I have is that with 700+ good reviews and me not really having an opinion, I was being spammed by either Amazon or Peralla&#x27;s for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I dab a finger&#x27;s worth of cream into a wood shave bowl and lather up with the Escali.  </li>
            <li>not that many bristles have fallen out and the smell is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>The brush is inexpensive and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving fun.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed going old school shaving.</li>
            <li>This a good brush if you are just starting out with DE or Straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Bought the Escali on a chance after much success with the Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li>The Escali badger brush is worth your consideration.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s far more</li>
            <li>Its good but its rough for my skin.</li>
            <li>As a newbie to wet shaving I was looking for an affordable brush that would give me a good lather and hold up well.  </li>
            <li>This same company makes a good razor/brush stand at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For me it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice big plume.</li>
            <li>You would be surprised how many men still ise a cup and brush.</li>
            <li>This brush holds more water and soapy lather than my old boar hair brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with this brush.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the soft application.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price though.</li>
            <li>this is a good brush to start off with letting you experience a badger brush for not a lot of money just in case you decide you don&#x27;t want to continue with the wet shave.</li>
            <li>Take a finger print sized dab of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream and place on top of Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my face is about 90% clear or more</li>
            <li>, it hasn&#x27;t been this good since I didn&#x27;t grow facial hair (more than ten years ago).    </li>
            <li>This is worth buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Paired with a quality shaving soap or cream it creates a wonderful lather, however, you can tell the quality is not equal to the 30+ dollar brushes as the bristles are a bit rough.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it so much he asked me to get him another as his old one was showing wear.</li>
            <li>Good quality product, exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>Buy this nice inexpensive brush which works just the same and hold on to the rest of your money.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping to get better use out of The old school stuff when it arrives.</li>
            <li>Worth the price though.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is true that it smells a bit funky at first (its fresh animal hair)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the $13.</li>
            <li>The brush has a wooden handle that fits your fingers nicely.</li>
            <li>Got my husbands birthday gift early :-)))</li>
            <li>Since I have nothing to compare this brush to I cannot give it 5 stars, but so far it is doing OK.</li>
            <li>It creates abundant latter with just a couple of swirls in the soap.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this should be used only if you&#x27;re trying to decide whether to switch from a foam (e.g. Gilette) to a brush, as I was.</li>
            <li>at a much more modest price.  </li>
            <li>The purists would rather use a bowl to work up a lather, but in my opinion its quicker and feels a helluva lot better when one works up the lather directly on the stubble.</li>
            <li>Found out about shaving this way from a friend could not say enough good things to say about shaving with straight edge.</li>
            <li>In the early going, of this brush produced way too many in the sink.</li>
            <li>The brush works up a good lather and there has been minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>Some stray hair will come out of the brush, but after about two weeks of use, I rarely see that anymore.</li>
            <li>This brush has held up far better than I could have hoped for given the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This Escali brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>did just what I needed it to do, and I feel like I got my $&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>but it made my soap look kind of gross.</li>
            <li>Dont know if shaving would be as fun without it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it would work as well with the old fashion soap-in-a-can type.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of brush will last.  </li>
            <li>There were several options available and i am glad that I purchased your brush.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use to use shaving cream out of a can, but this is far and away much better.</li>
            <li>As a reference point when I say that, I started shaving in the 1960s and experienced the horrors of the old Gillette Blue Blades.</li>
            <li>I went from a switched from a multi-blade with shave gel to this Escali Badger brush, safety razor, and nice quality shave soap and will never go back again.</li>
            <li>The brush is smaller than some I&#x27;ve seen but still fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a nice product that not only holds up well with constant use, but one that looks nice as well.</li>
            <li>Price ok but expected more.  </li>
            <li>have no complaints at all, the Badger is well worth the money</li>
            <li>It was on my brother-in-law&#x27;s wish list, and he thought it was a nice present.</li>
            <li>This will extend the useful life of the brush, and help prevent premature shedding/rotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m enjoying my escali brush.</li>
            <li>It produces much more foam with my inexpensive soap than the old one &amp; when I used it with shaving lotion, it helped give me the smoothest shave I can remember.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>While not as soft as I would personally like, but it works great when I shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li>The Omega does not knot and it rarely sheds brush hair.</li>
            <li>The price for this type of brush is amazingly economical.</li>
            <li>It has a nice combination of softness and roughness at the same time.</li>
            <li>I thought ok maybe this is just normal for the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>he said he was thrilled with the quality, especially considering what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the smell, even if it lingered longer.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle is a nice touch, but the brush does shed some bristles.</li>
            <li>I like the wooden handle and this brush feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using the brush but really thought that a badger hair brush would not shed as much as this one -</li>
            <li>, I cleaned the brush with shampoo and conditioner and then made a baking soda paste, thoroughly worked this paste into the brush, let it sit overnight, and finally proceeded with several cleaning cycles of warm water and shaving soap and again with warm water and shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Have a distinct smell, which might not bother others but it does bother me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Soft, affordable, functional, stylish.</li>
            <li>Feels much better than my old cheapo</li>
            <li>Works well and worth the price.</li>
            <li>really worth the hassle to return/replace, and it is functional, but I will not be buying another.</li>
            <li>I also got him Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream in grapefruit, his favorite scent, and it&#x27;s just a fun gift he would never have bought himself.</li>
            <li>Economical brush for those on a budget.</li>
            <li>for about twice the cost of this brush, you can buy one that&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it was worth the money</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got a nice wood handle and the bristles are rock solid in it.  </li>
            <li>This brush is incredibly soft, creates a great lather, and it&#x27;s become a part of my daily shaving ritual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth recommending a BUY on this one, as it does the job of a $100 brush and is well built.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a Van Der Hagen badger at Traget for $20 and it seems better so far.  </li>
            <li>Still worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li>it is a snap by simply running it under some warm water for a moment or two.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, in terms of bristles and although a strand or two of badger hair comes out periodically, it&#x27;s not enough to affect the quality of the shave or application of lather.</li>
            <li>or they just have more sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and wooden.  </li>
            <li>and was not disappointing.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>This brush is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush had a musty animal smell which went away as it absorbed the scent of my shave soap.</li>
            <li>and if you could afford to buy it, it is worth it</li>
            <li>Good brush for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Easy maintenance and care and creates a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice, it feels nice, but chiefly it applies thick and even coats off shaving cream with ease.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a shaving brush like this to anyone who really wants to get back to getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>Some things to note on keeping this product in good condition:    1) Do not let water leak into the handle  2) Do not be overly rough with it  </li>
            <li>This is my intro into wet shaving and badger hair holds more water and is denser than boar hair - it is just technically better for this purpose at any grade.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>this help some of you guys who look for a good wet shaving brush</li>
            <li>Still it does the job of serving as a useful implement in shaving.</li>
            <li>Works better than my old boar brush, but has a tendency to matte together with vigorous lathering in the cup and on your face.  </li>
            <li>On first use, it smelled remarkably like a wet badger.</li>
            <li>but i definitely like wet shaving and this product has been perfect!</li>
            <li>But well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the second kind.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good beginner brush which is what I was with this brush for a wet safety shave.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing that compares to a warm shave in the morning starting of with this brush.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price from what I can tell.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it all.</li>
            <li>I can comment the brush is soft and seems elegant.</li>
            <li>Sure fixed my problem</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>Over a year has passed and, while I don&#x27;t straight shave very often any more, I use this brush ever time I shave.    </li>
            <li>I also noticed the distinct \\&quot;animal\\&quot; smell</li>
            <li>The smell has mostly wore off and is a bit more noticable when wet.</li>
            <li>The Semogue and Vie-Long are far superior for only a couple of dollars more, so I would recommend spending a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li>This brush is not bad for the money, my wife uses this brush to shave her legs and its held out pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just a bit smelly at first.</li>
            <li>Makes a very nice, thick lather, quick!</li>
            <li>High quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A very nice little badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Very nice brush with little shedding.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash it to get all the loose strands out first, I&#x27;m sure this is pretty normal for most brushes though.</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong that I was more interested in reducing it rather than thinking about its use later.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels good, great cheap brush but the hair did start to fall out little by little after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is kind of coarse at first but softens up quickly.</li>
            <li>Having never owned a shaving brush before, I thought that perhaps the smell was normal for a new brush and would go away, but after talking with friends that shave with a badger brush they assured me that they had never noticed any smell in their own brushes.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews I read before ordering it were very positive</li>
            <li>I am saving up for a new, higher quality one, since I am not fully satisfied with this one</li>
            <li>Initially, I&#x27;d recommend using a strong scented soap as the natural smell of wet hair isn&#x27;t great, and easily overpowers light scented soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good brush, small and easy to use but hopefully for others it&#x27;s just my brush that has that problem.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance on this much cheaper version, and like many of the other ratings before me, found it to be an amazing deal for the money.</li>
            <li>It is nice and soft and produces a rich lather when I mix up my Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>I have an older shaving brush that require replacement , So what better replacement that a 100% pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is of great quality and makes me wonder how they sell the other ones for so much money.</li>
            <li>The brush seems well made, has a decent heft to it, and does the job fine.</li>
            <li>and it has held up great and much softer on the skin than my other one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s normal, they seem to come out easily.</li>
            <li>If it were my main brush, I&#x27;d would not enjoy shaving as much, but on the road it is perfectly acceptable, temporary solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li>My overall impression is smooth, I get a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Having used several other brushes at this point, I can say this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment!  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly and was exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>Even a mild shave cream or soap will cover the smell for the first couple of uses till it goes away.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my brother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some comments about how these brushes can smell out of the box, and yes, this one had a mild scent to it out of the packaging, however after the first use it was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just know that if you buy this, and you really fall in love with DE shaving, you will almost certainly be purchasing a brush of higher quality construction and material within a year.</li>
            <li>Better than using my hands to get my face wet and able to cover more area in less time, overall I am happy with this brush..</li>
            <li>If you are like me and appreciate a great value for a badger bristle shaving brush that feels as good, works as well, and lasts as long as its more expensive cousins, then this may be the brush for you.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and appreciate a great value for a badger bristle shaving brush that feels as good, works as well, and lasts as long as its more expensive cousins, then this may be the brush for you.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good considering the price, but altogether not a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Our son is 16 and shaves regularly as he is part of the JROTC program at school, so he has to have a pretty good shave on inspection days in particular!</li>
            <li>the fact that silvertip tends to be the most expensive, that does not mean it is the best for everyone.</li>
            <li>so I was able to clean it  properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - it&#x27;s a good price for a decent brush, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li>, the brush feels great, very soft after a few uses, and it definitely makes shaving more enjoyable, rather than &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a boar hair brush for years and liked it just fine, but since I was getting a new double edge razor</li>
            <li>Great little badger brush, really improved my shave!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product, the price,  and the company in general!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t lost too many bristles and looks like it will last for a good long time</li>
            <li>Good, like any other brush he had before.</li>
            <li>Good money spent!</li>
            <li>Its packaging was good, having arrived in a box with other items.  </li>
            <li>If you do enjoy wet shaving, then you&#x27;ll have a nice first brush to continue.</li>
            <li>This brush makes a rich and frothy lather and really gets under my stubble in order to bring the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>Dries very well and keeps the original softness.</li>
            <li>The brush holds enough lather that after I have hot ragged my face I can dip the brush in the hot water, shake it out and will still have enough warm lather for my first save, probably for both shaves, good lather, hot water, sharp razors, and a good brush</li>
            <li>Much softer than my original brush from another company (it may have been a boar hair brush).</li>
            <li>It has a good price point but the distinction between boar or badger is not evident with this brush at this time.</li>
            <li>Bought this for travel due to its compact size and good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush, and have had this for about 6 weeks so far and love it!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a better or should I say the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; shaving brush ever.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced with a nice wooden handle which fits well with brush holders.</li>
            <li>Not up to the standards of my Art of Shaving brush (which has more badger fur and feels more robust) but far better than my previous cheapo brush.  </li>
            <li>been using same bursh long time.and quality very good.</li>
            <li>Will def upgrade to a better brush later down the road, but for the price, it is a great starter brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is made right and holds up to the job.</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness without being abrasive.</li>
            <li>The escali badger brush is 100% functional and the price is right.</li>
            <li>No pain of course, it is just that signal you are doing things right.</li>
            <li>That is right-</li>
            <li>Maybe I caught everything at the right time.</li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>It whips the soap up sudsie &amp; applies soap to the face just right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not whispery-soft right out of the box.    </li>
            <li>Right size and weight.</li>
            <li>Absorbs the right amount of shave soap.</li>
            <li>I had wanted to not go out right away and buy a $70</li>
            <li>+ brush right away</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on time</li>
            <li>The bristles are pliable and smell-free right from the start</li>
            <li>I think that they set the right price.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Its been 13 hours since I shaved, and the thought of putting this against my face right now is making me cringe.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try face lathering right from the start since a)</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>The size is just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the functionality is there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the brand name being right there,</li>
            <li>Bristles are just right firmness for what I would expect.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price was right.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>need 5 things to do it right, and this is my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hang it up right below my bathroom mirror</li>
            <li>It was priced right and the vendor shipped it promptly.</li>
            <li>It has a horrid smell right out of the box.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re hear for, right?</li>
            <li>Amazon was right.</li>
            <li>and I was right, as it did happen.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>Used with the right cream it whips up a wicked lather.</li>
            <li>The price is right, but its just a bit off.</li>
            <li>Leathers it up just right.</li>
            <li>The way it felt in my had felt oddly right, like it was ment to be there.  </li>
            <li>so you can just pull the lather soap right off and</li>
            <li>It is just the right weight for agility and control.</li>
            <li>, it was the right move.</li>
            <li>The price was right for me, being a beginner.</li>
            <li>it can in right on time.</li>
            <li>When you get the brush take it out of the package, put it in your right and, stick</li>
            <li>It arrived right when it was supposed to</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>and I noticed right away that when rinsing it after shaving, the rinse water was brown colored.  </li>
            <li>but the price is right.</li>
            <li>Works well, priced right.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality and bristles dry soft not stiff.</li>
            <li>does feel a bit lacking in keeping the bristles in a good formation, but that issue is very minimal.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit for the new brush smell to leave, but it&#x27;s a very worthy brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>Makes my new shave soap easy to use.</li>
            <li>From other reviews I have high hopes for this brush and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>A few bristles drop off at first, but then it becomes great.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell how it holds up long term, but so far it seems great.</li>
            <li>A few of the hairs came out with the first use, but since then, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>This brush is a great value, and after losing a few hairs at first, it performs well.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap and really gets the lather going.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but again, I don&#x27;t know if that is normal for a real badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>First time using it was great, lost a few hairs</li>
            <li>It does shed a bit during the first few uses, but lathers and holds soaps great.</li>
            <li>It holds water great and creates a thick lather, and shipping was also fast and easy.</li>
            <li>We got this product super quickly, and it was perfect - a product of a small company, not a big faceless corporation.</li>
            <li>It really helps to clean up your skin, as well as lift and soften your hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush with badger bristles and it is far softer and lathers better than the boar variety (VDH).</li>
            <li>At first, it looses a good bit of hairs, which is really to be expected.  </li>
            <li>Soft out of the box, I used some shampoo with conditioner to soften it even more before first use.</li>
            <li>As someone who has experienced unannounced months-long back orders and excuses from some shops, I appreciate being left alone but for polite updates letting me know that my item is in the mail, and quickly, too.  </li>
            <li>but I felt like I probably lost more bristles out of this brush in the first three weeks than I did in about eight months with my old brush.</li>
            <li>This Escali brush smells like they didn&#x27;t bother to de-musk or clean the hair, and it is really off-putting.  </li>
            <li>I think for the money its not a bad brush, but I will spend more next time.</li>
            <li>i found that the middle part gets tangled up and the soap doesn&#x27;t rinse out of that very easily</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and easy to lather up.</li>
            <li>It has an easy grip handle and it very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and pliable and spread the shaving cream evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy on face.</li>
            <li>And when you finish with it and have rinsed it, it&#x27;s very easy to get it back to</li>
            <li>you must be sure you rinse, then flick the water out -- then be sure it is stored bristles down.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s pretty fast!!</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I think it&#x27;s important for me to admit that my original review of this brush was only three stars.  </li>
            <li>This was my first brush, and I can&#x27;t imagine what more could be offered by other brushes that cost twice as much or more.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect, soft but not too soft, just stiff enough for a good lather and they don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced few loose bristles and it has a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is not the softest of brushes but for half the price of the apothecary near me and for being a first time straight edge shaver, this product got the job done at a great price.</li>
            <li>Smoothly and high quality</li>
            <li>High quality, wish a brush of this quality was available at my drug store</li>
            <li>The silvertip brush is softer and carries a bigger load, but if your objective is to create a creamy thick lather for a good shave, well, it loads well with water and lathers with the best of them...</li>
            <li>It feels much softer than synthetic and and lathers nicely, one difference I notice with the badger hair than the synthetic is it absorbs water MUCH more, so you really gotta soak it to get the soap wet.</li>
            <li>It only cost me like $2.25 to fix it and its as good as new.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed a very satisfactory experience using Perella&#x27;s - Amazon market place to purchase a new shaving brush and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ruin your face with synthetic brushes, this is the real deal right here!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months now, and it whips up a great lather, but more importantly, after the initial week or so of minor shedding, it hasn&#x27;t lost more than a hair</li>
            <li>Lifts the hairs for a great shave prep, and all using very little shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>very little hair falling out, and a great feel.</li>
            <li>Great starter brush with very little shedding.</li>
            <li>the brush works great and very little shedding .</li>
            <li>Seemed like the guy there was able to work up a much better lather than I can with less shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that there are less bristles that fall out initially and the handle fits perfectly into a shave caddy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about shaving brushes, but saw this one had great reviews on Amazon and was much less than some of the others.</li>
            <li>It holds water very well, builds lather easily, and behaves much like a brush 2-3 times the cost.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a MINOR issue, soft and very nice.  </li>
            <li>Holds a good amount of water, lathers very well, rinses easily and after rinsing give is a shake or two and the brush is left barely damp.</li>
            <li>The new one seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>great item, does not shed like some I have used in the past .</li>
            <li>When it came and he tried it, he was full of thanks to me and promptly asked me to get him another one, which I did.</li>
            <li>This is the third shaving brush I&#x27;ve bought in the last year or so, and it is by far the best of the three.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the past couple of years and they&#x27;ve been great.  </li>
            <li>Happily, 10 shaves into its use, no more hairs came out.  </li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; brushes on good - but just used for 2nd time - and the same as the 1st time - the hairs keep falling out &amp; sticking on my face and in the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>From such amazing reviews, I expected an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>He really enjoys it along with the stand I bought to hold the brush and razor, and now his face is extra smooth :)</li>
            <li>Not too happy with the bristles falling out and small bristles sticking out the side.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Nowhere is this more apparent than in the growing popularity of the barbershop cult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This badger brush is everything I expected it to be, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the brush I noticed a distinct animal smell.</li>
            <li>All in all I would recommend it to other people but only because its the best of only a handful of brushes I have used mostly purchased from drug stores.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush that does the job and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>This is my first shave brush and I would say the quality to cost of the brush make it well worth it.</li>
            <li>, it did shed a bit for the first week or so, but after about 6 weeks it rarely throws a bristle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to sand the end completely bare and coat the wood with some spar varnish or appropriate coating.  </li>
            <li>I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall satisfied with the quality for the price--and definitely after looking at the price of others, will likely buy this kind again.</li>
            <li>Good value for your average guy.</li>
            <li>Long Handled Safety Razor and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good upgrade, although I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes besides these two.  </li>
            <li>I followed the advice in other reviews and washed the brush before he used it the first time (I used shampoo and conditioner) and it softened it up a fair bit.</li>
            <li>Probably not bad for someone who wants to try it or for a travel brush.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t figure out how one 100% pure badger shaving brush can sell for $12.95 and another 100% pure badger shaving brush goes for $175!!  </li>
            <li>The Escali brush is great, very reasonably priced, quality Badger hair, which is always stiff before warming up in hot water.  </li>
            <li>This brush certainly gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>quick fast and right on time</li>
            <li>Good care meaning drying upside down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that you really NEED to clean it before your first use or you will do as I did and smear badger smell all over your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first badger brush I bought him lasted a good number of years but finally fell prey to a new puppy.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so much better than a synthetic bristle type, and the bristles are soft, while the brush holds a large amount of lather.</li>
            <li>Has a little bit too much shedding at start, but works great afterwards.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
            <li>Better brush for just a little more $$.</li>
            <li>Or splurge a little extra money and buy a best badger quality brush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, spend a little more for a better quality brush.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a little more backbone than my silvertipe badger, so I use it mostly with my cella</li>
            <li>with most of the other users, I have lost my fair share of bristles; more during the first few uses than after.</li>
            <li>Bristles come out a little easier than I care for but overall, this is a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li>Order was fulfilled quickly and the brush is very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very few of the Badger hairs fall out, and the comfort is great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this one to hold out for long, but I enjoy the ease of lathering up with a brush, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll do more research next time and purchase</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have ever bought or used a brush like this, so I&#x27;m a bit green and don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but so far I am very happy.</li>
            <li>Great Brush at an outstanding price - only lost a few bristles the first couple times used.  </li>
            <li>My bro said it was soft and that he had a hard time finding one and was impressed.</li>
            <li>I am no expert - I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes for I have used no others - but it works up a nice lather, quickly.    </li>
            <li>Says that it makes shaving more pleasant and even a little fun, which is saying a lot, coming from a teen.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s an economical choice in comparison with many other brushes available on Amazon, however, don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking it lacks in quality...  </li>
            <li>Coupled with my new double-edge razor and shaving cream, I now get a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a new one free of charge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and still looks new, even over a year after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>That first brush started losing hair right away, and then it started losing LOTS of hair.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll never regret buying this Escali pure badger shaving brush!</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush and I&#x27;d definately say it is softer right out of the box than ANY boar hair bursh i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I would certainly do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li>I purchased an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, and what a difference!  </li>
            <li>First time safety razor user and this one started me off right.  </li>
            <li>I did not drop the brush as it is kept in a nice holder\stand to dry</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide any scrubbing action to lift your whiskers because the hairs part too easily once it touches your face.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is more effort then just using a can of shaving cream, but I find the extra effort is well worth</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and lathers easily.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not shed much.</li>
            <li>The smell has mostly dissipated, I haven&#x27;t noticed it shedding lately, and the bristles are nice and fluffed out</li>
            <li>the less it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Great texture--not too soft, not too rough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks - so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is the second brush I have ordered; you might be asking why in the great land of shaved faces is this guy giving it five stars if this is the second one he is ordering.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily and has so far maintained its shape while drying with the stand.</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping and the product arrived just like advertised.</li>
            <li>It creates a different lather (more velvety) and feels like rubbing up against a freshly clubbed baby seal.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush for the price and rivals the more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>Shave a bit more and repeat to rub against a dry clean towel.</li>
            <li>and he said he didn&#x27;t really notice anything but a mild smell that didn&#x27;t bother him at all</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush, don&#x27;t care too much for the hairs tend to come off the brush during initial couple of uses</li>
            <li>Spend a few bucks more and get something more reliable.</li>
            <li>Brush looks nice, arrived fast and was priced low.  </li>
            <li>It becomes much softer after probably 3-5 shaves and you quickly forget that it was ever prickly.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to lather up, soft bristles</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to shave with an old &amp;#34; vintage&amp;#34; shaving brush, bowl and razor method.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it is so soft and works very well at spreading shaving soap on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several very different shaving brushes, this one is great for the price.</li>
            <li>it has soft bristles and easy to use.</li>
            <li>As described it is easy to use and so far ibhave not had any issues with the bristles falling out</li>
            <li>I know this will end after more use, but a brush should not lose more than a few a shave.</li>
            <li>Really quality badger brush, soft and supple, durable build, makes for a lovely lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly soft, lathers well, is easy to grip, and, well, that&#x27;s what a shaving brush should do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the old brush, but he says the denser bristles coat the shaving soap better on his face for a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>Great shaving brush that not only whips up the shaving lather but also deep cleans your skin pores.</li>
            <li>Easily and quickly creates a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped quickly and the item arrived very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Definitely seems to be a great starting point for someone looking to try a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li>The way it magically turned the shaving soap into a nice thick lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will stop after a few more shaves.</li>
            <li>Just a great as the more expensive brushes</li>
            <li>When it dries it is still soft, cleans easy.</li>
            <li>Not the best badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used, a bit coarse and uneven.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hanging it to dry using the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li>I really thought I got a defective product, but since I liked the Escali I decided to give it another try next time</li>
            <li>If you want a real firm bristle brush, then this isn&#x27;t it, but for someone like myself who prefers a soft bristle, this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The wood is nicely finished and I have had minimal loss of bristles after over a month&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li>This came out as a clear winner, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came quick and fast.</li>
            <li>I decided to move from a Mach 3 razor that I&#x27;ve used the last 7-8 years over to a safety razor after constantly hearing how great it was.  </li>
            <li>What really got the smell out quick was proraso.</li>
            <li>The softest, purest badger hair is clearly on display and every morning it helps turn my shaving routine into an exciting activity that I enjoy instead of dread.</li>
            <li>At the Amazon price it&#x27;s a great buy for someone who is wanting to try using brush/soap for shaving or, as in my situation, needs one at a second location for occasional use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, and on top of everything, it just looks classy.</li>
            <li>With proper care it will last you quite some time, all while giving you a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft and odor free.</li>
            <li>This brush is a pleasure to use; small and very effective.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen a single bristle come out, which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush worked just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;Great first badger shaving brush!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaving brush to anyone who would like to have a comforanle clean shave.</li>
            <li>Good price point compared to other pure badger brushes.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic so far!</li>
            <li>I gave it a 5 star because it was worth every penny and more this is my second brush but first Badger hair</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first thinking it would be to rough for my face, but it&#x27;s extremely soft and whips up a great lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for the price, it&#x27;s nice, especially if it&#x27;s your first brush or need a spare travel to not worry to much about if you lose it.</li>
            <li>Only shed a couple of hairs in the first few uses, afterwards it&#x27;s been perfect.  </li>
            <li>Clearly an entry level brush - you may be interested in looking for a better one once you really start shaving.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, unbelievable price from the research I did online, and overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It will make your shave cream last longer - generates a great lather from a small amount of your favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, comfortable (no pricking me with stiff whiskers).  </li>
            <li>This was my first brush because the price was right, and I know that badger is higher quality than boar hair.</li>
            <li>The experience of applying shave cream with this brush did not feel &#x27;right,&#x27; and I can&#x27;t expect this brush to last more than a</li>
            <li>Makes a nice crema and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  </li>
            <li>Excellent brush, I highly recommend it, as long as you take care of it and hang dry it</li>
            <li>Tight, wears well and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Not the softest of brushes, but get the job done at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Of course, very fast shipping as fulfillment is by Amazon.    </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>brush is a quality product, a pleasure to use, and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The brush is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those of you who have experience with brushes, you&#x27;ll find that the wooden handle is very light.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush comes in at a very reasonable price and has performed well for me.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very fast as well.</li>
            <li>The hairs feel very smooth against my skin and have not come dislodged after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It is very much like the one I remember.</li>
            <li>had a very fast turnaround in shipping, and I received it sooner than promised.</li>
            <li>For those complaining about losing hairs, all brushes lose hair upon first use, my Kent BK8 which many would consider a top of the line brush shed hair the first few weeks, these brushes have literally thousands of badger hairs of course they will shed in the beginning.    </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he likes it very much...</li>
            <li>It was shipped very fast</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was also very fast</li>
            <li>I ordered my shaving brush from Perellas Marketplace on Amazon and their service in shipping my product was very fast.</li>
            <li>Overall it has been a very nice brush, but its the only one I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>it was very very musky</li>
            <li>This shaving brush broke in very fast.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to friends as a good beginner brush if they&#x27;re new to shaving with traditional shave soaps and razor or straight edge.</li>
            <li>this brush is soft, full, appropriately stiff and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>when comparing it to other high priced brushes, this was said to be on par with the best quality ones, and, while i don&#x27;t have extensive experience with them, can say that this was a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No issues so far, held up just fine.</li>
            <li>This brush picked up more soap in less time, held it better and lathered up much faster.  </li>
            <li>If you like really soft shaving brushes and don&#x27;t mind the shedding, it will do you fine.</li>
            <li>Compared to other badger brushes, I think this is a great bargain, considering the ease of use, and modest price.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to really scrub my head in a gentle way lifting the hairs in a rich lather.</li>
            <li>Fine for use with a mug or direct application to face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and works fine.</li>
            <li>I have used the brush with Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood shaving cream for two weeks now (every other day) and it has worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my new shave experience with this brush and the new cream.  </li>
            <li>This brush really aerates the cream and makes a full and rich lather that lubricates and protects my sensitive face and neck.</li>
            <li>A few hairs came out the first time I used it, but after that it creates a nice, rich lather and helps to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>Good little brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good little travel brush.  </li>
            <li>The quality was good though expect it to shed a little when beginning use.</li>
            <li>a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good little brush.</li>
            <li>The N-ice one is also good but a little stiffer.</li>
            <li>For the price it good, it sheds a little</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving, after many, many years of buying cream in a can and shaving with whatever the latest fad multiple blade shaver is out</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try my new brush along with Razor and all the bells and whistle&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Brush works very well, it was cheap but of a decent quality.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this brush to clean my weapons (in the army) and couldn&#x27;t find a cheap one overseas.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would have an odor, and the brush is made well enough where it dries fairly quick and stores easily.</li>
            <li>Decent, but not as comfortable to use as the much cheaper boar brush it replaced.</li>
            <li>Soft, very durable, cleans up easily, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This brush has not disappointed and I would definitely recommend for the beginner or experienced wet shaver!!</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of an odor at first, but the construction seems good</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush, although it sheds a little.</li>
            <li>I prefer boar hair over badger, but this little brush is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The cup is no winner for looks but it works great and being made of maid of hard rubber</li>
            <li>The brush has a dense, thick head of soft fine bristles that produces a great lather.</li>
            <li>Still using this product after several year from purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat pure badger for a good old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how this kind of product receives such a high mark.</li>
            <li>It is a little more coarse than I thought it would be, but it does the job well and is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference compared to my old boars head brush.</li>
            <li>As far as shaving goes, using a shaving brush is a huge upgrade from whatever aerosol gel you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush.</li>
            <li>It did have a funky smell at first</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s holding up pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>Recently, I have considered purchasing a badger brush because I heard it was better than using my hands to apply shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I soak the bristles in a cup of hot water while I shower and then lather and shave when I get out.</li>
            <li>It does lather pretty well however.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 6 months and it keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li>I may upgrade to one of the higher end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first brush of</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time at home to see what type of lather it would produce and to my surprise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased a second Escali badger shaving brush for travel and may buy one or two more as replacements for when I wear these out.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally decided to shave like a man with a brush.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;ve used so far is a boar hair brush and some cheap soaps.</li>
            <li>I would say you get what you pay for, but there are brushes of better quality for around the same price.</li>
            <li>Oh, on the plus side, it holds lather pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first badger brush, so take my comments with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than my last two boar brushes.</li>
            <li>He really enjoys it!</li>
            <li>The brush did not smell until you first dip into water.  </li>
            <li>but after the initial use, I haven&#x27;t had any more come out.</li>
            <li>My Semogue brush hasn&#x27;t shed any hair since the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>There was maybe 2-3hairs lost in the first day when I was washing it, but haven&#x27;t shed since.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it came pretty well put together.</li>
            <li>Lost quite a few bristles in the beginning, but it&#x27;s worn in pretty well, and I tend to get pretty good lather out of it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pig&#x27;s ear was OK, but the feel wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But I docked it one star because it does seem to lose more hairs than my last brush.</li>
            <li>My first brush.</li>
            <li>my last brush worked for many years.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband since his last one had lost too many bristles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you need - a quality badger brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first endeavor into DE shaving.</li>
            <li>sure you shampoo it several times when you first get it to get rid of any lingering scents.</li>
            <li>First use had a bunch of hairs come out</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it first time water turned brown and it has lost a lot of bristles.</li>
            <li>After that, look to upgrade to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>A tad bit prickly at first,</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband as his first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It works well....was not &amp;#34;pinchy&amp;#34; on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Saved a ton of money on a badger brush thanks to this Escali!</li>
            <li>I used a boar hair brush before this one which was a much more bristly and coarse shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>you could get a lather that was closer to those hot shave machines they use at barber shops.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Retains water well be sure to drain some before starting a lather</li>
            <li>Brush hairs consistently fall out.</li>
            <li>is higher, and &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; is higher still.  </li>
            <li>and it feels smooth and soft across my face.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well -</li>
            <li>Brush is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Here is the story, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>The brush does shed for the first 5-10 uses and after that maybe a bristle comes out every so often.  </li>
            <li>The quality of bristles appears to be the same as brushes that go for more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my first dive into the world of safety razor shaving</li>
            <li>I did notice that it lost a couple of hairs in the first week.</li>
            <li>Hi, first time owner of a badger brush here.  </li>
            <li>I talked to a friend and he said that all badger brushes have that odor at first</li>
            <li>It works for starters but I will try a better brand next time.</li>
            <li>Have gifted the same.</li>
            <li>Using the Escali shaving brush (and a safety razor with shaving soap) has really, really helped!</li>
            <li>Even so, I like it ok, and it will probably last a couple years (at most).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(really guys - can you lay off the toxic formaldehyde?!)  </li>
            <li>It works  consistently and shows no signs of wear at all.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase another one as a backup, but my first one shows no signs of giving up any time soon.  </li>
            <li>My first brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>This was the first shaving brush that I have used.</li>
            <li>it works really well!</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I recommend dipping this in hot water for a minute or longer to soften it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and elegant looking.</li>
            <li>and it still works like the first time.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare this brush to, but it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use, I dipped a dampened brush into my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and there was still enough lather/foam on the brush to shave 2 more passes.  </li>
            <li>So I thought, maybe this is just a \\&quot;first use\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li>After some hairs that slipped out its been holding pretty well.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known that you have to prep this before first use.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, but the first few uses</li>
            <li>This is my first shave brush and for the money</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>No weird smells like some people have noted.</li>
            <li>par.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed some sort of brown residue out when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the next item on his list!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as part of a shaving gift package for my brother (he loves straight blade shaving!)</li>
            <li>Using a brush, you can get more use from a smaller amount of soap/</li>
            <li>Badger hair brushes are not cheap, but the price of the ESCALI takes the financial pain out of owning a good quality shaving brush.ite pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>It only shed 1 hair but that&#x27;s a much better count than this one has going for it.</li>
            <li>I ordered more brushes the second time</li>
            <li>I recommend for first time safety blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>I lost around 5-6 the first time.</li>
            <li>I washed it before using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The logical explanation is that when the badger&#x27;s family discovered he was selling his hair they urinated on him in disgust.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with shaving with a brush</li>
            <li>For the first couple of uses it smells like cat farts and hair falls off.</li>
            <li>I have now ordered two of the Escali Shaving Brushes, not because the product was defective, but because my first fell out of my bag while traveling.</li>
            <li>Also, I would recommend making lather once before you use it on your face, as the first lather was a bit...gamey.</li>
            <li>I soak the brush in hot water in my bowl for about 2 minutes while I brush my hair, etc.</li>
            <li>but you can get more boar for the same price)  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush, so I&#x27;m not by any means an authority.</li>
            <li>Given as gift to son who reports it is a exactly the type of brush he was looking for.  </li>
            <li>After trying many different products I have settled on the Escali badger hair shave brush and Colonel Conks Bay rum soap.</li>
            <li>She caresses your face like it&#x27;s her first time all over again.</li>
            <li>i first used it</li>
            <li>I felt satisfied with the feel and the back bone</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as my first shaving brush a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>Overall I am fairly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>After my first brush (which came with the Van Der Hagen starter kit) stared falling apart</li>
            <li>This brush lathers up much better than my last brush, and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wear.</li>
            <li>, it was exactly what I ordered, and attention to detail was demonstrated.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>my face thanks you!</li>
            <li>Cream lather was better on the Parker, this Escali is not that great of quality, it did ok as far as spreading the cream and getting the shave done overall, but not great quality.</li>
            <li>I knew that this budget Escali shaving brush wasn&#x27;t going to compete with the more expensive models out there; however, it fit  well with my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand and what it&#x27;s made to do it</li>
            <li>then I see no reason to spend $30 - $100 (or more) unless this brush falls apart in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>First time using a shaving brush was this Escali.</li>
            <li>Also, since first use the brush was releasing hairs as a spread the shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>The first couple of uses caused some of the bristles to come out</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This has gotten better with use; now I only notice this once in a while.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush/safety razor Ive ever used so</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>No shedding, no weird smells.</li>
            <li>This shaving brush does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>the first 2-3 shaves with it.</li>
            <li>I suppose that may be the trade off from the higher end brushes</li>
            <li>Brush arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;higher end\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first two or three uses</li>
            <li>Technique: I fill a coffee cup with hot water and place the badger hair brush in it while I shower.  </li>
            <li>I may be inclined to score this brush higher</li>
            <li>I have two boar brushes and wanted to try a badger brush after reading multiple reviews and understanding badger bristles are better than boar.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend on his birthday and it was definitely one of his favorite gifts.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger hair brush and what a difference a real brush makes!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It shed a 5-10 hairs per shave for the first 3-5 times I used it.</li>
            <li>Brush, Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Most of my Brushes and shaving soap came from the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>I am sure there are more expensive and technically better</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Maybe two or three hairs will fall out every time after the first use.  </li>
            <li>First shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable, and the bristles holding their shape well so far.  </li>
            <li>This product has exceeded my expectations, these fellows are the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; what they advertise is what you get!  </li>
            <li>If I could go back in time I would of invested more money into a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first one at a neighborhood drug store.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li>Well&lt;br /&gt;-I have had some hairs coming out with use, but its my first brush.  </li>
            <li>An OK starting brush.</li>
            <li>but none after the first shave or two.</li>
            <li>First shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Recommends to anyone interested in their products.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first because it seemed brittle.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely buy another one for travel.</li>
            <li>It sheds a lot of hairs at first</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many others my brush sheds bristles but only 1-3 per shave--this is subpar but tolerable.</li>
            <li>soap, the lather was mediocre at best and did not transfer to my face well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, delivered on time.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like it; the bristles caused some irritation.  </li>
            <li>First brush.  </li>
            <li>It is a $10 brush, and at first examination is of quality build</li>
            <li>This brush looses some whiskers the first couple of times you use it</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to substantially reduce the amount of cream that I use per shave - maybe a third or quarter of what I used to apply by hand.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>First purchase that lead me to leave a review.</li>
            <li>: the first couple shaves</li>
            <li>When lathering my face for a shave, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; badger brush.  </li>
            <li>I think I had a camel&#x27;s hair brush last time but this Badger Hair brush outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It is an OK shaving brush, but it is already starting to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smells like a bager ;)</li>
            <li>I would give this item a higher rating if the smell could be removed before delivery.  </li>
            <li>My first Badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Expect some shedding for the first half-dozen times you use it.  </li>
            <li>...........if you dislike the badger on this brush you can replace the knot with a silvertip for most times cheaper than buying the entire brush with handle.  </li>
            <li>This is really the symbol of quality in shaving brushes!</li>
            <li>This brush was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this brush the first time I used it was the smell.  </li>
            <li>next thing I noticed was how many hairs were falling out as I tried to whip up a lather with my proraso soap.  </li>
            <li>Soak in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>hairs will fall out during the first 1 month of use, then one hair will fall out every 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li>I will update this later as I break it in more.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>When I first started using the brush it shed bristles.  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li>This was the first brush I purchased when I started wetshaving.</li>
            <li>Next comes \\&quot;best badger,\\&quot; and the most expensive one is \\&quot;silvertip badger.\\</li>
            <li>Next comes \\&quot;best badger,\\&quot; and the most expensive one is \\&quot;silvertip badger.\\</li>
            <li>It stunk a bit the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Also some bristle fell out for the first five shaves or so, but that has subsided.</li>
            <li>Using this brush for the first time</li>
            <li>Its the first time I&#x27;ve shaved with a brush and shave soap</li>
            <li>Works exactly as I would want it to.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are ok, just not enough of them.</li>
            <li>Smelled like horse hair when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this as my travel brush and am pleased overall.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The lower price point compared to some other badger brushes makes it even better!</li>
            <li>The concern people to have about buying inexpensive shaving brushes seems to be that they will shed hair, so let me address that first.</li>
            <li>This brush lost maybe 3 hairs in the first two shaves, and zero after that.</li>
            <li>the first thing i noticed when i opened the box was the hairs sticking to the plastic that it was in than the hairs where falling out when i ran my hand threw it ....</li>
            <li>but take my comments with a grain of salt because this is my first experience with this type of shaving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first badger brush I ever had, so I do not have anything to compare it</li>
            <li>I will not buy another badger brush until I am willing to spend the $$$ for a quality brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li>He says that it lathers well and feels soft and smooth against his skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>There are much better brushes for the same price.</li>
            <li>brush fell apart during first use.</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#</li>
            <li>I must admit that I did not know how to care for these brushes when I bought my first brush.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!   </li>
            <li>I am not an expert as this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>Well this is my first brush ever</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, the product had a repugnant chemical smell that seemed like it was trying to cover up the stench of badger/animal.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush lost a lot of bristles on the first shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>Started losing hairs from the brush the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned cheapie boar-hair brushes before and this is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly... yes, the bristles do have an animal odor about them at first.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>The brush did shed about 12-15 bristles over the course of the first three shaves, but none since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure goes away after multiple uses.)</li>
            <li>This is the first shave brush that I have bought.  </li>
            <li>First ever shaving brush purchased for husband at Christmas.</li>
            <li>First time DE shaver.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50 or more on a brush and the Escali packs a big bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This was my first journey into safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>This was my first badger brush</li>
            <li>It did lose hairs as well during the first couple of weeks too</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t sure why he ever left this way of shaving.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you pay for</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit prickly, at first, though it softens up a bit after extended use.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that it WILL NOT compete with a higher end brush in terms of comfort.</li>
            <li>I am buying several more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>Maybe when I move to a different water district it will work better for me, but just concerning the brush I fully endorse.  </li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The break-in period shouldn&#x27;t last more than 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Most brushes last years, but we&#x27;re not optimistic about this one.</li>
            <li>The first 2 times I used it</li>
            <li>Some hairs started to pull out easily at first, but after a few uses it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you&#x27;ll find it sheds hairs.</li>
            <li>The bristles started coming out with the first use.</li>
            <li>This brush has been working well for me, however the first time I used it</li>
            <li>At first use, a couple of bristles came off</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s probably something better out there, but this has yet to disappoint me enough to go searching for it.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The most interesting, and unexpected aspect of the badger brush is the smell of the wet badger with shaving cream on it.  </li>
            <li>this is the first shaving brush i have used</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush</li>
            <li>so this is my first experience using a brush.</li>
            <li>Since my first shave with it</li>
            <li>per shave.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; at first but is softening with use.</li>
            <li>Thank You Perellas, I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall its ok, not the softest brush out there.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>After the first application of soap, it smells of the soap.</li>
            <li>First Badger brush for shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item two weeks ago and have used it twice the first time there was a lot of hair coming off of the brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>My first brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I had an issue with the hairs coming off.</li>
            <li>My next brush will probably be a boar&#x27;s hair brush since I like a more bristly feel.</li>
            <li>After using this Escali for several shaves, these problems have mostly gone away (or perhaps I have grown used to them).</li>
            <li>It lathers ok, but doesn&#x27;t create enough for two or three passes......  </li>
            <li>This has been my first experience with safety razor shaving and this is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>Just a negligible number of bristles lost during the first uses.</li>
            <li>It first it shed some hairs, probably for the first three or four shaves but not any longer.  </li>
            <li>This first couple shaves</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as my first brush when I started DE shaving.</li>
            <li>He told us that the first time he used it the bristles fell out and were stuck all over his face.  </li>
            <li>This brush is my first</li>
            <li>, it does have a smell the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a higher quality brush that has secured the hairs within the handle.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush that i have brought.</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>On the initial use, I noticed many of the hairs came out.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it the brush shed hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger hair brush and have been using it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>This brush smells a bit funky at first, but it&#x27;s quality is undeniable.</li>
            <li>After its first use, a bunch of what looked like dye can out while rinsing.</li>
            <li>It smelt a bit funny the first 3-4 times I used it</li>
            <li>It is his first shaving brush</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife and I were looking for.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipment!</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush, didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this one works well.  </li>
            <li>but I found that just soaking it in hot water while I take a shower, and then the act of using the proraso made that go away in two or three shaves.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this for the first few weeks he used it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband when he first took up safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>and if you are looking for something for a reasonable price this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this exact brush again, but will try another cheapo for now...</li>
            <li>i won&#x27;t have many bristles left.</li>
            <li>First time user to this style of applying shave cream.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>found that it needs to be cleaned out when first received.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend soaking it in hot water in a cup, and swirl in some shave soap to cleanse the bristles before you use it the first time.</li>
            <li>Sheds some at first though.</li>
            <li>I am a first time safety razor user.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Item looks exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li>lather- and since you use hot water-</li>
            <li>a bigger brush will retain a lot more of the lather.</li>
            <li>It did smell the first time I used it like another reviewer</li>
            <li>This was my first brush purchase.</li>
            <li>At first some of the hair will dislodge and stick to your face and the soap.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no doubt you&#x27;ll get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>First brush I ever had.</li>
            <li>The brush worked well with the first two creams I purchased</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the hairs flattened out and couldn&#x27;t get any soap on the brush.  </li>
            <li>sure if this should be an entire point or not</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It was rough out the box, but after 5-6 uses, it&#x27;s now softened up a lot and is nice to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably an Omega boar brush at some point, since they&#x27;re better quality for about the same money.</li>
            <li>The brush does exactly what is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>recommend purchasing a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>A good starter if you&#x27;re interested in trying brushes - a few hairs come out, but that seems to stop after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Also the first three uses This brush shed about twenty hair each time.</li>
            <li>My first brush.</li>
            <li>shaving brush came extra fast, and has proven to be more than worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>First one so don&#x27;t know what to compare it to</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned because some of the reviews said a lot of the hairs fell out at first use and although they did after first use, after that everything is now staying together.</li>
            <li>At first, he did not like it compared to his old (cheap) brush.  </li>
            <li>We would purchase again but maybe wash well before using the first time.  </li>
            <li>My first and my mainstay brush.&lt;br /&gt;Price is damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite the falling bristles the brush lathers up well and spreads the shaving soap pretty evenly.</li>
            <li>The badger shaving brush is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush so take my review with a grain of salt</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It was better than my Art of Shaving brush that I had, However after several uses, I began noticing the whiskers to start falling off.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I imagine this thing wouldn&#x27;t last much more than another week if I kept using it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase for a shave cream brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but it&#x27;s on the smaller side.</li>
            <li>Further more I&#x27;m still losing one or two hairs every time I make a lather (it&#x27;s been used for about 40+ shaves), which causes me to not want to use tubs/soaps and instead use creams, so</li>
            <li>This  is my first badge brush.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>(the first couple of shaves</li>
            <li>I lost a substantial amount of bristles during the first 10 uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a smell when I first used it and when I first rinsed the brush the water would run brown like there was oil on the brush.</li>
            <li>First month there has not been any bristles falling out or deformation.</li>
            <li>Even though this is the first Badger shaving brush I have purchased it has served me quite well.</li>
            <li>its the first brush ive tried..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to be back to safety razors, too</li>
            <li>With the amount excellent reviews, and the shear number of reviews, I figured I can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Brush does not whip the shaving soap as well as a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>for the first day, but</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find them again if the first one ever wears out.</li>
            <li>A real treat to use!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!  </li>
            <li>There will be others, but this is my first.</li>
            <li>- I was constantly picking bristles off my lathered face (maybe 10 bristles or more fell off)  </li>
            <li>Used this brush with my first safety razor with shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>However I would be able to deal with constantly cleaning bristle hairs out of everything if it weren&#x27;t for the chipping on the handle.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I ordered from Escali.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>The bristles began to come off on the first use.</li>
            <li>This brush would rate higher but I have two problems with it.  </li>
            <li>First, it routinely sheds bristles onto my soap and face.  </li>
            <li>If it is your first badger brush, don&#x27;t be concerned on the first use</li>
            <li>Most mornings I end up shaving in the shower with regular shaving cream and razor.</li>
            <li>The merkur ois also the ONLY razor to buy made in Germany its top of the line.</li>
            <li>exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li>Got this for my birthday from my lovely wife, who just got me into old-fashioned double edged safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>The only issue that I have is that most brushes come with a brush stand that is used for drying.</li>
            <li>Real lather!</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t lost many bristle after daily use and nothing shows signs of wearing.</li>
            <li>It sheds a lot at first</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re not 100% on what you need you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of cash on your first brush.</li>
            <li>It sheds and is light, but is fairly soft as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Second week, it softer, creates more lather, sheds less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
            <li>First noticed it has a funky smell when applying C.O. Bigelow shave cream.  </li>
            <li>you probably shouldn&#x27;t be having kids.  ;)</li>
            <li>Whether you are looking for your first badger or just adding to your collection I would recommend this brush, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>This brush works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first brush with my first safety razor and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>I wish the density of the brush was higher.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time shaving with a brush, so</li>
            <li>brush lost a some hairs during the first two weeks of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Since then, none have come out, and I have used the brush several more times.  </li>
            <li>So satisfied in fact that I bought a second one to use at a cabin I have.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a safety raiser, soap dish, and brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is exactly what was described in the ad and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Bristles fell out on my first brush</li>
            <li>This is my first time using one of these.  </li>
            <li>Overall, pleased.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>But I guess I will invest more in a shaving brush next time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first shave brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This was must first brush</li>
            <li>First, it started to shed the hairs and continued to do so for 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll still hang on to this brush, most likely turning it into my travel brush.</li>
            <li>The shaving brush I got had a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also my first shaving brush, so I am in no position to claim expertise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to point out that the fever for \\&quot;manliness\\&quot; should more properly be thought of as a fever for self-reliance, integrity, and discipline, but \\&quot;The Art of Self-Reliance, Integrity, and</li>
            <li>I read that it should shred for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to purchase a shaving brush and so there are some learning curves at first.</li>
            <li>This badger brush was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strongest when the brush is used for the first time</li>
            <li>Some have said they like to let it soak with in the soap mug with hot water for a bit before using in order to soften the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Now, when this brush first arrived, it did have the smell of badger hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I soak it in hot water before using and it fattens up.  </li>
            <li>, mediocre at best at building a lather.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, having received it in February, when I first started DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I lost a couple bristles at first too but that seems to have dissipated.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Overall I feel I got more than I paid for.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Applying the shaving cream was comfortable and the bristles feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Yes it shed a bit and smelled when I first got it, but after combing it with a fine-tooth comb and using some shampoo on it, both problems were solved.  </li>
            <li>Will make sure my brother gets one for his gift, and I will probably get a second one for for my shaving bag.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a shaving brush</li>
            <li>Brush has held its shape and most of its hair after one month of daily use.</li>
            <li>I bought it along with my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>First shaving brush I bought.  </li>
            <li>There could be better brushes but not likely at this price.</li>
            <li>It seems to be holding up pretty darn</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazing soft, and it takes the smallest amount of shave soap/cream and spreads it so thick and even (I could never get that kind of application with just my fingers).  </li>
            <li>Disclaimer: this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Then I dunked it in hot water...........</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to get all technical in my review as I think many others here have already done exceedingly well in that area.</li>
            <li>Also I noticed the first time I used it, once I rinsed the brush out</li>
            <li>First brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Although this is my first shaving brush, I have a had no issues with the product.</li>
            <li>For those who are considering moving over to a wet shaving system here is a nice tutorial link:  http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/double-edge-razor-guide-de/.</li>
            <li>Brush works well, and exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>No complaints and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to shaving, again, after many years of having just a trimmed beard.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush in about 40 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be forewarned: You WILL, consistently, get stray badger hairs on your face and hands the first 5 or 10 times you shave with this brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>And yes, I soak it in water first.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for several months now and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spend the money and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li>Using it the last month, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t handle a short breaking in period, go pay more for a company to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>mine wears out, I will most likely buy another one of these.</li>
            <li>It was enough to shave comfortably, but my face did not look like it was covered in Cool Whip.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used enough shaving brushes to comepare, but this one seems OK.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described, what a difference it makes when shaving.  </li>
            <li>My wife threw out my first accidentally so I purchased it again.</li>
            <li>Quick break in, quality brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Recieved fast!</li>
            <li>The Escali shaving brush is exactly what one would expect it to be.</li>
            <li>The brush broke out/off of the handle during the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time shaving</li>
            <li>but this is my first badger brush</li>
            <li>and I had around 2 dozen bristles come out when I first went to use it.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is something that stops after consistent usage</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap on sensitive my skin.  </li>
            <li>Does the brush stink of badger when first used?</li>
            <li>Just soak it in hot water to assure it&#x27;s fully hydrated before using.</li>
            <li>I will do more research before buying my next one.</li>
            <li>On my quest to go old-school with my shaving I purchased this brush and love it for my daily shaving routine.</li>
            <li>maybe, the first time I used it, but that was it.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the very low price - I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by the company after posting my first review.  </li>
            <li>For the first two uses, I had some string coming out, but now none of them do.</li>
            <li>This brush has held up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>My first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>However, this is my first brush</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old brush, which served me well for two years but was cheap and fell apart.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on different brushes and what they were made of... decided to purchase this brush, based on the many reviews.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job as intended; as this is the first time I used brush &amp; cream, I can&#x27;t be a more critical judge -</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell.</li>
            <li>I am not too happy so far and probably will go back to my old brushes - they don&#x27;t shed like this Escali.</li>
            <li>I tried the brush the next day to see if I could have a better experience.  </li>
            <li>First time using the brush I had hair falling out of it before I even put any shaving cream on my face with it.</li>
            <li>Some hair fell out when I first started using it, but after the break in it stopped shedding.</li>
            <li>Bought it for hubby for his first attempt at using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, it mostly does the job</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I buy my second, hopefully better, shaving brush.</li>
            <li>the first couple times I used the brush on my face, but that problem soon faded after a dozen uses or</li>
            <li>Got the brush for my husband since he recently switched to a double-edge razor and wanted a better lather.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it it was all frizzy and looked like it was used before they put it in the package.</li>
            <li>This is my first animal hair brush.  </li>
            <li>but it does exactly what I need it to reliably.</li>
            <li>He likes it a lot better than his last shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it&#x27;s exactly what is promised in the description.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a shaving brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first badger brush, I&#x27;ve never owned a boar or synthetic brush</li>
            <li>This is my first entrance to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li>The first had synthetic bristles and a plastic handle.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever shave brush</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This was the first shaving brush I purchased and could not be happier.  </li>
            <li>This was my first brush I purchased and</li>
            <li>At the current rate of hair loss from the brush, it will be bald in 6 more months.</li>
            <li>This is my First time using aby type of brush for shaving</li>
            <li>shelling out more next time and getting a Parker.</li>
            <li>It continually left my face sore after most uses.</li>
            <li>This shaving brush is exactly what is described.  </li>
            <li>it self the first time I used it</li>
            <li>This is my first brush with the introduction to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I saw many different types of brushes including boar and bear bristles; however, I decided to settle with a badger brush after some research.</li>
            <li>Twice as much lather!</li>
            <li>After using it for several months, I purchased a more expensive best badger brush.</li>
            <li>If the shedding turns out to be more than this, I will edit my review later to say so.</li>
            <li>Smelled funny in the beginning but not now.</li>
            <li>I switched to safety razor shaving recently after 10 years of cartridge shaving and it feels SOOO much better.  </li>
            <li>Overall an OK brush, maybe time will mellow it.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, and my first time using shaving cream not in a condensed can.</li>
            <li>And, even in the first use, I found that NO HAIRS fell out for the Jagger.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>That said, this is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>This is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The smell from this brush once wet with warm water was overpowering and nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair fell out first use.</li>
            <li>I gave this brush to my fiance for Christmas and on the first use</li>
            <li>Much better than the last sheving brush I used.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush when I first switched to using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>This was his first time trying shaving soap and a brush...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first badger hair brush and it has changed my life.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s priced low compared to most badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li>This was the first shaving brush I ever bought</li>
            <li>Jumping into a reasonably-priced badger brush should be the FIRST brush I picked up.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush for anyone interested in saving money.</li>
            <li>This was a pressent for me and is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll be sure to replace it with the same brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will shed hairs for about the first week or so.</li>
            <li>Has the quality of a much higher priced brush.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I have ever bought</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is my first brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what it was advertised to be</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first brush, and it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>there were a couple of shedding hairs at first, but none after that.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else says, smells for the first couple of days, but after that, goes away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using a double edge again after many years away from one.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Escali shaving brush in the same order as the Old Bond Coconut shaving cream and have been very pleased with both purchases.</li>
            <li>There was some shedding the first couple of days, but that seems to have tapered off.</li>
            <li>This is my first Shaving Brush and well.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the way I started shaving too many years ago, brush, DE Razor and a cream.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well lathering and getting soap everywhere evenly.</li>
            <li>The first week of use the brush shed its share of hair.</li>
            <li>First...</li>
            <li>size is something that I am willing to overlook...</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak and rinse prior to first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a wealth of hand-on knowledge of competing products, but I can say this product seems to be well-constructed in the month</li>
            <li>It generates a solid lather and holds sufficient amounts of cream when used with a quality cream and the appropriate amount of water.  </li>
            <li>When I first converted to DE Safety Razor shaving, I decided to go with this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush shed maybe 20 bristles on my first use, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>I guess it will work for me until I buy something of a higher quality.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>First shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>It lost about 20 hairs the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but none since then.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it lathers, and how it feels on my face!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit concerned that the wood will begin to wear a bit when wet, but perhaps that will make a nice hand-worn patina.</li>
            <li>, it felt so much like his, brought a smile to my face.</li>
            <li>First shave resulted in bristles all over my face and soap cake.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>I soak it in hot water first then whip up the cream and apply it.</li>
            <li>This brush takes me back many years when shaving was an art and not just an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>The the difference between the two is pretty</li>
            <li>However, there was a noticeable odor for the first week that I used this brush that has since vanished.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>a funny note.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a plastic handled one on the first go around</li>
            <li>Definitely a recommended item for someone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li>As just noted, I have not been aware of a musty animal smell at all.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, there was a lot of shedding of the hairs, now it doesn&#x27;t do it as often.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>These actually last many years and will turn your shaving experience from chore to luxury.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed to lather for a shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>It also lost about 20-30 bristles the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his favorite part of the entire gift!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a high-end brush, and was losing bristles from the first use.</li>
            <li>Two or three bristles feel out first couple times using it none since.</li>
            <li>He soaks it in hot water while we shower and then uses it without issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible brush in terms of softness, but spending the extra $10 makes all the difference in quality.  </li>
            <li>and I love dipping it in hot water to really open the pores!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Did the job, Husband liked it, Bristles are medium density and not much shedding</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t smell funny and actually worked up a better lather than the one I have.  </li>
            <li>Better quality that the Art of Shaving brush my wife gave me last year.  </li>
            <li>Problem is I dont really want to ever spend $200+ for a brush!</li>
            <li>Holds lots of water and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>Overall a pretty okay brush; I&#x27;ve never used another shaving brush before</li>
            <li>Shipping was FAST !  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush.  </li>
            <li>But be aware it sheds a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>During the first use, several hairs came out of the brush, but not so many as to create a noticeable difference in its thickness.</li>
            <li>He had been looking locally for a replacement for his and wasn&#x27;t able to find one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush.</li>
            <li>Husband has had this brush for over year now, he says it&#x27;s his first badger brush</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described &amp; arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>For the price, you won&#x27;t get much better than this, after 8 months of use, bristles are still solidly mounted and no weird smells.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this brush it was the first shaving brush I had used.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time realy indulging in brushes, lathering, legit shaving soap.</li>
            <li>We immediately replaced it with the Body Shop&#x27;s brush, similar priced, much better quality.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush that I bought after switching from multiblade cartridge razors to safety razor and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I must say since this is my first brush</li>
            <li>It holds the water really well and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This was my first brush, and here is what I got out of it:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The first one I bought was just on a whim</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased and</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li>It was a pain in the ass at first leaving bristles in my shave soap and on my face.</li>
            <li>First brush i ever owned.</li>
            <li>Way better than my last one.</li>
            <li>I noticed some coloring of my soap on first use</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare with others because this is the first one I ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve purchased having switched to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This brush serves exactly what my needs are.</li>
            <li>You may a fuller brush with a unit priced around $30, but if this brush is in your price range, you will likely be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>&quot; I continued to use it for four days, soaking it for about 2 minutes in hot water and then using it,  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>First off I like the handle on the brush and the hair of the brush</li>
            <li>The quality of the item is comparable to much higher priced shaving brushes.  </li>
            <li>One thing I dislike is that the brush sheds when you first use it.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it would stay in one peice on a more permanent basis.</li>
            <li>First experience using a badger hair brush for shaving.</li>
            <li>Couple of things: This is the first I&#x27;ve tried using shaving soap and a brush, and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a woman, my shaving needs are different from most of the reviewers.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles will come out at first</li>
            <li>The brush knotted it up the first time I used it..</li>
            <li>I paint sometimes and even with good paint brushes you will see a few bristles come out the first couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>Everything I expected it to be, spreads the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li>I just want to go ahead and say this is my first shaving brush that I ever bought.</li>
            <li>The first thing I like about it is the price.</li>
            <li>But some people have had luck with this brush so if your willing to take the risk buy it</li>
            <li>and it has a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>That works pretty well.    </li>
            <li>Escali is not my first badger brush.</li>
            <li>I looked at brushes for up to $80 before buying this one, and can not imagine that I would have been more pleased with the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>#34;real badger&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I tried dish soap, head &amp; shoulders, every shampoo I could find in the bathroom, and hot water.</li>
            <li>Sort of helps keep you from slathering on too much soap!</li>
            <li>The first time I touched this brush to my neck</li>
            <li>This is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I was needing a second brush for my weekends away from home but didn&#x27;t want to spend another $30 or more for another brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li>this brush lose the backbone compare with the first used.</li>
            <li>First Badger brush...</li>
            <li>During those years I have used many brushes made of different materials.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon after I submitted it, I got an email from the seller apologizing for my experience and offering to replace the brush or refund my money.</li>
            <li>I noticed it the first couple times I used it, but it is going away.  </li>
            <li>The brush did shed a few hair the first couple of times I used it, but since then it has been good.</li>
            <li>Use hot water to make your foam in a cup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and has help up well</li>
            <li>arguably that is its only redeeming quality.</li>
            <li>My first brush</li>
            <li>But its also pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This was my first brush</li>
            <li>First brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Finally you can upgrade to a better quality badger brush too</li>
            <li>One piece of advice, make sure you soak it in hot water and rinse repeatedly prior to the first use to get the excess dye out of it.</li>
            <li>There are higher grade brushes that reek of badger when you first get them, from what some have told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>quite a bit first use, but</li>
            <li>Lathers pretty well and does its job.</li>
            <li>When wet and full of shaving cream, the brush works more like a paintbrush - It just smears the shaving cream on my face, which I can do with just my hand.</li>
            <li>These things are supposed to have a smell to them, at first, and I know this.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for as a starter brush.  </li>
            <li>Not expensive, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>figured that if I stick to it, I&#x27;ll just purchase a better one later on.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll buy this one again if, and when, my first one needs replacement.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush.</li>
            <li>I can run over my face with the electric razor once, and still able to re-apply several times if needed.</li>
            <li>Soaked it and used it and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This one is soft and fits in the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend as a first badger brush, or first brush in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>As my first brush, i have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>This was my first badger brush</li>
            <li>I then noticed that the brush was losing bristles with each use - on the order of a dozen or more at first, and now - after several months of use - it still drops 6-10 bristles per use.  </li>
            <li>of the hairs came out on the first use (~8-12), more on the second use (</li>
            <li>brush was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I must say it did smell kinda funky the first couple of times i used it.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li>Lost that badger smell (ha ha) after the first week or so.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush that I purchased.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Let me preface with the fact that most people&#x27;s complaints can be solved by running shaving soap through the brush 3 or 4 times prior to first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Seems to make a better shave with my double edged razor.</li>
            <li>It shedded at first but not since</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li>I know they are attractive because my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about them detracting from the bath decor.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this brush when I first got into straight-shaving.  </li>
            <li>The first maybe 10 times I lathered up, I would lose 2-3 bristles each time.  </li>
            <li>Since he uses a shaving brush everyday, I was looking affordability and good quality.  </li>
            <li>the brush is firm and builds up a good lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few weeks now and its a really good brush.</li>
            <li>but after a few uses it was all good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of picking a few up with some good cream for Xmas for friends and family.  </li>
            <li>(3)  work up a good, heavy lather  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my badger brush for a good few months now</li>
            <li>it arrived clean with no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it very frequently</li>
            <li>Im new to wet shaving with a double edge razor, and this brush makes it very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Decent brush, doesn&#x27;t lather extremely well, but good for beginning shavers.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and is a high quality brush.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>However, I will say that this brush is a good starter brush for those new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>So far, the badger produces a better lather than camel without the bristles adding new hair to my beard.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving products is a fairly new company who makes really good brushes that in my opinion are cheaper in price from comparable brushes from companies like Simpson,Rooney &amp;Omega.</li>
            <li>I get a much better lather with my new Escali Badger Brush than my old brush.  </li>
            <li>I am relatively new to wet shaving, and got this brush because it was well priced and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and wanted a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>The hairs have become soft and slightly fuzzy, it holds a ton of lather, and provides a great shave prep experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and well balanced, and the handle makes it easy to hang on to, even with wet hands.</li>
            <li>You really have to rinse the lather out and shake the brush dry for it to stay nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I did enjoy making the lather and have since practiced making a lather on nights when I&#x27;m not even shaving just playing with things like thickness, adding more or less water etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Why anyone would really forego shaving cream and smoothest 4-blade shave in 2013 by using a shaving brush and primiitive safety razor when there are other, better options available?  </li>
            <li>It took a few shaves to break it in and soften the bristles, but since then it has been very soft and produced great lather.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and does a decent job of working a lather but the hairs clump very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t loose hairs very easily, and is ergonomically well made.</li>
            <li>The lather was much finer and if you did things right</li>
            <li>ordered it and shipping was so fast that the delivery guy was knocking on the door right after I click on finish my order.</li>
            <li>Just the  right amount of exfoliating &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and still gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>badger brushes, but maintains the stiff spine for good scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Good stiff brush for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a good stiff brush.  </li>
            <li>Good stiff badger hair.</li>
            <li>I like that one a lot - properly stiff, no shed and a good feel on the whiskers.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews before buying, which for the most part were positive.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this brush has so many positive reviews, don&#x27;t make a mistake people, simply put this</li>
            <li>It was easy to break in and is not rough on you face and has held up well.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say I am thrilled to now be a wet shaver!  </li>
            <li>I hope this is not a typical issue with badger brushes as I do enjoy using it -</li>
            <li>I do wonder if it is normal for the brush to lose bristles as quickly</li>
            <li>, contacted escali customer care, they sent me free another one, a little better, but still bristles are coming off from the first use.</li>
            <li>This a nice brush that will more than likely get better and feel softer as it gets broken in.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes the daily monotony of shaving much for more fun as it can be a very old-timey experience.</li>
            <li>Very soft and full shaving brush that fits stands well, with wood that blends well with any type stand and razor.  </li>
            <li>I have stored the brush with the bristles down in a brush holder, the shape is holding up perfectly after 2 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li>the bristles is very good; it is a pure badger hair brush, and does every bit as well as my silvertip brush - only for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and I purchased it because of the positive reviews and the prices.</li>
            <li>Used a natural bristle brush previously, and this is MUCH better!!  </li>
            <li>but, just know that the Parker is a large step up for only about $10 more.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Escali Pure Badger is a better value.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing compared to other brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cheap way to get a brush but spending just a little more</li>
            <li>Great little addition to complete a set.  </li>
            <li>It is a great combination of firm and soft which gets my stubble ready for a close shave!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really review the brush because we haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far worth the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve used so far for wet shaving and does a good job lathering up my Proraso shave cream.</li>
            <li>There are far better brushes on the market, at a far higher price.</li>
            <li>My original Escali brush has handled everything I have thrown at it from Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap, to Taylor of Old Bond creams.</li>
            <li>other users here mentions, this brush seems to lose a lot of hair with each use which is kind of an annoyance</li>
            <li>but I liked it other than that.  </li>
            <li>Using this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream helped reduce razor burn and skin irritation significantly for me.</li>
            <li>This 100% pure badger shaving brush works very very well.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and using this brush for two and a half years it is apparent that either the quality control in the making of these brushes varies greatly or they&#x27;re made by different makers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li>Only used it once since I received it, but it produced a rich lather fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>My first brush was a typical drugstore brush and it was not soft at all, it did not hold water well or lather up very good.</li>
            <li>I still got a wonderful lather with very little effort and the animal smell is long gone.  </li>
            <li>So first the good: sharp, pointy bristles produce a nice thick lather and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Initially I had several bristles wash out but after breaking it in I haven&#x27;t noticed any more and have no odor that people have experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li>Gave it to new wet shaver who seems to enjoy it more than I did.</li>
            <li>it really helps lathering up a cinch and its rather large in size!</li>
            <li>Finally fed up with the mounting expense of buying the latest and not-necessarily “greatest” innovations in the disposable razor market, I discovered there are a few essential items I needed to buy before I could completely transform to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>it creates a fantastic lather, the bristles are thickly packed, and it feels amazing against my skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is great at what it&#x27;s intended to do: serve as a low cost brush for those introducing themselves to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It holds water very well and creates a nice wet lather on your face.  </li>
            <li>I have owned and used this brush for about one month and it is working very well thus far creating and comfortably administering lather.</li>
            <li>The reason it has such great ratings is because people switch from cartridge shaving to wet and see this as the number one seller so they buy it</li>
            <li>Great for starting to wet shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got one of these already for myself, and liked it so much I gave one away as a gift to my brother who is just getting into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>But after using it for a few weeks it&#x27;s stayed together and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does not shed particularly and is very much worth the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>that the brush is actually clean, the smell is completely gone and it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine</li>
            <li>This brush is not too soft nor too firm in that it easily creates a nice creamy lather in a mug that I can work into my beard.</li>
            <li>After about 5-10 cycles it finally looked and smelled super clean.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a shave brush (for a straight razor or a regular, safety blade) be sure to get BADGER hair.</li>
            <li>In a word, every bit as good as the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve bought and tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after a week of daily shaving the brush became very floppy and lost most all of it&#x27;s backbone.</li>
            <li>This brush is as good as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After each shave I am sure to shake as much water out as possible, reshape the bristles then set out on counter to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do, the bristles are nice ands soft (especially if you soak them in hot water), and it is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>So here I am getting a second one and planning sweet sweet revenge.</li>
            <li>A few months into using this it still scratches my face more than the cheap boar brush I used before.</li>
            <li>Gently squeeze excess water and give a few good shakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally found this brush, and it came with a low price tag and good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are nice and soft after only a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some badger brushes selling for big money, but no reason to buy those when this one is such good quality.</li>
            <li>so you may be able to get it for that much too instead of the regular $13 or so.  </li>
            <li>The things that cleared up my facial skin (surprisingly): Selsun Blue Medicated, face scrubber, and Escali badger brush.</li>
            <li>Nice wooden handle and natural bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, outside of the brush slowly going bald, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>; command for my wife was all it took to grab the dog and toss her into the bathtub as I quickly placed the brush back and began running the water to clean the pup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got back into straight razor shaving and having this brush lather up the soap is better than I remember.</li>
            <li>ThuS far Seems like a good shaving brush as expected.</li>
            <li>This brush gets soft over time and it&#x27;s easy to charge / load with soap and holds a decent amount.</li>
            <li>Good buy compared to more expensive options</li>
            <li>Granted I&#x27;m shaving my head and have some real estate to cover so if your only shaving your face you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>Good brush but my first shaving brush so not many to compare it to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that I don&#x27;t feel like it lifts my whiskers, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to drop too many hairs.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure that I really load the brush to produce enough lather for 3+ passes.</li>
            <li>Also, mix the soap with enough water or you won&#x27;t get a good enough lather.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles</li>
            <li>I frequent about wet shaving for good reason.</li>
            <li>I can’t say enough good about the entire experience.</li>
            <li>B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]], and a regular disposable razor; feels nice to handle and use</li>
            <li>such a good deal I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second as backup</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but it seems to me that this will last a good period of time if taken care of properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Described it as nice and soft compared to his existing item but rigid enough to hold soap.</li>
            <li>went for this brush mostly on price, but I have been very, very pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
            <li>It seems to really prepare the facial hair way better than applying a gel or cream by hand.</li>
            <li>use a large coffee cup and fill it with hot water and soak the brush while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other brushes on the market with better handling, better bristles, better lathering, etc, but for $14, I&#x27;m not sure you can find such a quality, real-hair, wood-handle brush to break in to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is my first pure badger hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li>First time using a safety razor and saw this shaving brush as being highly recommended -- they were right.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this little badger brush by Escali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a starter brush and it&#x27;s worth keeping around as an inexpensive travel brush when you upgrade.</li>
            <li>Also was surprisingly &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;, especially when new, but that seems to be getting a little better with time.</li>
            <li>This shaving brush has soft, but stiff bristles, that make it easy to generate a nice lather while softening the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost</li>
            <li>Makes rich lather with little effort what more can you say about a shaving brush?</li>
            <li>Funny how some can get a new cell phone every year for hundreds but cannot afford $13 to keep a fresh shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my cousin who has sensitive skin and needs special treatment for his beard.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my son with a special shaving cream for sensitive skin and they recommend using a brush to get up a lather</li>
            <li>Moving from a Gillette Mach 3, and Gillette shaving cream in a can to a nice Merkur safety razor, using &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream&amp;#34;, and the Pure Badger shaving brush is like taking a short trip to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brush is not too stiff or soft a great in between stiffness.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how short the handle is...not that easy to use for me.</li>
            <li>There was a slight chemical scent on the bristles at first but dissapated over week or two after a couple uses with some nice shave soaps.</li>
            <li>As a first time buyer, this purchase was based solely on other reviewers and boy were they right - this brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The Escal fells solid with a very full brush of hairs.  </li>
            <li>For $8 it was a good buy, but I knew I would need a new brush after reading reviews and losing so many bristles after only a few shaves.  </li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews here and ordered one.</li>
            <li>Positive:</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews; However, what I missed is that it doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette shave gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush based on a combination of all the positive reviews and the price.</li>
            <li>and I will say its been a positive experience.</li>
            <li>I chose this brush being on a budget and having read positive things about it on forums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this brush because the reviews were positive.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Be sure to soak the brush in warm water to soften the bristles because it can feel a bit hard and prickly to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The price point makes this 4-star worthy; If it cost any more, the star level would go down a notch or two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying lather to my face felt so soft and gentle that I actually enjoy the whole process.</li>
            <li>This was my first real badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>First time using it was a real treat.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty sturdy and hasn&#x27;t seemed to lose much hair after about 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush was purchased at The Art of Shaving, and it cost me four or five times as much as this brush.  </li>
            <li>brush was my first try at a real badger shaving brush, and</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and I really like the Escali brush.  </li>
            <li>My fiance has commented on the difference, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>And of course, the more expensive brushes are incredibly soft, and feel great.</li>
            <li>i also absolutely love that when I use it, there&#x27;s this faint animal (I can only assume badger - think woodsy smell) smell that is just incredible.</li>
            <li>First time shaving with a straight razor and applying shave soap with a barber brush.</li>
            <li>I suppose if I really crammed my nose into it I could detect something, but that would assume I know what I should be smelling in the first place.</li>
            <li>This brush whips up lather without effort, straight out of the box (please see below to prepare your brush for first use, however).</li>
            <li>After about a month of use the bristles are falling out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>My first shaving cream brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to go off of.  </li>
            <li>For the price it works wonders, and that&#x27;s all that really matters if you don&#x27;t feel like spending a fortune in a higher end brush.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it all that much, but the times that I have it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This is the first brush that I have used so do not have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it was made for and does it very well.</li>
            <li>My first badger brush, so i don&#x27;t have much experience with them.  </li>
            <li>My first badger brush so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>soak the brush in warm (not hot) water for a minute or two, then shake gently to unload some of the water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure before long</li>
            <li>The first time I lathered it up and gently squeezed it out</li>
            <li>I think I will be able to use this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably spring for a higher end brush at some point, but for now this one is working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I removed it straight from the package and used it the first day with no issues at all.</li>
            <li>This was a first purchase on shaving brushes to see if he&#x27;d like the change at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>As long as it lasts, I see no need to pay any more than this.</li>
            <li>Also, it looks great next to my other shaving supplies.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as it was very affordable, and since it was my first, if I did not like it, I would not be so out of pocket.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to which I can compare, but I can tell you this:  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about two weeks</li>
            <li>so this is my first shaving brush and dont really have any complains,hmmmm maybe one and its that some hairs fall out,</li>
            <li>It takes a few times of usage to get the smell off it but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>I am pleased, but this would not be a choice I would make as a long term purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my first real badger brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if there would be much of a difference if I paid 5 times as much!</li>
            <li>Also still a very prickly brush even though I let it soak in hot water for about 10 minutes before each use.</li>
            <li>There was some shedding the first week but not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>My first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.  </li>
            <li>The first time, the smell lingered for a whole day.</li>
            <li>This brush was my first brush trying DE shaving, and I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case I didn&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
            <li>I got this at a stellar discounted price and for how much I got it for I would buy over and over again.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much a slam dunk.</li>
            <li>product came well packaged and free of any apparent damage.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very prickly against my face even after soaking it in hot water and leather it up with soap.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of these 4 years ago and they have pretty much held together.  </li>
            <li>First lathers were very prickly.</li>
            <li>Really, it gets the job done, but hairs have been falling out consistently.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much experience to compare it to, but this brush is exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for - a low cost brush that wouldn&#x27;t feel cheap or fall apart.</li>
            <li>As long as I am able to shave, I plan to do so with an Escali bruch.</li>
            <li>Rinse it out VERY well BEFORE you use it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soft and  gives me a full lather on my face</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t shed any hairs after a few months of use, but the handle is tiny and does not have a good ergonomic or secure feel.</li>
            <li>The soothing warm water and soft brush makes you completely forget you&#x27;re getting to old to party like that.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still full and soft.</li>
            <li>It is quite small for a brush and it does not produce a good lather.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice full lather, well built and well designed, it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Turns out that as I&#x27;m soaking the brush in warm water, it starts to change the water&#x27;s color to a dark brown.</li>
            <li>in all a good starter brush, but no more than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the value of this purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to commit to a more expensive option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 6+ months, it works good to get up a lather and apply to face.  </li>
            <li>very impressed with this brush, as long as you rinse it and hang it, it will last a long time</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous when I purchased this that it would fall apart right away, but after using it for a few months it still works great and is holding up well!</li>
            <li>Most badger hair brushes are considerable higher priced and I just figured at this price that it was a cheap imitation of a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>quality is high and it holds shave cream &amp; water to lather up my face just right.</li>
            <li>either is pretty much fine especially for a beginner learning what you like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely get this if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving and want a nice brush for a decent price.</li>
            <li>handle has an adequate weight, and is shaped for easy griping with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to creating shaving cream foam with a brush so wasn&#x27;t excited about spending a large chunk of money for a high end silver tip brush.  </li>
            <li>It did have a little smell when I first set it in the water to warm it.</li>
            <li>I just love watching my husband use this sweet little tool to shave.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the brush is super easy, just run it under warm water and work the brush a few times with your fingers, then just shake it out once or twice, the brush comes out almost instantly dry.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the cheapest 100% badger brush of high quality available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that is deciding to take a more traditional approach to shaving.</li>
            <li>The instructions are concise but very useful, mainly where maintenance of the brush is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not shed bristles like other reviewers have found, and with better technique and practice I am able to get to the economies that justify this style of personal care.</li>
            <li>I liked the other reviews and this is cheap enough that if i didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive for a first time wet shaver, Badger instead of Boar, and on my very first try I got a fantastic lather.  </li>
            <li>Cons - not as soft as some other badger hair or synthetic brushes, handle is light weight wood (would prefer a bit more heft), packaging is unremarkable for gifting purposes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and create a great lather with very little shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I rinse the brush thoroughly and let it dry, following proper care instructions and after a couple of months of moderate use, it conserves its original shape perfectly.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush churns up rich foamy lather with very little effort and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why badger hair was so essential to making a good lather until I tried it; it holds in moisture between the hairs that other synthetic hairs simply can&#x27;t, making a rich lather that you can apply right next to the grain of your beard that you can&#x27;t with your fingers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues in the past of brushes going sour because my pre-shave oil adheres to them too quickly and saturates the bristles; the treatment on these bristles has successfully kept them oil free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-NOT super soft.</li>
            <li>I find this a very decent brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the skin, lathers well and dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to shake dry and leave on side.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting super soft bristles, but I was thinking the hairs would soften after use and conditioning.</li>
            <li>it kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;There is an odd smell.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t expect it to break that easy, but such is life.</li>
            <li>It has none of the floppiness of the higher grade badger brushes (best, super, and silver tip), but it is still soft and thick enough to hold water better than the average boar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers up quick and is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Only complaints are that it looses hairs easily and smells a bit like a taxidermy shop (made from badger).</li>
            <li>bid coarse, not as smooth as some of the higher end</li>
            <li>easily 20 hairs of various thickness shed from the brush.</li>
            <li>Important to soak it in hot water (in a cup) for several minutes before using.</li>
            <li>Much better than the really cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>The brush was packed in a simple packaging and was easy to get out.</li>
            <li>The bristles absorb water quickly making for a soft application of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let it dry on</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does hold water well, and creates a nice lather and has a slightly &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; feel which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>The wood handle also adds a very classic look.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the packaging it came in as it was easy to just open and have someonr take the contents out.</li>
            <li>My experience so far with this brush has been adequate to this point.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy enough.</li>
            <li>Be sure to dry in horizontal position.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for dry makeup or powders, but as for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Be sure to dry brush per instructions.</li>
            <li>There were a couple of hairs that came out at first, but that has not really happened any more.</li>
            <li>If you like super soft silky brushes, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse out for next usage too.</li>
            <li>The bristles keep their shape and the brush rinses out quickly and completely when I&#x27;m finished.  </li>
            <li>He has super sensitive skin, but this brush gives him a close shave with no skin irritation,</li>
            <li>I dry it with the bristles (handle on top) so that whatever it is that holds the bristles in doesn&#x27;t suffer any water damage.  </li>
            <li>I know my Dad had a super old horse hair brush</li>
            <li>I purchased it to use with the SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Black.  </li>
            <li>make sure you put it in its side when letting it dry.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to let the brush dry standing upright.</li>
            <li>The brush left badger hair on my face and as i washed the brush it started shedding very quickly in my sink.  </li>
            <li>Nice feeling brush, it did lose a few hairs at first.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, 4-5 badger hairs would dislodge every time I tried to make a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my Tweezerman shaving brush that is still going strong two years after its purchase.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe with the product is that it had a strong odor of, well, badger.</li>
            <li>Some loss of bristles during first few uses but seems to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>Looks like it was last a good long time.</li>
            <li>After the first week however it softened up considerably and I rarely lose any bristles now.</li>
            <li>I do expect a brush like this to have a smell, but the smell from this brush was simply too strong.</li>
            <li>Although it looks good at first sight, it loses bristles continuously.  </li>
            <li>It helps if you let it soak in warm - hot water for a few minutes while you prepare for the shave.</li>
            <li>The quality of manufacturing seems good and I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>It shed a few hairs at first but is breaking in nicely.</li>
            <li>Initially there was a strong smell to the brush, but that went away.</li>
            <li>smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>It looks like  it  will last for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>Instead of filling the entire area between the two, which would have produced a strong bond, the glue had a large hole in it.</li>
            <li>Good brush for those of you who likes a little more rigid than average hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>I take good care of it washing it out in lukewarm water and patting it down with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li>But every single time I have used the brush, a dozen or more hairs come off.  </li>
            <li>When I found a pure badger hair brush for this price point $12-$13 as if this writing), I figured I would try it out.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison to a pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>and then I ordered the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and believe me there is no comparison in the softness and shape of this brush.</li>
            <li>Whenever I replace my brush or gift one to a friend, I order the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>PURE BADGER SHAVING BRUSH proved to be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased an escali pure badger shaving brush from USA Vitamins</li>
            <li>It was a smart buy.</li>
            <li>Wholeheartedly recommend the Escali 100% pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade my shaving routine by picking up a Merkur Safety Razor and a pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to buy pure badger but find another brand not escali.</li>
            <li>is, as claimed 100% pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush is everything one would want in a shaving brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly I would suggest this brush to a friend(s).</li>
            <li>The lowest is this one, the \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li>&quot; The difference is in what parts of the badger the hairs come from, with pure badger brushes considered the roughest, and silvertip ones the softest.</li>
            <li>The lowest is this one, the \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li>&quot; The difference is in what parts of the badger the hairs come from, with pure badger brushes considered the roughest, and silvertip ones the softest.</li>
            <li>Bought this Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush as a gift for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Pure Badger shaving brush is all it claims to be.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pure badger, it works well, and it&#x27;s twelve bucks.  </li>
            <li>My one experience with the brush is the surprisingly large number of bristles that flaked off the handle while I lathered.</li>
            <li>Smart Buy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a boar or even horse hair brush instead of this (or any pure badger) brush.</li>
            <li>, Pure is meant to be &amp;#34;poky.&amp;#34; It is the stiffest of the grades.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to a friend.  </li>
            <li>a couple of razors ,soap and the brush I chose was the Escali pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>It held up for over a year, but I switched over to The Art of Shaving Pure Tip Badger brush</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]First time DE safety razor user</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be doing either of those though.</li>
            <li>You need a certain level of thickness to the brush to get it to work up the shaving cream into a lather.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a pure badger hair brush without the steep price.</li>
            <li>I purchased two Escali Pure Badger shaving brushes through Amazon with plans of presenting them to my grandsons.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand)</li>
            <li>Some have stated that pure badger brushes tend to be of poorer quality and are prone to having knots form within.</li>
            <li>You can search on amazon for Bellus 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>Is a pure pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Escali 100% pure Badger brush for my FIL for fathers Day</li>
            <li>Supposedly this is the lowest grade of badger hair (pure) given the price point.</li>
            <li>musky smell of the almond soap certainly doesnt help.</li>
            <li>When I replaced his boar bristle brush with this Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, he could immediately tell the difference in how luxurious the lather was on his face</li>
            <li>Got this brush after using a large Omega boar brush.  </li>
            <li>B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s supposed to be pure badger, I swear it&#x27;s losing color as well as bristles.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s pure &amp;#34;dyed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use anything but a Pure Badger Shaving Brush again.</li>
            <li>It is soft, makes a great lather, sheds very few bristles and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic buy - fast shipping, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Smells like a wet badger at first, but washing with shampoo and warm water fixed that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold enough hot water, nor does it keep enough air between the hairs to help lather effectively.</li>
            <li>At first a few hairs came out and it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought, but that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have heard that storing a brush with the bristles facing up like that can significantly shorten its life, so bare that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant, but for those sensitive to scent it may be bothersome.</li>
            <li>But, for the price, it is not a bad brush, especially if returning to the more traditional form of shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a brush and cream, but I have to say so far I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I have four shaving brushes - this is my favorite - and keep them at the different places I live and stay at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are new to shaving brushes, do yourself a favor and go with an Omega Boar pro48 or one of the many low cost Semogue boar brushes.</li>
            <li>You guys made my new Escali pure badger  brush hit right out of the park.</li>
            <li>THis is a good brush I have been using it for a few weeks now every day, with Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation (from amazon),</li>
            <li>If I shove my nose right against it immediately after wetting it, I can smell a hint of animal scent, but I&#x27;ve never smelled anything unusual during normal use.    </li>
            <li>I went over the brush with my hands and was pulling 20 loose hairs and more kept coming off.  </li>
            <li>and it does not shed loose hairs like many brushes.  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a breaking in period and those loose hairs will get worked out.</li>
            <li>High Density Pure Badger Shaving Brush WSP &amp;#34;Prince&amp;#34; Black&amp;#34; is the one I use now, Very Very Recommended.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that there is a slight &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>The price goes up depending on the color of the badger hair (silver-tip is expensive), however, badger hair will ensure you have a long-lasting smooth brush that feels pleasant on your face.  </li>
            <li>It was super soft and much fuller but also $180, so I will keep this brush.</li>
            <li>Finally whip up a good lather and stand the brush on end to let the lather dry on the bristles.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li>Super soft brush really works well.  </li>
            <li>Rinse and 2 good shakes in the sink and the brush is close to dry and maintains softness for the next use.  </li>
            <li>This brush has that new badger brush &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive brush and very cheap quality as expected.</li>
            <li>As long as you properly break it in and maintain it, it keeps its shape, it&#x27;s quite soft &amp; it works a lot better than the cheapo brushes you&#x27;ll get at the pharmacy or in most shaving kits.</li>
            <li>Good firm feel but still very soft tips.    </li>
            <li>Other than losing a few bristles during the first couple of shaves, this is a very good brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do follow general brush care (get a stand, clean it, etc.)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;badger smell\\&quot; that some other reviewers have mentioned, but I sure did lose a lot of bristles with my first shave.</li>
            <li>Soft feel, easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting out this should be fine, but it is not *</li>
            <li>Evenly applies the lather and makes me feel like a fine gentleman from the days of yore instead of the hairy wildebeest that I actually am.</li>
            <li>sure to dry bristles-down with a stand or hanger!</li>
            <li>Nothing like a classic shave!</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get a decent brush to lather up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience with classic shaving implements</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush for the money!</li>
            <li>but it seem of very high quality.</li>
            <li>this is a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li>have three brushes, a very high end</li>
            <li>Its a very high quality brush, prompt shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Never had a very high quality brush to compare this to</li>
            <li>It holds a good among of water to build a good lather in a mug however it did loose about 15 hairs total after three shaves but after that only once in a while does it loose another</li>
            <li>The Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I ordered held water and lather very well for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I bought this 100% pure badger shaving brush to go along with the Merkur stainless steel razor that I bought.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the hairs on this because it just held too much water...and after a certain point the hairs would come off and stay on my face as I shaved....</li>
            <li>To be honest, it smelled a little bit of skunk.  </li>
            <li>Nice little brush.</li>
            <li>Nice little starter brush.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, wish it was maybe a little softer bristles.</li>
            <li>Really nice little shaving brush for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>This little brush works wonders creating a nice lather for your face.    </li>
            <li>Got the brush in, was hoping for the best due to high ratings, however I have used it two days so far and bristles constantly come out, I&#x27;ve probably lose 20 bristles so far.</li>
            <li>This brush replaced a boar brush that was about 4 months old and was so bald that I thought of it as &amp;#34;the CHEMO brush regardless of how gently I treated it, and I have smelled wet, dead, possums that were a lot more pleasant to have in the bathroom with you.</li>
            <li>it is pretty small actually and easy to use and holds good amount of water and shaving cream... soft on the face...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first purchase of a brush like this, and I do not yet know the difference in quality between an inexpensive brush, and a high priced brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend pre-conditioning the brush before first use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li>Not as durable and as high of quality as the higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve owned but seems to be really high quality.  </li>
            <li>a little bit short, but works great</li>
            <li>Great little brush for starting out.</li>
            <li>As well the bristles are fine and soft with a natural feel, which works very well on the face.</li>
            <li>It took several decent lathers to have it settle in it&#x27;s sweet spot where your soap/gel scent gets absorbed and the shedding stops.</li>
            <li>good quality for a hard to find item</li>
            <li>recommend this brush along with Merkur razor and Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and good is hard to do.</li>
            <li>Good brush, it does have that badger smell a bit, but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>But it works very well for its purpose and seems of very high quality.</li>
            <li>This brush seems to be very high quality and works very well</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a high quality item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that the quality would not be the same since the product was relatively inexpensive, but it works great!  </li>
            <li>A year ago I returned to the old double-edge razor, and my old, cheap brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li>My fiance recently started using a straight razor to shave, and he had a cheap boards shaving brush to start out.  </li>
            <li>This one has lost a few hairs but overall has been a great experience.  </li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be quite as nice as some of the more expensive brushes, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this one.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product especially if paired with Dove Men+ Care Total Comfort Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>This brush is a huge difference from the one that came in my kit from a local store.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t imagine what would justify getting a brush more expensive.</li>
            <li>Anyone who pays twice, three times, TEN TIMES this much for a shaving brush is making a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the initial investment of the hardware, the blades are cheap and the soaps and creams reasonably priced but the shaving brushes were all over the spectrum.</li>
            <li>I kinda wish I had just spent more and went up to a nicer brush that does shed its brussels so much.</li>
            <li>Recently made the switch over from a synthetic bristle hair brush and let me tell you it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li>Working very well for my maiden voyage into DE safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>did a bit of research and settled on this shaving brish because of the reviews and the price (which really couldn&#x27;t be beat).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or low quality at all.</li>
            <li>O course, since I really like the brush, I treat it gently.</li>
            <li>but it lathers really well and fits well in the hand and is getting softer with every use.</li>
            <li>so I really want the \\&quot;best\\&quot; experience out there</li>
            <li>Thanks Escali.</li>
            <li>Asthetically, it looked very well designed.</li>
            <li>it has been a big hit as I get detailed critiques of each&lt;br /&gt;day&#x27;s shave by telephone.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I primarily started this on a low budget and did it to save money.</li>
            <li>This brush makes the shaving process much easier.  </li>
            <li>I really havn&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>More than I Expected.</li>
            <li>He said it didn&#x27;t spread his shave cream around smoothly or well enough.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re still on the search for a reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li>The brush seems solid however, and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>And the service provided by Amazon and Perella&#x27;s has made the journey that much easier.</li>
            <li>Brush is well made and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The misconception is that with an Escali you&#x27;re getting a quality badger brush at a fraction of the price, but you&#x27;re really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t name any specific vendors in order to remain free from accusation of marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but I know he uses it whenever he shaves and has no complaints.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized until I got my boar brush recently, but this cheap badger brush has no backbone.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took it with me during my vacation and it did not take much room in my toiletry bag since it is not bulky.</li>
            <li>He states he likes it very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like my Escali brush.  </li>
            <li>Brush is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter in the stand</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>It is like a paint brush for me and with the shave cream, i paint it on the spots ready for the razor.</li>
            <li>For the cost and quality of this product,  it performs very well.</li>
            <li>You can really paint very well with it which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>Appreciated the fast service.</li>
            <li>Holds water really well.</li>
            <li>My husband says he really loves the brush.</li>
            <li>I just started shaving with a straight and so needed a brush for shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The brush works very well and soaks well also, when I lather up the shaving cream and brush it on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Brush creates a lot of lather, but is softer than I would like since I have very dense hair.  </li>
            <li>It sets up the shave really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very shaving brush, thanks.</li>
            <li>Really works the lather of the cream into the wiskers and prevents pulling.  </li>
            <li>This would&#x27;ve been a 5 star product if didn&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li>After using this brush for a week I gave up and spent the money on a better quality brush.  </li>
            <li>brush hasn&#x27;t lost that much of its bristles...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very prickly, and it NEVER.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the face and lathers the soap very well.</li>
            <li>It lathers and holds soap very well.  </li>
            <li>found it lathered well, and a much softer application.</li>
            <li>I began using boar bristle brushes and really like this over them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but around the 3-4th time it was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price makes it very affordible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>it sheds a lot and is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The brush lathers up really well</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m amazed at how fast it dries out after use.  </li>
            <li>This is a 100% badger brush and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight for 14 bucks and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>brush holds water very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really allows me to get the shaving cream worked into my beard.  </li>
            <li>This brush was much cheaper</li>
            <li>He really loves this brush.</li>
            <li>and it has held up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are probably some softer Badger bristle brushes out there, but the idea of spending $60 for a shaving brush seems a bit much to me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>I found this at a reasonable price and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I had decided to stick with wet shaving, so I began looking on Amazon for a better replacement brush.</li>
            <li>It took off as much lather as it put on.</li>
            <li>Would recommend the brush stand so the bristles stay straight.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The brush spreads shaving soap very well on my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch or itch.</li>
            <li>Very scratchy though.</li>
            <li>A real quality product.</li>
            <li>#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, well I purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if wet shaving would be for me.</li>
            <li>This is real badger hair.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely reccomend to everyone.</li>
            <li>For a budget brush, this product performs very well.</li>
            <li>While there are certainly much nicer brushes out there</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than name brands</li>
            <li>The knot really has no body to it</li>
            <li>I really like the firmness of the bristles and the way my skin feels afterward....</li>
            <li>Definitely feels like a cheap product (~$15) but gets the job done, and holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped incredibly fast, packaging was efficient, the price was basically unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>which I would expect from any brush with real hair</li>
            <li>(this happens with artists brushes using real hair).  </li>
            <li>He really likes it  </li>
            <li>much fun brushing on old school sandlewood shaving lather.</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s made out of real animal hair.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really compare to anything.</li>
            <li>the quality is much better than i expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as I changed my shaving strategy from canned shaving cream and disposable blades to real blades and saving soap.</li>
            <li>I would have saved so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the price was low, the brush seems to be well made and does a fantastic job building and holding a lather.  </li>
            <li>It works VERY well at lathering up shaving cream</li>
            <li>So much for that.</li>
            <li>Is gentle and dries well.</li>
            <li>Have seen some bristles come out into the soap, but this was really just when I started using the brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the brush was delivered on time, looks as pictured, and is perfectly capable of doing its job.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as soft as those $60 silver-tipped brushes, but I can&#x27;t imagine the difference in quality is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very prickly and should be much softer.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well.</li>
            <li>Really works in the lather well.</li>
            <li>brush was very well priced and shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and works real well.</li>
            <li>When the badger brush arrived I wondered how often I would really use it, and the answer is: every day.  </li>
            <li>I am just getting into the whole safety razor and shave soap thing</li>
            <li>I am no expert or anything, so i can&#x27;t say too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li>, expect a pretty potent smell on the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>but not so much so given the price</li>
            <li>The price was ok, everything came as expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s from a badger, but really who knows?)</li>
            <li>Was told that most brushes lose a hairs the first few times you use it so it did not bother me at first.</li>
            <li>I grew up on straight razors and shaving brushes, and you know what?</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided that I wanted to get a real badger brush, since I&#x27;ve been using a boar brush for years.  </li>
            <li>Shipping from the store owner was fast and the package arrived in a w3ell packaged box....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a novice at lathering up this way, so I wasn&#x27;t going to spend too much on a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Quality product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It was a bit pokey until I realized that I should spread the lather by using a side-stroke with the brush instead of coming straight on.</li>
            <li>The hairs are very floppy and can&#x27;t stand up well to soaps or face lathering  </li>
            <li>The hairs seemed clipped and thus are very scratchy at the ends  </li>
            <li>It works very well just as advertised.</li>
            <li>so you do not nicked quite so much with the straight razor.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>very &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; when applying lather to the face.</li>
            <li>I considered spending over twice as much for another brush..</li>
            <li>I dont know much about shaving brushes, but my husband thinks this one is a winner.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It also smells like a badger, but I don&#x27;t really mind that so much.  </li>
            <li>Also fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This works really well with the Shae Moisture Shave Butter I use.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>With this brush you really don&#x27;t need a shaving mug.</li>
            <li>When my son saw it he said he wants one for his birthday.</li>
            <li>It lathers up my face very well</li>
            <li>Lathers very well, and applies to the face sufficiently.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Dealer shipped fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I shave with multi-blade disposables and straight razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert, but seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who is not using one of these brushes should really get it a try.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference for my shave and my skin.</li>
            <li>and the price is quite reasonable for the quality item</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well-made for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son... Plus bowl, soap, and straight razor.  </li>
            <li>pre shave cream very well and evenly.</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;ve tried to embrace synthetic bristles, I appreciate the feel of badger.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Made with real hair of some sort.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Hang on a holder, and it&#x27;s ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t like picking hairs off my shave soap, nor my face.</li>
            <li>With a toothbrush, gently brush with the grain of the bristles to help remove soap build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for a family member and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush - especially for the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it&#x27;s a badger brush, and I knew it was a real badger brush because it smelled of badger.</li>
            <li>Comparatively though, the badger brush doesn&#x27;t have hair falling out nearly as much as the boar</li>
            <li>not the highest quality but for what i paid I didn&#x27;t expect much and it exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now, every day, and I decided to spend the extra money on this badger brush instead of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>I will continue to support your  efficient and appreciated customer service &amp; shipping standards.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this alone without a stand or method of it being inverted, it&#x27;ll deteriorate really fast.</li>
            <li>But he really does like it a lot.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really got a basis for comparison, but I like it</li>
            <li>B000WNCD32 Williams mug shaving soap - 1.7 oz]] and the combination seeem to work very well while not breaking my wallet.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li>HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li>This brush is high quality and works well!</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys this brush.  </li>
            <li>Some brushes need to be replaced after a year they had shed so much.</li>
            <li>feel that I really like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience yet with safety razor shaving, but this brush is doing the trick.  </li>
            <li>I can lather up within a minute to get ready for my shave.</li>
            <li>This really helps get rid of the smell, and the lose bristles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like my Escali badger brush.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this brush for shaving and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>He uses it to lather&lt;br /&gt;a soap puck in a shaving mug, and the soap spreads really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like using a DE razor and shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it looks in the stand!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the very beginning</li>
            <li>By the way I grew up using straight razors and brushes...which gave me no problem.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There isn&#x27;t to much you can say about a  brush however you can&#x27;t beat this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well for dusting LEGO models.</li>
            <li>and now I am much happier.  </li>
            <li>The synthetic brush does not shed, is softer, and builds lather much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice shaving brush, only negative I will say is sometimes the brush hairs come out more</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>This brush is priced very well, and will do everything a shaving brush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It does its job very well</li>
            <li>It handles well in water and is very absorbent with shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold shape very well</li>
            <li>Smelled very animal like..  </li>
            <li>I really like this item, but I wish it did not shed as much of the hair as it does.</li>
            <li>The brush really picks the whiskers off my face and makes the shave so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Yes you&#x27;ll save some money, and yes it&#x27;s supposed to be real badger, but I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li>and now that I have this brush and some real shave soap I am experiencing a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job in a short time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now got a synthetic brush for $25 that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It sometimes retains too much water, but this means an adjustment on my part.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re thinking of starting to do some real shaving and dumping the pressure can chemicals and need a nice, low cost brush that performs well</li>
            <li>I think it does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says it really does the job.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks for the brush to really break in.</li>
            <li>I really like how well it works.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain much, but I have to say I would probably prefer Tank Riot.</li>
            <li>But, on the whole...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It feels very well built</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much being</li>
            <li>Its made very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems very durable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the seller shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and I find the quality is solid for its price.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of straight razors and sometimes a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Price was quite reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Very well produced and has increased my cream production and defiantly glides well with the 100% badger.</li>
            <li>i really like this brush,enjoy using it</li>
            <li>However, in my experience, the bristles on the Escali are much stiffer than the Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really a non-issue.</li>
            <li>this brush is a high quality product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Not too much to write.</li>
            <li>so I feel comfortable writing a brief review.</li>
            <li>You do indeed get what you pay for, I did not expect much at all from this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the brush is very acceptable, holds plenty of water, makes plenty of lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I used the brush it lather really and did the job.</li>
            <li>This brush does lather up very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not want to pay too much yet, as I figured it out, so I settled on the Escali Badger.  </li>
            <li>it does the job and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t shed much..</li>
            <li>It really builds lather well when paired with a scuttle.</li>
            <li>All very AOK.</li>
            <li>I really should have known - you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it over the weekend, it can expediatly fast as i was hoping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re ready to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is working really well</li>
            <li>Works as well as my parker, which cost 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold up very well and don&#x27;t seem to be coming off any time soon.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really matter because the razor removed the badger hair just as well as it did my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush for anyone looking to get a real shaving kit.</li>
            <li>So much nicer than boar brissel.</li>
            <li>This brush was much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price I consider it a real bargain</li>
            <li>much to these</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>gets the job done as well as the one I have that out three times as much</li>
            <li>I wore out a boar brush from the drug store in about two months, so I was ready to upgrade to badger, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a fancy one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This one is much nicer</li>
            <li>They really scratched up my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hairs keep shedding but its nothing to worry much about.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>very bristle-y brush, i have had some hairs come out</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone using a straight razor to shave.</li>
            <li>Does have an interesting scent when wet.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a travel brush, as well as a cheap boar brush from the local grocery, and both outperformed this brush.</li>
            <li>Appears to be comparable to brushes costing twice as much.</li>
            <li>it dripped real hair oil.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this product for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really find this a very functional brush for lathering up for a shave.</li>
            <li>The part that goes against your face is wood, which is unusual.  </li>
            <li>The brush works well but the shave cream doesn&#x27;t penetrate the wood applicator very well</li>
            <li>I hope that the Badger did not suffer too much.</li>
            <li>Not too much,</li>
            <li>For the price you can really beat it.</li>
            <li>But once the cream was on it i couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few shaves, it did shed perhaps 6-8 long bristles per shave, but that seems to have stopped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much softer than the boar hair brushes I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>This one is much nicer quality, and my husband likes it.</li>
            <li>Very prickly and the brushes keep falling out of the brush and get stuck to my face.  </li>
            <li>brush works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Wooden handle is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Soooo much softer than a boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well, is very well made, bristles do not fall out or otherwise cause problems.  </li>
            <li>This brush really does the job whipping up foam and applying to beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fact I lose almost no bristles.</li>
            <li>Brush is well constructed and has held up very well for over a year.</li>
            <li>I found this brush very prickly.</li>
            <li>Really well made.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>if you get some shedding of bristles, it is normal to happen on the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>The Badger Brush is the absolute best!I bought the stand and the Merkur safety Razor to go with it.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and works as designed.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast</li>
            <li>Item got here fast and intact.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Shed a whole month for me.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need for a $100 brush, but I&#x27;ll be making the move to a Simpson very soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expect some shedding at first, it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Might be a defective brush or just a really crappy product.</li>
            <li>For the price I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just got into the wet shaving world (using a DE shaver on my legs has been an interesting transition).</li>
            <li>Great brush, once you get it broken in.  </li>
            <li>It is compact, but lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well with my Poraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It gets all over the place and absorbs too much water.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how much of a difference there was between my boar bristle and a badger brush with out spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Proraso has a much stronger smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!  </li>
            <li>use it every day thanks for a well made brush</li>
            <li>Badger hair is the gold standard for shaving brushes and the wood is of fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>it softens up the hairs and really holds a lot of water.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaving brush for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Check&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast...............</li>
            <li>He was working up to using a straight razor like his granddaddy</li>
            <li>Thanks to this shop</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It really changes the shaving experience, even if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>bought it with a tube of Proraso and works really well together.</li>
            <li>Not the prettiest, but again, for the price, you can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Now, you have two different generations who both enjoy Escali&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Product works really well</li>
            <li>Makes the lather very well and spreads the soap well on the beard.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice stray hairs coming out very often at all, and the integrity of the bristles have remained intact.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it has a very pungent odor to it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s from a real animal.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed too much bristle loss.</li>
            <li>bristles are very skimpy and do not hold water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i really didn&#x27;t want a wood handle brush</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about 5 uses it is really broken in and works great with shaving soap and mug.</li>
            <li>My old brush rarely lost bristles.</li>
            <li>but once I go to face lather, the bristles get all bunched up don&#x27;t spread the soap very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t as much brush there to make lather.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li>I also get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>but it does very well.</li>
            <li>It holds a lather really well</li>
            <li>Recommend this seller highly!</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m applying too much pressure or what.</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely an upgrade over the cheap low-quality drugstore brush I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this shave brush several weeks ago and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It holds water very well and lathers quite a bit even without tons a shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful and knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li>Gentle brush, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li>They really help a lot with application of shaving soap and cream.</li>
            <li>Item was as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet a sophisticated wet shaver</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend</li>
            <li>I have owned only cheap brushes up until I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the complaints about this brush and its quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real badger (not boar) and is priced at $13-14 dollars.</li>
            <li>What really bothers me is how much it sheds hair.</li>
            <li>I find that soaking it a coffee-cup full of hot water for a minute or so prior makes everything much easier.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>Ready to go.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>and works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and very affordable</li>
            <li>and it makes lathering up much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li>It was a very affordable brush, but it was to mushy on the face.</li>
            <li>Works very well with market shaving creams.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended it because he loves his so much.  </li>
            <li>Rubbing it against your face brings so much pleasure to shaving.</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it with shave soap.</li>
            <li>and it should be much softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this brush for anyone starting with DE shaving, or just looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but seems solid.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than the $10 brush</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li>Price was extremely reasonable and this is a very well built shaving brush.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It really holds the lather well</li>
            <li>Very well made with high-quality badger bristles.</li>
            <li>but if I rub it on my skin the lather doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very functional and has lasted me six months already.</li>
            <li>He really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>It worked very well in both instances.</li>
            <li>He commended on its styling and construction so much that I bought one for myself as well.</li>
            <li>Well after about 2 weeks I cant say it has improved all that much.</li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth badger fur carcasses my face every morning in a way that camel hair brushes could only dream of.</li>
            <li>For an entry level brush that I wanted to be of quality and last - it has filled the bill.</li>
            <li>It sheds bristles with very use.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this brush as much as I thought I would because hairs kept falling out.  </li>
            <li>what would have happened if I had taken it straight to my face from the package.  </li>
            <li>Real garbage.</li>
            <li>so I cannot really compare it to much.</li>
            <li>However I really like this one and its quality.</li>
            <li>Really lathers up nicer than the synthetic brushes</li>
            <li>Low quality but cheap.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much of a difference that this made with shaving.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>The product is really well made.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much...</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>and it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>- you got me a real badger shaving brush?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, everybody is very happy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Smooth coverage and has held up to daily use without issues.</li>
            <li>I guess those badgers are really stinky?</li>
            <li>take the time to learn how to condition the brush and get it ready for use.</li>
            <li>It wicks away water correctly, spreads evenly, and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Compared to a boar brush, the Escali feels prickly and doesn&#x27;t generate as much lather.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t happened since then and he really likes it now.</li>
            <li>It has a real wood handle, not plastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and would buy this again!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was reasonably fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, along with a whole set of stuff.</li>
            <li>realize that this much cleaning may have impacted the quality of the brush as well, but I did not care.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>After spending a money on an Edwin Jagger razor, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shaving brush in case</li>
            <li>The thicker lather has changed the quality of his shave, and his skin feels so much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li>very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does make lather very well, and doesn&#x27;t retain water at all.</li>
            <li>These brushes are inexpensive and very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but the hairs come out for week quite some time.</li>
            <li>but I really like the feel and quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It is holding shape very well.</li>
            <li>B002WA0QGY Parker Safety Razor SYNTHETIC Bristle Shaving Brush with White handle and Free Stand]]</li>
            <li>has made the process much cleaner.</li>
            <li>So I really like the brush</li>
            <li>It is a very well made brush.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it almost daily.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like having the real thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to my fellow DE and cut throat blade shavers!</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, also.</li>
            <li>It lost so much hair on every use.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>shave straight razor</li>
            <li>Works well but hairs fall out a lot more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never used one before, so make sure it&#x27;s wet beforehand</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but it seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>The process of lathering prepares the skin for a very close shave and has also reduced the ingrown hair issue</li>
            <li>but since this is my first brush, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if this was normal or not.</li>
            <li>He really loves this brush.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>I had a synthetic brush from a big-box retailer and wanted to give real badger hair a try.  </li>
            <li>I really like the experience of using the brush</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s a much nicer brush than the one he started out with from Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So it must be real badger hair.  </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really say much about the durability -</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to replace this one with an Omega boar bristle brush here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush to replace one that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>It broke in really fast and no noticeable odor.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I also have an Escali stainless steel razor and brush stand.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My initial purchase included a cheap brush, bowl and soap.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a nice product at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>really makes it rather unusable.</li>
            <li>I gently squeeze the soap and water from the brush</li>
            <li>The brush is off quality construction, and it doesn&#x27;t get much manlier than rubbing your face with badger hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very afforadable badger brush option.  </li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush as part of a whole set up for my husband to try the double-edge razor shave and ditch the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price.</li>
            <li>After a year of use it doesn&#x27;t shed hairs much anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it wasent to much</li>
            <li>and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AS GENTLE AS</li>
            <li>very &#x27;farmy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend Google on how to break in a badger brush ,it really helped.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the fanciest badger brush, but it suffices well enough to give one hell of a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Makes no difference to me really</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Great brush now that it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>my Daddy used to get with his straight razor and the soap I mentioned</li>
            <li>care for the Escali inscription, but that is really &amp;#34;splitting hairs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I can see how that would cause issues with the wood/bristles (for any brush really).</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>After years of applying shaving cream by hand,my husband is amazed at how much he loves using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t take much time to research or read reviews.</li>
            <li>He is much happier with your brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles are durable because they are real badger hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Among the brushes featured on Amazon, I found this Escali brush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I bought a (separate) stainless steel stand</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>Straight to the trash can.</li>
            <li>The smell makes me think it is 100% badger because the bristles smell like real animal hair.</li>
            <li>It sounds fussy but you can drop $150 and it will rot just as fast.</li>
            <li>After use I gently rinse the brush and hang from a stand so that bristles point downwards.</li>
            <li>and I realized I was using too much soap to load on the brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a travel size brush and very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because it was the cheapest one I could find (just wanted to try wet shaving), but also it had many favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works</li>
            <li>Much needed improvement for my shaves.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>wery fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The badger is much nicer on your face than boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to check if the badger haired brushes are for them.</li>
            <li>Well I love it, it lathers good with my proraso soap and after the first few shaves no more hairs are coming out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get in there.</li>
            <li>While the price is extremely reasonable for this brush, it is no &amp;#34;bargain product&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>but will shed too much on you soon in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Seller ships fast and inexpensively.</li>
            <li>would absolutely reccomend this item.</li>
            <li>But he was using just a very inexpensive brush</li>
            <li>This is the real deal when it comes to badger hair shaving brushes</li>
            <li>I have since bought this as a gift, after liking mine so much.</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>I guess the bristles aren&#x27;t washed very well before assembly.  </li>
            <li>Makes things so much easier when using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from Perella&#x27;s and Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very durable as I have yet to see it lose any strands</li>
            <li>Shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combined with the ethical concerns about badger treatment, I have no hesitation saying:</li>
            <li>I was very disaapointed as the brush and the ad do not do what they say they do.</li>
            <li>need to pay 5 times as much for a quality brush.</li>
            <li>My fiance said it worked really well and helped reduce cuts from shaving.</li>
            <li>In the end do not expect too much.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast and convient to deal with.</li>
            <li>It does hold lather very well once you get it built up.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any loss of bristles.</li>
            <li>its real badger hair or what.</li>
            <li>It really sheds in the beginning...</li>
            <li>No issues really.  </li>
            <li>The brush has really softened up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched over to my straight blades, shaving soaps, and this quality badger brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Braun for years, and never realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a close shave, so I decided to give the safety razor a try.</li>
            <li>Always worked very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to lose a couple hairs here and there, but I really like using a brush.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m not paying $30 for a brush when I can get one much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift about two years ago, and I really prefer this method over shaving cream</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t shed much as yet.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday (a whole shaving set) for his birthday</li>
            <li>This one is inexpensive and does the trick very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money on some fancy pants silver tipped badger brush, not knowing if I would continue using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Bristles are more sturdy and the wooden handle is unblemished.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good beginner brush, but as the title says, it loses a hair or two with every use.</li>
            <li>Also thanks for the easy open package as he is older and has arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li>There are far better brushes out there at a similar price point.</li>
            <li>I tried soaking it in a solution of dishwashing liquid and warm water for a few hours and after rinsing it i tried it out.</li>
            <li>Overall, for an economically priced brush you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my shaves since I got this.</li>
            <li>It must be soaked in warm water for a few minutes before lathering soap or cream.  </li>
            <li>Soak the brush in warm water for a few minutes, shake excess water and lather up cream and soap mix.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the brush the few times I used.</li>
            <li>good news is that at least the bristles don&#x27;t come off the brush</li>
            <li>He was so pleased with this brush he actually threw the old one away.</li>
            <li>Thought the Escali would be at least as good as the one at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Good brush and soft enough on my face, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I would bet dollars to donuts that the people giving this brush good reviews simply have not experienced better brushes.  </li>
            <li>After a few months the bristles did soften but personally i liked them stiffer.</li>
            <li>So far it has stood up to the abuse of my daily shaving and not being able to care for it as well as I should.</li>
            <li>Mine is kind of &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; in how it was applied and dried.  </li>
            <li>My review was not overly harsh, but it was honest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the brush for a few weeks, it does a nice job of lathering up the shaving soap that I use.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised to see that, after only one use, many of the hairs fall off this brush into my shaving cream when I apply it to the brush.  </li>
            <li>Have recently started using this and Taylor of old bond street shaving cream and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the feel (not too soft, not too coarse).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice wooden look and holds water well for proper lathering.  </li>
            <li>Really nice feel, bristles are firmly in place.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast but bristles shed a bit more than expected.</li>
            <li>It was good when I initially started wet shaving, but I have moved on to better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush seems pretty durable, the first couple uses so far I have had hairs shed from the brush into my lather</li>
            <li>so I wan to be honest.</li>
            <li>Going from a disposable blade and canned shaving cream applied directly to my face to this makes a daily chore into an enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li>Holding lots of warm water and producing heavy lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and am now enjoying a proper shave the way it should have</li>
            <li>Only the second brush I own</li>
            <li>Good performance for the price but did lose a lot of bristles initially even with careful handling.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not honey badger, but good luck killing one of those suckers.</li>
            <li>will say it loses bristles a good bit</li>
            <li>I have had a good experience creating a thick lather without tons of lathering experience.</li>
            <li>Did have a good amount of sheading early on, maybe first three weeks, then no more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a comfort knowing that in addition to the sheer enjoyment of using the brush with its good robust bristles in play after tuning up with the aforementioned warm water enervated lather, at the end of the day I also will find this an economical way to stay in the game.</li>
            <li>I can get a good thick lather in not time at all.  </li>
            <li>I can whip up a good thick creamy foam without too much trial and error.</li>
            <li>Provides good and thick lather</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is not a huge deal.  </li>
            <li>This is a great basic shaving brush - it&#x27;s a little stiff, and will shed bristles if you abuse it, but overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>One great little shaving brush, it&#x27;s holding original form if needed will buy another down the road!</li>
            <li>Not a little, but more like I&#x27;d just shot one and thrown it in the back seat of my car.</li>
            <li>Super soft and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However my experience so far has been very positive.  </li>
            <li>A little smaller than i was expecting but very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li>Also, some reviewers say that the brush feels a bit stiff and prickly at first but in my opinion, it felt nice and soft since its first use, maybe I have tougher skin</li>
            <li>The wet badger smell goes away pretty quick after a few good rinses and soaks.</li>
            <li>The Brush is great... a little stiff at first but smoothed out wonderfully quick.  </li>
            <li>The brush does exactly what I expect it to do and cost a good bit less than the \\&quot;next level\\&quot; up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product,,  Arrived when stated,&lt;br /&gt;Quality of brush is good&lt;br /&gt;Would have been better if it included a stand, as has to be left upside down to dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor and this is my first shaving brush, which is just to say that I am no expert and don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this to, in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try shaving with a safety razor for the first time in years just to see if there was much difference, and that included buying new shaving soap and a brush.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this as a set with my new safety razer, at first i didn&#x27;t think i was going to use it as much</li>
            <li>Recently in New York I had my first straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>Plain and simple, this brush is great.  </li>
            <li>Mine fits perfectly and allows the brush to dry properly with the bristles pointing down.</li>
            <li>Fine brush overall, particularly at this price point.  </li>
            <li>I dry it (as prior experience taught me) with the bristles hanging down from a holder, and each shave is perfect.  </li>
            <li>( I skip the mug and rub the brush loaded with soap directly on my face) and this one is very nicely done , the bristles are soft on your face and the wooden handle has a nice grip , remember to get a stand since brushes must be stored vertically with the bristles down to keep them dry .</li>
            <li>I wash mine out, dab it on the towel to take out the excess water, smooth the hairs out to keep the original shape and hang it back in the rack, not rack - that was unjust, the &#x27;double edged razor and brush cradle&#x27;</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of not doing as much research as I should have and wound up on the page for this brush due to the fact that it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li>The brush keeps losing a few hairs but overall very nice feel.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the box, I was prepared for that NEW badger smell but to my surprise NO ODOR.  </li>
            <li>Being new to the safety razor, and  first time using shaving cream, it should be noted that I&#x27;m still learning the art of application.  </li>
            <li>Using this for the first time along my new Proraso Shaving Soap has been an awakening experience for me to say</li>
            <li>new brush lost 1 or 2 hairs the first two shaves, but since has not lost any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when new (maybe one or two strands the first two or three times I used it).  </li>
            <li>Being new to safety razor shaving, this is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>First lather on shave soap showed some brown oily residue, I figured since the brush was brand new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this is my first brush.  </li>
            <li>Being new to DE shaving, this is my first brush</li>
            <li>It was my first &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; shaving accessory to use with my newly acquired shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The store jumped right on the problem and fixed it.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, a bit stiff, but it may soften with use.</li>
            <li>* Doesn&#x27;t require break-in, soft right out of the box</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this brush is just right; some brushes are too prickly.</li>
            <li>He uses it every day with a Merkur razor and just bought himself a stand so it can dry upside down and stay in great condition.</li>
            <li>Not very expensive is matched by the quality.  </li>
            <li>After every shave, I have long badger hair in my blade that washes off easily</li>
            <li>Very first brush, decided to try this after using regular shaving cream, then shaving gels (Aveeno), then higher end shaving gels (Proraso), and now shaving soap (Proraso).    </li>
            <li>I love a creamy product from Real Shave and wanted to apply it with something other than rubbing my hads together.  </li>
            <li>Dries back to original shape really well.</li>
            <li>On my very first shave, I may not have known exactly what to expect, but I knew I had watched enough videos on YouTube about loading a brush and creating a lather to know that the Proraso puck shouldn&#x27;t have been caked with &amp;</li>
            <li>so he can&#x27;t compare it to other badger brushes but &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a WHOLE LOT better than synthetic brushes&amp;#34; and for the price</li>
            <li>Now I have no problems at all, no bad smell, and rarely do I have a loose bristle.</li>
            <li>As many before me have said, is is a smelly, stiff brush right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>Picked this shaving brush primarily for low price.&lt;br /&gt;Six months into using it, and it&#x27;s performing as well as the $50 dollar shaving brush I bought 20 years ago when it was new!</li>
            <li>does exactly what is supposed to do, very soft, saves a lot of shaving cream..</li>
            <li>before i would have some trouble creating a rich enough lather even with a quality soap but with the Escali lathering up is super easy.</li>
            <li>I am new to all the rage over wet-shaving with a single blade, and this shaving brush more than meets my requirements for value and performance.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it easily lays down a nice layer of cream.</li>
            <li>It retains enough hot water that I can get a nice warm lather at least two times and a decent lather the third time (in case I missed any spots).</li>
            <li>After reading some other reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this brush.</li>
            <li>The customer service experience definitely made up for whatever defects existed on the original product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend buying a boar hair brush off of Amazon, as there are other vendors that sell them at better prices.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s still better than a synthetic brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for father&#x27;s day, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Just glad it&#x27;s not made from other types of hair I guess.</li>
            <li>Badger is better than Boar and these bristles don&#x27;t \\&quot;shed\\&quot; as other brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I was able to glue it back together, but even considering that the brush doesn&#x27;t have the same quality it did after first purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Most other market and drug stores had nothing but shave cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>I realize it is Badger hair, but the first time I used it, WOW!  </li>
            <li>I have read a lot of other reviews on here about how many hairs</li>
            <li>Others reported better performance may be due to quality consistency.</li>
            <li>I know love shaving due to the feel of this as well as the aroma of the shaving cream that I use.</li>
            <li>Got my hubby this brush along with other items for Christmas and he now shaves more often.</li>
            <li>The hair is really sharp and didn&#x27;t seem to get any better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more petite than other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many other hairs in this brush</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other brushes that cost more</li>
            <li>As noted by other reviewers, this does have a &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; scent to it--if you don&#x27;t mind that kinda musky smell, it is okay.  </li>
            <li>, this thing rivals other 100% badger shaving brushes that cost 4x more.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a bit better based on other reviews I saw.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not enough to consider a significant problem, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I could due to hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a month now, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>With this brush I can produce a big handfull of rich foam every time.  </li>
            <li>One of the first things I noticed about it was its distinctive musk, which, while enjoyable, was unanticipated and only served to increase my appreciation for this brush even further.</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m glad I bought this first before investing in more expensive shaving accessories.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that most badger brushes are probably a little &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my original one for regular use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush, The only problem a i have is that it sheds a little, i hope its because its new, but other than that keeps a good lather .</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves his new badger hair brush and says it lathers twice as well as his old brush and is 10 times better overall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend using a pure badger shaving brush, specifically this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Pure Badger Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a large, high price, super-duper, silver tip badger brush that I use at home.  </li>
            <li>you can find several online guides on how to make good lather, select right soap, and take proper care of the brush for its long life.</li>
            <li>I like very much the lather this brush produces on my face and am quite pleased with its non-funky smell now that it has been used a few times.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and enjoy using it daily.</li>
            <li>He gave me a cheap plastic stand to have the fur/hair facing down after a good rinsing and said I should think about buying another brush to rotate if I shave everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, hardly sheds bristles, and I like it so much</li>
            <li>Hands down best brush I have ever owned, it is very soft on the skin, but strong enough to create thick foam.</li>
            <li>Good for starting out, perhaps, if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend extra clean up time cleaning the scuttle /</li>
            <li>After a shave, it&#x27;s easy to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say nothing out of the ordinary -- great brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I feel for the price it is a decent brush to start with when one looks at how much a high-end brush would cost.</li>
            <li>More than a few hairs fell out on first use, but it seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>handle is simple and clean...  </li>
            <li>the stink was nearly completely gone, and the brush was much softer than it was when I first got</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is comfortable on my face and performs exactly how I expected it to.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that it has real badger hair, the hairs in the brush even have a natural smell and the first time I soaked it in water</li>
            <li>I am not one to indulge the &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;S GREAT&amp;#34; reviews, because they don&#x27;t really give you a realistic expectation.</li>
            <li>All the same, you can&#x27;t argue with the cool factor of anyone that shaves with a brush and straight razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and dry.</li>
            <li>I think this is normal first-use wear out of a badger brush as I only lightly whipped up the soap</li>
            <li>I lost something like 15-20 hairs the first use and a few more reliably on each use.  </li>
            <li>For the first week or so bristles would come off regularly but it is quite rare now.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the $80 brushes can offer that would make them worth $67 more than this brush.  </li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean than my prior brush.  </li>
            <li>It shed a few hairs in the first couple uses, but not any more</li>
            <li>The overall design of the brush is a bit small, which is great if you like to lather while holding with your finger tips.</li>
            <li>I had to wash and rinse it several times before it rinsed clean.  </li>
            <li>Seriously though, if you are on a budget this brush is perfectly good.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to completely void the brush of shaving cream after each use to maintain the integrity of the brush for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice brush and yes a few bristles will be lost but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>can see that we will have a long lasting and loving relationship together.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would add that this has a good sized handle for those of us with bigger than average hands.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice brush, but not the one that will last in the long haul.</li>
            <li>Seriously, mate... take good careof this brush.</li>
            <li>Not only was it made of durable, natural materials, but also the bristles were 100% pure badger hair-- the most frequently recommended bristle material for an old-timey shave.  </li>
            <li>have the super cheap &#x27;Van Der Hagen&#x27; set as well, and the Escali brush, while an improvement, is not a significant improvement over the plastic handled boar hair brush included in that</li>
            <li>I had a $60 AOS badger before (last almost 3 years) which was really good and this badger has less bristles than it but still gave the same rich lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a large brush but certainly more than adequate for my shaving needs, I actually like the size.  </li>
            <li>On first use it shed a few hairs but other than that it was great.</li>
            <li>After the first week, the brush was extremely comfortable to use, sheds very little, and smells like whatever shave cream I most recently used with it.</li>
            <li>It holds a very large amount of water and it is very fast to clean to be put up for later for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>This brush does loose a lot of hair initially, but a great brush overall.</li>
            <li>a few hairs have come loose, overall an excellent starter brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost very few bristles and it makes great larger.</li>
            <li>Sure there are more expensive brushes, but for the price this one seems well constructed with a smooth wooden handle.</li>
            <li>It is soft, made of quality bristles, and was very reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable, high quality badger hair shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>It is built well, from high quality materials,  and is very aesthetically pleasing to have on your counter in a brush and razor holder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a well made brush, it really gets the saving cream into your beard, evenly spread--I highly recommend from anyone, beginner to expert.</li>
            <li>Nice later from regular soap, smell of badger was stronger when I first got it, but now after a year it is barely there.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and lathers very very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced starter brush.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>After recently switching to the big leagues of shaving, with natural shave soap/cream and a safety razor, I needed a good brush to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a little bit of practice to learn exactly how much water to leave in the brush, and it turns out I like a little more water than most men.  </li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and I am thoroughly enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, but this brush has made it an extremely enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li>And finally, a hint if you don&#x27;t want to take up counterspace with a special brush drying rack.  </li>
            <li>So, with that in consideration, I have been using this brush for only a short time and it does most certainly shed, to the extent that I had to fish out the hairs out of the shaving cream bowl as it was looking rather</li>
            <li>Be careful just with the name, 100% PURE is the lower end of badger brushes; they go all the way up to silvertip which I learned is much more soft and</li>
            <li>My father wanted to try traditional shaving, so having watched barbers on film for years, we went for the Escali shaving brush (with some special shaving soap).  </li>
            <li>I chose this brush because of the low price and high reviews; I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>You can easily see loose hairs that are protruding from the brush before you put it on your face - it&#x27;s nothing truly bothersome.</li>
            <li>great brush, slight smell, but expected with animal hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Some soap like more or less soap, so you will have to figure out how much water to shake out.</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry it completely before putting it away.</li>
            <li>He loves it and it is super soft on his sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brush was not super coarse and felt good against the skin.</li>
            <li>Most real boar bristle shaving brushes typically cost $30-$50.</li>
            <li>a week).&lt;br /&gt;The badger-ish aroma was strong, but after several uses, it&#x27;s faded away completely on</li>
            <li>I found one badger hair brush that was about half the size of this brush which, by the way, is probably a standard size brush which is a good size to me.</li>
            <li>I previously was using a tweezerman in the same price range, and based on good reviews ordered this one.</li>
            <li>After almost half a year of use I am ready to upgrade to a better quality brush.</li>
            <li>I use it with a wet / dry razor and it all works good.  </li>
            <li>More often than not, with the first few uses, you notice hairs bristles come out before it get settle (high end brushes).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent choice for someone new to wet shaving, though it does shed more than a brush should.</li>
            <li>I started researching for a new, inexpensive brush and selected The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>As noted in other reviews the brush did shed a bit when I first got it then stopped after a week, so this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li>Wow, Using a badger brush makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this brush is good, and the weird &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; smell weans in about 2 to 3 uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in a few months to review the durability, but so far, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other posts that it did feel a bit prickly at first, but now is butter smooth.</li>
            <li>Essential tool for a great traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and everything that I read made it clear a badger hair brush is the way to go.</li>
            <li>This is a great bush to use daily or add to the daily rotation as some wet shavers are doing these days, ask me how I know...</li>
            <li>Now I know that my brush will last a long, long time and looks great sitting in the stand on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for a few weeks, and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice firm brush and he loves it!</li>
            <li>The brush feels really soft and applies the cream pretty evenly</li>
            <li>It is nice to buy from a small company.  </li>
            <li>and is really soft, granted it looses bristles from every use, the majority that do fall are in the first use, after that it&#x27;s maybe one or two here and there.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, it&#x27;s a good brush, IMO, but not really as good as the Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li>the smell went away for the MOST part when i squeezed the water out, but as i did that, a the water was a dark reddish/brownish color.</li>
            <li>Everyone complained about bristles falling out, but I have experienced the same problem with many other brushes.</li>
            <li>Run hot water on it for a few seconds and enjoy the hot lather.</li>
            <li>On the first use the brush lost nearly 50 hairs.</li>
            <li>My old one was pretty shot.  </li>
            <li>Being conscious about hygiene i thought i should first give the brush a wash before using it.</li>
            <li>This was my first brush and still frequently used in my rotation.</li>
            <li>Was not sure which kind to get</li>
            <li>This brush has held up pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>you know exactly what the material is because your face is a sensitive area of your body.</li>
            <li>This is my first time going old school and using a shaving brush with a merkur razor.</li>
            <li>This is the first badger hair brush I have used, and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Kind of a small handle</li>
            <li>I think he feels extra cool using it to whip up a shaving lather :0</li>
            <li>I was surprised that all the hair was falling off at the first use - this never happens.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty soft out of the box and holds water and cream</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll continue making my own shaving lather.  </li>
            <li>(as this is my first one), but I was kind of surprised :/</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s scratchy; 2) the hairs are already loosening after only a few uses; 3) most importantly, it smells like a badger.</li>
            <li>Soft, holds hot water longer.</li>
            <li>The full badger is a definite step up from</li>
            <li>It works well, dries quickly, and I very rarely lose any hairs out of it even with some heavy lathering.</li>
            <li>spreads my shaving soap just fine, but it lose bristles every single time and it forces me to scratch my face while removing the bristle, and then i have to reapply shaving soap to the area.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, outstanding quality and no problem whatsoever like other shaving brushes with any distinct unpleasant odor!</li>
            <li>and Amazon shouldn&#x27;t make me put down more words than I need to review a product.</li>
            <li>If you use a badger brush to shave, make sure it is bristles down in a holder when not in use.  </li>
            <li>sure that you store it vertically, with the bristles hanging down.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you hang it upside down or on its side though to help it maintain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sure to care for it correctly by hanging it bristles down in a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll leave an updated review down the road after some more use.</li>
            <li>Be sure to store with the bristles down so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the handle and loosen the bristle glue.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hang this brush side down when storing it or the brush may get ruined.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are pretty soft, but I have an older brush from Tweezerman that is</li>
            <li>Very natural and pure badger hair.  </li>
            <li>I have found everyone usually trys to find the cheapest they can live with while the select few will drop a butt load on the best without experimenting.  </li>
            <li>A nicer and more expensive brush would be nice, but I&#x27;m stepping into these waters slowly and this brush was perfect for where I currently am with wet shaving.</li>
            <li>far as the seller goes, they shipped a terrific product, shipped quickly, and the item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I can afford the pricier models, but I get this one and bank the savings in my little girl&#x27;s college fund and feel good about the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten a much bigger bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>I can afford the pricier models, but I get this one and bank the savings in my little girl&#x27;s college fund and feel good about the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten a much bigger bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush but a little smaller than what I was used to .</li>
            <li>The overall feel is good after I learned that I have to apply at an angle an not perpendicular to my face as it is a little bit prickly that way.</li>
            <li>Good brush, lathers well but just a little big.</li>
            <li>My fiance loves his new shaving brush!</li>
            <li>My husband loves this new shaving brush!  </li>
            <li>But an average boar brush will scrub better unless you go with high end badger brushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Produces a good lather (using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream), and while it did lose 7 or 8 bristles upon first use (and a couple during each of the next few shaves), it no longer sheds.</li>
            <li>I also made sure to order the stand for the brush &amp; razor after learning how important it is to let the brush dry with the bristles down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also capable of whipping up a nice lather with hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality seems very high and so far it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t top of the line Silvertip Badger, the badger hair in this brush provides a rich wet lather with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that only the loose hairs were falling out and that after a while It would stop, but no, I have had it for months and every morning more hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole shave soap, brush, and safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Much like another reviewer, I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and using a brush to apply cream/soap.  </li>
            <li>I like it even new, and not broken in</li>
            <li>He really likes his new shaving brush and tells others too.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a shaving brush, but I am very impress with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of safety razor shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this brush to, but ice used it for a week now</li>
            <li>I just received a new brush that cost twice as much,  Guess what?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with these brushes because I am new to using them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an entry point into &amp;#34;shaving like my grandfather&amp;#34; and while I am really sold on the new way of shaving this brush has shed every time I have used it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this like 2 years ago and still does the job really well ... thinking about ordering a new one again</li>
            <li>My husband really loves using his new shaving brush with the shave bars I made him.</li>
            <li>You can get a highly regarded quality Boars hair brush like the Semogue 1305 for just a few dollars more, but if you are committed to wet shaving, you might want to go a little bit further and get the Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great, just a few hairs have come out which was expected.</li>
            <li>I have been wet shaving for a while now and the Escali brush is easy to recommend.</li>
            <li>Cost less than most boar hair shaving brushes I&#x27;ve seen in stores.  </li>
            <li>But even if they don&#x27;t I&#x27;m ok with that because it cost me less than $15</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the typical drugstore brands I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can get a better brush for less than $60 in the mall or antique shop as I have tried both.</li>
            <li>The shaving brush makes shaving less of a chore and more of a ritual to start your day or night.</li>
            <li>Some days it would be just a couple, others easily a half dozen or more.</li>
            <li>The brush creates a much better lather than my previous brush.</li>
            <li>handle is stout and fairly easy to hold even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with shaving cream (from Bath &amp; Body Works) instead of shaving soap, but I am using much less of the cream with this brush, plus i feel like i&#x27;m getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li>and all i can say this has improved my lathering alot and get a better shave then previous times.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to lather up, and it isn&#x27;t rough.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure pricier brushes lose less though).</li>
            <li>I have had this brush less than a month, but am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>My previous supermarket cheapy went 9 years and still had more hair than I.  </li>
            <li>and it is a better brush than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I tried the shaving brush and Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream and feel like I&#x27;m getting a better shave, easier to apply and using less cream</li>
            <li>previous brush was one of the ones you buy off the shelf in Walmart, and this one does perform better.</li>
            <li>As a wet shave beginner, this seemed like an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>He says he can tell it&#x27;s much better than the camel hair brush he was previously using.</li>
            <li>is to just use the top half of the brush in rapid circular strokes</li>
            <li>The reviews mentioned the boar bristle brushes typically have more body to them.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it creates a much better lather than previous brushes I have owned.</li>
            <li>it is slightly prickly, but thats ok.</li>
            <li>Better size than the previous one was I was using from a start up package.</li>
            <li>Bristles are firm, but not at prickly as my old one, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Makes great lather and does not leave behind bristles, ever, so far anyway.</li>
            <li>my older brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be looking for a better product and different brand!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a decent shaving brush for a while</li>
            <li>I would recommend soaking it it warm water for a few minutes to take away the natural smell it has.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaving brush to replace my older shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The critter odor does dissipate after a couple weeks of steady use.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying a cheaper product that is rated decently, because that&#x27;s what this brush is: decent.    </li>
            <li>A classic, &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>So, I mainly went off the reviews from others.  </li>
            <li>Got this to replace an older bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help reduce irritation, which is my main purpose for buying the brush.</li>
            <li>Badger hair brushes are not cheap, but the price of the ESCALI takes the financial pain out of owning a good quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I had bought an inexpensive brush from a local store and it fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li>Good enough for everyday shaving, and priced so that you can toss it into your shave bag for travel.</li>
            <li>Its decent for the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased an older shaving brush at an estate sale, which got me started using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Has lost a decent amount of bristles.</li>
            <li>The biggest issue I have with it is hairs are coming out of it in clumps and at this rate it will only last me a month or two at most.</li>
            <li>Three main problems&lt;</li>
            <li>Once you use it a few times it fans out more and really works well</li>
            <li>It works very well, I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and so far it&#x27;s holding up very well</li>
            <li>Decent brush for the money</li>
            <li>A decent shaving brush for beginners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li>A decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>I am sure that&#x27;s why some are much more expensive</li>
            <li>I ordered a much more expensive brush, hopefully its better then this.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a decent, no frills shaving brush...</li>
            <li>It is a decent beginner brush and will do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I&#x27;ve never used any of the more expensive, high-end brushes, I&#x27;m sure there are nicer ones out there</li>
            <li>Classic cream-colored wood handle.</li>
            <li>hope I don&#x27;t have to replace it any time soon, but if I do (accident, loss), I&#x27;d most likely buy the same brush, from here!</li>
            <li>I will most likely give it 5 stars in the future if it stops losing a couple bristles with every shave.</li>
            <li>You actually end up applying lather with the side of the brush more than the actual tip.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for my husband because he wanted to keep a brush in our downstairs bathroom and our main bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Better than products 5-6 times more expensive.</li>
            <li>Be realistic when considering this brush.  </li>
            <li>Looks classic.</li>
            <li>This brush is of decent quality.</li>
            <li>It is adequate but just a tiny bit skimpy in that regard.  </li>
            <li>After having a beard for many years, I decided to go back to a younger, cleaner look and started shaving again.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for people on a budget and still want a decent shave.</li>
            <li>No odor like tweezerman, decent size, works well.</li>
            <li>He loves it and I will most likely purchase one in the future.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;would definitely consider choose a better quality the next time !</li>
            <li>Decent brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does shed off some hairs over time, but even after almost daily use for a more than a year it  still seems to have about 70 percent brush hairs left.</li>
            <li>This product just works and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that that bristles get all stuck together and matted.</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li>My old brush which I&#x27;m ready to replace does a much nicer job than this one.</li>
            <li>The main reason I gave this 4 stars is the price.</li>
            <li>I have three main points as to why I deducted stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems you gotta spend fifty bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li>There is no funky smell, it works well, and has not fallen apart after 2 weeks of steady use.</li>
            <li>This was more a brush to ease my way into wetshaving without spending a lot, and I&#x27;ll likely make a future purchase for a nicer brush.</li>
            <li>A decent Badger haired brush can cost you over $100.00.</li>
            <li>as I started using my Lavender shave cream daily, that smell quickly</li>
            <li>main point is that the brush works and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Even if you could work up a decent lather with it, it can&#x27;t hold the lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since any experience has made me want to repeat it as quickly, and often as possible and this brush help&#x27;s make DE shaving that experience.  </li>
            <li>After only three days in my shower (NOT in direct contact with water) the plastic-y film that makes the wood smooth and shiny looking is chipping off.</li>
            <li>Why spend any more money on a much more expensive brush?  </li>
            <li>but it gets the job done for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick fix by throwing some epoxy on it and sticking it back it</li>
            <li>A decent starter brush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use a mild soap, consider a different brush.</li>
            <li>My main concern at the moment is the amount of hairs it sheds.</li>
            <li>After several cleanings the brush has lost its odor and softened up tremendously.</li>
            <li>I recently left my Art of Shaving (lower end) brush in a hotel room and needed one quick.</li>
            <li>The issue with my particular brush was a one time issue.</li>
            <li>and I cannot see how much better it can get with more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to appreciate this Escali brush more, now that I&#x27;ve compared it to a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>But for now, it works, and for the price, I would say it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been shedding steadily into my soap since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent shave brush</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but want a decent brush get an Omega than.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not losing too much bristle when I clean it and comb it once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>After watching a couple YouTube clips on proper usage (newbie to using a safety razor/shaving balm) use this brush every morning to make a great thick foam.</li>
            <li>It lathers the cream, and puts it onto your face before you shave, and it does a decent job of it.</li>
            <li>Whips up a nice fluffy lather in no time and then applies the lather softly.</li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection, but I was expecting a decent product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush, but I am wonderfully satisfied with it over against the boar brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>several week late, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>first couple of times there was some hair loss and a funny order, but the last 2 times no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find maybe 3 hairs that fall out each shave, but it isn&#x27;t really an issue--I think most of these lose a few each shave.</li>
            <li>Decent badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li>The local retails store offered a similar shaving brush for more than three time the cost of this produce.  </li>
            <li>I will likely buy a couple more for my adults sons for their next birthdays.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, nice heft to the handle but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I finally got around to using my brush tonight after my old fairly cheap badger brush broke.</li>
            <li>The brush held water well and helped give a quick lather, but I noticed that the lather started to go from a shiny white to off-white and eventually darker and darker.</li>
            <li>This newer one has a different finish on its handle, it is more of a sealant, similar to Semogue wood handles, than a varnish like on the older version.</li>
            <li>more than several bristles have fallen out and still occasionally one comes out after a couple weeks of shaving with it.</li>
            <li>Decent brush.</li>
            <li>so it may give off a smell initially, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>After that initial wash / prep, I only had 2-3 more bristles fall of during my shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the history to compare and rate the quality of the brush, seems decent.  </li>
            <li>I discovered the benefits of the badger hair brush and bought this particular based on the price point and reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>Use short quick circular motions to apply the foam to the face.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to get some decent equipment.</li>
            <li>As a result...shaving is quick and simple.</li>
            <li>a bit smaller than I expected but nicely made</li>
            <li>but then i just put super glue and left it over night.</li>
            <li>Decent brush.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t ever shaved with brush and regular razor before, but I love the feel of both and the low cost!</li>
            <li>Most people who only get 6 months out of a brush are not properly handling it during use.</li>
            <li>As soon as I am able I will try a more expensive brush to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Mother downside is the strong animal smell when the brush was wet.  </li>
            <li>The hairs seem strongly seated in the handle after about 10 shaves, with minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li>Not really that strong.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a brush so some of my complaints might just be part of the whole dynamic of a pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are a little stiff vs. ideal for me, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>The price is fair, but it does loose hairs like some other people have said.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as my thirty-year-old fine English badger, which would probably cost in the hundreds now, but it makes foam easier and seems to be a little better at raising the stubble.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little pokey to my sensitive face, but love the hot lather shave that results.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and holds in the soap very well when I shave.</li>
            <li>This brush has worn in well and has become very soft and bristle fast.  </li>
            <li>The brush is reasonably priced and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and pliable giving a very even application of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO INTERESTED PARTIES: this brush MUST be stored hanging upside-down or on its side; the flat part of the handle easily supports the brush in an upright position, but if you store it that way after using it, the brush will not only start to get a funky smell</li>
            <li>Also, most brushed result in using less shaving cream, but this brush actually requires more than normal.</li>
            <li>I observed very very few hair loss from the brush in the first 2 months of use which is really phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well so far!</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are a little softer than I would prefer, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>Most of which complained about quality and hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the brush pretty fast</li>
            <li>I bought this brush when I was first getting into double edge razors and wet shaving, and did not know any better, and hope this review saves someone else money</li>
            <li>The Escali brush is made with quality and has very soft badger hair!</li>
            <li>Delivered very promptly, I think even one day early!</li>
            <li>My very first use with this brush and it was relatively coarse, although it did get the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very soft and supple!</li>
            <li>Spend an extra $5-8 and get a good boar brush, that will last you a long time</li>
            <li>told there are some cheap ones at walmart i can try until i can shell out some more money for a higher priced brush, and i think ill try that.</li>
            <li>It left a few bristles on my face and I would expect that over time it will lose some bristles but it kind of worried me when it lost some the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>nice wood handle, lost only a few bristles at first, and has been stable</li>
            <li>I expected and compared to others I&#x27;ve tried using before, the bristles seem not to be as firm as the higher dollar ones, but for $12 or so, its a good way to try out the brush/shaving soap method.</li>
            <li>It produces a good, thick lather and makes shaving a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am new to the old school technique of shaving and this is the first brush that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Great brush for price a little stiff at first</li>
            <li>Stiff but soft bristles make a nice lather and scrub the face well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff enough so that I can build a good lather.</li>
            <li>Started out kinda of stiff but, over time has become nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for more than a month of daily shaving and can report that it is sturdy, soft and just as good as the more expensive products I have previously used.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the brush performance relative to my previous synthetic brush.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the brush thoroughly and hang it with the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li>It had a strong animal smell for the first few uses, but the smell is almost gone now.  </li>
            <li>For my first few shaves, the scent of animal hair was extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>That said, I do not notice the brush being any less full or useful, just a bit disconcerting that it keeps losing bristles.</li>
            <li>The smell from the brush faded over the first few uses, but remained strong.</li>
            <li>It shed quite a bit over the first few uses, but I&#x27;m now at a month in and it is holding strong.</li>
            <li>I will mention that is has a pretty strong animal smell at the beginning and is somewhat rough but after running it through hot water and shaving cream several times, the smell has gone away and the hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush for the money,had it a couple of weeks with no major issues, still sheds a little</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone who is looking at getting into the correct was to shave.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m just saying that the dirt and funk on this one was noticeably high.</li>
            <li>This brush was highly recommended, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Escali for the price and quality..</li>
            <li>If you never owned a badgers hair shaving brush because of its high dollar price tag....</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, refined, and amazing brush for the man looking for a new wet shaving brush.</li>
            <li>When it is time for me to get a new one I will more then likely purchase this same one.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it about 100 bristles fell out, making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean , Shake to Fluff &amp; Dry .</li>
            <li>It has a very affordable price compared to some of the other available shaving brushes, $12 vs $50 approx.</li>
            <li>It sheds a lot of hair and has a smell of a dead animal, other than that a great brush</li>
            <li>I bought this brush due to the low price and the amazing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I said, I have no real comparisons for it, and it does  do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>but i expected that from a $12 brush so its fine for a beginner not looking to spend a lot of money</li>
            <li>A tad rough at first,however,  this brush has tremendous value in regards to quality and price.i will purchase another when this ine expires! ....</li>
            <li>The other brushes that I own would stop shedding after a month of use, but this one still sheds a hair occasionally.</li>
            <li>but given this works so well I&#x27;m curious to see what all the fuss is about with premium fine badger brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning works really well just make sure to rinse well with plenty of water so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfectly fine for a beginner, but you will probably want to upgrade if you continue wet shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a fine brush to get started with the art of wet shaving, but now I am looking to upgrade to a nicer brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really in a position to compare brushes, but this seems fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity it won&#x27;t last long because the bristles spread very nicely on the face and work the soap into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few times that I soaked the brush, it really leaked color/paint, like a cheap, new cloth.</li>
            <li>It is soft and has a large surface area of use.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but strong and stiff enough to whip up the cream easily and hold more than enough for multiple shaves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usable, but I bought from Escali expecting a little better from the brand.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>A little sandpaper to remove the varnish eliminates the slipperiness in soapy water – making it a much better product.</li>
            <li>On my next Badger hair brush, I&#x27;ll do that first!</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get an Omega and/or synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anything major and stopped after the first week of use.</li>
            <li>I little grandpa like but who cares? :)</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on forum sites about brushes and was a bit leery about spending so little on this brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got a sub-par brush, but I would recommend spending a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your initial investment like I did, and don&#x27;t let bogus products like this one take away from the enjoyment you can get from a good old school shave!</li>
            <li>That little badger sure does lather me up.  </li>
            <li>but it is a little more than should be acceptable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see it be a little softer and not lose as many bristles.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but using a brush and shave soap is way better than getting shaving cream all over my hands every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I rinsed it with hot water really well to get any loose hairs out.</li>
            <li>Decent for wet shave starters because it is cheap but that is about it.</li>
            <li>Sheds a bit on first few uses, but then is fine.</li>
            <li>Lost a few hairs the first couple of shaves but is now fine.</li>
            <li>It lathers the soap and my face well, is soft, easy to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li>Also, the wooden handle is very easy to hold onto with wet and soapy hands.</li>
            <li>Very soft and makes a much better lather than my previous brush.  </li>
            <li>You can create a thick lather very easily without having to use much shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t really caused major issues, but I really hope it stops shedding soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trick is to use a little more water than you would do with a normal nylon brush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of hard against your face.  </li>
            <li>Other badger hair brushes contain a strong, wet-wool-like odor that lingers for about three months.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely with creams, I have not used with hard soap (I use a Muhle synthetic for that), and I can get 3 to 4 passes, no sweat, without drying out.</li>
            <li>The only reason I rate it a 4 instead of 5 is because it does loose brush hairs more often when soaping up then the more expensive brushes i have, but you can buy 4 to 1 which more then makes up for it.</li>
            <li>However, after his old brush completely fell apart, he started using this one and has come to like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Mine has a slight issue where the there&#x27;s a hole in the topmost layer right down into the knot, but honestly this doesn&#x27;t really affect anything</li>
            <li>My first foray into shaving with a safety razor and this brush came up very highly recommended on various shaving sites.</li>
            <li>I will say that the first couple times I used it that the brush was a little prickly but after 3-5 uses it has been broken in and is soft and works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>This brush holds at least an ounce of water but a hard shake will remove that and a good squeeze will remoe even more.</li>
            <li>Mine had a strong animal musk sent when wet for the first few days but is fading significantly</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, as soon as this one goes bad,  this product is awesome .It</li>
            <li>Great Brush have used for a week now and find this Brush works superbly, Can&#x27;t go wrong with this gem, Lather&#x27;s the soap</li>
            <li>Your&#x27;s replaced the needs so far very well.  </li>
            <li>Holding up very well so far.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>One first of the Art of Shaving, purchased a few things realized I made a huge mistake</li>
            <li>Soft on my face and really lathers the shave cream up.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and soap foams up very well.  </li>
            <li>I have used a badger shaving brush military officers used to get for free - don&#x27;t remember the brand.</li>
            <li>With a light touch, just pressing slightly and loading the brush with foam from the soap dish often you get a decent lather that is not as valuminous as a synthetic brush but has a much denser foam</li>
            <li>Great entry-level brush for those looking to get nostalgic and shave the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li>I have not used it a lot so far as this is not a system you can use fast.  </li>
            <li>This brush, while a tiny bit smaller, is so much softer than the brush I got from the Van der Hagen shaving set (I know it&#x27;s cheap).</li>
            <li>So much that I can&#x27;t even smell my Old Bond Almond Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li>Rub tip against a dry clean towel.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and dry when not using it</li>
            <li>The brush is soft on the face and it holds soap really we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li>I chose this primarily because of its price as I was just getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than my boar brush - the bristles are soft and help create a lot of lather.  </li>
            <li>Some bristles fell out early on, but I think I may have been using too much pressure on my soap.</li>
            <li>The bristles are also cheap grade and rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>My old boar hair brush is much stiffer and does not flatten out like this one.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that for 12 bucks I could get an very acceptable brush.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and really appreciate the softness of the brush.</li>
            <li>I started out wet shaving by purchasing a cheap badger brush,</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s soft and I really like using it.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal old school brush with quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my father as a replacement for his old brush and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>When testing brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t brush the face directly as you have no idea how much that brush has been handled and what&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li>After using several different brushes at this point and knowing what REAL badger hair looks, feels, and smells (yes this is important)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for someone on a budget or someone who wants to try out old timey shaving without investing a lot.</li>
            <li>I spoke with someone who has been straight razor shaving for 30 years and using a variety brushes,he completely agreed and said it should never fall apart.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my experience that with a brush and old style soap you have a much nicer shaving experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bushy, soft brush that holds moisture very well.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement and is so far working very well.</li>
            <li>but that was all most gone after a few uses.</li>
            <li>so maybe that is normal.</li>
            <li>, it was a lot thicker than my normal brush.</li>
            <li>Most brushes have a period of shedding that subsides after a few uses; this one is still shedding after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s well constructed and worth the price.</li>
            <li>well worth the extra pop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some of the hairs come out after use, seems like normal wear and tear to me.    </li>
            <li>It drops a few hairs, but loads well and lathers even better.</li>
            <li>Kind of gets irritating, but this is my first brush</li>
            <li>I guess thats just normal wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>Then when done, wash it by running under hot water and gently squeezing the later out.</li>
            <li>To get rid of the smell I left the brush in fresh squeezed lemon juice for an hour.</li>
            <li>Their was some shedding, two maybe three bristles, but I assume that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds just enough water, I feel like it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It was good in its time, but since we can&#x27;t turn the clock back to when men were men, just go with the technology edge and let the past repose.</li>
            <li>I assume this to be normal.</li>
            <li>Only used it a few times so far, but seems like a good brush.</li>
            <li>This brush smells like a boar&#x27;s ass, but I think that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>I rarely see a bristle come out on a daily basis now.  </li>
            <li>and I see no negative attributes.  </li>
            <li>It should be better, but it might take a few hours or a day.</li>
            <li>For the decently low price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it normal or not</li>
            <li>Note sure how long you&#x27;d have to keep the same brush to make up the cost in shaving cream savings.</li>
            <li>only issue is that it&#x27;s not overly soft, but not bad.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really speak on it&#x27;s durability over time, however it does shed a strand or two of hair per use which i find to be acceptable and normal from what I&#x27;ve read of natural brushes in this price range.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t know if all these issues are normal.</li>
            <li>Price considered, I still think it&#x27;s a solid 5 star and absolutely worth the price if you&#x27;re thinking about moving up from a boar brush.</li>
            <li>If you want a quality brush that is going to last a long time, then check out some of the better brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to last for a decade or anything, but it was definitely worth a look while I was just trying to get into shaving with lather.</li>
            <li>Although it loses bristles after use, it&#x27;s a handy product and tool for shaving.</li>
            <li>I went back to old fashion double sided blades and love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an everyday brush till I have the money to spend on a better one.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a few boys out there with tender hands:).</li>
            <li>Sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>every once in a while a bristle will fall out, but it seems to be normal.</li>
            <li>I went through the normal process to break in this badger brush and still, it sheds like a dog in June.  </li>
            <li>It looks just as good as the expensive ones and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no problems.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>but I think that is normal?</li>
            <li>After the normal conditioning procedure, it works well.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Most shaving brushes either lose hair or disintegrate after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be a long lasting worthwhile brush.</li>
            <li>Next to no &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and the bristles are soft and thick, providing great coverage of his shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Are these part of normal break in?  </li>
            <li>It does shed some hair with use, but I figure that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It start loosing hair after first use but not as much as purchsed from CVS for same price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied for the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this brush.</li>
            <li>If this is normal behavior for this brush, please help me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth it to spend the extra money and get what you pay for when it comes to shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>I will review again after a few months to make sure the brush holds up well.</li>
            <li>Oh and you can use normal shaving cream with it too -</li>
            <li>Sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but it may last so long that i don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>I got this as my first brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much and overall</li>
            <li>is perfectly normal-</li>
            <li>and I will update this after a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is normal for a badger brush.  </li>
            <li>but I expect this is normal.</li>
            <li>had it long enough to know about longevity, but after the break-in period, so to speak, it hasn&#x27;t been losing too many hairs.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d give it a 4/5, and say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>This brush picks up soap and turns it into a rich lather much faster than other brushes I have owned...</li>
            <li>So I tried a few more times.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if all badger hair does this or not, but when I use it, even when loaded with soap (Old Spice Swagger Bar Soap) it smells kind of funky.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have noticed some some shedding, not a ton and again this is probably normal</li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal given the price, but worth noting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure will also last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that, but have since heard that is normal for any brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal shape each morning.</li>
            <li>Some bristles will fall out but that is a consequence of normal use.</li>
            <li>Save a few more bucks for a nicer one.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t review things</li>
            <li>I am having fun getting to know how to use it properly</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also got an Art of Shaving travel brush that I paid a few dollars more for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that there is some shedding of the hairs when I lather up, which I don&#x27;t know is normal or not.  </li>
            <li>Probably it is normal.</li>
            <li>and so far its in good shape (only a few bristles dangling) in combo with the Escali brush stand.</li>
            <li>it works up into a nice thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice the brush has achieved a nice thick blossom&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The badger hair is nice and thick, lathers the shaving soap and applies it without issue.</li>
            <li>Nice thick brush, quality handle.</li>
            <li>Nice thick well made brush that produces alot of lather.</li>
            <li>Good not great brush.</li>
            <li>the only downside I done is that it tends to shed and loose a couple of hairs after watch use but other than that it&#x27;s a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an inexpensive but high quality badger brush to start getting into wetshaving, and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips for new guys to wetshaving:&lt;br /&gt;-Make</li>
            <li>I wanted a shaving brush for some new high end shaving cream.</li>
            <li>trio out performs the new high tech b.s at 5th the price</li>
            <li>I did notice that there was a slight &amp;#34;wet animal&amp;#34; smell for the first week or so of use -- but honestly, isn&#x27;t that to be expected in a brush with real natural fibers?  </li>
            <li>As my first brush, it definitely has introduced me to a whole new world of shaving like a man.  </li>
            <li>This brush is soft yet stiff enough to generate a good lather.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a fine brush for its price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives: it lathers in a cup nicely, is readily cleaned (by rinsing and flicking), dries quickly and gets *enough* soap on my face to (albeit barely)</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>After the fix, the brush works fine, other than the glue problem</li>
            <li>First of all, applying shaving cream with a brush simply feels better than using your hand as it messages the cream into your skin and helps generate a decent lather with little effort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You cannot beat the price and performance of this brush for a travel or primary brush, or if you are new to the wet shave experience.  </li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and wanted a cheap brush to learn how to maintain and use them.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new brush or a replacement for an old worn out one, you really should consider this one.  </li>
            <li>everyday it sheds a bunch at this rate it&#x27;ll be bald in a new more months</li>
            <li>He said it is very soft and is high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using less soap than with my old brush and getting a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>sure to dry the brush properly!</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and a solid wood handle</li>
            <li>He has been pleased with it so far, which has been about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li>I find myself using less cream because this brush makes better foam than my old brush.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s face is super soft after using this brush and actual shave cream.</li>
            <li>when using this type of premium brush is to make sure it has a place to dry properly which is why I bought Escali&#x27;s Razor and Brush stand.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to dry it extra well</li>
            <li>It builds up a good foam in just a few seconds and the bristles have not become dry, brittle or scratchy.  </li>
            <li>The biggest complaint i have is the presence of a distinct almost horse like odor to he brush that still clings strong to it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are weaker/floppier than my previous brush, and so it is harder to work up a good lather and apply.  </li>
            <li>This is my 1st experience with traditional wet shaving, so, while I don&#x27;t have the benefit of having used other brushes, this one works great for me.</li>
            <li>soft enough for my sensitive skin and provides a rich lather bristles have held up well and have had no issues with the construction of the brush</li>
            <li>This is the third brush I have bought, all at reasonable costs, and yet this is better than the other two.</li>
            <li>When warmed in water for a few seconds, it holds just enough to make a rich lather that goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Other than the occasional shedding it is of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush lathers just fine and probably has a lower overall useful life than a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and creates a nice thick lather.  </li>
            <li>This may be normal for a new brush.</li>
            <li>I dismissed this as something normal with a brand new brush, but that is not the case.</li>
            <li>BTW I am getting almost as many shaves from a single double edge blade as with a &#x27;5 blade&#x27; cartridge.</li>
            <li>definitely did not have any smell to it when I took it right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>Wish the brush was a bit more stiff.</li>
            <li>I wanted a badger-hair brush that would last, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on one right out the shoot.</li>
            <li>This brush is made well, the wood handle is solid and feels right in the hand.</li>
            <li>Only downfall for me is that right out of the box, pieces of badger hair fall out on each use.</li>
            <li>I may need to try several brands to get the right brush for me.</li>
            <li>Again, this abates with time and use... use the break-in procedure linked above to reduce the prickly feeling right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only was the price right</li>
            <li>I am on the road a lot for work, and opted for a cheaper brush as a back up and could tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I put it right back</li>
            <li>The badger hair seems rather prickly and somewhat more stiff, but I&#x27;m guessing that will go away in time.</li>
            <li>After many shaves is still stiff and loosing pieces.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>- Sharp and prickly, regardless of how long it&#x27;s soaked in warm water</li>
            <li>A simple rinse under the sink and it&#x27;s clean and ready for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend getting a brush stand</li>
            <li>I would expect better quality and not expect hairs to come loose regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and comfortable when applying shaving cream, and it&#x27;s durable insofar as, the bristles don&#x27;t come loose or fall out.</li>
            <li>Received this brush as a gift for my son who wants to be an \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaver using a single edge sharp razor and mix his own soap and lather it on..</li>
            <li>When I opened the package and first soaked it in hot water, it smelled like hot badger booty, but after a little soap and a rinse, the smell is all but gone.  </li>
            <li>Firstly the brush is a little more coarse</li>
            <li>Yes it will lose a few bristles with every use but it works just the same as a high dollar chrome or rose gold plated Merkur or Muhle.</li>
            <li>I have a really good sense of smell and detected no strange oder from the brush wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Badger hairs bristles are soft and it creates a rich lather but during first use, lot of black color come out.</li>
            <li>Maybe expensive brushes are &#x27;better,&#x27; but this one is fine</li>
            <li>Being clipped to shape there is a slight prickly character to the brush at first, but it fades quickly with use.</li>
            <li>However, this may have just been a matter of breaking in the item, as this was only particularly noticeable the first time I used the brush.  </li>
            <li>I have no other badger brush to compare it to, but I certainly prefer it to the plastic thing I was using before.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other models.  </li>
            <li>My search for a budget friendly wet shave brush continues.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is built well, but the boars hair brushes offered in other brushes are just as cheap and softer.</li>
            <li>It lost a fair number the first couple days (to be expected), and now it loses about 1 hair a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both comfortable and extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>It will shade a little but for the money it is way better than old brush</li>
            <li>little stiffer than i expected, good for the price.</li>
            <li>At first it had such thick, abundant bristles, the shaving cream almost got lost in it.</li>
            <li>I rated only four stars because it would have been nice if it came with a little stand - even a plastic one would do.</li>
            <li>It is not terribly repulsive, and the brush is well worth it if you can tough it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush 4 times since I got it, but it seems to be a pretty high quality brush.</li>
            <li>After using it, my shave soap dish was full of loose hairs from the brush.</li>
            <li>My fatger saiid he needed a new shaving brush</li>
            <li>my new brush is all that a person could ask for.</li>
            <li>New to the DE shaving scene - I have used my brush for about 2 weeks now and a couple hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li>plus i would probably want to get a new one</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll need to buy a new one eventually, the badger hair does fall out, but it&#x27;s a strand or two per shave.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles aren&#x27;t springy like when it was new and it doesn&#x27;t apply the lotion as well as it did.</li>
            <li>This order arrived within a couple of days of being ordered and arrived new in the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li>The brush is one-third of my new shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of safety razors/DE razors/wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have since started using the new brush.</li>
            <li>Used it around fifty times and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day along with a new razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving brushes but thought I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li>As a guy who just started shaving using safety razors and shaving soap,I found the Badger brush to live up to my expectations by making the process alot easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;10-8-17 time for a new one.</li>
            <li>New to this type of shaving gear</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get what you pay for, I am new to this type of shaving (safety razor)</li>
            <li>I contact the seller and they sent me a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s gonna happen with any new brush you get.</li>
            <li>I was new to DE shaving when I got this</li>
            <li>That might be because it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>I will buy again when I am in need of a new brush</li>
            <li>I have not had opportunity to use the New brush.</li>
            <li>I chose this brush for its price point, since I was new to the process.  </li>
            <li>New user of safety razor</li>
            <li>and it will be my new go to one.</li>
            <li>The new brush arrived in a couple days.  </li>
            <li>You do that with any new brush to &amp;#34;clean</li>
            <li>Everytime I use it, it feels like it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably need a new brush before new</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s because this brush is new and just needs to wear in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of new to this, so I can&#x27;t say if this is suppose to happen or not, or it</li>
            <li>so maybe these are all things you have to contend with using a new badger brush.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and have an Escali brush and Bond Street Sandalwood soap.</li>
            <li>I will have to buy a new brush soon, as this one has withered away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this style of shaving and accessories.</li>
            <li>have had no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just new</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lather: I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li>But as a tool to start a new tradition in shaving</li>
            <li>I am new to using a safety razor and a brush for shaving foam, this brush performs well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a brush for shaving, so, I have no reference for comparison.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d go for a new brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to the quality shave movement, so I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank on supplies, but I wanted a quality brush as well.</li>
            <li>My son is new to the shave brush and loves the feel of the brush on his face.</li>
            <li>and I know that some day soon I will need a new one.  </li>
            <li>but it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who is new to using a Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>This is all new to me</li>
            <li>I have used it for three weeks now and still looks and feels new.  </li>
            <li>so i started looking for a new one .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a shaving brush and bought this when I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this is just because the brush is new.</li>
            <li>but i can live witht hat</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have a bit of musk to it when it is new...</li>
            <li>I will be buying a new brush.</li>
            <li>Newly purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking to switch to a safety two edge razor, or if you are looking for a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li>it is on to this new Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>but I would expect that on any brush that is new.  </li>
            <li>I can live with that though.</li>
            <li>I used for 7 months still looks new.</li>
            <li>It was prickly at the beginning, when new, but is softening with use and does not shed.</li>
            <li>and it looks like new each morning.</li>
            <li>If you are new to this shaving method, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for three months, use it 2-5 times a week, and I don&#x27;t foresee needing a new one for a while.</li>
            <li>When I pulled the brush out of the box when it was new, I ran it across my face to see how it felt.  </li>
            <li>Like I said I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li>I have newly returned to the world of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a safety razor, shaving brush, etc.  </li>
            <li>There is not a lot of info or reviews for us ladies out there who want to try or are new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>After just a two weeks ordered a new silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a new experience to me.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li>I decided to spring for a new one (and a mug).  </li>
            <li>I am a new user to shaving brushes so my feedback may be colored by that....  </li>
            <li>Have had it for a couple months and still looks like new.</li>
            <li>After a year , still like new.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li>My new go to.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d try a new one.</li>
            <li>New home, garbage can.  </li>
            <li>Good value at half the price of other brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a whole new way to go green and have smooth legs every day.</li>
            <li>Escali sent me a new brush, and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing many bristles after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush since I only recently got into safety razor shaving, but seems fine to me, but as others have mentioned it is shedding already after only about a month.</li>
            <li>You must remember to clean lightly, don&#x27;t be rough when cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice on the face and after about 4 weeks has only lost a few bristles.  </li>
            <li>First I\\&quot;ll use some hot water on it and wet my face that way.</li>
            <li>Remembering my grandfather&#x27;s shaving practices, I wanted to abandon modern commercial foaming shaving creams/gels and use a brush like a \\&quot;real man!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I am particularly grateful with the fact the brush is natural material.</li>
            <li>Second shave was a bit better, but not much.</li>
            <li>While I love wet shaving I have met cats with medical problems that don&#x27;t lose their hair like this brush.</li>
            <li>The wood handle is classic looking, which I like, and the badger bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>But, the soap is only half the key to a good shave ..</li>
            <li>Obviously, if you&#x27;re looking at getting this brush you are not ready to spend the money for a top end brush.</li>
            <li>The wood handle gives it a classic look and feels natural when held.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never used one of these before or eve know how to, but I wet the thing in water first, then rubbed it around the shaving soap, and the badger hairs start falling out consistently.</li>
            <li>Do normal soap wash and rinse prior to using the first time.  </li>
            <li>It is heads and tails above the cheap boar bristle brushes i see at pharmacies and big stores.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin, but this brush allows him to apply natural products evenly to achieve a close and gentle shave.  </li>
            <li>I give it a quick rinse and shake it dry after use</li>
            <li>Bought this brush based on reviews and it makes a great lather with Taylor of old bond street for the price of this brush you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>It had been more than 30 years from my last experience with a DE razor, when i decided to give wet shaving a shot again.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the second week of use you could see a nice bloom shape on the dried brush.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, so be sure to check the product listing for the dimensions.  </li>
            <li>No matter how gentle you are it looses entirely too much hair.</li>
            <li>He has been using it for a few weeks now, &amp; likes it much better than his old brush.</li>
            <li>Given that shave shops will charge upwards of $50 on the low end for a real badger hair brush, I don&#x27;t have much to complain about here.</li>
            <li>We wanted to give him the chance to learn more about wet shaving - my husband has been using a safety razor and a brush for shaving for years now and definitely feels it&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Van Der Hagen boar bristle brush with plastic handle because that was the only thing available locally.</li>
            <li>Glad we spent the $$ on something that will last.</li>
            <li>Builds a good thick lather and will stand up to years and years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little brush, especially if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend dozens of dollars to get a decent brush that you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re going to use for more than a week.</li>
            <li>My first brush didn&#x27;t last long (it came in a kit), and I wasn&#x27;t ready to drop major money on a super fancy new brush, but I wanted the badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The surface is not as smooth as in other more expensive brushes and it lost more bristles than I expected during the first uses.</li>
            <li>Smells a little when first use; goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>At the beginning there were a few hairs that had come loose, so you may want to perform fairly vigorous early inspection of the brush to get those out of the way.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a fine brush to pass down to your kids...</li>
            <li>dries just fine laying down on its side.</li>
            <li>This brush has VERY soft hairs.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this brush if you want to start shaving the old fashion way again.</li>
            <li>Unless my brush is a defect, I find it very soft and &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>He likes it and it is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>It has a very modest look and price, which I like.</li>
            <li>It works well and is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>Very soft and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>It seems well built and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and lathers up well.</li>
            <li>very soft .and</li>
            <li>Not as soft as some high end ones though.</li>
            <li>Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting one of these if you want to try the old school style shave.</li>
            <li>It also has a very soft feel on my face.  </li>
            <li>trustworthy store very professional</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift for my partner to replace his very old brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft and doesn’t irritate the face.</li>
            <li>Feels very soft, haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>Very soft on the face</li>
            <li>For the money, the Escali brush is very soft and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft feels.</li>
            <li>I use an oil pre-shave from Kiehls which helps my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft, hairs are falling off after 15uses.</li>
            <li>Very surprised by the quality of this inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li>I read that some users said it wasn&#x27;t very soft on their face.</li>
            <li>Very soft, have lost no strands.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin and was bleeding always.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, and lathers the soap nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been VERY gentle with the brush when lathering in the shaving cup; only the tips of the bristles touch.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft brush on your face.</li>
            <li>All badgers hair is very soft and supple, it feels like cashmere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture - very soft.</li>
            <li>Although slightly softer than previous brushes, I was originally taken aback by the amount of bristles it lost, specially during the first week of shaving.  </li>
            <li>There were a few loose bristles the first time I used it but other than that its been great.</li>
            <li>This brush has a nice wooden handle and fairly stiff hair.</li>
            <li>Handle is large and very solid, the brush itself is soft and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>Look, pure badger brushes can cost serious cash, and I found myself strongly drawn to this item because of its reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s dry, if there are stray hairs sticking out at right angles to the main knot, just snip them off.</li>
            <li>Since the brush is not as full as some others, the lather tends to cool a little quicker than bigger brushes.</li>
            <li>I actually have a much cheaper brush I got from Target that I like a little better.  </li>
            <li>There is very little hair loss from the brush and am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>The brush was soft, effective and only took a little bit of time to break in.</li>
            <li>I bought a few brushes and razors, and this one has held up better than expected, losing very few hairs and taking a good bit of abuse.</li>
            <li>I was long due for a shaving brush and this filled the need just right.</li>
            <li>In past, low price has mean a pig bristle brush - OK but not as good as a badger bristle  brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but was surprised by how quickly this brush fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft but still firm enough to create a good lather and massage facial hair.</li>
            <li>I rinsed the bowl clean and whipped up a new lather only to find the same results.  </li>
            <li>I just went back to single edge wet shaving recently and this brush is great.</li>
            <li>I expected a cheap imitation of &amp;#34;badger hair&amp;#34; but this is the real thing and very much a bargain when compared to Shaving Supply Stores.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m going to spend a little more and get a little more.  </li>
            <li>As such, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li>I feel so classy!</li>
            <li>first brush and only brush</li>
            <li>I was so surprised!  </li>
            <li>Only issue I had with the brush is when I used it the first couple of times, the badger hair would come off into my shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>and I know they are exactly the same brushes.  </li>
            <li>Not excessive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had since switching to my double edge razor.</li>
            <li>The only problem i had with this brush is that when i first began using it, it shed a lot of bristles, but htis turned out to be temporary because it stopped.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I picked up when I got into traditional shaving with a DE Safety razor setup and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of purchasing a natural boars brush to start with....what a mistake!</li>
            <li>Much better at lathering than the two brushes I have gone through in the past year.  </li>
            <li>Just like old Granddad!</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher, however, it continues to lose several hairs with every use.</li>
            <li>When first used, mine last a couple of hairs</li>
            <li>I went back to my first Burma Shave brush</li>
            <li>same exact one that we bought before</li>
            <li>The stink of this brush was  was evident not only in my bathroom, but</li>
            <li>SEVERAL hairs fell out in the first use.</li>
            <li>No idea what benefit I could possibly get by spending 4x more on other brushes</li>
            <li>Not counting the first week, only one or two hairs are lost with each shave.</li>
            <li>The loss of bristles on this item has subsided, and it&#x27;s apparently a trait of all real badger brushes, so I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li>this brush for the past 3 months and am completely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Yes it does lose bristles, especially on the first use.</li>
            <li>There are various methods out there like hot water soaks in soapy water over night, then lathering some shave soap, and leaving that sit, etc.</li>
            <li>If you do a paint brush stroke like you do when painting a wall then the low grade hair is not as evident to your face until you increase the angle of the brush upon lifting off your face.  </li>
            <li>This is my first brush, and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a while.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, several bristles came off of the brush</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend to anyone interested</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush, I would also recommend soaking the brush in hot water while you shower or wash your face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>the first use, it let out a pungent brown water, which thankfully stopped after multiple rinses and washing with my shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first shaving brush, and it did the job well enough.  </li>
            <li>The brush is not top notch, but works ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second shaving brush, my first being a boar brush.  </li>
            <li>Halfway through my first shave I simply threw the brush away and wrote off the expense.</li>
            <li>The hairs feel exactly the same as the ones on this brush.</li>
            <li>I got this for $9 - be aware Amazon changes prices constantly</li>
            <li>Not enough to notice form the brush, they are just evident in shaving bowl and on counter.</li>
            <li>Some bristles do fall off the first time using, but no big deal.</li>
            <li>if this isn&#x27;t your first brush, I would look elsewhere as this is probably not going to be an upgrade for you, but if you want to test the safety shaving waters, this is a quailty product with a very low entry fee.</li>
            <li>Some reviews point out how the brush feels the first couple of uses, but I actually like the &amp;#34;tickle.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Made the switch to old fashioned safety razors and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because I bought this based on all the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go back the electrics first), and now I know.  </li>
            <li>it once- big mistake, as she immediately sat pretty to beg for it).</li>
            <li>I soak it up in hot water prior to each use and it helps lift the whiskers to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After only seven uses, I can&#x27;t rate its long-term durability, but I only found two hairs on the shaving soap after the second use and three more after the seventh use.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy another one of these when my first one needs to be replaced</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as my first, having recently discovered the joys of shaving with a safety razor and brush on shave creams.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty big and furry brush.</li>
            <li>but it shed A LOT the first several times he used it.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this brush a 5 is because it is the first shaving brush my husband has owned, so he has nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>First time for me using such a product.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Many times the bristles in small brushes like this seem to just fall off.</li>
            <li>After 8 months or so, it started to shed bristles pretty regularly, and I just decided to upgrade to a nicer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush sheds hair and prior to the first use the wood knob disconnected from the hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t freak out if you lose some hairs early on, its normal.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it lost several of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>and it is pretty similar to this, just a tad bit softer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this extensively, and this is my first brush, so</li>
            <li>However, that was only after the first shave - no shedding at all after that.</li>
            <li>Definitely - it does exactly what I need, and</li>
            <li>I received an email form the manufacturer because my first review was only 3 stars.</li>
            <li>4 stars only because when I first ordered this brush I also received ph test strips.  </li>
            <li>bristles tend to fall out occasionally at a rate of 2 per shave, but like it said this is my first brush</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it with different brushes.  </li>
            <li>This brush does a great job of stimulating the hair prior to shaving and makes a small amount of shaving cream go a long way.</li>
            <li>, first of all it does not hold its shape, second</li>
            <li>The first several uses, it lost some bristles.  </li>
            <li>Has held up nicely so far!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than any other brush out there, because this is the only brush I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I use&lt;br /&gt;very hot water on the brush but only submerge the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First use &#x3D; badger hair mixed in with the cream.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only lost one or two hairs from it since the first week.  </li>
            <li>I wondered at first if the price indicated low quality.</li>
            <li>first several shaves it smelled like hair might have come from badgers</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first ever brush for shaving with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>My next purchase will be a higher quality classification.</li>
            <li>only problem was the smell when i first used it.</li>
            <li>Recommending to all who may consider a quality shaving brush with a professional look and quality!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is the first use I had some hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li>It shed a lot for the first 4-5 uses but now it only sheds 1 hair once and a while.</li>
            <li>This is 100% normal when you have any natural bristle</li>
            <li>I shave pretty regularly (my head, rather than my beard)</li>
            <li>The brush lost like ten or 15 hairs when I was first using it</li>
            <li>Get a badger shaving brush as some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that some of the bristles come out at first, but after a couple weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t had that problem anymore.  </li>
            <li>As this was its first use, some hairs did come lose in the lathering process, but the quality feels solid</li>
            <li>Only reason I did not give it a 5 was the loss of hairs during the first couple of shaves...</li>
            <li>My only concern is that it, at first, it lost a lot of bristles...</li>
            <li>I bought this shaving brush for myself and have used it daily for a couple of weeks now and really like it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my first time using a shaving brush, so i can&#x27;t compare the product to others in its category, but what i can say is that my shaving has improved immensely since i started using this brush.</li>
            <li>gave this brush only 3 stars because I think I could find other shaving brush the cheaper and work better than this brush.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The big loss is that the hairs consistently fall out.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve had an issue with is that it lost a LOT of bristles in the first six months of use.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush and it feels the same quality as in a barber shop.</li>
            <li>I should start by saying this is the first and only shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so perhaps all shaving brushes are like this:  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if the brush did not have such an overpowering smell at first but</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that the brush is much smaller than my Omega 48.  </li>
            <li>It is not the first Escali brush, and I hope it will not be the last.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to pick them off of my face and out of the sink, and after a few more months there probably won&#x27;t be much of this brush left.</li>
            <li>It sheds hairs every once in a while, but not excessive.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed the brush off and ran it in hot water before use however it still changed my white shave soap brown.</li>
            <li>This one here provides more lather but small in size.  </li>
            <li>Holds enough lather for 3 passes, bristles are nice and soft (though they take a few weeks to get fully softened up).  </li>
            <li>It creates a full lather and sheds minimally</li>
            <li>Other than those few things I can complain, it is a good brush.</li>
            <li>It is a nice combination of soft and firm; not too prickly, but enough so that it can work the shaving soap into my beard.</li>
            <li>It felt like a few but not all of the hairs were quite sharp and fairly irritative, but I can&#x27;t complain from a $10 brush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as a good shaving brush for someone who wants to step up their game with a badger brush, but don&#x27;t want to buy that $80 lifetime brush just yet.</li>
            <li>I have received  NO bad feedback from the actors about it being too rough on their face.</li>
            <li>Both are in the same price range, and both are highly reviewed here on amazon, but I ended up choosing this one by pure chance.</li>
            <li>The brush is not very soft, but it does make a nice lather with a little work.  </li>
            <li>... started noticing loose bristles falling off with very first use.</li>
            <li>Bristles spread more than expected after first use, though I am drying it upside down as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Little rough to start, but over the last year it has held up VERY nicely.</li>
            <li>It saves your shaving cream, because you put just a little bit of the cream on the brush, put on your face and the rest is easy...</li>
            <li>I know there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but if you are new to wet shaving ( meaning safety Razor, Straight Razor, which I use both of)</li>
            <li>Finally decided to spend a little bit of money on this and a nice shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t compared this to other pure badger brushes only the cheap boar one.</li>
            <li>gripe is how the bristles seem to dry more flared out than I&#x27;m comfortable with even hanging upside down to dry.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality with a simple clean wooden handle.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent badger brush in a reasonable price range.</li>
            <li>Overall, I say that this is a decent brush for anyone who wants to try one out without over spending.</li>
            <li>After going through three cheap drug-store boar hair brushes, I broke down and bought this.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase: I don&#x27;t shave every day and have used my new brush approximately a dozen times so far.</li>
            <li>Purchased much more expensive brushes in the past and honestly the more expensive brushes were better.</li>
            <li>This one is soft, but stiff enough to give me a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, but still stiff enough to apply the lather and lift hairs.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a con, because it&#x27;s advertised as real badger hair, but just be aware that it&#x27;s going to have a slight odor to</li>
            <li>I know that probably sounds normal, but several of the other shaving items I ordered took MUCH longer to arrive and one of them was fraudulently advertised (see link at bottom), so it was nice to see delivery come as expected when</li>
            <li>first it lost a few hairs but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;Now almost a year later this brush keeps chugging along strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and this is my very first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>With the right soap, produces a thick rich lather.</li>
            <li>I try to dry it out as good as possible and hang it bristles down.</li>
            <li>Was not impressed bought from all the positive reviews but the brush came in pretty bent up shape, the case it came in was all beat up and the brush was deformed many of the hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li>If you soak it in a heavy, heavy shampoo bath for a few hours and thoroughly rinse it out when you get it, the fairly pungent badger hair smell disappears and it actually has an attractive bloom as the hairs dry out.  </li>
            <li>I saw more expensive brushes both on Amazon and other sites; however, I bought the Escali and have liked the shave.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the brush high quality, but I get more lather in half the time compared to my old boar brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;, but this works well to lather up.</li>
            <li>I rotate from shaving &#x27;old school&#x27; and new school...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to old style safety razor shaving (have always used multi-blade ones).</li>
            <li>I had to order a new shaving bowl because he knocked my old one out of the cabinet in pursuit of this brush.  </li>
            <li>maybe that is a natural condition for all new brushes.</li>
            <li>It was a bit stiff at the beginning, but as i continue to use it it is becoming softer.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was natural for a brush to loose a half a dozen bristles per shave until I started noticing that minimal bristle loss comes up over and over again in a good review.  </li>
            <li>It is stiff enough to help lift the beard, but soft enough to feel good.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaving brush for my second home and ordered Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush from  Perella</li>
            <li>Smells bad when you first get it and sheds a lot of bristles, but great results for the price.</li>
            <li>I previously had the cheap boar bush that came as a package deal with soap and a bowl.</li>
            <li>he did mention a distinct &amp;#34;badger smell&amp;#34; the first few times he used it, but it has since faded.</li>
            <li>There might have even been a slight twinkle in my Opa&#x27;s eyes when I came downstairs with a shockingly smooth face.</li>
            <li>After washing it prior to the first use I had to pull the drain trap under my sink to clear all the hair from it.</li>
            <li>It only lasts for the first few uses and then it is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to work up a pretty solid lather with it, and it&#x27;s finer and softer than the brush I previously had, which cost about the same.</li>
            <li>The brush is quite functional and I&#x27;d recommend to others who are not too heavy handed in their technique as one could easily beat the life out of the brush within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I easily got rid of the scent of animal hair by soaking in vinegar for a few hours.</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush and as an intro into wet shaving, it leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wooden handle instead of the usual resin one that you&#x27;d get at this price, and the loft is at a nice height.</li>
            <li>, I have used it so far like 10 times and only the first 5 times aprox</li>
            <li>Pretty much useless as a shaving brush, though I supposed it could be re-purposed into some kind of paperweight.</li>
            <li>Brief notes from first couple uses -&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable on the face, soft bristles, holds lather well&lt;br /&gt;Whips</li>
            <li>but after the second time the same thing happened you can run your hand across the brush and have a hand full of hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush does have a bit of a smell when you use it the first couple times, but I expected that as its hair from a real badger.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, and the smell of badger was only noticeable for the first shave or two.  </li>
            <li>This small, plastic box has a hole near the top that you often see on products so that they can hang from walls in stores.</li>
            <li>This is my first Escali brush, and, so far, I have an idea that Escali will be my only shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is only the second shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>There was a strong animal and chemical smell for a few weeks, but now it just smells like my shave soap.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush because it was much cheaper than most shaving brushes, and it works as well as other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>As had been stated many times, here and elsewhere, if you want the brush to last, hang it bristles down, on a stand.  </li>
            <li>This will get the job done, and well too... just make sure you squeeze out the final rinse water, and try to sore it bristles down hanging from something.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff enough to get a great lather yet soft enough to not irritate, They have not fallen out, despite daily vigorous use for over a month now.</li>
            <li>Soft yet stiff enough to get a good lather going, and holds enough lather to go around the face completely in one</li>
            <li>The shaving brush was delivered on time, but within a day of using the brush for the first time the wooden handle suddenly developed a significant crack down the length of it.</li>
            <li>Decided on purchasing this brush because of positive reviews and low price.</li>
            <li>A few strands fell out at first, which I&#x27;m sure is expected.</li>
            <li>This brush is OK after a few weeks of using it, but the first times you get it wet</li>
            <li>The brush bristles starting to come out a little when I first used the brush, but for the price this brush is infinitely better the the standard drug store shave brush and soap.</li>
            <li>First, the shaves are much smoother because I can apply a thicker lather to my beard and, second, my razor blades last longer because I can get my beard softer with the lather applied by this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I am hoping it lasts as long as my prior brush which actually cost more 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>but it shed bristles at first and Badger hair takes a few uses to properly soften into a comfortable brush.  </li>
            <li>bristles are a bit on the prickly side for the first few shaves, then soften up just enough to be comfortable and work that lather into the beard.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you could purchase a higher quality badger brush for much more but as a beginner you could do far worse then this one.</li>
            <li>The brief research I did recommended to use only badger brushes and that advice was true as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Although it can be a bit on the small end in larger hands, it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the shedding brushes and do it right the first time.</li>
            <li>It takes a week or two worth of use before all the loose hairs fall out.</li>
            <li>However, I find that after beginning to use this brush my face breaks out much less, is left softer, and many cuts are prevented.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend them for the wet shave beginner because they are low in price and get the job done easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking for my husband time to get used to it, but he says that overall it&#x27;s better than the boar bristel brush he previously had.</li>
            <li>nearly vomited!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wiping down and Febreezing the bathroom, AND running my shaving mug through the dishwasher with a fresh soap puck afterwards, this brush went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a tight fit into the razor stand, I find that I have to rotate the brush so the skinnier diameter of the wood handle slides in.    </li>
            <li>Works up a good lather and only had a few hairs come out the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>A good badger hair brush should lose approximately 5-10 hairs in the first 5 shaves and then only the occasional errant hair every once in a while.  </li>
            <li>but it is very soft, making it hard to get a good lather on harder soaps.</li>
            <li>Form it with your hands to the right shape and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>When wet the Brush had a bit of that wet dog smell which can be expect of most new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush for anyone getting started with the classic shave or for an extra travel brush.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the cheap Tweezerman one I had previously purchased off of amazon, despite the latter being boar bristle and this one being badger.</li>
            <li>A few bristles came out, but if you buy a stand then this brush will hold up fine.</li>
            <li>Works just fine but its not the softest and each time you shave a few bristles come out. . .</li>
            <li>OK, strange, none of my other bushes smells like this.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine now after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>This is real badger hair and will smell when you first get it wet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using gel or foam shave creams for a long time and after a demonstration of a pre-shave cream, I decided to change the way I shave, most of it due some skin irritations and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>Soft, makes better lather than my previous synthetic low end brushes.  </li>
            <li>have used other products in past, this is vastly superior.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush every other day for the past 3 months and it works good.</li>
            <li>the silvertip is regarded as the best and usually what you desire for most faces unless you have just such a tough face that a plain badger will do.  </li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t enjoy dealing with all the loose bristles and wondering what the results from my next shave will be.</li>
            <li>Very nice, soft brush, however it sheds pretty badly.</li>
            <li>Still a very good brush, but its a little irritating when a hair gets on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a fine little brush and will give you a solid lather without much work.</li>
            <li>You head to your pearl bathroom, open the mirror and grab your Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li>If I had bought this for my husband (large hands), I would have had to send it back.  </li>
            <li>Using a pure badger brush makes a big difference when applying your shave cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is certainly the brushiest brush that ever brushed.</li>
            <li>The hairs regularly fall out (a minimum of 5 per shave), and there is a large section of hair that knotted together.</li>
            <li>I say this because I later purchased a large Kent silver</li>
            <li>these equally I have found this Pure Badger</li>
            <li>A Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the proper way to shave.</li>
            <li>Although pure Badger brushes do only have Badger hair, that&#x27;s not the definition.</li>
            <li>My super cheap seven dollar Van der Hagen boar bristle brush that I purchased at a grocery store is a far superior brush to this crap!</li>
            <li>Even though the top is flat and it is shown standing on it&#x27;s head, it says to store it upside down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cheap little brush for a couple years now, and I dig it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very smoothly with a very minimal loss of bristle(s), rarely, Unlike the previous shaving brush which lost bristles constantly.</li>
            <li>it loses hairs each time I use it which is a little concerning but it does make great foam.</li>
            <li>It smells a little at first and the first time you use it some hairs fall out of it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more likely than not going to upgrade in a little while.</li>
            <li>but I will probably spend a little more money on his next brush.</li>
            <li>It did smell a little funny at first but after using it a couple of times it seems to have faded away.</li>
            <li>Knowing what I know now, though, I wish I had paid only a little more to go with an Omega brush instead.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change if I could would be for the brush to have a little more backbone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other brushes, and they wore out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain but it somehow makes the shaving experience much more pleasurable for me.</li>
            <li>Treat your face well; it deserves no less!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than the boar brush, which is hard to adjust to, but it holds more water and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The brush itself had a tiny bit of a smell the first couple uses, but it washes away quickly (and is typical of affordable rushes).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this brush, based on the low price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anyone interested in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>lather is good, and the loss of bristles has been very slow, only notice 1-2 every week or so</li>
            <li>Great brush, very soft but stiff enough to stand up to a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>And although the only problem I have with the brush is that it will occasionally lose the bristles into the cup, whilst I stir the shaving cream, I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li>for silky smooth appication ,rough as wisk broom !!!</li>
            <li>the other half is a good shaving brush and the badger brushe from Escali definitely fills the bill.  </li>
            <li>The other issue with face lathering is that once it&#x27;s loaded up to a nice lather on the brush, the bristles spread out in all directions when applied to your face, leaving the middle to scrape along your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it still lathers creams and croaps fairly well, but does not have enough backbone to load enough soap from a hard puck.  </li>
            <li>For context, this is only the second badger brush that I have used and the first was from The Art of Shaving (which, apparently, set a very high expectation).&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this cheap price, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quality brush spend an extra 10 or 20 dollars more for a better lather.</li>
            <li>I waited a few weeks before writing a review in order to give an accurate account.  </li>
            <li>No point in shelling out huge money on something you may or may not enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is clearly a quality product.</li>
            <li>The higher the quality, the longer you should expect them to last, in addition to being made of generally finer stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was unable to find one like this in my local stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It feels great lathering up my face, I dont think ill ever go back to using canned shaving cream again.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to complete the whole traditional shaving experience</li>
            <li>The instructions on how to maintain it are clearly defined</li>
            <li>Repeat 2 - 3 times until the water is clear</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really know a good brush from a bad one since I don&#x27;t have much experience with them.</li>
            <li>I was losing closer to 5), so I can&#x27;t yet say if this will eventually stop, or if at some point that ONE final hair will fall out that causes a catastrophic drop below minimum required density and the whole pack of badger hairs fall into the sink with a soft &amp;#34;fump&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>For nearly the same price as a boar brush, you get a much improved shaving experience.</li>
            <li>At $12.95, my brush clearly came off badgers from the &#x27;hood.  </li>
            <li>I had to change the watery cleaning concoction three times to get the smell out, until the water stayed clear.  </li>
            <li>I expected this shaving brush to have a smell, and I tried several methods to reduce the smell to a comfortable level before returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft; holds water and cream really well and doesn&#x27;t make me the itchy when an occasional strand falls out.</li>
            <li>This was a bit bigger than my old one, and works the lather up very well.</li>
            <li>It soon became clear that this brush was a mistake.  </li>
            <li>B001613S8I Kingsley Clear Shave Brush Stand]])</li>
            <li>Shake it once to clear the water, then use one pump of shaving cream into your palm and lather with the brush.  </li>
            <li>It holds lather well and is soft.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as this one is.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Plus,this product was reasonably priced compared to similar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Soft and lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dense and lush.</li>
            <li>Its really soft, and after three shaves its still shedding.  </li>
            <li>I have used it 5x a week for 2 months now and it is still as soft as the day I received it.</li>
            <li>If you already have sensitive skin and struggle with ingrown hairs, this brush will not help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realize what a waste of money it was to be cheap and buy this brush.</li>
            <li>Improves with each use, the ends naturally split over time.</li>
            <li>Decided to try the old brush and bar.</li>
            <li>Soft yet sturdy brush.  </li>
            <li>Soft to the touch&lt;br</li>
            <li>offers.</li>
            <li>It stays soft through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess common sense.and can leat to most of the issues I read on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wooden handle is light and so far everything has worked as expected.</li>
            <li>for the price this is a must have for anyone looking to try out using a shaving brush with either a soap puck or the old fashion tubes of shaving lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving brushes are a product that I think are frequently overpriced</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, feels soft though</li>
            <li>the real shaves they make possible.  </li>
            <li>I have had to for over 3 weeks now and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristle shedding.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Really soft and has become my go to shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Quality brush thus far.</li>
            <li>(the hairs are fairly soft), which makes shaving no longer a chore for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I can apply a much smoother and thicker lather onto my face prior to shaving than before when I was using my hands.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft, holds water well and smells like my soap now.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Merkur to replace my old Gillete, that guess what.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell the smell doesn&#x27;t transfer onto anything, it&#x27;s locked into the bristles themselves, but it is something to note.</li>
            <li>Like it, so far.</li>
            <li>Loves it so far.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for several months now and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li>This makes it softer then my old brush.</li>
            <li>It makes the facial hairs stand-up and much easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>Then it leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>also did not notice any smell, but I started with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
            <li>use so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this for a couple of months so far</li>
            <li>So far I cannot say I have any issues with the brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using this in combination with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>but this brush left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>There is an old saying that goes &amp;</li>
            <li>So far no issues</li>
            <li>have to say that this has completely changed the way I shave.</li>
            <li>After the initial hair loss, which wasn&#x27;t much, the brush seems to be holding up</li>
            <li>it feels soft and no smell like some others</li>
            <li>I have always used the old school shaving soap and a brush.  </li>
            <li>It makes applying the soap much easier (especially when you skip the bowl and go from puck to face).</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>But, no way did that old stuff come up to this product of today.  </li>
            <li>He used it a half-dozen times and it completely fell apart.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it has thus held its form, it doesn&#x27;t look like an old tooth brush yet.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the pack are clear and concise.</li>
            <li>I use it with a cup and Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s held up well</li>
            <li>Extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This is nowhere near as soft as a silvertip badger brush, but you probably already knew that.</li>
            <li>The brush is well made, the bristles are soft and dense.</li>
            <li>but I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much since it was only $13.</li>
            <li>Bradger bristles, I guess they&#x27;re not hairs, are soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Eventually stopped using completely.</li>
            <li>Im glad I ignored the negative reviews and made the purchase.</li>
            <li>the brush completely fell off within a week of using it</li>
            <li>I am one of those who discovered late in life that a glycerin-based shave cream in a jar is infinitely better than anything found in an aerosol can.  </li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding or negative to say about it.</li>
            <li>No loss of bristles so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use it while it last, but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it.</li>
            <li>So far after about 2 weeks of using it, the brush seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>Its not auper soft but</li>
            <li>Horse hair is fairly soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, Lathers</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and holds a lather well.</li>
            <li>Using it with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
            <li>when i use it i&#x27;m left wondering if this thing is real badger hair.</li>
            <li>Mine stopped shedding completely after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Just switched to using safety razor and old fashion shaving cream.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SOFT AND SILKY</li>
            <li>It still sheds about 1 hair per shave, but it completely tolerable.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order 2nd one to keep in my RV.  </li>
            <li>but that is as far as it gets.  </li>
            <li>so I went completely old school and bought everything I needed to shave the brush</li>
            <li>So many 4 and 5 star reviews, but mine sucks.</li>
            <li>I give this 2 stars simply because of its low price, and with genuine hope that it softens up and stops shedding after further use/cleaning.</li>
            <li>I use this brush with the &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I used this 3-4 times and every time I shaved I would lose at least 5-10 hairs in my shave mug and another 5 or more on my face while lathering.  </li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to lose a lot of hair, and so far is holding up well.</li>
            <li>The quality seems top notch - some folks have complained about losing a lot of bristles...</li>
            <li>The brush is not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft but durable.</li>
            <li>You know that old addage.....</li>
            <li>It has worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li>Get this guys as it is so soft.</li>
            <li>starters I use Old Bond Street shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I now tend to take care of my shaving gear and so far all has lasted well beyond any cost/value expectation I&#x27;ve had.   </li>
            <li>I like it so much I am buying another to replace the one I just left in Australia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 3-4 months of use, or as soon as too much soap buildup is visible, follow above steps #1-6, but between #2-3 add this step:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>The old brush looks like Donald Trump.  </li>
            <li>Just throw some shave soap in an old coffee mug and lather it up with the brush.</li>
            <li>Old school style is irreplaceable and unmatchable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because while it is really soft and an improvement over my old boar brush, it still had some flaws.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the paint brush might not shed its bristles at the rate this thing did, I&#x27;m surprised this item in for sale in amazon at all.</li>
            <li>My beard is really soften prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I just started using a DE safety razor and shaving old fashioned, but I have to say the experience has been night and day.</li>
            <li>nope...every shave at least 3 or 4 buried in the Proraso and more on my face and neck...</li>
            <li>It appears that most reviews in 2013 are negative</li>
            <li>I have bought two so far, one for me and one for  my dad.</li>
            <li>Also, the hairs aren&#x27;t as soft as I would have hoped for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially if I&#x27;m being budget conscious.</li>
            <li>I got back to wet shaving recently and purchased this brush as it shows as the top result on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Shows considerable wear after sitting in my shower for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the negatives far outweight those.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it so far.</li>
            <li>Brush has held up well under use so far.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it has that kick ass old school</li>
            <li>Old school.</li>
            <li>soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me so much, but it is constantly losing bristles.  </li>
            <li>but I think at least they are OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially it did have a wild scent, but that did fade after about 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets the lather going and is soft when applied to your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just say that this brush is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the early bristle loss</li>
            <li>I ordered the Escali badger brush along with a Parker razor and Taylor of Old Bond St. shaving cream.</li>
            <li>With the low price just be ready to replace it in a year or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really soft.</li>
            <li>This thing is soft.  </li>
            <li>Bought with razor and soap to go old school on the shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>- I might just go ahead and buy another Van der Hagen kit JUST for the brush, since it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at</li>
            <li>It might just be the knot I ended up with, but it is soft to the point of being floppy.  </li>
            <li>The quality is very close to equal.  </li>
            <li>Brush works well so far no compliance.</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not hurt the skin.</li>
            <li>but, after a month so far, the brush is holding up well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it maybe 12 times so far and no sign of wear or pieces falling out.</li>
            <li>Its soft and</li>
            <li>Have used it about 10 times so far.  </li>
            <li>So far it is holding up well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using my brush but so far it&#x27;s been what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a shaving experience that was old tyme style and this is the brush just for that.</li>
            <li>The real problem for me was that it lost it&#x27;s shape with only 1 shave!</li>
            <li>I used it as far as &#x27;breaking in&#x27;...</li>
            <li>It is soft, and helps give an even application when using a shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>At first there were a few individual strands that would come out of the brush, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.</li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t really a need to look further than this brush</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li>It has been some time since I have used a brush and lather from soap in a mug, nearly 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it will load so much lather.</li>
            <li>After nearly a month of use this brush has lost a substantial amount of bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully customer service will take some action.</li>
            <li>Just enough bristle to massage face but not too much that it pokes.</li>
            <li>The product is of considerable quality and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it to date.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the brush so much that he got a second one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>Got into the old way of shaving from my Brother.</li>
            <li>The brush has completely changed my shaving experience and makes it a lot easier, smoother and gentler to do so.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know how much I should spend on the next one as the prices range quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Its not too prickly, not too soft, and it holds its bristles well.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to change my shaving routine, so after much procrastination i finally made the switch.</li>
            <li>and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Was using a cheap boar brush from CVS and was having lots of trouble lathering Col Conk almond soap.  </li>
            <li>It gives me the same smooth cover my more expensive &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; brush gives me.  </li>
            <li>I tried this brush as a start on &#x27;old school&#x27; shaving.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go next time.</li>
            <li>Bought this product after I decided to stop using shave foam and instead decide to go with Sandalwood Shaving Cream of Taylor of Old Bond</li>
            <li>I recommend this to any value conscious shopper.</li>
            <li>It looks classy too.</li>
            <li>I recently started shaving with a straight razor and this brush is a must have.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and feels quite well on the face.</li>
            <li>but it is by far the softest.</li>
            <li>bristles are soft, hold water without drenching.  </li>
            <li>I take proper care of the brush rinsing it and gently squeezing it (not wringing it) and then hanging it in a stand.</li>
            <li>However, this brush really surprised me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps i shape and stays soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>it is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>A well balanced brush soft in every way.</li>
            <li>So far everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is replacing my old one that was 5 X the cost of this one that I had for 4yrs.</li>
            <li>Surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>i recomended to my family and friends to shave old schoold to avoid all the chemicals the shave cans have.</li>
            <li>Escali, go natural.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>Holds water well and is quite soft.</li>
            <li>One to use with old fashioned shaving cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and made with a quality handle.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few months but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and for the longest have always used Gillette -brands</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder if I will ever need to spring for a silver tip brush because they might be too soft.</li>
            <li>That brush is about 4 HOURS old.  </li>
            <li>I gave the brush five stars because it&#x27;s soft and spreads the shaving cream well.  </li>
            <li>Natural hair brushes can have some odor</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and a standard horse hair one I got for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>Works well and is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told), and it&#x27;s soft on the face.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for any wet-shavers - double edged or straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a waste of money, but I don&#x27;t think people that purchase this brush will stop here.</li>
            <li>No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up to old school shaving.  </li>
            <li>They are far softer than boar hair</li>
            <li>no problems with that so far.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going old school</li>
            <li>I would recommend  it every time  soft and plush</li>
            <li>4 stars because it loses more bristles than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold a lot of water, warming the shaving cream or gel, and softening the beard.</li>
            <li>I had already switched from the old aerosol can to a a pump bottle cream</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have this issue with my old boar brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>and they were too soft.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot;  When I asked why, he mentioned that he was transitioning to an old school non-disposable razor because that&#x27;s what his father used to use.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it&#x27;s only mine.</li>
            <li>Now I just need a stand for my brush and razor to complete the ensemble.</li>
            <li>If I really wanted to make a concerted effort, I could shampoo/rinse it a bunch of times in a row, but it just doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend the Taylor Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream with this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even shave with a razor but ever since I have started displaying this in my bathroom the level of classy girls I entertain</li>
            <li>The smell goes away considerably with use.  </li>
            <li>Gives a closer shave and makes it feel old school.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive for what it offers</li>
            <li>Retains bristles and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>Went to old school shaving and have been using this brush for a month now.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal really.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and it dries overnight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I always thought as a boy of 23 years old.  </li>
            <li>The Escali brush is soft and holds lather well.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this brush.  </li>
            <li>My husband prefers his old boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how my shaves improved.</li>
            <li>I would go \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>Im hoping it stops losing hair after I break it in, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>It is soft but it gets the job done in terms of lifting the hairs and getting out the dirt.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t extend that far into the handle; they&#x27;re just seated in glue.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a wild animal.  </li>
            <li>But still like it its soft.</li>
            <li>I pair this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College.</li>
            <li>It was like a night and day difference between this brush and my old boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Six months old and the brush fell apart.</li>
            <li>Not too soft.</li>
            <li>I like the look of this brush, but I am still using the old one until it wears out . .</li>
            <li>The bristle are soft and I think sturdy.</li>
            <li>but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really soft on my face which I like.</li>
            <li>You will feel like a man using old school wet-shaving methods, and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li>Bristles are reasonably soft.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and evenly spreads the shaving cream or paste.  </li>
            <li>too soft.. just flops around..</li>
            <li>I find that lathering with just the fur of a badger is much easier than using the entire animal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t say the brush is extremely comfortable by any means, it&#x27;s soft enough for my delicate skin and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and comfy.</li>
            <li>I have used it to lather my face directly and used a bowl.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend of mine earlier who is really into the art of shaving.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but sometimes i feel like it was a bit prickly to my face.</li>
            <li>Using this with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li>It is soft yet still stimulating when applying shave lotion/cream.  </li>
            <li>back to double edge wet shaving (I&#x27;m glad I did) and upgrading to the Proraso shave cream</li>
            <li>like the handle, but almost wish it could have been made from something completely impervious to water...plastic, maybe?  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s years in the future, and it was reasonably inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Its bristles are are soft and not prickly.</li>
            <li>I started shaving with a straight razor about a year ago, but I didn&#x27;t invest in a brush until recently.  </li>
            <li>Soft and sturdy</li>
            <li>Well, this is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to (please excuse the ending preposition).  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush as a replacement for my old, boar&#x27;s hair brush, and I have to say this makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>I bought the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream when I bought this.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and works well with the cup soap.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a shaving brush and shaving soap for nearly 40 years and have gone through a number of brushes.  </li>
            <li>So far . . .</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference it made.</li>
            <li>It is soft and holds a lot of water, which is what you need if you&#x27;re mixing up lather from a cake of shaving soap in a mug or using a brush-type shaving cream from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s real badger hair, and you can definitely SMELL it.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want something too soft (silvertip)</li>
            <li>so the shedding should completely stop.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soft on the skin and does well in spreading out shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Classy.</li>
            <li>Thus far it feels a tad stiffer than my other&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard raving reviews on this product, and it&#x27;s living up to its name thus far.</li>
            <li>I purchased Taylor of Old Bond w/</li>
            <li>Had it for a month now and so far it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart .</li>
            <li>Developed rashes after using the brush.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to receive a premium quality level shaving brush, just one that would apply lather, not shed much and enhance my daily shaving ritual.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>Time to go old school and shave like a man</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>The odor is completely eliminated - not a trace.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and lathers well, however it is not as soft as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>but at this point it is not as soft as my Omega Boar Brush.</li>
            <li>A gentle rinse-out the next day</li>
            <li>It gets tender and soft, but still maintains its bushy nature.  </li>
            <li>Holds water well and is soft.  </li>
            <li>The wooden handle has held up well without absorbing water and swelling.  </li>
            <li>If it will last for a reasonable amount of time; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>These bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brush five or six time so far.</li>
            <li>While I was on a trip I got a professional shave and the gal</li>
            <li>His dog chewed up his old one</li>
            <li>Lathers soaps well and is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised if this was made of dog or cat hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lathering my face 3 times during the course of 1 complete shave with this shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves using it, describing it as a facial massage.  </li>
            <li>Never had an old fashioned brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li>but as far now I do like the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for nearly 6 months and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it held up very well only losing a couple in the sink.</li>
            <li>But since I paired that Mach 3 with this Badger Brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream my life has changed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap price, so far no hairs have fallen out, and it has a medium firmness to it.</li>
            <li>It lathers me up like a professional barber</li>
            <li>I replaced my old brush because it started shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li>and I dug the old one out.  </li>
            <li>- it gives you greater control when building and applying the lather (at least for me; I use Geo F. Trumpers shave soap).</li>
            <li>gives it a old school feel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face at all</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s nearly a hundred years.</li>
            <li>Scent - Old Fashioned for a Luxurious Experience</li>
            <li>Bristles are not as soft as the brush my son bought.</li>
            <li>It has lost a number of hairs and have used it five times so far ... perhaps three to four hairs per use.  </li>
            <li>I really do wish I had gotten this Escali brush earlier, but at least I&#x27;m sure I will get another one when the time comes.</li>
            <li>As far as bang for the buck goes</li>
            <li>So far, there is nothing I dislike about this product.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s an old Army thing).  </li>
            <li>Holds a ton of water and has a soft knot.</li>
            <li>I used a boar brush for years then switched to the Badger, wow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, lathers well, doesn&#x27;t fall out of my hand, and after a couple of months of using it hasn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Brush loses so many hairs, sheds profusely</li>
            <li>The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  </li>
            <li>There were bristles on my face and on the shaving soap nearly every time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I am old</li>
            <li>a quality product, soft not scratchy, lathers up a treat.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>Tried it once so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet comment on the durability but so far its holding up.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell like a wild animal like some others have said.</li>
            <li>Nothing sucks more than going to work and smelling barnyard on your face all</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Then, load it with water and &amp;#34;sling&amp;#34; the water out in the shower or tub (hold on to the handle and do a short fast throwing motion).</li>
            <li>I wouldnt be surprised if this was horse hair or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, the price is very affordable and the handle design is solid.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s loosing a considerable amount of hair when shaving.  </li>
            <li>The bristles feels soft on your face.</li>
            <li>so I got him this as an early Father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>You will notice the water turns brown when you first get this brush wet but don&#x27;t panic, it only happens on the first use.</li>
            <li>Just got this brush to replace an old one from another manufacturer that had been shedding for some time.  </li>
            <li>This is like by father&#x27;s old shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and works well.  </li>
            <li>A couple of pumps from the shave cream and it completely lathers my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item last July and my husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Also started to using the old shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Escali brush as a back up brush to one I had already purchased and paid 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li>Like my face, the old brush was beginning to show the effects of tempus fugit.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s genuine and the smell went away after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s badger fur, it&#x27;s going to be soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decently soft but maintains some prickliness, I just wish it would stay together.</li>
            <li>brush, however, is too soft for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve been using a brush and shave soap for at least a decade or so.</li>
            <li>I decided it was getting old</li>
            <li>It sheds like my old cat</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s bristles are about as soft as her fur.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m going to give it to an artist friend of mine - maybe he can get some interesting textures out of it before it loses the rest of its bristles.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, holds water and lather well.</li>
            <li>So I got a complete outfit, including this brush.</li>
            <li>Was surprised to learn not to store it standing up.</li>
            <li>It also still had the smell of the wild.</li>
            <li>No way to get the wild musk out, will stick to my old brush.</li>
            <li>There also is minor loss of lose hairs in the first dozen uses</li>
            <li>I just dab this once or twice into my Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, and then lather up on the lid, and brush and dab on my face.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m guessing the handle will not last for more than a few months.</li>
            <li>Great entry level brush, and even though it loses a few hairs each time I use it, for the price</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was in trouble when I first used it</li>
            <li>There is an initial smell, but that is OK as it is a natural fiber brush, it goes away with a few shaves.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and it is so much better than using a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I then cleared the sink and tried it again with almost as many lost in the next round.</li>
            <li>I received this lovely brush just a few short days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Essentially became only 50% useful after two to three weeks of use, at around 3 days between shaves.</li>
            <li>That said, after a few more shaves, I actually started to appreciate the feel on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it only a few weeks, but I&#x27;m sure it will outlast me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times but it seems to get better each time.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, the brush came with a distinct smell of wet animal, in addition to a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with different brushes, but after using this one for a few months, I can confidently rate it at 5 stars for performance and cost.</li>
            <li>The brush did lose some bristles initially (the 1st few uses), but since then it has not lost any more.</li>
            <li>I can see now, why badger is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush in my first foray into DE Razor shaving, but now, a few months into using this brush, it&#x27;s still shedding hairs.</li>
            <li>For that reason I give it 3 stars, its good but not perfect.</li>
            <li>i was a bit skeptical before ordering this brush, but after using it once I was convinced I made a good choice.  </li>
            <li>You might ask what is there in a brush to break in, well good for you that you have those weird questions.</li>
            <li>I cant wait until I get it nice and broken in and it softens up just a hair</li>
            <li>When attempting to shave with this brush many hairs fell out with each use, but most importantly, it smells horribly!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slowly moving towards &amp;#34;upping my game&amp;#34; by using better shaving products as I find them.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of shaving with the fussion razor and did some research and bought thr murker 34c and this nice brush along with it.</li>
            <li>Expensive but good quality.</li>
            <li>The lather was crap and nothing compared the excellent lather of the Escali brush.  </li>
            <li>Money wise this brush isn&#x27;t going to dent your wallet, but at the same time it&#x27;s not a great brush.</li>
            <li>Makes thick leather.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - satisfied completely.</li>
            <li>It holds moisture fairly well, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost useless if you are trying to work up a lather with a soap puck in a cup (Williams Mug, good stuff).</li>
            <li>Good quality but bristles are little stiff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s down to acceptable levels, and it&#x27;s now sitting overnight with a full load of lather.</li>
            <li>Able to whip up a thick / rich lather with little effort.</li>
            <li>The second reason is that it loses hairs pretty easily.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and bought this as my first shave brush.  </li>
            <li>The only complain I have is that it sheds quite a bit of hair, but being new to using a shaving brush, perhaps this is normal.</li>
            <li>At first, the brush will smell like a wet dog, but if you soak it in dish washing detergent (look online to find out how to break in a new brush and remove the smell) and use it often the smell will disappear.</li>
            <li>For this price I expected a nice, fairly stiff shaving brush that would hold it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about this badger brush; it lathers up soap well, with nice stiff bristles for application.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting to move away from canned shaving gels and towards using shaving bars, getting the right equipment is key.</li>
            <li>It stays nice and stiff when wet</li>
            <li>Like others state, bristles are pretty stiff at first</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something ornamental or elegant, this isn&#x27;t it--as you might have already found out from the picture, it has a plain, undistinguished wooden handle.</li>
            <li>I have been really frustrated with the modern razors and decided to go back to the basics; so far so good!</li>
            <li>and it seems to do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and although there are many other brushes for more money, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made (I hate when I purchase something</li>
            <li>The bristles flatten out way too easily when your applying cream using very little pressure.</li>
            <li>My son will inherit this from his grandpa, which will mean more than gold to all 3 of us.</li>
            <li>However I recently ordered one for a relative of mine and have noticed that this brush is slightly different than my original from about a year ago.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but make sure you use the stand that holds brush upside down to help it dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry it upside down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve made sure to always dry upside down on a brush stand, and have no doubt I&#x27;ll get years of use from this brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep it dry and hanging brush facing down on a stand.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to buy a holder and dry it upside down.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse well and hang with bristles down to dry.  </li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that the bristles would not return to their original quality after getting wet and left to dry, but this fear was undue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, it just doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles, and the bristles it does have are far too soft to get a decent lather going.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely recommend this brush for anyone thinking about getting into wet shaving without wanting to invest a significant amount.</li>
            <li>The cheap price of it is what puts it above the other options out there on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This brush might be a great deal according to the other reviews here, but this brush shed hair worse than a Persian cat in the summer time.  </li>
            <li>I let it soak in hot water while I&#x27;m in the shower, then hang it to dry when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to use</li>
            <li>has increased and the brush is noticeably less full than when I started using it.</li>
            <li>It seems to drop a lot of hairs, but it&#x27;s still going strong now past the one year mark.</li>
            <li>As others mentioned, it does have a slight odor -- not bad or overpowering, but noticeable -- however this went away after two or three uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times so far and it does loose a couple of bristles when you first start using this</li>
            <li>It does the job, but the bristles splayed completely and immediately, so you&#x27;re swiping with a very broad expanse</li>
            <li>They are all glued in as a clump, and I was able to super glue them back in and reglued it every month or so for the past few months, but I am finally moving on and getting a newer and higher quality</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving brush that I&#x27;ve bought, thus my frame of reference is limited</li>
            <li>This was my first badger brush purchase, so, my experience is somewhat limited.  </li>
            <li>Okay guys I hate to write reviews, but I do love this really soft brush and thought well this time!!</li>
            <li>It is affordable, comfortable to use and clean without going through a difficult learning curve.</li>
            <li>It is has a soft texture and retains enough moisture to generate a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>It is has a soft texture and retains enough moisture to generate a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>The brush drys quickly by hanging it up side down as Badger</li>
            <li>Not to bring down the sales to the shipper,because the delivery ways quick and customer service oriented.  </li>
            <li>Working very well so far for the few first shaves.</li>
            <li>This was my first badger hair brush for wet shaving with a double edged safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>In the original review I wrote, I mentioned a few hairs fell out of the brush with use.</li>
            <li>Shedding of loose bristles were probally 2 or 3 the first couple uses.    </li>
            <li>I first got it, there were a lot of loose hairs, but once they came off the brush was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I used it, there were loose hairs that came out and got into the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>recommend letting it soak, rubbing it on your palm under water, and getting rid of any loose hairs before using for the first time.</li>
            <li>seems to loose bristles on the first use</li>
            <li>Lots of loose hairs on this brush even after months of use, but works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I tried washing all of the loose hairs out of the brush before my first shave but it still shed for about 4 or 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li>At this rate, I&#x27;ll have to look for a replacement soon, as all that pure badger hair is going straight down my drain.</li>
            <li>Other than some minor early shedding (which has mostly stopped), it has been very solid.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there a few of the hairs have come out after only a few uses, however, the number is 1 or 2, and the overall quality is very good.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other “pure badger” grade knots and they are exactly the same in performance...</li>
            <li>Overall a good quality brush with only a few loose hairs.  </li>
            <li>New to the world of wet shaving, this was the brush i bought, and a smart choice it was.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much of the shaving soap experience is affected by a decent brush, but so far I really like it with the soap.  </li>
            <li>Brush does not appear to be of really good quality seems to have not much body however the company got it to me in less time than expected</li>
            <li>My shaving experience is better and definitely less abrasive on facial skin from daily shaving.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price, may upgrade at a later date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I could say the same for a brush I paid over twice as much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I purchased the local drugstore&#x27;s only shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>The first one was crap (the $12 starter set) and this one was great for about a month.</li>
            <li>A decent quality shaving brush was one such item.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews stated that this brush had an odd odor after opening it from its packaging, but mine luckily did not.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot (as a gift, no less).  </li>
            <li>brush is decent, but I think for my next brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to invest in a more expensive, higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>Now, I understand that for a Badger Brush you would need to spend around $35 and above to get a decent one (</li>
            <li>This is my first Badger brush, I only recently moved from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>By using the brush, it always seems to have enough left on it after my first shave for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Starting with the first time I used the brush, and continuing up to the present, stray hairs began coming out.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for any classic gentlemen looking to take their shave up a notch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never previously used a badger brush because of its exorbitant cost &amp; this is a world of difference.</li>
            <li>Overall is decent for the price I paid</li>
            <li>Upon first use I noticed the brush shed a few bristles, which one could reasonably expect.</li>
            <li>On the same note, there are tons of shaving brushes many times this price point that seem to get reviews which are no better.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is particularly valuable for those with curly hair that will tend to curl back into the skin (</li>
            <li>I was using an older (5-6yo) boar brush, the badger is a definite improvement!</li>
            <li>I had not previously used a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I just went back to the double edge razor and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The 1st I bought was for myself 2nd one as a gift for my older bRotherham that was using a terible boar brisle one that swe</li>
            <li>I typically do 20 circle swipes to get the soap on the brush, then it takes another minute of applying the brush to the beard to get an adequate lather.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with this brush is that hairs constantly fall out of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent enough brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>you want an alternate brush for around the same price, but significantly higher quality, check out the Omega line, specifically the 20102 or 10066.</li>
            <li>The brush I received had several coarse hairs noticeable on first inspection.  </li>
            <li>My replacement brush has since arrived and proved to be much cleaner and had fewer coarse hairs apparent.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and does everything the more expensive brushes do - fast shipping and zero complaints!</li>
            <li>The only reason it lost a star is because for the first several times you shave with it, it will smell like a zoo.</li>
            <li>This brush was one of my first badger brushes when I started traditional shaving several years ago.</li>
            <li>When it runs out of bristles, which looks to be soon, I will replace with a more expensive and higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely a decent value to determine if you want to experiment with traditional shaving, but I will be upgrading</li>
            <li>This brush was purchased as a gift for someone who wanted to try the older, traditional methods.  </li>
            <li>The first time several hairs do fall out though, so don&#x27;t panic if you think your brush is falling apart, thereafter only one or two hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy an Omega S-Brush (not the Omega Syntex, they are an older variety) or an Omega Boar/Semogue Boar as a starting brush.</li>
            <li>It seemed to do a decent enough job making lather.</li>
            <li>If the brush was bigger and less smelly it would be fine</li>
            <li>The first one I have had and used regularly for several years.</li>
            <li>The water from the first wash on mine actually turned brown and murky, and the brush actually did smell like badger.</li>
            <li>More expensive companies wash this smell out first.</li>
            <li>Considering how damn expensive and fancy these brushes get, I want to point out that this brush is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li>Smells a little funny for the first few uses, but maybe that&#x27;s the smell of freshly plucked badger hair.</li>
            <li>It was still wet from this mornings use, 13 hrs ago, I guess I need to take more care drying it because I hung it upside down.</li>
            <li>The brush does not shrink down too much and spreads the shaving cream on my legs very well.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad little brush.</li>
            <li>not bad but wished the handle was a little bit longer</li>
            <li>It will lose a few bristles at first (like any brush), but after a few shaves it will hold together strong, even against intense lathering, and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The price was right and quality seems to be about on par with other entry level brushes.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bristles are high quality and do not fall out under regular use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two high end brushes also do the same to me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>He says it is reminiscent of the high quality ones his father and grandfather used.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a high quality brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it because of it&#x27;s premium feel for this low price.</li>
            <li>so I had to purchase another and the second product is of equally high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price may be low but the quality us high.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but from my personal experience, this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended - especially for the price point.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a stand to hold your razor and to hold the brush so it dries properly.</li>
            <li>it left so much hair in the lather that I had to throw the whole thing away, third the lather was of white, almost brown color that leads me to believe that the hair on this brush are painted.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this brush, it will get the job done.</li>
            <li>Not much to add except it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Having used this brush for several months now, I highly recommend this purchase to others.  </li>
            <li>you can, try visiting a store that carries various brushes (for example, Art of Shaving but beware that their prices are HIGH).</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a quality brush</li>
            <li>The brush dries quickly and very few bristles have fallen out or escaped the main group.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are thick, soft, and installed into the wooden handle very securely.</li>
            <li>This slightly improved the smell, but it was still very strong and difficult to even test smell once wet with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a decent enough first brush for getting introduced to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I just put hates a new better brush as I am tired of trying to use this one.</li>
            <li>Being new to the whole wet shave thing, I bought this brush off of a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li>found my old double edged razor ordered new blades,soap and this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving, and recently decided to dump the Gilette Mach $$$ and switch to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>As a new wet shaver, I do not have anything to compare it to, but it works very well with the 2 soaps that I use --- Arko and Pre-de-Provence --- lathers well in the can with minimum water, and holds sufficient lather for a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li>This being my first shaving brush my experience is very limited.</li>
            <li>Fibers tend to come loose a little more than I would like.</li>
            <li>No regrets!!</li>
            <li>Makes it a little more difficult to use, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li>Buy something a little more expensive to avoid losing quite so many bristles</li>
            <li>Recommended from someone with no other experience!</li>
            <li>The badger brush feels a little coarse but it does a great job of building a thick lather.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lather with very little shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Gently run the brush over a soft towel OR hang in a stand to air dry.</li>
            <li>It is soft and rinses well and dry fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for about a month, and it more or less what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>eventually went ahead and shaved with it anyway, and noticed that the brush wasn&#x27;t as soft and gentle as it felt when dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brushes and this is easily one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made my own stand to hang my brush up to dry (brushes should be stored upside down to dry)</li>
            <li>I only gave this product 4 stars because if you do not dry it very well it smells mildewy.</li>
            <li>This is the second Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I have bought,  The first one of several years ago has lost no bristles so the new one is serving at present as a spare.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not fall out no matter how hard he can use it at times and we love that the product is all natural and the handle is wooden and not plastic.</li>
            <li>The first one was from a better known name brand, but was very poor quality and the hair was coming out in clumps.</li>
            <li>During the first use it shed a few of the bristles which worried me, but I guess that must have been normal for the first time, because it hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle since.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is true of all shaving brushes, but be sure to rinse it well afterward and dry it on it&#x27;s side or upside down, otherwise it develops a smell.</li>
            <li>With this type of bristle loss, you will enjoy the brush for a minimum of 5 years, if not more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that its comfortable and saves me a lot on shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I spent several minutes rubbing the brush on my palm over the sink and coated the porcelain with more than 50 bristles which promptly jammed up the drain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give you any long term test but as of now I really like this brush..</li>
            <li>My husband had really wanted this one to replace another that had lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>Although there are some minor flaws, it&#x27;s really well priced for what you get.</li>
            <li>and it feels cheap - because it usually means it is)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never loved a woman like I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I am using this brush in my first adventure in wet shaving</li>
            <li>Exactly  Wat I expected</li>
            <li>I can say aside from some initial shedding wich seems normal with anything using natual hair</li>
            <li>Of course there was some brush hair loss initially, but I assume this is normal.</li>
            <li>It is pretty inexpensive though, so I guess that could be expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do note that it is expected that some hairs will fall out on the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>First off, as soon as it gets wet</li>
            <li>PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, spend a few extra dollars and get a better quality brush,</li>
            <li>When wet the brush smells exactly like a Badger.  </li>
            <li>So, I was looking forward to my first badger brush, after having to use a boar brush that got ratty and rough on my face.</li>
            <li>Minimal hair loss at first use.</li>
            <li>The Brush is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I expected this to stop, after the first couple uses but it continues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I had some hairs come out in the first use, but as to be expected.</li>
            <li>Had a smell the first time i used it like wet dog.</li>
            <li>As it stands I can&#x27;t recommend this brush as anyone&#x27;s first foray into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Not having any prior experience with a badger brush, I&#x27;m guessing it might be normal not being a synthetic brush</li>
            <li>The brush was synthetic bristle and was pretty rough on my face.</li>
            <li>a couple bristles during first use, as expected, but have not lost any since.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as my first to try out wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>For the price I paid I&#x27;d say it was money well spent as my first shave brush.</li>
            <li>It lost a lot of hair initially, but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>As others have noted, it is animal hair, so it will give off a bit of funk the first time it gets wet.</li>
            <li>Please note that all natural brushes have some smell initially because they&#x27;re natural products (they come from living creatures!)</li>
            <li>The brush is exactly what I ordered and expected to receive.</li>
            <li>The first 2-3 uses there&#x27;s a smell, which is expected of a badger brush</li>
            <li>The safety razor shaves pretty well, but you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>first brush or travel brush for wet shavers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is normal, but it is definitely a gamey scent.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Following a few simple care suggestions and it seems to do OK.</li>
            <li>and that is expected after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>Not a whole lot to say as I haven&#x27;t exactly checked out the market on badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>A few hairs fell out the first time I used it, but after that it&#x27;s been pretty solid.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and it is everything i expected.</li>
            <li>At first it has a bit of a smell (wet badger?), and also in the beginning it stains the soap</li>
            <li>This was the first badger shave brush I purchased when I started wet shaving.</li>
            <li>My first experience into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>It also has that distinctive badger smell when you first wet it, but that disappears after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Upon receiving mine and having a first shave with it, I noticed a pungent odor not unlike that of a wet badger.  </li>
            <li>expected a bristle here and there to fall out with the first couple uses, however, after about 15 uses 5 to 6 bristles continue to fall out during use.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>The Escali has been exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li>Minimal hair loss when i first started using this.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it would smell like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li>Seems good..not as full as The Perfecto, but the Perfecto is beginning to shed bristles heavily</li>
            <li>High quality affordable product, complete with instructions on cleaning and care that were lacking for other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased; I wish I had purchased this one first!</li>
            <li>At first it was shedding some of its hairs, but I read it was expected and that it would just settle down after a few uses and it is good that it did as I kept picking long hairs off my face.  </li>
            <li>Properly using the safety razor has significantly cut down if not eliminated razor burn</li>
            <li>No more shall I bow down to any more boars and their whiskers for my shaving needs!</li>
            <li>It lathers easy and just stiff enough to lift hairs.  </li>
            <li>Soft brush, a little small but definitely feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>It does shed a few hairs every so often, but at the current price, that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>Holds water fine, but the hairs are coming out after only a few uses</li>
            <li>Gave up a few hairs the first couple of uses, but holding steady now.</li>
            <li>I drilled a hole and epoxied a rare earth magnet for &#x27;sticking&#x27; it upside down underneath my sink.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving I first made the mistake buying a boar brush at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched to solid shaving cream--versus foam from a can-- and use the Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>Pure badger hair is the only way to go to ensure a proper lather that gets into the beard.</li>
            <li>although the brush is 100% pure badger, it is only badger fur, not the entire beast.  </li>
            <li>and so I was quite intrigued to see such a relatively inexpensive brush that was \\&quot;pure Badger\\&quot; ... which I incorrectly assumed meant that the brush has nothing but Badger hair.</li>
            <li>Not really a significant issue, this is to be expected from most brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is it feels &#x27;sloppy&#x27; and limp, like using a wet cotton ball.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars was because it lost quite a few bristles the first few uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There will be a few hairs that fall out the first couple of times, and I suggest letting it soak in hot water for a few minutes when you first get it.</li>
            <li>A little prickly the first few shaves but just fine after that.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse it properly and do dry it upside down.</li>
            <li>Letting it air dry upside down helps keep it fresh and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Due entirely to those crummy disposable razors that wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>This shaving brush sure is nicer than the old cheap rough, stiff, brush I used the last few years.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and does not loose hairs or bristles.</li>
            <li>But it has faded after a few uses and I attribute it to the real material it&#x27;s made of as well as the fact that my other one im used to is just a cheap synthetic bristle with no smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to all this traditional shavin stuff.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a shaving brush, but I have watched several maintenance care videos on youtube</li>
            <li>I got this Brush recently, eventhough I am new to the DE shaving, (approx 1.5 years), I had a Prker Brush as a 1st one, that one fell apart as well,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving, and boy did I change the entire experience with this product.</li>
            <li>This new Brush is shedding quite a bit, I&#x27;m left with Hair in the Soap, and on my face.</li>
            <li>Not enough to bother me into buying a new one though.</li>
            <li>If you are new to traditional wetshaving and want an affordable entry-level badger hair brush, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>I would guess the brush will last through another 2 or 3 months before a new one will be needed.</li>
            <li>But at this rate I see myself having to purchase a new brush sooner than later.</li>
            <li>I am New to shving with what I call &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; shaving equiptment, such as this Escali Badger Brush.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush as part a gift set with a new Double Edge Razor by Merkur.</li>
            <li>The scent is essentially GONE from their new brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush has remained stable and essentially as it was when new.</li>
            <li>After using for several weeks the brush looks like new.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item, especially over using live badger.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m currently shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the same  to anyone who has a new brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving with a double edge razors.</li>
            <li>I have no intention of going back to cartridge razors after just 1 shave with my new safety razor</li>
            <li>My only word of warning is that if you are new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li>I am new to using a shaving brush and with quite a bit to choose from finally decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new Escali badger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the long-term durability of the brush, since I&#x27;ve had it for only a couple of weeks, but in my regular shaves, I am loving it; the badger hair is tough enough to give you some tingle and agitate the hairs to stand on end while remaining soft enough that it does not irritate sensitive skin like a boar&#x27;s hair or synthetic brush would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a decent starter brush if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>As it seems I&#x27;m one of the few that experienced a poor</li>
            <li>A brush is essential because it allows you to build up a better lather with less product resulting in a closer shave and more efficient use of expensive shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well and there isn&#x27;t a floppy characteristic to it when it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>I gently squeeze out excess water before storing the brush hanging handle-up for a drip dry.</li>
            <li>I dry the brush hanging from the handle, keeping the bristles always expanded and ready.</li>
            <li>Anyone looking to upgrade their daily shave should consider using this all natural bristle brush that is soft to the touch and gentle on even dry winter</li>
            <li>- the whole hair bundle broke off the hand when I was squeezing water of out of it to dry it.    </li>
            <li>I only have a couple months&#x27; worth of wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li>When first used it had a chemical smell and left the lather a grey color.</li>
            <li>Does the job well though, and soft enough for sensitive skin if used correctly.</li>
            <li>At the rate this is happening, won&#x27;t be much brush left in short order.</li>
            <li>when I first got it a few hairs of course fell out, this is normal.</li>
            <li>Loses hairs on a regular basis, has no rigidity, doesn&#x27;t build lather well, pokes into the skin even more than bear hair brushes</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the hair falls out more than I would like.</li>
            <li>It does lose a lot of hairs during the first few uses, but I can see that being normal.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and pick up and Omega boar brush for the same price OR spring the extra money for a real badger brush.</li>
            <li>(second use and later) with just a gentle squeeze.</li>
            <li>. . . before it had completely shed the entire finish on the handle.  This means the wood of the handle is now completely exposed to the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine immediately developed a void of hair directly in the middle</li>
            <li>so I simply rinse thoroughly, shake out as much water as I can (~2 minutes of working, shaking while the cream softens facial hair) and then rest the brush on its side in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also is comfortable, firm enough to massage in the cream but not so raspy as to irritate my face.</li>
            <li>I was concerned after the 1st shave because it shed a few more hairs than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and hope it last for a long time.</li>
            <li>have noticed some discoloration of the wood around the knot (where the bristles meet the handle), as well wear around the top edge of the handle, as if the finish is wearing off, not sure how the brush will hold up long term</li>
            <li>only complaint with the Escali is that it does shed a bit more than desired.</li>
            <li>Was disappointed to discover many of the hairs coming out and becoming lodged in the soap with each use.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re willing to soak it overnight in white vinegar before using it.</li>
            <li>Hairs falling out at first is normal, after a few uses, it stops happening.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, holds together (a few hairs came out for the first week or so, but that&#x27;s fairly normal and it hasn&#x27;t had a shedding problem</li>
            <li>only complaint is it tends to lose more bristles/hairs than I think it should.</li>
            <li>The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating would be that I have lost a few of the badger hairs after some light use (once a week).</li>
            <li>Badger brushes have always been my favourites;  I decided to get one for my husband, who had last year gone from those god-awful shaving foams to real soap, but had only bought himself a cheapy brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Escali brush isn&#x27;t very expensive, yet it lathers beautifully and, oddly enough, the lather stays on my face.</li>
            <li>I do not understand how a brush this size can have more bristles than the Escali without some pointing straight sideways and being totally useless.</li>
            <li>While this brush isn&#x27;t terribly expensive, it&#x27;s twice what I paid for my cheapo and definitely not twice as good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to keep up with the Joneses, they&#x27;re huge D-Bags with nice crap and no money.</li>
            <li>It Lost a few bristles in the beginning but quickly stopped doing it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Break it in: (1) soak it for five minutes in hot water (2) load it with a good shaving soap  </li>
            <li>The bristles are firm and adequately secured within the holder.</li>
            <li>Lathers and applies with a few quick brush strokes.</li>
            <li>While the bristles were a little stiff for my liking, it&#x27;s done my face nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush to new wet shavers or anyone looking for a bargain brush.  </li>
            <li>Excited to get this new shaving brush, I have had some badger brushes in the past, and I was looking to replace my current brush of 5 years from Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Opened the box, and the smell of manure hits me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are all matted once wet and stiff making the process of working up a rich lather very cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>maintain it by rinsing thoroughly after use, holding the bristles right below the wood when I shake it out, and storing it bristle-side down from a hanger that I bent for the purpose.</li>
            <li>Compared to my last Shaving Brush, which didn&#x27;t shed at all, until it got very old.</li>
            <li>, seems to holds its bristles well, had a standard sized handle and is very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and appears to be a solid product.  </li>
            <li>But, It&#x27;s very soft to the touch, but a little prickly on my face the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the directions that are on the reviews and the internet to learn how to properly whip up shaving cream -soap lather, and especially how to clean your brush (run under water till clean, blot dry on towel, put in brush holder - handle up to dry - brush down).</li>
            <li>Glad I got this brush, have been using this for a couple of months and it sheds very little and dry</li>
            <li>It had a cheap plastic handle/base, and the bristles were too long, too soft, too uneven, and fell out with every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am value conscious, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to buy cheaply made items.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected and he loves it!</li>
            <li>have seen other brushes at a much higher price</li>
            <li>Mine continues to shed hair after three months, but that has not affected the shaving experience in any major way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, isn&#x27;t prickly, and only lost a few hairs when I first used it.</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>The brush sheds like no other and it is still releasing a brown tint when rinsed.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, it is a bit prickly at first, but within five or six shaves it softened up.</li>
            <li>It seems to shed a little more than some of the other brushes I&#x27;ve encountered</li>
            <li>Most of my brushes in the past simply fell apart after a short time.  </li>
            <li>This brush has major manufacturer&#x27;s defects.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my primary, and very expensive brush, this one is cheap and priced nearly as if it was disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>** 03/05/2016:  TWO Major</li>
            <li>You got rid of the one major complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First experience owning a badger brush - so I can&#x27;t offer experience in comparing to other brushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush with low expectations, and boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I had my first one from walmart until it began to fall apart due to reaching it&#x27;s end of use point.</li>
            <li>There is no other way to &amp;#34;describe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>NO worries and NO regrets... ACES!</li>
            <li>This is my first brush but other reviews prompted me to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any major problems with bristles falling off as some reviewers described.</li>
            <li>The other three went into the Christmas stockings of the sons-in-law (&amp;#34;My Three Sons&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>This brush is also a bit more forgiving with the amount of water used to make lather than the more expensive brushes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>some other users reported the first couple times I used it.  </li>
            <li>I have seen some decent ones around $50 to as high as $300 + for a single silvertip badger brush!!!  </li>
            <li>It does have a &#x27;&#x27;new&#x27;&#x27; smell for the first few times that you use it</li>
            <li>Right before first use and after wetting the brush, the wet brush scent was a little off-putting, but after lathering-up and using the brush a couple of times (x3)</li>
            <li>Smelled fairly strong like wet animal initially - which is not unusual for a natural brush, but this continued for the first three weeks of near daily use which seemed longer than with other brushes.</li>
            <li>After owning for a year, this whole time I have been losing hairs from the brush in my shave soap/cream and they come loose on my face or stick in the shave soap.</li>
            <li>For the first two uses there was a slight &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and completely went away after 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to get this inexpensive shaving brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like wet shaving and wanted to keep my initial costs down.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised with the quality and would have bought this as my first everyday brush had I&#x27;d known,</li>
            <li>I first soak the brush for a few minutes in a small ceramic bowl in really hot water (tea pot hot water).</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razor shaving and so far I see no potential for me to ever go back to a 6 blade razor and shaving cream from a can.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very strong chemical smell which has faded a little after washing it a few times.  </li>
            <li>The only real complaint we have is the bristles come out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>There is a real difference in applying shaving cream with badger hair over other types of natural and synthetics.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the handle is comfortable and the bristles are not too rough, but I would choose another brush.</li>
            <li>This brush has lasted one year and is still going strong with regular use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will lose quite a few hairs initially, and a couple every time you use it.</li>
            <li>Apparently I have super hard water, so getting a really good lather is difficult and is easier with a boar bristle brush for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, the first time that I used it, about a dozen or so loose bristles came off - no big deal.</li>
            <li>Holds water and lathers very well, and barely any loose hairs on it.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t loose much, only on the first use.</li>
            <li>Again, not my first brush, but this one constantly has hair coming loose.  </li>
            <li>Initially (the first week of use) loose hairs kept coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding or smell as some other reviewers have noted here but make sure to sanitize the brush before your first use and then maintain it properly during it&#x27;s life (rinse, blow dry if possible, hang upside down to continue drying).</li>
            <li>The bristles are both stiff and soft in just the right way.</li>
            <li>It works well, and certainly lasted longer then expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving and ordered the brush due to its high ratings.  </li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and decided on this brand due to the high ratings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any other shaving brush to compare this to since this in my first foray into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>Also, I installed a powerful disc magnet in the bottom of the handle and now hang it tip-down from a little cubby that&#x27;s set into the wall beside my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really more of a $25-30 brush at less than half the price...and the reason I shop on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the brush does tend to lose hairs during every other shave, even following a normal routine of rinsing the brush and allowing it to dry while hanging from a stand, being sure to keep water from getting on the knot, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently gotten into shaving with soap, that a friend makes,&lt;br /&gt;over shaving with shaving cream, and had a decent brush from a big dept store chain.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This Escali brush gets bonus points for having an Italian name and a classic wooden handle!  </li>
            <li>A decent shaving brush can retain enough soap and liquid to allow several applications without having to “reload”.  </li>
            <li>It has decent sized handle seems small at first</li>
            <li>you really are a small company and want to reach a large market, make a gimmick brush (100% Vaginal Hair) instead of spamming.</li>
            <li>The brush will shed a little a first then stops completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a full 5 is because it sheds a little.</li>
            <li>- this did shed a decent amount over the first few uses, but now it&#x27;s just the occasional hair here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush was not stiff enough.  </li>
            <li>Seems as high a quality as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>There is also a section of hair in the middle, but a little off center, that has more backbone that the surrounding hairs.  </li>
            <li>Smelled a little funny at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a badger brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are skimpy, it is not a very full brush, so much so that even wet, the handle makes the unit top heavy and want to fall out of the shaving mug.</li>
            <li>Almost uncomfortably small it&#x27;s hard to get a good whip going.</li>
            <li>It will lose a little hair the first few uses but that seems pretty normal.</li>
            <li>I would recommend paying a little more and getting L&#x27;Occitane Cade shaving brush for $30, you can get down to $24 if you join their rewards program</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend a substantial amount on a real badger brush.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star rating, because my opinion is positive, but I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes to use superlatives.    </li>
            <li>I bought this due to all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Its not the best brush but its far, far away from being the worst.  </li>
            <li>(badger brushes are generally easier at creating lather than boar.</li>
            <li>is a cheap brush does its job, but loses a lot of the quills/hairs (it sheds like a dog).</li>
            <li>but you generally won&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li>I like it for it&#x27;s weight and thickness, density and softness of the bristles, and general quality.</li>
            <li>I generally see a hair or two fall out during every shave, but otherwise it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have generally used a boars hair brush and decided to try a badger hair.</li>
            <li>Having nothing to compare it to, I will give my general opinions.</li>
            <li>It is very well built and with care, yes, it is a tool gentleman and they should never be abused, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I am not a &#x27;life long&#x27; straight razor user, but will be considered one as of last year.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Perella&#x27;s went above and beyond in this instance; I did not submit any complaint to them directly, nor did I offer a terrible review, but they still reached out to me in an effort to make me happy.  </li>
            <li>Ok I know nothing about shaving brushes, and as a result I may be complaining about something that is normal even with expensive brushes</li>
            <li>not sure if i notice much difference between real and synthetic</li>
            <li>These smells are pretty common with real animal hair brushes</li>
            <li>This brush works well like any other, the packaging was fantastic, but like any other brush....</li>
            <li>I use this as my traveling brush because it is small enough to fit in my shaving kit without being damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has only used it twice so far, but it has lost a lot of bristles both times.</li>
            <li>I will probably upgrade to a silvertip here in the near future!</li>
            <li>I find the bristles are too soft to lather the shave cream properly.</li>
            <li>It is not as soft as my CVS Pharmacy brush but this one does not shed hairs and the price is the same.</li>
            <li>I also changed to Proraso shaving soap when I started using this brush, so I can&#x27;t directly attribute the awesomeness of the lather to them individually, but as a pair.</li>
            <li>hair is soft on your face if you have sensitivity to the rougher brushes this would definitely be the way to go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly a year (11 months) of constant use, I have probably lost 5 hairs (which is nothing).  </li>
            <li>About a year ago I decided to go back to the old way of shaving that my Dad and Grandfathers did it...</li>
            <li>(I think I&#x27;ve only seen 3 bristles fall off so far).  </li>
            <li>I would recomend this to anyone thinking of starting out shaving \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>I would still absolutely recommend this brush as an entry-level brush to those who are getting into DE shaving and just want to get their feet wet.</li>
            <li>I recommend starting out with a Taylor of Old Bond Street</li>
            <li>I started using this a couple of weeks ago and have used it only two times so far.</li>
            <li>I am currently using EJ &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; DE razor with Taylor of Old sandalwood cream.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s manufactured, but the quality is apparent nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Using a shaving brush may seem old fashioned, but once you try it you&#x27;ll never to back to shaving cream in a can.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of time so far.</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it two times, but the brush is still as soft as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li>Beyond that there are some in the $100 range if you get really into the wet shaving lifestyle and</li>
            <li>Well i can tell you its not because of the day my doberman got a hold of it and uses it as a toy, barely lost any bristles that day being</li>
            <li>Pretty rough for the first few shaves, but after a while it softens up.</li>
            <li>I get using this badger brush, Taylor of Old Bond Street avocado shaving cream, and a double edge razor...</li>
            <li>the brush, when wet, didnt hold form very well.</li>
            <li>but wow such a difference.</li>
            <li>They all do what is necessary: create lather from soaps and creams, either directly on the face, in a bowl, or in your hand.</li>
            <li>I have barely lost any hairs in it, and it keeps the shape well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as soft as my last brush</li>
            <li>the brush lasts longer than my old one, I will come back and upgrade to five stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, works well, and while not a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; item, seems like it will stand up to daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The bristles fall out often developed an odor rapidly even with proper care.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a Christmas present to my son who has decided to go old school.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets about buying the Escali brush and will buy another when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take it from a guy with sensitive skin who HAS TO SHAVE DAILY!</li>
            <li>Solid construction, hair is quite soft, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>after about 3-4 uses, i was flicking the water off teh bristles , and the bunch of bristles completely came off of the wooden body..disappointed..</li>
            <li>The bristles fell completely off the handle during its second use.</li>
            <li>Holds lather very well and makes wet shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I saw that it was going to lose some hair, so, for the first two times that I used it I combed it out with the coarse end of my comb, it rarely loses a hair now.</li>
            <li>This brush irritates and barely lasts.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so far</li>
            <li>Finally decided to give old time shaving a go</li>
            <li>the bristles come out frequently interfering with shaving (with a double edged razor anyway).</li>
            <li>So far, its a throw away, but, for $13.00 bucks, well, it&#x27;ll do the job until I find my next one.</li>
            <li>Will have to wait on the durability with use, but everything is terrific so far.</li>
            <li>, it is soft enough on the skin and spreads the soap in an even manner.  </li>
            <li>stated but that is to be expected with real animal hair.</li>
            <li>I recently got into acoustic shaving, old school style.</li>
            <li>but it should be rinsed thoroughly before the first use to remove the dark dye(?) from the bristles.  </li>
            <li>The stink nearly turned me off from it entirely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hanging mine from some string on a towel rack until I have time to make a proper stand, but it&#x27;s treated me well so far.  </li>
            <li>I have brushes that are years old with no such problems.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li>Well; I have purchased dozens of things online over the years and, as far as I remember, this is the only item that I have ever returned.</li>
            <li>Therefore I invested in a German razor, the Escali shaving brush, and a jar of sensitive shaving cream that lasts quite a bit longer than the canned foam.  </li>
            <li>It works well for anyone how wet shaves, and wants to decrease razor burn by preparing your skin for a blade to slide on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that my brush is getting old, the finish is starting separate.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe you spent that much on me.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Consequently the brush struggles to produce a proper lather.&lt;br /&gt;Using real shaving cream with this brush just wastes the cream and much is needed to get a</li>
            <li>Apparently the glue gave way</li>
            <li>After shaving a couple strokes I rinsed my razor out and noticed that I had apparently grown badger hair because that&#x27;s partly what rinsed out of my razor.</li>
            <li>The brush was is soft enough on the face not to bother me.  </li>
            <li>But it is of course real fur, and it had a persistent wet animal smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you want change the way of shaving, old school shaving is totally recommended !!</li>
            <li>Careful though honey badger may pretend not to care, but can be very jealous at the sight of another freshly-shorn badger.</li>
            <li>When his old brush finally needed to be replaced, I chose this one as a birthday gift .</li>
            <li>The brush barely lathered before that fix.  </li>
            <li>If that wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason not to buy this product, the laminated clear coating on the wooden handle has delaminated and is peeling off like a 2-day old Sunburn.</li>
            <li>I just got into wet shaving and did not know much about quality of brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a year now, bristles are still soft and has retained it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times so far and the smell is still there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush once thus far.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to go with a Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap in a Wooden Bowl.</li>
            <li>(As far as badger brushes go, this is the only one I have</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far), but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li>I followed the same practices that I was using with my old brush...</li>
            <li>, I went back to my old brush for now.</li>
            <li>The reason for this is simple - it ensures that the brushes natural hair bristles don&#x27;t chip off or</li>
            <li>Really helps to lather up for the wet shave.  </li>
            <li>My 2yr old female yorkie saw it and must have seen the hair pattern or something.  </li>
            <li>used a brush and actually whipped up the cream in a cup like in the old westerns.  </li>
            <li>I see one hair from the brush on my face about every 3rd complete shave.  </li>
            <li>and now I barely see any.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to Badger hair.  </li>
            <li>I have only used six or seven times so far.  </li>
            <li>and I have not regrets.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised, but the smell was definitely stronger than I anticipated, and</li>
            <li>Been shaving my head on a daily basis, and had to replace my old brush.</li>
            <li>I discontined to use this brush, went back to my old brush, and my face cleared up after a couple of days, and have had no further problems using my old brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and it is back in</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t relish going through a return process for such an inexpensive item, I just broke out the epoxy and fixed it on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for nearly four months now and it continues to perform well.</li>
            <li>Far closer than using standard shacking cream or the lotion w no brush.</li>
            <li>My Dad had a worn out brush, and being old school, only uses brush to lather before shaving.</li>
            <li>No regrets, I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li>I expect it will stop completely after a couple weeks of use, also like my last brush.</li>
            <li>After years of shawing with commercial brands of shawing cream, I decided to try a natural shawing cream and</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this brush, a dark gray dye ran out of the brush and made the shaving soap</li>
            <li>Soft, supple and TOTALLY retro!  </li>
            <li>Looking back, I wish that I had gone to WhippedDog and purchased a silvertip badger hair brush for $26 from the beginning and not wasted my money on this brush - just my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a wooden handled, badger-hair shaving brush, pretty much exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been soaking this brush in steaming hot water (a few seconds after boiling) and it sits for about 5-10 minutes as I shower, and it has held up so far.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, not sure if it is normal</li>
            <li>There is some minimal shedding especially the first use</li>
            <li>Only drawback is the animal smell at first, which frankly I expected.  </li>
            <li>At first, several of the bristles come out, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly as described and delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>It lost a few hairs initially, which I hear this is normal, and I haven&#x27;t lost any hairs since the first week.</li>
            <li>When I first used it several of the hairs fell off, but that was expected.</li>
            <li>But hold on: this brush is well made, is not too expensive, it applies soap exceeding well and the handle nicely fits the nifty brush and razor holder</li>
            <li>The handle is kind of cheesy.</li>
            <li>I almost returned it for that reason alone but it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to go to the post office.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the slow leisurely manner it takes to use it.</li>
            <li>but I own expensive brushes &amp; inexpensive brushes and this one</li>
            <li>bought mine for under $15, and I think it was well worth it, seeing as how you can waste a ton of money on fancy brushes.  </li>
            <li>But from my experience of using this shaving brush the past few weeks, I can honestly say that it does its job</li>
            <li>I used the brush (given to me by my family for birthday)&amp;#62; I enjoy using it with the cream when I have time for a slow shave.</li>
            <li>You could do much worse, you could do much better.</li>
            <li>(some others have had better, and others worse experiences in that regard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an ok brush for the money but not great.</li>
            <li>Once properly broken in, the brush is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it will stop soon, will update after more use and broken in.</li>
            <li>it shed routinely and smelled a bit like a small animal (not a bad smell, but it did smell).</li>
            <li>The bristles were a little stiff on my face for the first few days, but they have softened nicely and no longer feel like they are pricking my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush for my son to use as he started with a straight razor - it high quality and quite stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut shaving prices down considerably, and get a much shave.</li>
            <li>The first couple shaves I was losing 10-20 hairs, but now it&#x27;s down to a hair or two per shave.</li>
            <li>It has lots a few bristles which is a little surprising compared to other badger brushes I&#x27;ve used, but we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend buying a brush stand to hang the brush to dry.  </li>
            <li>The more expensive brush doesn&#x27;t shed, but is about 1/3 less &#x27;full&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Having shaved with a brush for over 20 years I recently found myself in need of a new one and ordered several from Amazon to try.   </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this especially to someone new to this method of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I utilized 5 minute epoxy to join the two back together, but a new product should require such measures.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this will last me for a very long time and I won&#x27;t have to throw as much away.</li>
            <li>Very little smell that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>The other was lower in cost, but wasn&#x27;t 100% Pure Badger.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly try other products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a super expensive brush, so it&#x27;s great for beginners in DE shaving to get to start with.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems to shed bristles to easily.</li>
            <li>I hang it to dry on the rack, and it dries perfectly, ready for the next shave.</li>
            <li>It will dry much faster and last longer.</li>
            <li>My previous brush would constantly shed and this brush rarely sheds.</li>
            <li>This will tame the natural odor and soften before first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received shipment quickly, and the brush is a well crafted piece, which feels solid and heavy in hand.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe this brush will last me at least a decade.</li>
            <li>cheap brush bristles keep falling out -dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li>There was a little minor shedding the first few days, but that has pretty much stopped.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of other better brushes out there at the same price and you shouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this one.    </li>
            <li>When it comes right down to it,  this is a solid product.</li>
            <li>There were quite a few loose hairs when he first started using it, but it has since stopped shedding so much.</li>
            <li>Been so long since I had a new brush</li>
            <li>but I soaked mine overnight a few times in diluted lemon dish washing liquid and the odor came right out.</li>
            <li>For the first month, the brush was stiffer than the previous brush.  </li>
            <li>I had a slight issue with the first one that was sent out to me and without any questions they sent me out a replacement</li>
            <li>Some people mention an odor, mine had a slight &amp;#34;badgery&amp;#34; smell the first couple of uses, but this has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I said in the subject line.</li>
            <li>When I first used the brush it lost a half dozen bristles</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted at a third of the the price of other shaving bushes</li>
            <li>I have only recently started using a shaving brush, so I have no past experience with them.  </li>
            <li>hairs are very coarse and sharp and the density is pretty lacking.</li>
            <li>But I have had no problems with bristles falling out; the only time I lost a few hairs was the very first time I used the brush.  </li>
            <li>I get the exact same performance from this Escali brush at a fraction of the cost of my other brush.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave 4 stars is that the brush was smaller especially compared to my older ones.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend still uses this because we don&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a brush, but the hairs quickly became flattened and somewhat matted after a small amount of use...</li>
            <li>Odor is small and goes away quickly..</li>
            <li>You might get a little softer or a lose a few less bristles if you buy a more expensive product, but for the price it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also got a few other popular products to begin my shave den such as Proraso Green, my Merkur 34C, and a decent brush/razor stand.</li>
            <li>I was worried I would need a more expensive brush, but I feel confident now that this will last me at least a year.</li>
            <li>I expected a few to drop during the first few shaves while it worked itself out, but it&#x27;s becoming a bit unacceptable to continue having this</li>
            <li>It holds just enough water to make adding the cream easy without making a wet mess of things.  </li>
            <li>I know other commenters have said it gets soft over time, but when I bought the Van der Hagen kit previously, it was soft right away.  </li>
            <li>Very new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick in diameter, meaning it&#x27;ll only hold enough lather for two, maybe three passes.</li>
            <li>No loose hair.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical considering this is a pure badger  brush at a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>(I still use a more animal-friendly artificial bristle brush from the Body Shop, which is fine but less luxurious.)</li>
            <li>I remain with my original brush which I was going to replace, but it loses a couple of bristles a shave, the Escali 4 or 5 times that.</li>
            <li>Why are other brushes so darn much.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to other brushes its much cheaper and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between badger and boar, other than the color.</li>
            <li>This brush does everything that other brushes costing 5 times as much do.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about other brushes.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected, a lower middle of the road brush that performed well enough for ~10 bucks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it does get a little messy.</li>
            <li>I had a few hairs fall out from the brush the first couple times I used it, but nothing major</li>
            <li>Only use a few times thus far but exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It creates a really rich and thick lather with my Prorasso shave cream.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create rich thick lather.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick lather and a luxurious close shave.</li>
            <li>I shave about 2-3 times a week (less than average) and it has lasted me 2 years and imagine it will last me several more years.</li>
            <li>What did it in for me was that after about 6 uses, with typical lather technique, the middle part of the brush (essentially the core of the brush where most lather should be) became depressed into the brush, the bristles became tangled down there and that results in a garbage lather.</li>
            <li>The badger hair is strong ( no more loose badger hair creeping up the nose).</li>
            <li>Has a solid wooden handle, 100% full and dense bristles, and it retains heat from the lather as long as any other badger brush.</li>
            <li>After the brush was completely dry, I noticed it was softer than when it was new.  </li>
            <li>First off, I am new to DE shaving and purchased this brush due to other posted reviews about one month ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff at first obviously, but after a while the badger hair gets soft and they have also stayed in the brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this cheap brush if you&#x27;re serious about your shave.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, this brush is really smooth.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have a huge base to use for comparison, but I&#x27;ve been absolutely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is the fraying/shedding that never quite goes away, though it&#x27;s easy enough to just trim it.  </li>
            <li>Loads very well and keeps wet for an entire shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about ten times and have only lost a couple brush hairs so far.  </li>
            <li>I have bought three of these; the 2nd and 3rd were for my adult sons.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t really have anything to compair it to, I can only tell you this brush has worked as well as I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Some minor shedding at first, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li>The only reason this brush doesn&#x27;t get five stars is because in the first few uses some of the bristles came out, but this is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so this could just be a normal thing that I am unaware of.</li>
            <li>After only a week or so, there was a &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; in the middle of the brush where the hairs had completely fallen out, or tangled together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know a lot of about shaving brushes, so take this information with a grain of salt as it&#x27;s possible that this is normal for them or that it&#x27;s not going to cause any problems for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has become more difficult to find old fashioned razors and the associated brushes and soaps needed.</li>
            <li>After several shaves that stopped happening and it has been a solid brush so far.</li>
            <li>current brush is approaching 9 years old.</li>
            <li>Please, please, please do not waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;**New wet shavers and old alike,</li>
            <li>It was smaller than what I expected but the build/material quality was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a dew days of staying away from the brush, and going back to my old shawing methods, I used it again, only this time noticing that the brush is the source of the smell.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra few dollars for badger.</li>
            <li>The varnish did not dry evenly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to whip in a cup, but difficult to get a good lather on my face because of how uncomfortable the bristles were.</li>
            <li>A few of the hairs have come out but again, not unexpected and still feels full.</li>
            <li>They must not have used a good enough adhesive to keep the hairs attached to the wood because as I lather up my beard hairs come off and get stuck in the lather, which is itchy and infuriating.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;escali\\&quot; name on the front leads one to believe it&#x27;s an Italian product, however I&#x27;m not sure this is in fact true as there is no indication on the product page or on the product itself as to where it&#x27;s manufactured.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have lost a few strands within a few weeks of purchase, but besides that, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>He suggested since I was just getting into the wet shaving trend, I buy this particular brush.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m not gentle at all.  </li>
            <li>I just switched to the single blade razor and my friend told me I needed the cream and brush to go along with my new shaving system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just transitioned to the wet shaving, and Escali brush definitely plays a big part in making it a positive experience.</li>
            <li>It lays down the most uniform lather on my face in comparison to any of the non-Badger hair shaving cream brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>the brish itself, it smelled a little at first.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty stirdy little brush.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little prickly when you first start to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I give it 4 stars because off all the hair that came out at first, and because it is a little prickely.  </li>
            <li>a little at first-</li>
            <li>It shed a little the first week or so, but shedding is now a rarity.  </li>
            <li>It did have a little odor at first</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little prickly at first</li>
            <li>This little brush could not be of higher quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of basis for comparison with other more expensive brushes, but this brush gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li>I use it with some hot shave soap lather and it&#x27;s like a little luxury in the morning.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the hair loss was due to the break in, but months later I was still losing several hairs on every shave.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush it did have a little bit of odor.</li>
            <li>I lost a little bit of hair the first couple uses</li>
            <li>The brush sheds a little bit here in there in the first week but nothing to warrant spending twice the price on another.</li>
            <li>I was a little thrown off by the smell the bristles give off at first.</li>
            <li>A little glue from the hot glue gun</li>
            <li>I use barbasol and a little bowl to lather up with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did shed a little the first 2-3 times I used it</li>
            <li>It is a little scratchy at first, but that goes away over time.  </li>
            <li>Nothing major but enough to mention it.  </li>
            <li>This thing feels a little prickly at first</li>
            <li>It was a little smelly (Badger) at first, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush so take my review with a little grain of salt.  </li>
            <li>a little badger whiskers on the face never hurt no one ; )</li>
            <li>I never carry big cans of shaving cream, but I do carry a this high quality pure badger shaving brush, and a small bar of shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll loose a few bristles the first couple of times you use them, that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>Firm and tight bristles, with a soft and comfortable feel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for newbies to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for wet shavers on a budget.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this brush to anyone who is getting into the wet shaving trend that is making a comeback.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking to start wet shaving or already are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more expensive brushes in the past but this one lived up to being at least as good.</li>
            <li>It does not come up to the feel of one of my other Italian pure badger brushes (costing around 40-50 dollars).</li>
            <li>Try out the different brushes and you&#x27;ll notice a difference between the pure and other brushes.</li>
            <li>Also, a few of the bristles do become loose and fall off during the first couple uses, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, so I ran it under hot water with a bit of shaving cream and used the brush on the palm of my hand before shaving with it to get rid of a majority of the loose bristles.</li>
            <li>It only gives me a smooth shave everyday, my razors lasts longer!!</li>
            <li>the mean time, for the price and the use I have gotten out of it so far (~3 months) this brush was well worth the price for an introduction into brush lathering.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t going to last a long time, so be prepared to buy a new one every couple months.</li>
            <li>This brush was exactly what I wanted it to be, no more and no less.</li>
            <li>Having used it a few days, I am pretty certain it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>thoughts:  If you are on a tight budge, this little guy will get you by until such time you can afford a better brush since this one will not be the last brush you ever buy.</li>
            <li>My husband took a step back a few years ago by switching to safety razors and shave soap - cheaper, less waste, all the good reasons.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that although this is a great starter brush it sheds like crazy!</li>
            <li>He really appreciate this gift and uses on a regular basis due his skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brushes and they were much softer then this, and around the same cost.</li>
            <li>I read some negative reviews but decided to try it since it was 1/2-1/3 or even more of the price of some other shave brushes.</li>
            <li>Although it was bought for someone else it gets stolen on a regular basis and due to that I can say it holds up very well.</li>
            <li>I am rapidly approaching middle age,&amp;#34;I am 72&amp;#34; I have always since age, about 18 used a garden variety Drug Store, or Grocery Store, shaving brush; well let me tell all who might be interested, this brush is; at least for me, far, far, ahead of those garden variety brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as other badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit coarse but apparently need to be for lathering up well.</li>
            <li>After used this brush daily for about a week, it not was a quarter sized bare patch.  </li>
            <li>and I am not especially rough on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up very well for several months of daily, rough use, and I even bought my wife one just like it</li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are very coarse to the skin, especially for those who have sensitive skin and are likely to bleed during a shave.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the brush did shed several of its bristles on the first shave, and continues to lose an average of one or two per shave a couple of weeks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a natural product, I was not surprised or taken aback, and now it is odor-free and does not stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also quite prickly, and not near as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The bargain price is no excuse for being covered in badger hair.</li>
            <li>So far it has performed well with minor bristle shedding.</li>
            <li>This is by far the nicest brush I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  </li>
            <li>A few hairs came off on the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>Shed a lot for the first few uses</li>
            <li>The Brush came in pretty humble packaging.  </li>
            <li>A few of the hairs came out the first couple of times using it.</li>
            <li>My understanding was that some bristles would come out the first few uses until the brush is &amp;</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, there were a few stray hairs from the brush that fell off onto my face.</li>
            <li>Had just a few hair&#x27;s fall off while using it, for the first time.</li>
            <li>A few hairs fell out the first time the brush was used.</li>
            <li>I noticed a smell for the first few days, but probably wouldn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>A few bristles fell out over the first couple of shaves, but none after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this after my first badger-hair brush fell apart after a few months.  </li>
            <li>Looses a few hairs for about the first week, but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li>A few hairs come out in the first use but</li>
            <li>For the first few times the fur was coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li>Prepare a hot water soap with a few drops of dish soap.</li>
            <li>You might want to shampoo it when you first get it to remove the funky smell; I didn&#x27;t, though, and the smell went away after a few shaves.</li>
            <li>It also shed a few bristles during the first couple uses but seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li>up, I did notice that the bristles were a bit prickly during the first few uses.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews of the Escali brush here on Amazon and decided it was worth the small investment to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It shed a lot during the first few uses.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used this you&#x27;d think I had lathered up and rubbed my face on my dog.  </li>
            <li>but it does lose quite a few hairs in the first 5 uses but then the problem stopped.</li>
            <li>Note that a few hairs will come out the first couple of times, but that&#x27;s temporary.</li>
            <li>I noticed I lost a few badger hairs from the brush after first use.</li>
            <li>I thought it was acceptable the first few times</li>
            <li>I did notice after the first few weeks</li>
            <li>It shedded a bit in the first few uses, but that tapered off after using it a bit.  </li>
            <li>it did lose some hair for the first few days</li>
            <li>had a few bristles fall out the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>I did lose a few bristles on the first use though.  </li>
            <li>For those saying the bristles fall out, that happens with any brush in this cost range the first few times you use it.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend soaking it a few times in hot water, and remove the looser bristles.</li>
            <li>Where there&#x27;s trouble is the badger hair consistently falls out.</li>
            <li>It will also shed hairs the first few times you use</li>
            <li>Took about a week to \\&quot;break in,\\&quot; meaning for the first few days</li>
            <li>Lost a few hairs at first.</li>
            <li>Expect some shedding for the first few days</li>
            <li>You lose some fibers the first few uses but after that nothing.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, this brush is exactly what I need for travel.</li>
            <li>There were a few hairs that shed with the first dozen</li>
            <li>The brush did shed a few bristles at first</li>
            <li>first few times I used it a number of bristles seemed to come out, but that seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li>Ordered these as entry brushes for a few friends looking to get into higher quality shaving.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have lost a few hairs the first couple times.</li>
            <li>first few uses, it lost a hefty amount of hairs (now it might lose one or two hairs</li>
            <li>This shaving brush does have an odor the first few times you use it</li>
            <li>The first day I lost quite a few, but now the loss is tolerable.  </li>
            <li>just remember to let your Escali brush soak in a cup of hot water for a few minutes before you shave.</li>
            <li>You do lose a few hairs when you first start</li>
            <li>this brush had some coloration that washed out during the first few goes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs the first time I shaved but haven&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li>It lost quite a few hairs at first</li>
            <li>After a few came out at first I have had none falling out on me.</li>
            <li>Those are going to come out within the first few times I use it.</li>
            <li>Some hairs did come off of the brush during the first few uses, but that stopped after ~5 uses.</li>
            <li>A few bristles came out, but he said they always do when you first use them.</li>
            <li>Yeah, a few bristles fell out with the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Lots a few hairs after first use.  </li>
            <li>After the first shave with it, I noticed that there was quite a few hairs falling out.</li>
            <li>I have lost a few bristles at first</li>
            <li>A few hairs came out on first use, but none since</li>
            <li>It does smell at first as people say, but that is what happens when you use dead animal hair on your face.</li>
            <li>A few strands come out the first couple times, but nothing that effects the product.</li>
            <li>It shed a ton the first time I used it and still sheds a few hairs each time I use it now.</li>
            <li>At first a few bristles would come out when lathering up, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with it after  the first few uses.</li>
            <li>The brush does shed a few hairs when you first get it but that stops after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>Upon first use just a few brush hairs came out of the brush but</li>
            <li>As soon as the brush is wet, it smells close to a wet dog but distinct enough to be (what I assume is)</li>
            <li>A few hairs fell out on the first couple uses, but it stopped soon after that.  </li>
            <li>The brush did smell a bit &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; when I first got it, but that wore off after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li>To summarize, this brush is WELL worth the small investment.  </li>
            <li>A few hairs fell of the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to using a brush on soap, I think I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to a fuller, more expensive brush (maybe even silvertip!).  </li>
            <li>Not a bad brush, but it loses a couple of bristles every time I use it.</li>
            <li>As expected, the first use or two resulted in a couple loose hairs, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues.  </li>
            <li>It might still be breaking in and loose bristles might be expected at first from manufacturing.</li>
            <li>A man has to shave and this brush certainly makes it less of a chore.</li>
            <li>Pure is the lowest quality classification typically used.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I feel the handle is too small as most of the lather created always drips down.</li>
            <li>new brush was about half the cost of the old one.&lt;br /&gt;JF</li>
            <li>Very few loose hairs compared to the other more expensive brand I own.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but it may have been worse than the original brush!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted it has the smell of a new brush on first use, not uncommon for hair brushes, and may be reduced by washing with shampoo before first use.  </li>
            <li>Was a decent brush...not too harsh (and not as soft as hoped)</li>
            <li>The main problem is that the handle is too short to grip when your hand is wet.  </li>
            <li>A decent brush for someone looking to try traditional wet</li>
            <li>Pros - price (mine cost under 10 USD), real badger hair, compact size, dries well in down position.</li>
            <li>I hang it upside down (under my sink) and it dries out very quickly (much faster than the boar brush used to).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving (years of using multi-blade systems with canned shaving mush don&#x27;t count), and this is my first badger shaving brush; it replaced a synthetic bristle brush I was using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I washed it with some dishwashing liquid when I first opened the package (not because it was dirty or smelled bad, but because I didn&#x27;t want to rub something all over my face without making sure it was clean first!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too stiff, but is soft enough for a gentle exfoliation of your face.</li>
            <li>Hello fellow wet shavers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush back in August when I chose to dive right into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I usually lose about 1 per shave currently, although I&#x27;m sure that will become less as time goes by.</li>
            <li>I was a little suprised though at how prickly the tips were when I first used it despite its overall softness</li>
            <li>It did shed a little for the first couple uses, but the boar bristle one i had initially did also.....</li>
            <li>The first time my husband used this, it left a bunch of little hairs all over his face.</li>
            <li>I have since invested in a decent razor - merkur, and have invested in other products.</li>
            <li>A lot of hairs fell out initially, and now it is only 1 or 2 per shave, but I assume the really high end brushes don&#x27;t have any loose hairs.</li>
            <li>I found the varnish on this brush to be way too slick, and had trouble hanging onto it with soapy hands, and so I went through all the trouble to remove the finish right down to the wood, and then, while I was at it, I used a high-speed rotary tool and appropriate burrs to create a random pattern of shallow holes with sharp edges at the surface of the wood (so as to provide a good gripping surface when the handle was slippery with soap).</li>
            <li>It was cheap yet highly rated; I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive brush if I didn&#x27;t like the safety razor</li>
            <li>This badger shaving brush is not cheap, but if an old fashioned shaving experience is what you desire, you need this high quality,well made brush.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I expected so much, and it really isn&#x27;t a big enough problem to make me want a different brush any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice a very few brush hairs fall out after about 3 uses, but after about 1 month worth of use</li>
            <li>I would practice lather making with any strong scent shaving cream or soap a few times to get the smell down to an acceptable level before actual use.</li>
            <li>I held the brush up and purposely plucked any bristles that were noticeably longer than the rest; wow, I gently removed over a dozen with very little effort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bulky as some other more expensive brushes but it works really well.</li>
            <li>However, when I wet my brush and swirled Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream in a bowl with it, a rich, thick lather appeared.....</li>
            <li>the bristles will fall out due to the wooden brush handle drying much more slowly that the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing is that I loose a hair or two when I use it, then again I am pretty rough on it.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and so figured i would get an inexpensive brush to get started.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m new to the world of wet shaving, and just about everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively New to wet shaving with a brush and soap, so I was quite unsure what to look for in a quality brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving (6 mo).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to others new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Its loosing some of the hairs but since its a new brush, it is expected to happen.</li>
            <li>but I imagine it is expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to give a bit of assurance to new wet shavers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and got this brush because it was an inexpensive option to get started.  </li>
            <li>Im new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and purchased this brush based on all the reviews I saw here.</li>
            <li>I found the bristles to be pretty stiff, too.</li>
            <li>I am new to the classic safety razor and brush shave and didn&#x27;t want to invest a small fortune into something I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like or not.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend over any of the other shaving brushes, could not be happier!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle</li>
            <li>Now, when it said it was 100% pure badger hair, call me naive, but I thought that was some gimmick name for new brush hair technology.</li>
            <li>, there is a slight prickly feeling i really like.</li>
            <li>(it is shiny and chrome and i am a guy, so i dig it) to let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use i&#x27;m finding less and less hair each time so eventually it may stop shedding all together, but i would definitely prefer one that was shed free from day 1.</li>
            <li>This is the lowest of the grade and on a dry face if you put the plume directly to your face</li>
            <li>/&gt;If half stars were permitted I would have given this product 4 1/2 stars based on how much I like it and the price point.</li>
            <li>You can spend $75 on a brush with a fantastic handle and hairs that never come out, or you can buy this one for less than 1/5th of the price, and get the same value for less money...which increases its value....</li>
            <li>Soft on dry skin and doesn&#x27;t shed like a spaniel in August.</li>
            <li>You want to hang dry the brush to prevent early wear.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well and and has lost less than 5 bristles since I have owned it.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for a low cost general brush, especially with shave soap</li>
            <li>This brush provided the quality I was looking for, the smooth lather necessary to cut my not so shave-friendly facial hair, and the price that left it very financially viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely 5 star, and call me naive, but I cannot imagine what else you would look for in a badger brush that the Escali does not provide.</li>
            <li>I cannot really afford lot of money to buy expensive brush but really wanted to get some decent brush...and found it here...</li>
            <li>On my second shave only 2 hairs came off and the brush barely smelled.</li>
            <li>As far as durability and longevity, I don&#x27;t know how long a shaving brush should last.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but so far, only a couple of bristles have come out.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles with only minor break-in required&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hear its super common.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as pictured and came on time to surprise my hubby with on Valentine&#x27;s Day (not easy to find these in stores).</li>
            <li>It shed when I first tired making lather with it, but I didn&#x27;t know you were supposed to &amp;#34;pre-shed&amp;#34; it before really using it.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the brush is that it shed quite a bit during the first few uses and continues to lose a couple of hairs with each use.  </li>
            <li>My brush lost a total of about 3 bristles over the first few weeks of use.    </li>
            <li>I think I only had bristles (and just a few) fall out with the first shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the brush for a few weeks, but it appears to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes I can&#x27;t comment on more expensive brushes, but it is hard for me to understand how much better a $50 brush could be than this inexpensive model.</li>
            <li>The brush had shed a lot of hairs initially (in the first two weeks) then stabilized to one or two hairs falling everyday.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that the first few times I used it, some of the hair/bristles fell out while lathering.  </li>
            <li>The bristles have softened with use and the amount of shedding (happens with all brushes no matter the quality) is pretty miniscule only a few hairs after four sessions.</li>
            <li>Works well for about a year and then loses bristles quickly.  </li>
            <li>Initially lost a few hairs at first use (~50?) but has stopped shedding since then.</li>
            <li>and/or loses bristles quickly.  </li>
            <li>for the animal smell; yes it is there, but only for the first few uses.</li>
            <li>Mine did not have any odor whatsoever and minimal hair loss at first use as i expected.</li>
            <li>I lost several bristles in the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>The first time my husband used the shaving brush, it smelled like a wet dog - or maybe a wet badger.  </li>
            <li>This product came to us when expected and was exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>Smells very odd at first, but it seems to go away.</li>
            <li>I usually buy at few Meyers for just a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li>Only a few hairs have come off in the first month.</li>
            <li>Also, be prepared for a musky smell, especially the first few times, presumably from this being badger hair.</li>
            <li>It did shed a very slight amount and had a hint of a smell at first.</li>
            <li>It loads quickly, lathers well, and rarely loses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lost a few bristles in the 1/2 dozen first uses, but this may just be the initial break-in..</li>
            <li>Little rough at first but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the loss of a lot of hairs as I had read was normal - there were only a few the very first few times.  </li>
            <li>only reason for 4/5 stars is just due to the fact that on the first use, a bunch of bristles came out which gave me a negative first impression.</li>
            <li>big plus is that even though I don&#x27;t hang it upside down; it really dries well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s true that there are a few loose badger bristles left on your face initially</li>
            <li>Hairs falling out constantly and was super hard to get the roadkill smell out of it.</li>
            <li>As some of the other reviewers have stated, it is slightly prickly for the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not very annoying.</li>
            <li>Soft to the skin but stiff enough to produce a decent lather with shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and apply the shaving cream in a smooth, delicate manner, while also raising the facial hair slightly to make for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It will lose hairs the first few times you use it, which is annoying but probably not all that uncommon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this again because I don&#x27;t use it that much and the hairs appear to have stopped falling out but still not cool.</li>
            <li>first thing I&#x27;ve noticed during my first use of the brush is an intense unpleasant chemical smell.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the bristles come out of it pretty frequently</li>
            <li>The Escali is very similar to my old brush; it loses a lot of hairs at first.  </li>
            <li>not long after the third time using it the bristles have been coming off  a lot</li>
            <li>First thing is it is actually animal hair, so it smells like a wet animal when it gets wet.</li>
            <li>I only lost couple of bristles the first couple of times and lost none the last few times.</li>
            <li>There was also fairly few loose hairs in the first use, certainly fewer than other brushes I have</li>
            <li>only people that would consider purchasing this brush would be someone new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I looked online and found that an initial odor was to be expected from new brushes and that with use and washing (w/ borax, vinegar, baking soda, shampoo, etc), the smell would go away.  </li>
            <li>Several bristles have fallen out but this is to be expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to wet shaving and this is my second brush.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving, I had done enough research to determine that I wanted to go with a Badger brush compared to either Boar or Horse hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend excessively on my initial brush, soap, safety razor etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all traditional wet shavers!</li>
            <li>However, I like the brush but hair strands continue to come loose and the strands are not as soft as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>: Soft, not very much hair falling out after 4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>He says it works great and doesn&#x27;t look bad setting on the sink (also to dry) during non use.</li>
            <li>It will last longer and dry completely.</li>
            <li>Easily the worst brush I own.</li>
            <li>If dried properly (hanging freely upside down)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had another one now for a year, storing it hanging upside down properly, and it&#x27;s lasting very well.</li>
            <li>Whips up lather quick and thick (enough).</li>
            <li>Works really well and have only lost a few bristles the first few times.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick, natural, pure Badger bristles whip up a lather quickly and apply it thickly.  </li>
            <li>After use I rinse out the brush in running hot water and let it dry hanging down (handle up)</li>
            <li>Super glued them back in and they have stayed since, but not very happy as now bristles are shedding.</li>
            <li>after four days of use, and I have ordered a synthetic brush which I expect to be better (at least in the smell department), especially when used with the Jack Black Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>It is well put together, and at less than half the cost of most of the other brushes on Amazon, it was a solid buy.</li>
            <li>This brush works fine, but I&#x27;m tired of picking badger hair off my face when trying to shave.</li>
            <li>This brush will do the job just fine, I have shaved with it plenty of time, but there is not much joy in using it and my shave cream is covered in hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li>Now the shaving brush looks seriously deformed and patchy when it should be in full bloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whereas I&#x27;ve found boar bristles somewhat stiff and horsehair unpleasantly fragrant, badger brushes are properly soft, spread the soap evenly, and clean easily.</li>
            <li>Since the brush is new, I expected quite a bit of hair loss for the first few weeks, but I was very surprised to find almost no loose strands, at least so far.  </li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave and little to no razor burn every shave.</li>
            <li>Very well made and add a little class to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I really like this little brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a few loose bristles, which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of 5,  but all in all, this brush is worth owning.</li>
            <li>So if you are on a budget new to wet shaving or just want to try the brush I encourage not to delay and give it a shot!</li>
            <li>Only precaution is to store it with the bristles down - easy enough with a rubber band wrapped around a small towel rod.</li>
            <li>Only other point I can add is that if you have big hands, go for a brush with longer stem since this one may prove too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight animal smell, but only if you wet it and stick your nose right in it ( which I did for the sake of this review).</li>
            <li>As the brush bloomed, a large empty spot has appeared in the center of the hairs.</li>
            <li>This is much nicer than applying by hand, and it actually does help to get shaving cream under the hairs to raise them up a little.</li>
            <li>Once this little jewel is broken you will begin to see why this brush is so popular.  </li>
            <li>If you, like thousands of other shoppers on Amazon are considering buying the Colonel Conk Shaving Stand to hold this brush and your razor, you should know that the Escali brush handle is just a shade too thick to slide easily into the prongs.</li>
            <li>Did loose a few hairs right off but not enough to worry</li>
            <li>Also a stand would probably be useful, but I just loosely wrap mine in two pieces of toilet paper and keep it in the little cup I use to lather up the cream.</li>
            <li>It is neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t really use it any more.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, both good and bad, then ordered.  </li>
            <li>Good brush for the money , I use it every day , when it starts going bad</li>
            <li>Works up a good lather&lt;br /&gt;Noticing some shedding but nothing too bad at the moment</li>
            <li>I had hoped that they would be soft but they are not, at least not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Once it became clear I was going to stick with wet shaving I bought a mid-level Parker shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate its longevity, but it is quite clearly a quality product that I expect will last a long time.</li>

            <li> Now I am getting the best shaves of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want a badger hair brush, splurge for a Best or Silvertip brush instead of settling for a cheaper one like this.</li>
            <li> so I instead went with a best badger brush by Edwin Jagger (Model 1ej947sds):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B002QI45Z0 Edwin Jagger Best Badger Shaving Brush With Drip Stand,</li>

            <li> My face feels great!!</li>
            <li> My husband said it was the best brush he&#x27;s owned.</li>
            <li> He says it is the best brush ever.  </li>
            <li> Not the best quality shaving brush but gets the work done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve upgraded from a boar hair brush and the quality of this brush is impressive for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this product.  </li>

            <li> This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve tried in its class.  </li>
            <li> This is not the best shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money, although not the softest of brushes but still quite luxurious</li>
            <li> The Escali shaving brush is an excellent value for the cost and the softness of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Some soaps are also picky as to which soaps they will do their best work with.</li>
            <li> This Product is awesome.  </li>

            <li> This was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t feel great.  </li>

            <li> I think that it could have a bit more bristle stiffness, but for the price, it is perfectly serviceable.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; but, for the money, this is an excellent shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It lathers great and seems to be made of good quality.</li>

            <li> This is by no means the perfect badger hair brush, but as an entry-level improvement to a boar bristle brush, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is a great size, and creates/holds a good amount of lather.</li>

            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> I had this for about a week, used it a good bit, and found my soap covered in what looked a hobos beard.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good brush.</li>
            <li> really good brush.</li>

            <li> Badger is the way to go and this brush meets the need at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This brush is well built and helps create a good lather with the soap I use.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and at a good price.</li>
            <li> This brush has been good to lather up with.  </li>
            <li> It arrived ahead of schedule &amp; the price a good deal as well for a brush made with badger hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush was excellent for lathering the soap and felt smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> and I decided to look for a good one online.</li>
            <li> This brush is as good as any of the ones I saw  for 3 to 5 times the price.</li>
            <li> Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2) Creates good lather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s superior to shaving cream in every way.</li>
            <li> It will shed, but for the price its good.</li>
            <li> Good brush.</li>
            <li> For what you pay, it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li> A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I get a good lather from the brush.  </li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> Feels good, works well.</li>
            <li> Seems to be fairly sturdy now that it has shed out&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Came in good time.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any good comps.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see why anyone would pay over $100 for a brush when this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Good cheapie to use, if you are a beginner and want to see if you like DE safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> It breaks in nicely, for a great lather and shave.</li>
            <li> Nice brush at a great price point.</li>
            <li> Good brush</li>
            <li> Good company and a good product</li>
            <li> USA Vitamins did a good job with delivery.  </li>
            <li> My advice to anyone who enjoys a good lather is to skip the value brush and just buy a &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; out of the gate.  </li>
            <li> Its a good brush.</li>
            <li> I had a cake of shaving soap to review on my blog, and for the longest time I was using it without a good brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a stand for it, but otherwise a good product and good value.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Looks and feels great, fits in the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to do that good of a job.  </li>
            <li> Take my advice and put another twenty to thirty bucks with this and get yourself a good brush..</li>
            <li> This is a good, moderately-priced brush.</li>
            <li> Provides good lather.  </li>
            <li> Build up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Good placeto start with de shaving</li>

            <li> Seems to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> This has a good feel to it, and is a badger brush, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> if you want to stick with cartridge marketing gimmicks I still say this could be a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your like me and just wanted to try one out before dropping off 100 bucks on a nicer one, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> The price was so good on this brush</li>
            <li> It works really good.  </li>
            <li> You guys keep up the good work</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> me, this + Merkur 34C razor + Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades + Van Der</li>
            <li> If you want good value this is it  </li>

            <li> The brush feels good against the face.</li>
            <li> It holds water well, gives a good lather, and feels good.</li>
            <li> Fair price, good product,fast shipping.  </li>

            <li> Feels good on contact with your skin and good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with Proraso shaving soap and it works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, that all seems to have gone away now - the brush has started to work well and holds a good bit of lather.</li>

            <li> Excellent shave brush, no foul smell, breaks in well, and creates a smooth lather.  </li>
            <li> Hair keeps falling out and does not keep a shape that allows you to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Receiver loved it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good performer for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is good</li>

            <li> Just paint on with the brush, then good to go.  </li>
            <li> This is a good value for the money.</li>

            <li> Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in my hand and is made well.</li>
            <li> Iv looked on amazon and this is the best price for a genuine badger brush.</li>

            <li> Good brush for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good starter brush.  </li>
            <li> Builds up quite the lather with a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> good brush...</li>
            <li> (Which is really good for a Badger brush).</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good badger brushes start at around $30.</li>
            <li> Quality is good.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Works up a good lather.</li>

            <li> Good brush,  got another for my son.</li>
            <li> Seems to be of good qualitity - my husband hasn&#x27;t used this yet.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is good and the feeling on the beard was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It also feels good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t stink like a boars hair brush, but it tends to lose hair with each shave.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t justify giving that when this one is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> Good feel.  </li>
            <li> My brother loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product for price.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money.</li>
            <li> For the beginner it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It feels good and holds lather well, and it doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, feels and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, some hairs come out sometimes, but good luck finding one that doesn&#x27;t shed every once in a while</li>
            <li> Good if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Saw the price and reviews and thought this looks really good.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product</li>
            <li> This brush is of good quality and I have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Also came in a timely fashion, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the brush itself deserves 3 stars, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because the service was good.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert shaver, makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> If it lasts than 3 months, I will downgrade it, but the price was good, so.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality product.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Brush fits good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> This helps me get a good shave each morning.</li>
            <li> good quality, fair price, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  </li>
            <li> Badgers do not smell good.  </li>
            <li> I like to experiment to see what is best for me and how cheap I can get out for.  </li>
            <li> Good luck and</li>
            <li> Good luck and</li>
            <li> the soap leathers up nicely and works great.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter as the brush separates leaving no head to brisssle your face or wrestle up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Nothing offensive that I can detect, so that&#x27;s another good thing.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is both a good product and a reasonably-priced one.  </li>
            <li> However, I like how this brush feels on my face, and it does a good job</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> Feels good in hand.</li>
            <li> i dont find a good reason to switch to a brush..</li>
            <li> and it seems to be fairly well made.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It helps give a good lather &amp; is constructed well.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush feels great on my face and gets the soap lathered up nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair entry-level brush, but don&#x27;t expect longevity here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and reliable, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> It gives me a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Still, it works great and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good quality bristles and cut.</li>
            <li> Good wetting and lathering.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> In addition it give a good face scrub.</li>
            <li> I think the price is good.  </li>
            <li> The build is good quality.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and is made with good quality.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had that happen with good makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of lifting whiskers while applying the lather to my face.</li>

            <li> Also, I use the shaving brush to apply the cream to my scalp and I find the brush holds a fair amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> But if you want a brush that exfoliates (or if you like to rotate your brushes), this can be a good thing.  </li>

            <li> , I just look for it in the bowl as my good luck charm.  </li>
            <li> I take good care of it</li>

            <li> For the price, the brush is quite good.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good priced quality shaving brush I came across this Escali Badger.</li>
            <li> Good brush for a good price.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good buy at the time, and was.</li>

            <li> Let me say this: it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with all of these items.  </li>
            <li> seems to be a good alternative to a separate stand (which i dont have room for on my sink)</li>

            <li> Holds a good amount of water and helps make a good lather.</li>

            <li> Good quality, good pricing.  </li>

            <li> but after looking at all the good reviews i went ahead and bought it</li>
            <li> The lather it makes is great and it feels so nice.  </li>

            <li> Good buy.</li>

            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Good job.</li>
            <li> Used in circles it is a bit prickly (a good thing as it makes your hairs stand on end)</li>
            <li> Good for a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
            <li> Everything has their snobs, and this is a good one for none of those ppl.</li>

            <li> Nothing beats an old-fashioned shave with a safety razor and good quality shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I found it good for what I paid for it YMMV.....</li>
            <li> I had heard that badger brushes are good</li>

            <li> I was hoping with all of the good reviews, this would have been a good purchase....</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars rather than one because it does whip up a good lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is of good quality, though I wish the brush was longer.</li>
            <li> The brushes texture feels good against my skin and seems to work the cream in well.</li>
            <li> This brush is about economy and on that front, I think it succeeds fabulously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin felt afterwards and had to switch over to this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing like a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I really liked the brush.</li>
            <li> Try your own razor, this brush, and your own shaving cream to see your own results.</li>
            <li> , I like the smell, the size is ok, good quality</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a silvertip brush</li>
            <li> A nice brush, holds soap well, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten many a good lather out of it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t like it and should have given it one star.</li>
            <li> Nice feel of the wood handle.</li>
            <li> He loves this brush and has made the transition quite nicely (hasn&#x27;t even nicked his face yet).  </li>
            <li> Nice brush.  </li>
            <li> Honestly i can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this thing and spreading shaving cream across my face with my hand.</li>
            <li> Nice price too.</li>
            <li> There are certainly better brushes out there for an increased cost, but a badger hair brush for $13 is too good of a deal.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the shave I got</li>
            <li> This brush gives me a nice even lather all over my face and the bristles don&#x27;t get ruined by water.</li>

            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> It works well and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> Now my brush smells like my nice almond shave soap, but it took some time.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Perfect size, and handles very well.</li>
            <li> It smells like they caged a badger in its own feces for a year, clubbed it over the head, took a patch of its hair, then put that hair in the brush.</li>

            <li> The warm water rushed across the brush as it dampened.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Running the brush through warm soapy water did not help.</li>

            <li> Though he loved it at first, he mentioned after using it a couple of times that the bristles were falling out and the quality wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, you think I&#x27;m joking, but this brush has all sorts of great applications as now I don&#x27;t have to carry 60 pounds of trembling weight to the bathroom when it&#x27;s time to get clean.</li>

            <li> Upon hearing about and ordering an awesome shaving cream (Duke Cannon Superior Grade Shaving Cream), I figured the next step would be a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten 6 months of good service from this brush, and I can&#x27;t see how much more I could get out of one costing $100 or more.</li>

            <li> If you are trying to look for a high quality badger brush with challenging price, these are the best you can get!!</li>
            <li> The cost was very reasonable and it does a great job of whipping up a nice shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very pleasant surprise to find such good quality.</li>
            <li> I started with a Boar&#x27;s Hair brush and it was nice, but most (if not all) of my research suggested Badger.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful brush with natural badger bristles.</li>
            <li> While boar hair isn&#x27;t quite the quality of a good silvertip badger brush, it blows the Escali out of the water in performance and is surprisingly cheap.</li>
            <li> Great value given its economical price.</li>
            <li> This brush was the best value by far.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles, great lather!  </li>
            <li> This brush seems suitable to get anyone started.  </li>
            <li> He was able to make his own stand</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality, old school Shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job building lather and is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> That was by far the best than any others including escali.  </li>
            <li> [I&#x27;ve a brush made of nylon kind of material (some kind of synthetic material) which is much more better.]</li>
            <li> I got it cause its cheap just to see if it would be good.</li>
            <li> Look ate the $18 Parket Safety Razor, it works and will be just ok and good as a starter rezor, not take Merkur at $50 range, you can see the better quality metals and the better craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This Escali Badger brush and some wonderful Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shaving cream did the trick.</li>
            <li> Best part of an old fashion shave</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush, it&#x27;s definitely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> So far works perfectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to nicely foam up my face and shaving</li>
            <li> But the brush remains my favorite of three brands that I own.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill with really good reviews.</li>
            <li> The good things about this brush are its price, it feels comfortable in the hand, and it holds and whips up lather</li>

            <li> It is well made, has a good weight to it and the bristles are just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Before that make sure that the badger brush is soaked in warm water for a minute or two to moisten its bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush spreads it way more effectively than just my hand</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is comfortable and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> So far (couple weeks) has performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Its a good cheap brush.  </li>
            <li> So far it appears to be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be a good idea to start with a cheap, entry-level badger brush for shaving.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I kind of like the Escali one better..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, has a comfortable handle, the bristles are somewhat scratchy.</li>
            <li> The brush effectively works lather into your skin, preparing you for an outstanding gourmet shave.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is by far the best brush in it&#x27;s category.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple bristles on my face, but it&#x27;s been an excellent brush so far.  </li>
            <li> Kind of glad</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I have used so far.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working great RARELY losing them.</li>
            <li> I knew he had his father&#x27;s razor but did not have a suitable brush.  </li>
            <li> Discipline\\&quot; sounds a bit punitive for a light-hearted popular website, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 101 year old Pop in Law and we are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Brush is excellent at building lather and so far hasn&#x27;t lost any of its bristles.</li>
            <li> and so far I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> It was a good brush for a cheap price, but it sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my badger brush, soft and lathers my face well.</li>
            <li> So far he has been very happy with it.</li>

            <li> Love it applies shaving soap well and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this brush a lot yet, so far I&#x27;m very happy with it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using a good brush with shaving soap rather than cream.  </li>
            <li> Looks like excellent quality so far.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing it job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this using this brush, and the wood adds a nice touch to my counter.</li>
            <li> my opinion, start with something extremely cheap, like the Van Der Hagen, and if you decide that Wet/DE/SE shaving is for you, get something good.</li>
            <li> A great purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect so far.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the old ways are best.</li>
            <li> It has served me well so far and does an excellent job of applying the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> nice brush, better than the synthetic one I was using before.</li>
            <li> I will say that I love this kind of shaving.</li>
            <li> B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]] for a superb shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this brush works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is extremely soft and feels wonderful on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but the musty smell noted by others is accurate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard good things about them but wasn&#x27;t about to buy one for cheap Gillette shave cream.</li>
            <li> Good size, fit and finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is quite as soft as the one I tried in The Art of Shaving store, but at 20% of the cost it is an excellent value.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> Good price, good product, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent, lathers well, real soft badger hair, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush, and much more satisfied with Perella&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great brush, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> she was very nice and willing to replace the brush, which they did!</li>
            <li> Just received and used this weekend this new Escali Shaving Brush, and I fell in love with its smoothness, and excellent lathering ability.</li>
            <li> I loved it you guys and thanks bunches!!!</li>
            <li> After looking at my wifes brush, while it is very nice, I dont think I see  a $60 difference and with some good shaving soap I am really shaving better than ever.</li>
            <li> LOL,   It lathers fine, it drys fine by shaking it off vigorously, and seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It holds soap better than my starter brush, has a good weight to it, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Great product that makes applying shaving cream easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Lathers nice, applies nice, and rinses out easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works a up a good lather, quickly and cleans out nicely.</li>
            <li> love this product, and shipping was quick and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush is a great value, but I will eventually upgrade to a something more substantial after I become more familiar with DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Creates a good lather and rinses clean very easily.</li>
            <li> This brush was surprisingly well made, very soft and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s inexpensive, but it can work up a great lather right on my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are great, just about the right &#x27;softness.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know if it is right for your, then this is a great brush for you.  </li>
            <li> Bought this right before Christmas, it&#x27;s still in great condition and used all the time.  </li>
            <li> All I could do was LOL and kick myself as it all was right here in the feedback.</li>
            <li> but when I do it will be badger and the knot will not come out so easily!</li>
            <li> I received my order of the shaving brush very quickly and was very pleased with the item</li>
            <li> But it shipped very quickly (showed up before the razor!)</li>
            <li> Voila! EASY!</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping and Nice packaging!  </li>
            <li> Love love love it!  </li>
            <li> While I do want absolutely the best for my precious face, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference just yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience for comparisions, but this seems like a very nice brush, and well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> The price is right if you aren&#x27;t into a super awesome shave</li>
            <li> There are two main brands that make very good boar hair brushes that can be purchased in the $10-25 range, and those are Omega and Semogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is even in some circles I have researched a special designation beyond that to a incredible special badger or something.  </li>
            <li> The Escali 100% pure badger bristle shaving brush fulfills it&#x27;s purpose and at the best price available.  </li>
            <li> The brush holds a lot of water and allows me to create a water rich lather that really accentuates this wonderful new shaving experience I&#x27;ve been enjoying!!!  </li>
            <li> I had stopped using shaving soap and a brush some years ago because I could never produce good, rich foam.</li>
            <li> Very good product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the world like a great shave with some Proraso Shave Cream and a Pure Badger bristle brush!</li>
            <li> I prefer to face lather and doing so wasn&#x27;t super pleasant with this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush, makes a good lather and is soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> For 15 dollars this is honestly a great buy if you want to get an idea of what a badger brush feels/lathers like, but if you are buying this solely because you want a cheap brush, then just go get a cheap boar/synthetic brush in one of those drug store shave kits.</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave and best of all it doesn&#x27;t shed like the old one.</li>
            <li> Most good cheap brushes will be bore hair, horse hair, or synthetic.</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed by how soft the brush was, and how it easily whipped my shaving soap into a nice foamy \\&quot;just right\\&quot; lather to my liking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to clean and awesome to use!</li>
            <li> Good Shaving brush as advertised, it was fast delivered after order was placed and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Good built quality, soft, densed bristles and attractively priced .&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> Well made, feels great on face, bought several as gifts, everyone happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> It is nice to know some businesses share my views and can supply quality products for a reasonable cost and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I have used many brushes in my life time but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Using circular motions creates more of an exfoliating feeling from the brush while up/down or back/forth motions feel really soft and produce a wonderful lather with my Proraso Shave Soap.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden handle that fits perfectly in my shaving stand</li>
            <li> It also rinses quite easily, so there isn&#x27;t a great deal of clean up involved.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush works a lather very easily and will save your shave time for actually enjoying your shave.</li>
            <li> It looks very nice with my chrome stand and certainly feels nice to the face.</li>
            <li> I am nicely impressed, and have no regrets springing for this brush!</li>
            <li> Great quality for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great on my face, and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> If you buy be sure to clean the brush real good before first use.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Loved it very nice and soft lather was applied with ease</li>
            <li> First one is still in great shape after 3 years.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described, well made product.</li>
            <li> As a first brush it is a great starter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great at doing the job, I just wish it didn&#x27;t shed the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great that being said this is my first experience with using a shave brush</li>
            <li> This brush is great for a first time shaving soap user.</li>
            <li> After wetshaving for a while, i&#x27;ve moved onto Colonel Conk&#x27;s shave soaps and they are excellent products that I love, but the creams of Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, and Cella are 5x better than Col Conk.</li>
            <li> It feels great and seems be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to get a great lather by using this brush and it feels smooth and comfortable while applying an even coat to my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I experienced a fast and well-packaged delivery!</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but I have to say that I am quite happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> it does not smell great on first use if you don&#x27;t do something to somewhat condition it.</li>
            <li> it feels great when using hot water.</li>
            <li> Some hair came off throughout first use, but has been great since.  </li>
            <li> This brush works great and does exactly what it is designed to.</li>
            <li> well the first time but after 1 or 2 uses, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> The price is great and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Keep up the great work and enthusiasm guys, and thanks!</li>
            <li> My dog freaked out when I first unpackaged it lol.</li>
            <li> Even so, I still thought it was a tad bit sharp for my test, so eventually I will be opting for a good Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent badger shaving brush, really soft and makes lots of smooth nice lather</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush and it works great -  Holds up well and does not shed - been using it for about 6-weeks or so</li>
            <li> For the price it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, and shipping was fast and efficient!</li>
            <li> He is in the Forest  Service and apparently this brand is the best thing going.  </li>
            <li> First impression of the brush was great.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it, but I am happy with how it functions.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is quite superior to most shaving brushes available today.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li> Great first time shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised, great entry level badger brush that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, does not smell much.</li>
            <li> funny thinking about that and makes me want to use it all the time besides what a great job it does.</li>
            <li> I would probably give this brush 5 stars as it is my first and it works great</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for someone unsure if they want to use a shaving brush at all, this is a great first investment.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful brush that lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect with it being pretty inexpensive, but after reading all the great reviews I ordered it.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that dealing with USA Vitamins was great.</li>
            <li> I give it a full rinse, then a good squeezing, shaping it into a christmas lightbulb before putting it on my holder.</li>
            <li> price wise not bad .i</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months since I started using this brush and the hair is still full and helps create a good lather.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect, very well made and really works the lather into the face for &amp;#34;really good shaves&amp;#34; +</li>
            <li> It remains true that you get what you pay for and I should have known that at that price the quality cannot good.</li>
            <li> The brush was quite full and the hair was of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Great for whipping up a perfect lather in seconds and the badger hair does a perfect job of lifting all of those bothersome little facial hairs.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with a nice safety razor; I purchased a Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; 42C, nice blades; I purchased Astra Super Premium Platinum Double and a nice shaving cream, you will get the best shave of your life.  </li>
            <li> a later with shave soap very easily, and feels awesome when applied to the face.&lt;br</li>

            <li> No hairs have come out and it is very comfortable on my face.</li>

            <li> I like it better than the badger</li>
            <li> There are better badger brushes out there</li>
            <li> So much better than boar (on me</li>
            <li> Simple and no-fuss brush that will do the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and the packaging was great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can that many people that purchase  </li>
            <li> Much better than the boar brush</li>
            <li> cheap, but works as well as a quality badger brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just go with a cheap synthetic omega brush and then upgrade to a nice badger brush if you feel the need.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s pleased.</li>
            <li> I hope they stay in business for many, many years to come!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall for the price this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> It will wear out, but the cost is reasonable and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It got slightly better with use, but still scratches more than a quality brush should.</li>
            <li> Just save yourself some headache and buy a better brush; I did.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Have used it for 4 weeks and like it better every day.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where can I learn more?</li>
            <li> I opted out for the badger since it holds and retains water better.  </li>
            <li> The brush is ok for the price.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> glad to report it</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Really exfoliates the skin and feels great every morning.</li>
            <li> use Col Conk&#x27;s which requires a bit more vigorous whipping</li>
            <li> Lathers up my shaving soap better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t imagine a better deal.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t keep losing it, but I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lose to many bristles - been using it for almost a month</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok for the money.  </li>
            <li> If you are purchasing this brush most people recommend a stand that allows for it to be stored inverted.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but this is a great brush and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This brush from Escali is holding up much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it deserves 5 stars for sure.  </li>
            <li> but this is more an observation than an annoyance and</li>
            <li> Well worth the money build good.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with the Escali badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is not the best in the world but is better than several boar brushes that cost more.  </li>
            <li> What i DO know is i like it better than spraying something on my hand and wiping my face with it.  </li>
            <li> to go get a kiss now.... :-)</li>
            <li> This brush sheds more hair than a husky in summer.</li>
            <li> also love the feeling of brushing the cream on my face with the Escali.</li>
            <li> I love the way it swirls around my whiskers and exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably get more of them.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied, but not amazed by this brush.</li>
            <li> i was able to get a fluffier lather with this brush then the boar.  </li>
            <li> Price makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin and really helps lather up my face.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> They are making me type more words.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Much better then no brush for sure.  </li>
            <li> Been using shave brushes for years and this one is top of the line.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase especially considering that a comparable badger brush cost 40 to 50 dollars.</li>
            <li> I tried the boar bristle and it was OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money and certainly good for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> Quite more affordable than the more quality, softer badger brushes</li>
            <li> a stylish brush from the art of shaving company.</li>
            <li> in this case it was more.</li>
            <li> I love that stuff, but I&#x27;ve found that applying soap/cream with a brush makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> Within seconds, a nice foamy lather ensued and I was able to shave more comfortably, and closely than I have ever shaved...</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this one more than those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pay more for a better brush than this one.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> i love this brush.</li>
            <li> Again neither of these issues are a huge deal and in all honestly are probably just part of the brush.</li>
            <li> Perhaps as I use it, it might get better.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, your best bet will be to look around for a low end Simpson brush.</li>
            <li> Just like many who purchased this one, I was just getting into the Wet-shave thing.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d be OK with losing.    </li>
            <li> and I am quite pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I bought a synthetic shaving brush after this one, and that fared much better.</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic hanging display box keeping the brush safe during shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it myself</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the Cade but has much more capacity I would go with that way before this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes, but I can&#x27;t complain because of the price</li>
            <li> sure to hang it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> maybe after some more use, it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best badger</li>
            <li> Well, I love it.</li>
            <li> It holds water much better than the boar hair brush did.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get a brush holder so that it hang drys with the bristles facing downward.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaving brush!</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft which I was looking for and works great for lathering shaving cream on</li>
            <li> I have returned mine and have picked up a cheaper and better one from Target.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> probably 4-5 more months.  </li>
            <li> Get some Sandalwood shaving cream too, ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this brush based on the top reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It reached the point that I would pull twenty or more bristles off this brush before each shave</li>
            <li> and I still had so many come out in the lather on my face</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the brush at its bargain price.</li>
            <li> Review by Charles, Elizabeth doesn&#x27;t shave with a brush.  :)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect for me, but i can see how this may be an issue for someone with really big hands.  </li>
            <li> I even look forward to shaving as it is know more of a ritual indulgence than a chore.</li>
            <li> I feel that I am washing away a lot of the lather that is still in the brush that would have worked better on my face.</li>
            <li> and it gets softer the more</li>
            <li> i nded up with more hair off the rush than the hair on my face</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> This method is so much better</li>
            <li> I love it and will get another if I ever need another one</li>
            <li> You could spend more but why?  </li>
            <li> It has lost more than I was anticipating it would lose, and more than what others have said they lost.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I find this to be an OK shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is I love the brush.</li>
            <li> Stay smooth!</li>
            <li> It looks ok and works ok</li>
            <li> I am really happy I decided to go with this product as it makes lathering up my shaving soap much easier.</li>
            <li> This brush requires much more shaving cream than a brush I have.</li>
            <li> This time I stepped up to a premier brush and the results are stunning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;am Returning it and getting a Baxter of California Best Badger Brush, its made in Germany and will likely be a better product for me.</li>
            <li> but Im sure</li>
            <li> They loved it so much they bought their own brush and TOBS shave cream :))</li>
            <li> He is just starting with shaving with a safety razor and this is perfect for him.</li>
            <li> It creates a nice think lather and spreads it smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> I love my shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Is it better than a $60 Parker?  </li>
            <li> but it is worlds better than a boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> The badger shaving brush is an elegant implement.  </li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works ok for bowl lathering but not for face lathering.</li>
            <li> The Semogue is a better brush than the Omega)</li>
            <li> and it is better than most $70 dollar</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rinse it thoroughly after every shave and give it some air to breathe when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase and the fulfillment service.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with its quality and performance from day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t used it too many times as he was finishing up some shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It would have gotten 5 stars if my husband had used it more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> It lost more hair than my Parkers.</li>
            <li> It shed a couple of bristles but not as many as the boar hair one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I came across this brush.  </li>
            <li> I guess I appreciate that the fibers are authentic and that they didn&#x27;t use a bunch of chemicals or fragrance to cover the sent.</li>
            <li> until I was sure that it was something I would use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles on a smooth finished handle perfectly suited to shaving soap bowls.</li>
            <li> Its leaps and bounds better than the synthetic brush I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> So the shaving brush works as promised and by most accounts</li>
            <li> Love this Badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a better quality than most of the cheaper, store bought brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> You can pay more for fancier handles, but they won&#x27;t work any better for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> My brother and father have purchased $100+ brushes and they are better,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush and am planning on purchasing it along with some more shaving supplies to give as a gift to my dad.</li>
            <li> excellent brush especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Top quality</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a basis for comparison, but the brush seems well made and does a great job of working up a lather.  </li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this one for my husband.  </li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure some of that can be attributed to the brush doing its thing.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t matter if its badger, boar, horse, synthetic, anything you buy at this price point, from those manufacturers, will be leaps and bounds better than this Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This thing also looses a LOT of hairs, typically 5 or more every shave.  </li>
            <li> , I like that much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest paying for a better one,  the hairs continue to fall out 4th use.</li>
            <li> It holds the shaving soap better and creates a better lather.</li>
            <li> When you rinse it out, and examine it, you can see the Hair sticking up from the top, which have come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (many colors to choose from) or #10066(faux ivory)  Medium size boar brush, 24mm knot.</li>
            <li> Omega S-Brush S10065 (many colors to choose from)  </li>
            <li> There are better badger brushes out there, but you will have to spend a lot more to acquire them.  </li>
            <li> I find I have to use a comb on the brush after use to make sure it does not get too tangled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather put the money towards a better quality razor.  </li>
            <li> He says it is a great quality brush and works very well.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on reviews and glad I did.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived promptly and packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any others, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I love this one.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better one in my life</li>
            <li> I can also feel the brush extending my whiskers for a better cut thus a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Along with the Arlington shaving bowl and soap, this made a lovely gift for my son.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are rougher on my face than most boar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it does a much better job of foaming the face than I used to get by putting on the shaving cream by hand.</li>
            <li> Very durable and great quality.</li>
            <li> All in all I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight and finish so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> it works ok but the bristles are not the softest .</li>
            <li> For the price I doubt a better brush could be found.</li>
            <li> Clearly better than the boar hair brushes you see in drug stores</li>
            <li> I hope that it softens up after more uses.</li>
            <li> Stray hairs all over the soap and my face, and the bristles irritated my skin more than a blade ever has.</li>
            <li> If not, I would safely say one star.</li>
            <li> even the art of shaving brush that comes with the $20 kit is better than the Escali.</li>
            <li> I find it better than the synthetic ones.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I paid much more for this shaving bursh.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than the shaving brush I got from a shaving kit at CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving brush for about a month now, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This is a great compliment to a straight edge shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this</li>
            <li> I will however, be moving on to a better brush eventually.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first, as it seemed to be losing more hairs every shave for the first week, but has performed excellently after that.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> THE OVER ALL DESIGN IS OK.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Join the club and buy this brush and use the savings to get some more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it may even beat that.</li>
            <li> Many months in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it functions OK.</li>
            <li> its identical cousin, the Tweezerman) is the brush I use most often sometimes every day.</li>
            <li> This is OK.</li>
            <li> I love this Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> I am getting so many email to rate this</li>
            <li> Makes so much more soap lather then the one that came with the kit I bought.</li>
            <li> I had to lather my shave soap and leave the suds in the brush before it got better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me pass on a truly great tradition and</li>
            <li> but it does lose more hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not seen any more bristles fall out since then</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Each time, it has deposited many bristles upon my face, which I don&#x27;t notice until I&#x27;m picking them out of my razor.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush was not up to par with the top ratings it has received.</li>
            <li> Worked 100% better then</li>
            <li> A perfect addition to any double edged shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy a couple more if I thought I could wear it out in five years or so.</li>
            <li> If, like me, you haven&#x27;t enjoyed 100% badger against your skin, then this product will enhance your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this along with the safety razor that I purchased with it, I have noticed a change for the better in the way that my skin feels after I shave.</li>
            <li> Pick this thing up you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and at a good price too.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> It is made from top quality materials and has helped make shaving a pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge into traditional wetshaving, and read that badger hair shaving brushes are the best for generating and applying shaving lather.  </li>
            <li> better than the one i got from whatever that overpriced shaving chain in the mall is, which was like 3 times the price</li>
            <li> but as I use it more it seems to have subsided.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush and this seller, both are top rated.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> creates a great lather and is very durable.</li>
            <li> Am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would have paid much more.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased</li>
            <li> Love my item.</li>
            <li> Much better than the plastic one that I have.  </li>
            <li> My spouse uses this daily and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I will just not use them any more.</li>
            <li> I like this one better</li>
            <li> Of course you can get a better quality brush by spending more money.</li>
            <li> but if you have the money I&#x27;d find a better brush.</li>
            <li> It lathers the soap better and we both think he&#x27;s getting a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this one, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This one seems to be holding together much better.  </li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Note : since I bought  two more ..I just put these two on reserve..</li>
            <li> If you have a shaving bowl, that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Recommend spending additional money in getting a better brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using for many more shaves, I now find that I prefer this to the cheaper brush... but still looking.</li>
            <li> Really feels great on the face as it spreads the cream/lather around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market and that experts could point you to them.</li>
            <li> It holds the soap wonderfully, and it hasn&#x27;t dropped but one, or two bristles in several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a terrible quality brush, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for two weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li> like it much better than using a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t go to the better safety razor, Geo F. Trumper shaving cream and this Escali shaving brush sooner.</li>
            <li> So much better than some cream out of a can and lathered on top of the whiskers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away the more you use the brush.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the brush on my skin.</li>
            <li> When you start using, you&#x27;ll notice that many hairs will come out, but will this will stop after you break it in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will enjoy this product for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the Escali if you want to try out shaving with a brush &amp; soap, but aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
            <li> this brush is perfect and should last for many years.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone went to pay more?</li>
            <li> Its real badger hair and its feels great.</li>
            <li> Compared to my &amp;#34; The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush the Badger hair is not as dense and the hair is shaped in a way in which most of the hairs on the periphery do not touch your skin.</li>
            <li> love Proraso soap and the Van der Hagen brush</li>
            <li> badger brush, which was more than 2x the price.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more for a brush that doesn&#x27;t keep losing hairs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for a better shaving brush for the money.  </li>
            <li> A great value and retains moisture very well.</li>
            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> I went synth and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s served well as my learner brush before I upgrade to something a bit nicer, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Could&#x27;t ask for a better brush.</li>
            <li> Works better than described.</li>
            <li> Never used one until now, and it spreads the shaving soap smooth and even!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend spending your money on a better quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The product could be improved by adding more bristle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month or so now, and it has gotten alot better.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than my boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself just using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent Brush, simple as that</li>
            <li> Lathers up a lot better than without one.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will lessen with more use.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and it has helped with the whole adjusting to using one of these blades.</li>
            <li> I have used shaving cakes, creams, and regular face soap and the brush has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> and I like it much better than my boar brush</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll go away with time.</li>
            <li> the brush is okay.</li>
            <li> its okay for a beginner</li>
            <li> Buyers remorse for sure on this item.</li>
            <li> This brush feels great, lathers well, and has almost no &amp;#34;shedding.&amp;#34; I really like the wood handle as well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;style!</li>
            <li> Be sure to order a shaving brush and razor stand.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the product and would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the comfort of an old-fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> It feels great very morning when I am lathering up.</li>
            <li> so I would have to use it more than twice or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine a better price/quality balance.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> There are better quality brushes out there, but you pay for them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to have more soap transferred from the brush to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most affordable one I&#x27;ve seen, and for all I knew this was just how badger fur brushes were.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great all around if you take care of it :)</li>
            <li> Glad I stayed the course.</li>
            <li> I started using shaving brushes with this brush, and it was a okay quality and inexpensive way to get into using a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> After about 4 shaves I didn&#x27;t notice any more coming off.</li>
            <li> Brush feels soft and great with a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this item.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m not noticing any more strays in the bowl or sink.</li>
            <li> Well, perhaps it costs its price, but I would invest a bit more to get something else.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this one works better.</li>
            <li> but eventually you&#x27;ll want to get a better brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are tremendously soft and hold a lather incredibly well.</li>
            <li> The badger hairs make for an elegant way to butter up one&#x27;s face before shaving.</li>
            <li> Im enjoying this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
            <li> No wonder it&#x27;s the top selling badger brush on Amazon.</li>
            <li> More and more bristles come out of the brush after each shave.</li>
            <li> Every time I apply cream using this brush, it makes feel more manly.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I will keep on using this till I find a better brush when I feel I have graduated to it.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of junk don&#x27;t buy it unless you like many bristles coming out each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I bought a boar bristle brush and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Lovely brush for shaving.</li>
            <li> It does hold more water than the bore bristles.</li>
            <li> It works very well, holds water and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Art of Shaving brush and while it feels better, the price does not match the need.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> My shaves seem closer, but I know that the shave is mostly the result of my razor and shave soap.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I opt for it after considering many others that are in the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this badger hair shaving brush and have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The gift is enjoyed every morning</li>
            <li> As with many things, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> However, I would rate this brush as top tier for the price point.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I felt that i would try the Escali brush out because so many people recommend it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be getting slightly better over time</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> This brush does not exceed expectations, but for the price it&#x27;s being offered at, does more than it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Soft and effective, I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to update this later for a long-term review but initially I am very happy with the quality and how this brush works.</li>
            <li> I did some research about proper brush care, bought this guy, and I&#x27;ve been a happy customer since!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the entire set.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d pay a lot more for one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great brush, so much easier than using hands to put on shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great brush at a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving brush to use when I travel and am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Father&#x27;s day preasant for my husband, he had been shaving with boar bristle brushes since we started dating, and I noticed his shave could be better.</li>
            <li> and I received it in the appropriate time frame.</li>
            <li> He was quite pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> its namesake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue to use it hoping that I would be able to break it in.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my order and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> You want an outstanding brush for the cost of a 12-pack?  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, and there are certainly better ones out there.</li>
            <li> I had not used one in many years.  </li>
            <li> However, I am very happy with this brush; it has lost one or two bristles but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, really works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> I lose more bristles each time I use it than I&#x27;d care to admit.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very well-made shaving brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> Its slightly smaller size makes it perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable and nice.</li>
            <li> My guys love them.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever been able to get.</li>
            <li> Planning on buying 2 more to gift to my dad and my f-in-law.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a more substantial brush.</li>
            <li> However, almost a year later, this brush is doing it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This brush is great getting my beard ready for the razor.  </li>
            <li> I am a man of simple tastes- easily satisfied by the best!</li>
            <li> so she could use it with her favorite brush-on shave creams.</li>
            <li> Many people these days expect the best possible product on the market for a minimum amount of money.</li>
            <li> This leads to many things, and one is the loss of value.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the best possible brush, you&#x27;re realistically looking at a couple hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what brush to get but for the price</li>
            <li> but I am sure at some point it</li>
            <li> then I am able to load the brush with plenty of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> All and all I am quite satisfied and would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised; have enjoyed using this brush.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> I have been completely satisfied with the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush, for $13 is a phenomenal value.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, didn&#x27;t lose many bristles at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, but you can get better quality brushes for cheaper at maggardrazors.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one from Escali.</li>
            <li> More like 3/12 Stars.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d be more concerned if it DIDN&#x27;T have a bit of an odor.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be made well,  Hangs perfectly in the wooden holder I bought to hang it in.</li>
            <li> That being said, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> In summary, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush also helps to prepare your skin for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that will diminish over time.</li>
            <li> My Husband truly enjoyed this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Great quality fast shipping from vendor</li>
            <li> Still using, but only until my Edwin Jagger Best badger brush arrives.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying it for about 2 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problem with it getting ratty looking or too many bristles coming out.  </li>
            <li> A middle grade brush at best.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li> I love the brush but it took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I also cannot use it in the swirling motion (which exfoliates better) on my face because of said irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile now, and it looks great and seems very well crafted.</li>
            <li> They are just all around better in every way, softer, quicker lather, feels better on the face.</li>
            <li> Makes any shave prep a better prep.</li>
            <li> Escali recommends that after using your rinse the brush with water, making sure to remove all of the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> its ok  (Jeff Abel)</li>
            <li> I love using this brush to shave.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving Brush</li>
            <li> and they fit in it nicely.</li>
            <li> Is it as comparable with most of the top name brushes out there?</li>
            <li> Either of those brushes I feel would be a step up from this one, for not that much more money.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the brush</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> , the more you use it the better it gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> and so this one provides a more vigorous application of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It also helps whip up the lather better.</li>
            <li> Not any more...</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and whips up a nice frothy lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that because I always viewed this as my entry-brush</li>
            <li> If you expect to get more use out of it than that you&#x27;re kidding yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and I love how the brush dries when hung properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I am losing hairs way more than I should.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted to get away from spending much more on the throw-away razors and blades and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this shaving brush--great quality!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the foam I could generate</li>
            <li> Shaves are better and closer.</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> works OK, some of the hairs come out onto your face when you are spreading the shaving cream on your face.</li>
            <li> Gets better as it wears</li>
            <li> I had researched it prior and found this to be the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and</li>
            <li> Excellent brush..very smooth and soft feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but also hasn&#x27;t changed my life.</li>
            <li> He has been looking for a legacy shaving kit for quite a while but has not been able to find one.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace another one for which I paid a lot more and used for years until it started shedding hairs.  </li>
            <li> This one works and feels better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush and is very well made.</li>
            <li> Is comfortable in your hand and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I still love this brush.</li>
            <li> The lather is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed having the brush and it works OK.</li>
            <li> But I guess for what you pay, it is an OK value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s badger hair (the top of the line in shaving brush material.</li>
            <li> Excellent basic shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Love useing it when I shave.</li>
            <li> The Shaving brush is really comfortable and feels nice when you work up the lather.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of a brush and the ability to re-wet my face with it.</li>
            <li> Prefer it so much more than those synthetic bristles brushes.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Be sure to grab the base&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> There were 40+ bristles in the sink and just as many hanging out of the brush.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen many bristles falling out at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than you will spend on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years using an electric or whatever the latest craze was.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Do not trust reviews from people who don&#x27;t know better.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need to spend more money to get a quality product.</li>
            <li> after use I have to use a comb to untangle the bristles and make sure all soap is removed, I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better?</li>
            <li> and i really love this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and can recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and this is much better than applying it with my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Save the money and invest in something better.</li>
            <li> Going on more than a month a haven&#x27;t lost any of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Use it often, love the product.</li>
            <li> love this thing.</li>
            <li> again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better re-introduction to an artful form of shaving.</li>
            <li> I think this may be the case with most shaving brushes though.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> There are definitely better quality brushes out there</li>
            <li> I love using this brush.  </li>
            <li> In many cheaper brushes the bristles have a tendency to fall out.  </li>
            <li> I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it with the shaving cream stuff they sell at trader joes and it works a lot better than just rubbing it on with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it for the six weeks I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of usage, the smell has dissipated and I mostly smell the scent of the shaving soap I use.  </li>
            <li> but the product is well built, much better than those gillete plastic brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with that shaving cream, truly</li>
            <li> but this brush with that cream is simply magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this one and hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Above all, I&#x27;m impressed with its softness and ability to generate a lather.</li>
            <li> I decided on the Escali because of the many reviews.  </li>
            <li> okay brush for the money....</li>
            <li> better ones def out there though.  </li>
            <li> Mostly I just smell shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a shaving brush made from Badger hair after reading some blogs that said it was much better than just using shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using it with Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.), and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Lemme tell ya, I love this shave brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone I know who shaves more than once a month.</li>
            <li> For $15 dollars I&#x27;d expect more.</li>
            <li> Great I&#x27;ll order another one real soon</li>
            <li> I guess the brush will get better as you continuously use it.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by a small company willing to go out of their way to provide excellent customer service and a quality product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Only the best.</li>
            <li> You can always pay more, but if you&#x27;re just putting your toe in the water for this type of a shave, no need to drop a king&#x27;s ransom.  </li>
            <li> Phenomenal product at a phenomenal price.</li>
            <li> Shaving brush is ok.</li>
            <li> Enjoying a close shave with the help of this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is just ok.</li>
            <li> that was for my husband and he love it..</li>
            <li> It is OK, but I find I now need to purchase a holder to keep it in.  </li>
            <li> handle feels ok in hand</li>
            <li> You can spend $145.00 on a badger brush, sure, but why would you?</li>
            <li> and I expect to get many years of service from it.</li>
            <li> It looks good to, so in short its a great purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very inexpensive brush that is great to use or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> My life hasn&#x27;t changed, but I do use this brush more often than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad that I did.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> so I opted to start with this instead of the $30 brushes (or more).</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> and I like this escali better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect upon ordering this brush.</li>
            <li> , however, I must agree with most of the reviews in saying that this brush works wonders for its price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve passed them by regardless of price because I wanted to get  one brush and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love using the brush.  </li>
            <li> Sheds a bit more than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Generally satisfied with quality of shave.</li>
            <li> Doubt I could have done better.</li>
            <li> Received it fast and what a great brush.</li>
            <li> Coupled with dreadnought shaving cream, my skin has never looked or felt  better.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> i freaking love this brush.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?  </li>
            <li> I have to say while I do like it and will continue to use it, its far from ideal.</li>
            <li> The brush is stunning, to begin with.</li>
            <li> so I felt it was safe to order it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shed much, works great.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Is it top quality badger and manufacturing?</li>
            <li> If this is a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; process, and it gets better, than this will be reviewed once more.</li>
            <li> It is an ok shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush daily for a couple of weeks, and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I thought this would be a starter brush for me until I saved up for something more fancy.</li>
            <li> Not only did it end up being a great brush, it also ended up being a wise investment.</li>
            <li> This Badger Shaving Brush is replacing a Boar Bristle one and it is much better.</li>
            <li> This lasts a month or so and then you don&#x27;t lose as many.  </li>
            <li> Make your shaving an enjoyable experience and get yourself one of these</li>
            <li> So to sum up, the quality is ok.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not convinced badger hair is any better than synthetic.</li>
            <li> looks ok on the stand..</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I have been more than satisfied with this brush.  </li>
            <li> but if I have to remove from my face more hair from the brush than the hair from my face</li>
            <li> Better to find a better brand.</li>
            <li> This one seemed like a safe bet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an excellent product not just for its price but as overall value.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these brushes for well over a year and really love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes and this one seems like the best one yet.</li>
            <li> but it seems better put together than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK brush</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading many reviews, and I had hoped that my experience would be like the majority.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are finer than horse or boar hair so are more densely packed into the handle</li>
            <li> Its just OK.</li>
            <li> Totally enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to determine which is better for me (badger vs. boar).</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy lathering my face with shaving cream now!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see the need to pay more.</li>
            <li> This brush shed more than my dog when her coat changes for the winter months, returned.</li>
            <li> and I Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have tried several others and found this brush to be excellent.</li>
            <li> ok improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or I should say seems to look and work better.</li>
            <li> I searched many vendors at Amazon to find a shaving brush as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and nice, can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash it with soapy water before you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review more once I&#x27;ve bought another and have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I think one has to spend more money to get a better quality brush.</li>
            <li> He says it is so much better than the brush has had before, which kept having the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and really holds water well.  </li>
            <li> It is regarded as the softest but some prefer that their brushes have a bit more \\&quot;backbone\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I had a horsehair brush before but had heard that badger is better.  </li>
            <li> This is a top notch brush that is soft and ideally shaped.</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave using this brush and shaving soap than I do just using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The brush effectively applies lather to the face and feels fantastic in the process.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> JUST LOVE THIS BRUSH AND WOULD TELL ANYONE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY SHAVING BRUSH</li>
            <li> I still will lose one here and there, but for the most part the shedding has stopped.</li>
            <li> He now shaves his face every day :)</li>
            <li> This was a part of a birthday gift basket for my husband and the \\&quot;I Love It\\&quot; is from him.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; ok.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t include a stand which means you can get a better brush and a stand for the price of this brush and a addition stand.</li>
            <li> There probably are better brushes out there</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a stand with this product and don&#x27;t leave it lying around.</li>
            <li> I have also found that this brush works much better with a shaving mug as opposed to a face lathering.</li>
            <li> As a barber I would definatly order more products from this business.</li>
            <li> better</li>
            <li> Also, does not contain a stand, but many shave</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have many brushes to compare it to</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ll have to shell out 5 to 10 times, or more, for one of those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it every day.</li>
            <li> Highly enjoyable product.</li>
            <li> I look forward to many more</li>
            <li> It does seem to exfoliate quite well and conserves cream better than say spraying barbasol on your face alone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Top shelf brush thank you</li>
            <li> Save badgers and shave better.</li>
            <li> so I hope it stays that way... :-)  </li>
            <li> Be sure to let it sit in warm/hot water for a couple minutes to let it absorb water into the bristles.</li>
            <li> #34;utilitarian&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this rating after a year or so, when I know more about durability.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to choose Escali.</li>
            <li> The appearance is elegant.</li>
            <li> Several hairs fall out every time I use it, even after 10+ shaves (although the frequency at which this occurs is declining over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: inexpensive and gets the job done, but I am not overly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> It looks so sexy.</li>
            <li> This was way more cost effective and works great as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> brush any time soon since this brush more than meets my needs and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush was shipped fast and I am totally happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> 3 stars might be one too many, but I was feeling generous.</li>
            <li> Am VERY happy to report, such was not the case.  </li>
            <li> but I would spend more money on a better brush.</li>
            <li> if not then one more soap up should do it.</li>
            <li> and I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> better than than the squirrel brush I used to have</li>
            <li> But this brush does as advertised and is quite handsome.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you could beat this authentic badger</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks of use: It is already my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted a badger brush instead of a boar brush and a badger brush is definitely better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a better product paying more.</li>
            <li> I was able to find a brush priced more competitive on Amazon than tweezerman and escali.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my husband, &amp; he is quite pleased with the Badger bristles.</li>
            <li> Boar bristle is a bit stiffer and makes thicker lather, but badger feels better and gives better control of the application of the lather.  </li>
            <li> I love my brush, it makes all the world&#x27;s difference when shaving.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than a month now without any issues.</li>
            <li> &quot; This product is equivalent or (in handle design and quality) arguably better, for about a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Whether using store-bought aerosol lathers or shaving soaps/cremes, it does a nice job of ensuring better whisker coating, making my shaves more comfortable and closer.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy</li>
            <li> Make sure you get a stand like the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand.  </li>
            <li> The brush seems to be more rigid that others I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> more then my boars hair.</li>
            <li> Tried to get them out in the beginning but more continue to fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure at some point</li>
            <li> + years more.</li>
            <li> My best recommendation, spend the extra money on a  silver tip badger brush.  </li>
            <li> For a softer texture, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be adding cans to the landfill and can produce and even better lather with a brush and shaving cake.</li>
            <li> The $4 boar brush from Walmart is better.</li>
            <li> It is getting better,</li>
            <li> the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I personally love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if boar hair brush would be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for so many others, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s their favorite thing to play with.  </li>
            <li> Like most things in life you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t know how a person couldn&#x27;t notice it considering the smell of decaying flesh is fairly overwhelming with this brush.</li>
            <li> This one has a better feel, and the bristles have held together well.  </li>
            <li> It will need replaced soon, but I imagine after a year, most brushes would.</li>
            <li> I would recommend investing slightly more for a better experience.</li>
            <li> It is made very well and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> but it works better than the boar brush I started with.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush, it picks up and retains the soap really well.</li>
            <li> What more could you be looking for?</li>
            <li> YES, SHALL IT CARESS MY FACE FOR MANY AS SHAVE</li>
            <li> SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;TO FEEL THIS EUPHORIC MAGIC</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush that allows you to lather the cream really well.  </li>
            <li> All in all this is a great brush to get started with, and is capable of handling everything that is out there, in terms of shaving creams, soaps, and cream-soaps.</li>
            <li> A reasonable brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this.</li>
            <li> I love using this badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Great Brush....lathers up soap very well</li>
            <li> What more do you need.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price and everyone would enjoy it, unless you need a shaving brush made of silken unicorn hair or something.</li>
            <li> Does what it should :-)</li>
            <li> this situation appears to have gotten better with time...</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand and makes application smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> sometimes wish the bristles were softer, but knowing that I&#x27;d have to pay upwards of 2-3X more for that level of cuddly badgery softness</li>
            <li> Much better bang for your buck (Still around $10-15).</li>
            <li> I wish I had done better research before purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> I was glad that the handle fits &amp;#34;perfectly&amp;#34; into the shave stand I bought.  </li>
            <li> ok brush but not the highest quality, sheds and doesnt hold</li>
            <li> There are many quality, affordable products out there.</li>
            <li> Seems like more bristles than I would expect fall out every time I use it and stick to my face, maybe that will stop after a while.  </li>
            <li> It is an OK product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for more than a year</li>
            <li> i love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face and really makes the shaving process more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased</li>
            <li> I store my brush in an appropriate stand, making sure to rinse it thoroughly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is ok,  </li>
            <li> My shaving experience has never been better....</li>
            <li> The one thing that I love about the brush is that the longer I have the softer and more effecient it becomes.  </li>
            <li> For the price i am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier in the shower, the lather is great, and the shave soap is better for my skin that whatever is in feminine shaving products</li>
            <li> I bought a better brush for considerably more money.  </li>
            <li> Better than the el-cheapo I had used as a started brush.  </li>
            <li> The smell seems to be dissipating the more I use it.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I have purchased many as gifts</li>
            <li> But the hairs are nice and soft, and work great.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m enjoying the shaves</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for some months now and have greatly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I am truly pleased with the quality and price of this brush.  </li>
            <li> When storing this product, make sure that it is pointing bristles</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many of them that it just doesn&#x27;t matter, but they do get in the sink and on your face.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Again, for the price, for beginners, this is an okay brush.</li>
            <li> okay brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like this brush better.  </li>
            <li> The soap lathers up nice and it is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> This badger brush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It work ok but the hair falls out of the brush</li>
            <li> more specifically Africa by ToTo.</li>
            <li> However, the reason for the 1 star rating is because, after slightly more than 1 month of use, the knot broke and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to spend a bit more money and get something better than this.</li>
            <li> I would try to get better quality .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over 6 months now and don&#x27;t have many complaints.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, and reasonably priced to boot</li>
            <li> overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Has better luck making lather with a 5 dollar Walmart starter kit</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Once you are satisfied maybe you can go for fancier ones.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> This one performs much better.</li>
            <li> The brush seems to retain an appropriate amount of moisture while shaving and dries well between uses.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy I really like this,highly recommend</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> it for so many hours before use&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I love them both.</li>
            <li> and I was glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I will now search for a more quality brush.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tell the difference, don&#x27;t pay more for it.</li>
            <li> and I got to say that the Escali badger shaving brush is better than the one I have used.</li>
            <li> for sure.</li>
            <li> There was no way to tell why they would do that, but the fault lies with me for not using the better brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten into shaving with a brush and better shaving cream</li>
            <li> This brush has become the most used.</li>
            <li> it got better and</li>
            <li> Then, make sure you do it, with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, but I have used better brushes,</li>
            <li> The more you use it however, the softer it gets.  </li>
            <li> Very happy overall.</li>
            <li> So once I bought a better shave cream (kiss my face)</li>
            <li> Still pleased with the output and performance of the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would invest in something better.</li>
            <li> Provides a wonderful lather (once I actually figured out the correct water-to-soap ratio) every time.</li>
            <li> Haveing not used a brush in many years,.</li>
            <li> It came on time, it is OK, has an animal odor I hope it will go away as I keep using it</li>
            <li> Great brush, very durable</li>
            <li> Outstanding shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> For the price could not get a better brush.  </li>
            <li> It holds lather well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose many bristles.</li>
            <li> I imagine there are more luxurious ones out there, but this product was just as described.</li>
            <li> bristles, comfortable in the hand, the wood handle is a nice touch, bristles spread evenly, retains water (depending on how you view</li>
            <li> I know most are, but maybe it was the way mine was manufactured</li>
            <li> I really love how this brush loads up.</li>
            <li> They love them, and are now shaving in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The badger fur is much better than the horse hair brush</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used since my shaving history since 1972..</li>
            <li> I use Col Conk Almond Shaving soap with this, and I have enjoyed each shave.</li>
            <li> Take some time and enjoy!  </li>
            <li> A good investment in self, trust me you are worth it.</li>
            <li> I just bit the bullet and ordered a silver tip brush for more money.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping that works out a lot better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great item.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love Col. Konk&#x27;s World Famous Rum Shaving soap as well.</li>
            <li> I prefer more at this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> With a dab of Proraso cream, I can whip up the most luxurious lather in 20 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and nice to use.</li>
            <li> brush is ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(best endorsement i can give is that i have bought 2 more as gifts to my dad and father-in-law)</li>
            <li> Cleans very easily and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality, and am still learning how best to use the brush: up - n- down strokes, or in a circle pattern.  </li>
            <li> Quality is very good for the money and shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is of a very high quality and feels very nice when spreading the lather when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>

            <li> The brush is good quality and it is just the right size.</li>
            <li> holds a good lather, just the right consistency...</li>
            <li> It is a good quality brush and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it&#x27;s a good brush and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a great product that feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Quick service,  quality product equals very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It works the soap into a great lather quickly and makes applying the foam smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for choosy and experienced shavers who want to pamper their faces for a proper and perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Holds water very well and makes a very nice lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice brush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product and extremely fast shipping with Prime</li>
            <li> It did arrive very promptly and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Handle seemed to be of nice quality, and after tugging at the hairs with some decent force, none came out, suggesting that the knot is also good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush works very well and makes a good lather very easily.</li>
            <li> : this is not my original idea, I give credit to someone else on here for this, but it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift and the recipient was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, good quality badger-hair brush, this is an excellent pick, especially if this is your first trek into brush application.</li>
            <li> This is so natural and good quality!</li>
            <li> Creates a rich lather, cleans up nicely.  </li>
            <li> It creates a nice, rich lather and exfoliates the skin well.</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> It takes about a week to break in, but after that it puts shaving cream on your face very smoothly and is very easy to clean, 5 -10 seconds under faucet</li>
            <li> Overall great value and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> particular brush is a great value.  </li>
            <li> It really is an awesome brush, although its my first shave brush so i really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> This brush has a nice wooden handle, holds plenty if water, and produces a beautiful lather.</li>
            <li> The good old fashioned way of lathering using a brush and a good shaving soap gives you a much more comfortable shave than the foam from the cans and is more affordable over time as well.  </li>
            <li> Apparently if you get a good one, you get a good one.</li>
            <li> Far from the best, but not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> I liked this brush a lot when I first started using it, but the boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve tried handily trump this brush.</li>
            <li> is to get some hair conditioner (any kind will do) and to use this on their brush after they clean off the soap.</li>
            <li> I clean the brush after each use by rinsing and letting it sit in warm water.  </li>
            <li> and I get a nice clean and even lather.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft brush from a nice, friendly, helpful company.</li>
            <li> High quality badger brush for a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this brush because of the great price and look.  </li>
            <li> I will buy from this company again and I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a shaving brush to trust this company to deliver quality and great service.</li>
            <li> Great high quality brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great and seems to be a high quality item.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and find the price-value ratio to be quite high.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> highly recommend getting a stand for the brush since I read that this greatly expands their lifetime and utility.  </li>
            <li> This is good quality brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This badger brush was very reasonably priced compared to others and I am absolutely delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li> This brush is easy on the face, holds water well, and delivers the lather nicely, you&#x27;re able to easily spread the latherr easily, as it feels like it&#x27;s gliding over your face.</li>
            <li> The reviews and online tutorials all said to get a pure badger hair brush, so I looked for the best most reasonably priced one</li>
            <li> The biggest plus is that it is super soft, and gave me a great lather!</li>
            <li> It applies easily and makes for a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Many people share their own experiences with different products, and I myself have learned a great deal</li>
            <li> Builds a good lather and is not expensive... will buy another when or if I wear this one out.</li>
            <li> As a first time shaving brush user I had no idea what to get, but I knew I wanted something affordable and yet still will good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a brush to shave and it has been a good one.  </li>
            <li> If you care that your brush looks as good as it acts and have the dough to pay for it, then you may want to go with a higher end brush.  </li>
            <li> If you care that your brush looks as good as it acts and have the dough to pay for it, then you may want to go with a higher end brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, but I believe it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> First couple of uses will leave some stray brush hair, but over all a really good brush.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles come off during the first 3-4 shaves, but then its all good.</li>
            <li> Good for a first time shave kit.  </li>
            <li> If you really want an excellent Badger Brush, then, get ready to spend way more .</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality brush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his shaving brush, and I loved the fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price and its intended use.</li>

            <li> The first impression was this was a good brush.  </li>
            <li> Great starter brush, entry level for sure, not much back bone to it kind of moppy once you load it up.</li>
            <li> The brush needed a good rinse after I soaked it the first time...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty good price for a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Lathers pretty good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and it is beautifully crafted.</li>

            <li> Good for your first brush.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of an odor when first used, but makes a good head of foam and brushes on well.  </li>

            <li> I loved this when I first got it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft but will lather up beautifully.</li>

            <li> I get a great lather (I&#x27;ve only used the Proraso Shaving Cream so far), and this brush feels wonderful as I&#x27;m lathering my face.  </li>
            <li> Loved the first one and couldn&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> A good brush for what u pay, but any seasoned shaver knows you should shave n a circular motion.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good for the  price and as a starter.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> It lost a lot of brisltes the first couple times but now seems good.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it is good.</li>
            <li> Bristles are nice and full just as pictured as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to have this brush for a long time as I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, if you&#x27;re considering a shaving brush for the first time, buying this one will be a good decision.</li>
            <li> Generally pretty good brush, durable, does what it should do.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty good brush, given the price (about $15 all told)</li>
            <li> Good first brush.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush, for what it is.</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty damn good too</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good brush.</li>
            <li> has held up well and is a good first brush but every now and then a hair or two will fall out.</li>
            <li> This is a really good brush however the first couple weeks there was a lot of oder</li>
            <li> Hairs are not packed tightly as a higher end brush, but good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for the price, builds a very good lather with a little work.  </li>
            <li> It certainly makes the shaving process a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came quickly, works great and fits the Escali razor holder just right.  </li>
            <li> the money it is well worth the cost - it has held up fine and is of a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Definitely makes shaving a more pleasant experience!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s more work to whip up some shaving cream with this brush than to push the button on the top of a can, I find the process somehow more satisfying and the resulting cream more effective than modern alternatives.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Out of this world rich lather!  </li>
            <li> I use this brush every morning and it has not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Update: the company sent me a new replacement brush without me asking so upgrading to three stars for great customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE world and, besides enjoying great shaves, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality of products made for wet shavers.  </li>
            <li> And as a bonus, it feels pretty cool when your applying the shaving cream too!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a win, and didn&#x27;t cost any more than my old boar-ing brush.  </li>
            <li> They love the idea of getting them something nice and useful.</li>
            <li> Great value for an authentic natural shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice brush.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to easily pull the bristles out of the handle.</li>
            <li> It arrived nicely packaged and quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived QUICKLY and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I get a nice even application of the shaving cream and it lathers the cream quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for starters, quick shipping</li>
            <li> I dry it as best</li>
            <li> It does fell nice on the face and drys quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I did was order some popular stuff from amazon and quickly found out that the brush had a lot to do with the application.  </li>
            <li> Holds plenty of soap, and a quick dip in warm water will bring a frothy lather.</li>
            <li> Now, I really do not know what makes one badger brush better from another, but I now know that this brush does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was part of a starter kit that I bought three years ago when I made the awesome switch to shaving with a straight edge instead of the $25 modern razors.</li>
            <li> This Shaving Brush Lathers Proraso Nicely, overall a good product and fair price.</li>
            <li> He said it is soft, feels good to use, and that the lather goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, good handle and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> This brush looks good and the build quality seems good, but I did have some personal issues with it.</li>
            <li> It spreads the soap nicely and even and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does tend to shed more than I hoped maybe 4 hairs a shave so far, but for the price it is a great brush.</li>
            <li> Use with shaving soap from a bowl, had no issues so far, good feel on skin and nicely priced</li>
            <li> Whips up lather nice and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like it, helps me make a good lather, but I feel that it is kind of soft</li>
            <li> For the price, this seems like a great product, and is definitely a good introduction for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> He reports that he is very satisfied with the full coverage of the brush and the smooth shave resulting from its use.  </li>
            <li> one to be more comfortable to use and of greater quality.  </li>
            <li> This Brush is amazing, its soft feels good on your face.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having the best products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it- with a good soap, it creates a fantastic lather, with no bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> The Escali Badger brush is of a great quality and far better than the horsehair brushes I used in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Great price on a badger brush with a nice wooden handle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - well crafted with real wood and real bristles.</li>
            <li> this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid wood handle looks great and fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li> It is great for any man who wants a soothing, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This brush is slightly smaller and is lighter than my primary brush but is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for intro to wet shaving brush (and maybe more?)</li>
            <li> But again, overall, good brush and certainly good value.</li>
            <li> As far as an beginer brush with quality and value couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> By far the most luxurious shaving brush I have ever had... just a joy to use each morning.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a better, more comfortable shave lathering up with a brush than you do with that canned s</li>
            <li> It does its job perfectly and it is very easy to clean and dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, performs well, and is at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that feels very soft when applying the shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, but the form a great lather.  </li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft feels great on my face and</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and works up a great lather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> GREAT brush and very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and lathers great.</li>
            <li> and he LOVED it even more than his old one!! :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great size not small at all</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase so far!</li>
            <li> seems to be working great so far!</li>
            <li> Great Brush, lost a few hairs the first couple uses, but definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Altogether I think this is an excellent value for the price, you could easily spend three times as much or more for a shaving brush from some other companies that would not be significantly better than the Escali.  </li>
            <li> The wood is very beautiful and there were ~30 loose hairs</li>
            <li> Even the best paint brush ($30 to 50.00) will loose a bristle now and then.</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly and I&#x27;ve had a great experience using it.</li>
            <li> so I was really happy to find one of such good quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will be fine.  </li>
            <li> More than a month in, and fine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay with a breaking in period, this brush might be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Im sure it will do a fine job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was refreshing to see that there are still fine quality old-style shaving products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this might work fine for you if you use a brush that way, but if you like to be more aggressive when applying your shaving cream this might not be the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, i will get a more sturdy made one, but this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clean!  </li>
            <li> Hubby seems to like it just fine :).  </li>
            <li> , it holds water very well and works great to build up a rich, luxurious lather (I use Geo.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as my travel brush and it has a more notable smell of badger than my Parkers.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for creating and applying a rich later and exfoliating your skin while doing so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it several times now, and Im very happy with the rich lather it helps work up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it and who knows, maybe someday I&#x27;ll consider moving up to a super or silvertip quality level!</li>
            <li> But it is cheap and feels nice so definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> You can spend a lot more on other brands but this one does the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali Badger shaving brush after reading the benefits of this brush indicating that this is a great brush, creating a rich lather, and very confortable.  </li>
            <li> , it allowed me to experiment with building lathers and gave me a good point of reference as to what a pure badger brush is like.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great brush that is priced right you can find it right here.</li>
            <li> But this one certainly does the job fairly good.</li>
            <li> but the brush certainly has proved to be a good buy.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly comes at a good price.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush 5 months ago (January 2013), and have been delighted with it&#x27;s quality and function.  </li>
            <li> nice when something I buy is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Break it in and give it what you&#x27;ve got, then enjoy a great classic shave.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft, and holds the shaving cream very nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend this shaving brush, even if you own a boar bristle brush, badger bristle brushes beat boar bristle brushes bar none!</li>
            <li> Very full and stands up to the whiskers.</li>
            <li> Generally very cool  </li>
            <li> The build quality is very good, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this brush compares to others, since this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought, but seems to be very good and would buy this one again.  </li>
            <li> Overall the feel and work ability is very good.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush seems to be of very good quality, especially for the price (about $13).  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a very good brush for the money.</li>
            <li> Creates a very good lather, but I think I personally prefer a stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li> Very good basic shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that you can find a better pure badger brush at this price point, very satisfied here.</li>
            <li> It lathers up soap in a very short time (about 30 seconds), holds moisture within the hairs, feels great when applying the lather and cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy to hold, and very soft.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very happy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> perfect brush for the new or experienced wet shaver!</li>
            <li> great value for the money.the bristles shed very little and the water retention was great.</li>
            <li> I am not the most qualified to make accurate comments.  </li>
            <li> - my best guess is the wood cannot stand getting wet which of course is the kiss of death since it is supposed to be used with soap and water.    </li>
            <li> Excellent, and just what I expected from a Badger Brush</li>
            <li> One of the best sources for learning about wet shaving is the &amp;#34;wicked_edge&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> sure that there are better brushes on the market, but if your just starting out, and want something inexpensive, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it&#x27;s met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s 100 years old, then it was a great  bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for someone who is curious about making the jump to shaving with a brush.</li>
            <li> His skin is sooo smooth after shaving that I can&#x27;t stop touching it</li>
            <li> A lot better than the flimsy cheap box store ones.</li>
            <li> Great results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> A great brush for shaving beginners and old shaving pros.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I always get a more comfortable shave using it.</li>
            <li> Feels great and makes a ton of lather with Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li> excellent product and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Man, that badger fur sure feels silky smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> Makes for a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It does the job and is noticeably better than the cheap boar bristle one I started with from CVS.</li>
            <li> So far this does a great job.</li>
            <li> I would suggest finding a nicer model so you can enjoy the shaving experience better.</li>
            <li> This is one the the most comfortable brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> Great brush for anyone who is price sensitive.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my foray into wet shaving</li>
            <li> So far it seems like a great brush.</li>
            <li> Use it nearly every day and it is still on great condition</li>
            <li> Great price and seems to do the trick so far.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and feel great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps others are more fortunate and it takes them longer than a month for the brush to fall apart, but I have no doubt that eventually it will happen.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t anticipating a great brush, just because of the price, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It makes a great lather and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like those are more important.</li>
            <li> Cannot see why spend more when you try this smooth brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is extremely soft, durable, looks great.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and generate a great lather.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and does a great job applying the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> like the brush and how it feels, soft and great with my shaving cream and spreading the lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also bought the Escali brush and razor stand, which this and the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor fit perfectly in.</li>
            <li> So far its worked great.</li>
            <li> Perfect buy for the money for anyone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This brush provides me with an excellent wet shave</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and feels really great on my face.  </li>
            <li> sometimes i wonder if i would have a more comfortable shaving experience if i use a wall paint brush???</li>
            <li> Soft on the skin and helps work up a great lather.</li>
            <li> always used cheap junk because I didn&#x27;t know better.</li>
            <li> It sheds even more when you rinse it and give it a light shake to get the water out.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is working great</li>
            <li> and I find it much more comfortable than a cartridge shave.</li>
            <li> Brush creates a fantastic lather, much better than doing it with your hands.</li>
            <li> First time using a brush and am very pleased with the way it sets up my beard for the razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the aesthetics much more of shaving this way.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the brush and the price is a real bargin!  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a better brush to replace this cheap thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even better, they do not shed as they would in cheaply constructed brushes.  </li>
            <li> Working great so far.  </li>
            <li> Although not as soft as the higher priced brushes this one is perfectly acceptable.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> As this was my first purchase of the kind, i must say I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> i love it except that it doesnt fit the holder that i have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping there are much better brushes available.</li>
            <li> My advice is to skip this one unless you&#x27;re just getting into this style of shaving and aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll stick with it because it is cheap, I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
            <li> Soft, holds and makes a great lather, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, but so far am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Great so far.  </li>
            <li> Great starter brush as far as I&#x27;m concerned, maybe one day I&#x27;ll upgrade to a silvertip but at the moment I see no need to spend $100</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap  brush many years ago</li>
            <li> After having used another shaving brush , this one is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> lather directly on my face and it produces a great lather in under a minute</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair shaving brush and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> So far, this is proving to be a great brush.</li>
            <li> Soft brush that works up a lather great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it so far; lathers up nicely using Proraso.  </li>
            <li> Hubby says its better than boars hair and puts cream on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have just started to shave as my father and his father did, and wow what a great shave I am getting.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the most comfortable brushes I have ever known.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for anyone looking to get into wet shaving and not wanting to spend a lot of money in case</li>
            <li> Again, maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I thought it felt great on my face.  </li>
            <li> On the flip side, it is a really secure hold :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a brush for shaving, and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li> Builds up a great lather with the two soaps i have used so far.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful shed alittle in the begining but thwt is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Since I paid about 5 bucks for it, I figured I was safe going cheap again.</li>
            <li> This brush was shipped fast and in good protective packaging.</li>
            <li> There are many better options available if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> it is reasonably priced with a good feel.</li>

            <li> The brush has a nice feel and is economically priced in the badger line.  </li>
            <li> It creates a good lather and seems very well-made--I haven&#x27;t had problems with bristles falling out or</li>
            <li> It does feel nice to brush on the fresh lather rather than squirting some out of a can and then coating my face.  </li>

            <li> It is a good value which for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It loads and holds lather very well, it feels good on my face.</li>

            <li> I can say that this brush does a good job of getting my skin and whiskers ready for a shave.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> quality Badger brush works up a good lather and it was reasonable and shipped</li>
            <li> I kept reading one review after another about how superior badger hair brushes are, so I picked this reasonably priced one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really has done a good job for me</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than others that I have seen and just as good.</li>
            <li> brush is capable of creating good lather from the soap.  </li>
            <li> For 10 bucks and real badger with a good feel it does the trick.</li>
            <li> But, to be honest this is worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> but this one does just as good and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but it will be worth spending the money and getting a nice one.</li>
            <li> good, real product.</li>
            <li> Vary nice and worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and pliable with very good bristle retention.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that almost 2 1/2 years later, this one is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> Stirs and holds lather well and just the right stiffness to spread it around on your face!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to clean after!wards !</li>
            <li> I am really getting in to buying all these new wonderful soaps and creams</li>
            <li> You can spend more or less on a shaving brush; this one is an excellent find.  </li>
            <li> This brush, the Escali, is the best of them and perhaps the only one worthy of the name.  </li>
            <li> This brush is gentle on my very sensitive face and does an excellent job lathering up the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> We took it out of the packaging and the bristles are very soft and seem like they will work very well to create a wonderful lather for the purpose of shaving.</li>
            <li> I can get a nice lather going right in a mug and massage my face before taking a blade to it.</li>
            <li> The badger hair soaks up just the right amount of warm water to transform any of my shaving soaps into a decadent mound of shaving smoothness.  </li>
            <li> This brush is far from perfect (I&#x27;m still losing hairs after more than a month of use), but overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I confess that this was a late-night impulse purchase, added because Amazon suggested it would be a good companion to some double-edged blades I purchased (100 box of Blue Personnas -- love them, too!).</li>
            <li> I know this is old school, but I truly enjoy using this brush when I shave!!!</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush is an exceptional shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This shaving combination is more economical and a much better shaving experience than the many shaving creams available.</li>
            <li> The brush is a good one, probably best in its price range, but there are better and more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> very smooth to the touch and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far very nice.</li>
            <li> It maintains it shape very nicely time after time and so far (over a month)</li>
            <li> Very nice component of my old fashioned shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> Once prepped and ready to use, the brush expands into a wonderful, full head that lathers beautifully in just a few swipes.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush and a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all true!</li>
            <li> Other than that, great!</li>
            <li> The first use was a contest as to whether or not I&#x27;ve have more lather on my face than shedding brush bristles!</li>
            <li> I find that he is willing to shave more often now that he has a nicer shaving set!</li>
            <li> The brush is in perfect order and extremely well made.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, holds more moisture than boar bristle brush, and makes a rich lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is much more softer then the original one</li>
            <li> so I delayed submitting this review in order to be more familiar with the product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely invest in a good stand for both razor and brush and don&#x27;t skimp on the shaving cream/soap!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy another one (assuming my friend doesn&#x27;t offer me one of his custom brushes at a good discount!).</li>
            <li> In comparison, this one appears to have excellent construction - I&#x27;m not worried about it falling apart like the other, and I expect to use it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> works perfectly lathering up just as expected!</li>
            <li> He has loved the whole experience, in general, and this brush has worked great.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with shaving brushes, other than with this one, however, it seems to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to purchase an inexpensive brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to stick to using it</li>
            <li> Construction very good better than expected</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this particular offering -- incredibly quality for a much lower price than I expected, and with great reviews</li>
            <li> It holds water nicely and quickly works up a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I could HARDLY tell the difference between a best and silvertip, but you might appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved his new shave brush!</li>
            <li> it feels comfortable and makes really great foaming action.</li>
            <li> Very quickly received as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> cheap boar is better than cheap badger:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> and it came very quickly...</li>
            <li> This process affords hot water, hot lather and a great shave.</li>
            <li> Compact &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle, lathers well.</li>
            <li> good brush for the price... have used it more than a dozen times and no complaints so far...</li>
            <li> You could easily take the brush we have here, stick the bristles in an ivory handle &#x27;made by virgin monastery stewards&#x27; or whatever and find someone who&#x27;d pay $599.99.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply the shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face - and definitely help to lather the shaving cream 300% better than using just your hands.</li>
            <li> The handle fits your hand easily and the brush holds water and shave-cream/soap</li>
            <li> Soap washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it, using a badger brush and a good razor has allowed my husband to shave more frequently and not break out.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shedding has stopped and the brush aids a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> we received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li> easy to use &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would have liked it, as the bristles are nice and soft, but the handle came off after 1 use.</li>
            <li> When you lather up your non dominant hand you can easily apply the cream to your face without wasting any cream in the mug/glass.</li>
            <li> The price point on this brush easily makes it a 5 star buy for what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and superb service, I am enjoying my morning shavings now that I am back to the old double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipment and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Since the handle is wood, it is extremely easy to drill a hole and put in an &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; screw to hang up the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to build up a lather with as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for applying lather to your face.</li>
            <li> Running it under water and squeezing the brush hairs easily clears the remaining soap from the brush.</li>
            <li> Honey badgers don&#x27;t care about your face and if you cut yourself shaving, but this badger brush does, and helps lather up a nice shaving cream for your face, not too prickly and kind of soft....</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily and holds the shaving cream well.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to handle and hangs well on the rack I have for it and my razor.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was using Col.Conk Bay Rum soap, which has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> Great, soft brush, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, cleans up easy, and maintains it shape.  </li>
            <li> But that will be easy to fix.  </li>
            <li> I have found shaving to be very quick and painless.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a brush/mug many years ago and now remember why I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li> It also fits the stand easily.</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the badger brush itself is excellent soft, spreads evenly and also lathers very well</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are prickly and fall out fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> you could repeat this lathering 4 times easy without adding anymore proroso .</li>
            <li> Easily recommend.</li>
            <li> I have truly enjoyed a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly after ordering it.</li>
            <li> falls apart so easily</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent, have not experienced any loss of hairs, dries quickly and feels great.  </li>
            <li> It evenly and easy cover your face with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great price and even better product (super soft)..</li>
            <li> Both started out with that badgery smell, but it was easily taken care of.</li>
            <li> It was very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> and I can just as easily shave with water.</li>
            <li> This brush is well assembled, and easily compares to the $25 brush I started with.  </li>
            <li> Well-made and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> but you should easily find one that fits this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to lather and apply and</li>
            <li> cleanup is easy.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews however, suggested that the bristles fell out easily, that the handle broke off, or that the badger brush smelled</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, great first brush.</li>
            <li> I was not too happy with my shaving experience with a synthetic brush and began scouring the net in search for something better.</li>
            <li> Application of shave creme is easy and thorough.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft bristles, creates a great lather.  </li>
            <li> It rinses easily and it does not shed</li>
            <li> Most are just too soft to get up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> I chose the Escali because it had good reviews, was well priced,and I liked the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good brush so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> my Razor came with a synthetic brush, but this is far better, it gives me a good even lather all around.</li>
            <li> Spend money and get a decent one instead of buying this and then buying a good one...waste.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a durable shaving brush.</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend the escali to anyone thinking about getting into DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought over 6 months ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Pair it with a good quality shave cream (I&#x27;m using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood, love it).</li>
            <li> Mine is still going strong after 4 months or so, but is losing hairs at an increasing rate per day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Overall a nice looking and performing brush, and good quality for the money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong).</li>
            <li> This badger brush is decent, it is good quality.</li>
            <li> rest are holding on quite strong.</li>
            <li> Its not on year 2 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> The main body of the brush is doing good.  </li>
            <li> Update 1/30/16: Still going strong.     </li>
            <li> Had for two years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice, dense loft, good foam generation, solid construction.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> a good shaving lather just really isn&#x27;t that important to me.  </li>
            <li> Strong strong purchase reccomendation.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt a brush this good, with a decent shaving cream or soap</li>
            <li> Classy looking and works better than anticipated using a good quality soap.</li>
            <li> brush also has a strong odor of badger that overpowers my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Have not used long term yet, but product feels very good quality and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money--  super high quality.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much and haven&#x27;t used shaving cream since.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this if looking for a good inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li> Will give it a fair trial before retiring this one, but I don&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> A good badger hair brush (even pure badger which is the lowest grade badger hair brush)  should soften significantly after 10-20 shaves.  </li>
            <li> If you look online, you&#x27;ll see that there are different badger brush qualities where many consider the order (lowest to highest) being: pure -&gt; best -&gt;</li>
            <li> I was pleased right away at the softness of the brush and enjoyed the fact that the bristles retain their shape in application.  </li>
            <li> After years of paying more and more money for more and more blades in my razor and more and more formulations of canned shaving cream, I decided to get back to basics.  </li>
            <li> It still is not the softest brush but creates a good consistent lather relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> Still a very good entry level product to see if you really want to start investing into straight razor or safety razor shaving without beginning with a huge investment.</li>
            <li> They seems to fall out too easily, but the performance is fine.</li>
            <li> Got to my place of residence within a reasonable time and was very pleased with the package it came in.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nice first upgrade from a boar brush.</li>
            <li> The wood handle is nice and the hair is definitely of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice brush.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to bleed off some kind of dye from the bristles during the first couple of uses;</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> My first real shaving brush, but its pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> My first brush and I must say it is really a nice instrument to have.  </li>
            <li> Also, can&#x27;t beat having a nice badger massage first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush that I have purchased since leaving my cartridge razor, and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a brush until now, and now I use this brush to whip up my own hot lather.</li>
            <li> Soft, no poor odor, good handle, and it even looks good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, and feels really nice on the skin!</li>
            <li> At first I really liked the brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly for the price you could just plan on replacing it every 6 months, but for now I&#x27;ll upgrade to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Works like an average badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice and does the job i need it to.  </li>
            <li> For those complaining about quality and smell I would have to ask what exactly do you expect for this kind of money.</li>
            <li> well so the lather stays nice and hot.  </li>
            <li> I do not soak it in HOT water, but instead warm water.  </li>
            <li> Upon first impression the brush looked nice, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> A pretty nice badger hair brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush of this kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price, though, and supposedly better than boar bristles.</li>
            <li> I recently made the switch to wet shaving and a good brush is a very important part of your equipment , Badger brushes are just perfect to create the lather and massage your face</li>
            <li> I use a 2 dollar medium sized Ramiken from Target as a shave bowl and it stands up on the side perfectly for drying with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> it would be best for the brush to be hung, bristles down.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super absorbent, very soft, and makes a great lather.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of stiff bristles to whip up a nice lather, and they are in there for good!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving brush that I have used so far, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> for the brush itself, the bristles are high quality and soft, and do a wonderful job applying lather to the face.  </li>
            <li> The Escali shave brush holds a great deal of shave soap and enables you to get a good lather, with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a badger brush but it works good.</li>
            <li> Good brush for new users.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t looking for a 50$ brush for 10$. Was looking for a good introductory brush for someone new to brush shaving.</li>
            <li> Looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, just the right size to whip up a decent lather using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> works well, although I am new to using shaving soap and a brush was able to develop a nice foam and applied easily.</li>
            <li> The item was accurately described and arrived very quickly after ordering.  </li>
            <li> A fine brush.</li>
            <li> otherwise the shaving soap brush would have been fine -</li>
            <li> my husband says it works fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before I got this one but to me it seems just fine and dandy.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned that creates the perfect amount of lather and brings enough moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> This brush does a perfect job for half the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works up a fine lather.</li>
            <li> It works fine now and gives an even application of the soap.</li>
            <li> Works just fine and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by the fine folks that sell this fine product and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> and it still sheds a hair or two on occasion, but it works up a fine lather and feels fine on the face.</li>
            <li> but it works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> I hacked the softening process by soaking the brush MANY, MANY times in hot water with hair conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> does it just fine for my liking.</li>
            <li> Smooth easy shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as it just works fine unless you want to spend the money for something else.</li>
            <li> and i must say it works fine for what its made for.  </li>
            <li> flimsy product- better off spending more money on higher quality-</li>
            <li> The finish on the handle is holding up fine with no peeling or anything.</li>
            <li> AS fine a shaving brush as I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li> Lathers up just fine on your face.</li>
            <li> Now it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> But its a fine shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine.  </li>
            <li> I like the design just fine.</li>
            <li> Now it looks fine again and works well.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the brush just fine.</li>
            <li> It hold water pretty well and gives a great lather with my stainless bowl.</li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine, holds a lot of water that needs to be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great for first brush and arrived fast</li>
            <li> Of course looking at a photo of the Escali brush on the Escali stand it all looks fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve lost more hair from the brush than I&#x27;ve shaved from my face.</li>
            <li> Fine quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it sheds every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works just fine.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how the stiffness of this brush compares, but it feels just fine to me.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job.</li>
            <li> and it seem to be fine now.  </li>
            <li> I found the brush easy to use, and it was comfortable on my father&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a fine entry level shaving brush.</li>
            <li> this works just fine.</li>
            <li> This works just fine.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fine.  </li>
            <li> but if you want a badger brush, this one is fine.</li>
            <li> why buy a $ 50 brush where you can buy this awesome one for a lot less.</li>
            <li> So for me it appears to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Being a novice when it comes to these, I think it does a fine job.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend more money, spend more money.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Holds lather fine.</li>
            <li> As a first time badger brush user I must say I enjoy the way the bristles kind of &#x27;poke&#x27; at the skin and make the hair come up a bit.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that this is my first shaving brush, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Yet review after review stated that the VHD soap was indeed fine.  </li>
            <li> This brush works and will get you lathered up just fine.</li>
            <li> and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> a fine razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> Now it seems gone and the brush works fine.</li>
            <li> but it has held up fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with this brush for a long time and after looking at all the brushes and brush sets</li>
            <li> Works fine for now.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works perfectly, easy to hydrate in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Generally this lets me work a bit more water into the hairs before shaving, which is usually a good</li>
            <li> Fine looking.  </li>
            <li> but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and my SIL said it was fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Holds plenty of shaving cream and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my shaving mug, as opposed to the recommended hanging stand, and it holds its shape fine.</li>
            <li> The brush works fine.</li>
            <li> Shaking the brush of excess water before hanging it, I find it smells fine and works well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still performing well in another six months, I&#x27;ll bump my rating to a 5 out of 5...but every indication is that it&#x27;ll be doing just fine then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li> It may be fine for someone without allergies though.</li>
            <li> Anyway, they both seem just fine to me.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I could feel the hair of the brush as being fine needles against my face.  </li>
            <li> has been working fine for me, but I am an infrequent shaver (1-2wk)</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Plus, the transaction to purchase the brush was easy and smooth, and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> My husband says, &amp;#34;Works fine, doesn&#x27;t shed bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is fine to get as a starter, but I lose about 10 hairs every shave.</li>
            <li> A quick google search of &amp;#34;Omega boar brush&amp;#34; will bring you many options.</li>
            <li> The brush head is densely packed quite soft and pleasant to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It sheds much more quickly than costlier brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes, but so far this product has been as advertised and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The smell fades quickly though, and ends up smelling more like the shave soap you use.</li>
            <li> OK, so yes it does have a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> For someone who wants to get into a more classic style of shaving it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> am pleased with your company and how quickly I received the product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> Very Soft and good shape.</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft and works up a good lather in my dish.</li>
            <li> This was my son&#x27;s description of using this brush, with some good quality shaving soap,on his very sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Very soft, good lather.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and creates good lather.</li>
            <li> skip the pricier brushes; this brush is perfect; lathers up easily, gets the lather where it needs to go, feels great in the hand, and dries quickly; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The price is right, I&#x27;d recommend it for beginners, although I&#x27;m sure you could get some good mileage as your main brush as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how much water these bristles can hold and how easy it is to lather up and clean.  </li>
            <li> other wise it is a solid product that has a good medium stiffness and works up an excellent lather without much effort involved.</li>
            <li> First of all, this badger brush looks pretty cool and when you use it to put Shaving Cream, it feels great.</li>
            <li> This badger shaving brush is a lucky find for me after searching for many moons for a genuine badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a great brush as it traps water easily.</li>
            <li> The wood handle is comfortable in my hand and the feel of the badger bristles is soft and pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not fall out easily and it still looks great with only minimum care.</li>
            <li> It is fairly soft, has a good shape, makes creating lather easy with cream or even soap (Williams).  </li>
            <li> Hoping the shedding and odor stop after a few more uses, but otherwise excellent -- very easy to build up a good, even lather with minimal soap.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Great brush, word of advice wash the brush first with hot water and mild dish soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple uses the bristles were nice and soft and dry wonderfully after each use.</li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t buy a pure wolverine brush you can make do nicely with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and</li>
            <li> Very comfortable brush definitely gets a good lather on my head.</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little prickly but lathers up great!  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Excellent little badger brush....</li>
            <li> The hairs come off a little bit, but the brush does an excellent job of lathering and getting under whiskers.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little brush.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, 100% pure badger hair shaving brush at a very low price and top notch customer service.  </li>
            <li> I feel it works fine and will last a great amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beginners shaving brush for under $15.00; it works pretty good and would make a fine travel brush when a more high end brush would replace it at home.</li>
            <li> The Escali Badger brush was highly recommended, so I decided to purchase it and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Product works great but is a little stinky when used with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Nice little brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is very high quality and has a nice price point.  </li>
            <li> The brush is just the right size and it feels very comfortable in your hand when applying shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge turn off to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> A huge improvement over any boar / synthetic hair brush out there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a huge amount for a brush</li>
            <li> It was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> so of course I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a huge amount of money for a brush.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the feel of the wooden handle over metal though and the badger hair works great to apply my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased about a year ago and so far so good, works great, feels great on your skin,  not to rough and has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> brush lathers great, is not too rough, and I anticipate it getting softer the more</li>
            <li> Its soft bristles are the perfect compliment to any shave butter and the end result is a soft supple shave.  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in the quality of your shave</li>
            <li> I have since upgraded to another brush in the ~$30 range and it is a huge difference in feel.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It will last, and make great lathers and feel FANTASTIC on your face.  </li>
            <li> he has used it many times and its still nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It will make a huge difference in your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I can get a good comfortable lather with this and my proraso sensitive soap.</li>
            <li> Soft beaver hair bristle are perfect for my sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> The Escali is a huge step up in foam generating speed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feel.</li>

            <li> Great product use it daily!  </li>
            <li> Badger brushes later on, but for now, I am extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush holds lather quite well and spreads it smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Great brush for daily use.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> free to comment with anyquestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really holding me breath wondering what you kind of badger brush you get at this price.  </li>
            <li> The report I got back was it was great.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.   </li>
            <li> It gives me a nice lather and since I&#x27;ve started using it my skin seems clearer and my shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> While the brush makes great foam, the stiffer bristles irritated my husbands skin and further contributed to razor rash.  </li>
            <li> For the price this brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> happy with this product and doubt I&#x27;ll need another brush for a while, if I do I&#x27;ll be back to look at what these guys have in stock</li>

            <li> Comfortable and the bristles stay intact.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Uncle by marriage who was using a cheap boars hair brush.  </li>
            <li> This one seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Smaller than most but a nice firmness for brushing and produces a better lather than others</li>
            <li> This brush makes a real difference for applying warm water and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy shaving and using this brush.  </li>
            <li> Loving Amazon Prime, I am trending back to the days of warm lather and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does the trick as a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> But after the initial period of suffering, it is a great brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap one that lost bristles and felt like a pot scrubber.....</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.  </li>

            <li> Great buy overall.</li>

            <li> Overall great value.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it has worked great for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush holds the lather well, keeps its form, its affordable, and its easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> What a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> After that it has been shed free.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap synthetic brush that came as part of a set that I was using.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great brush, and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you want to enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the process of lathering my face and using the safety razor.</li>
            <li> But if you have the money and you know you&#x27;re going to use a brush for years to come, don&#x27;t be cheap and buy yourself something you can brag about, even if its to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Writing review heeding to call for review...sound genuine :</li>
            <li> Give it 2/3 shaves to get smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I figure this out, it has been smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> then the cheap brush it replaced.</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget, look no further: You have found a great deal.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth even lather that makes shaving a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Following the holding and drying recommendations presented here and it works great.</li>
            <li> It really comfortable</li>
            <li> Works up to a nice lather and very satisfactory for an entry level shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush spreads the shaving cream evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> After using one of the cheap kit brushes, this is a fantastic upgrade.</li>
            <li> and I get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of its great reviews and low price.</li>
            <li> but after that is is a solid brush that works great.  </li>
            <li> you must make two, sometimes three &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; in one session to get a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Produces a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t soak up so much water that it washes the soap off as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li> Overall a great brush.</li>
            <li> Washed it and now it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It helps the shaving cream go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, smooth touch.</li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable.</li>
            <li> how cheap I can get out for.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making this item available.</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep in shape and clean -</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is as cheap as they come.</li>
            <li> Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be because it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li> and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> Works up fantastic lather.  </li>
            <li> The order was filled in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving brush, if you make it well, its both comfortable and will last--not rocket science.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is attractive and does the job, but I&#x27;ve only owned this for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy that...........buy this brush.  </li>
            <li> Smooth application of the soap.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush vs the ones sold in retail stores is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The delivery was real fast and it sure did help me out.  </li>
            <li> Rinses clean easily under running water.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great brush for those just starting in safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap no-name brush, so decided to upgrade and enjoy the luxury.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of badger hair, the wood handle is comfortable, and it will allow you to lather like pro.</li>
            <li> but when you expect for cheap.</li>
            <li> Whether on my face or in my mug, this brush does a fantastic job of building a lather with either soap or cream (or in my case, a dab of Taylor&#x27;s cream with soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sheds some hair but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> You might think it is cheap but does the job.</li>
            <li> Quality construction and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I lost my Parker brush at a hotel so in a fit on rush and based on price point</li>
            <li> It is a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> After a year with it, I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s worth paying more to get a brush that stays together.</li>
            <li> It is too light, It looses brishels.</li>
            <li> my son!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy it again if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> Why not just display the brush and double edged razor in an attractive chrome stand.  </li>
            <li> Try this for a smooth shave:</li>
            <li> I have owned this brush for about 2 months now, and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean up and store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably one of the most economical brushes out there and it shows why.</li>
            <li> I guess that proves it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I used it to exceed 35 dollars merchandise limit for free shipping, It is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great brush overall</li>
            <li> so smooth</li>
            <li> The brush is cheap.  </li>
            <li> Yes, badger hair is what you want in a shaving brush, but the quality of the badger hair is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a throw away or starter brush on the cheap</li>
            <li> The shaving brush showed up in a short amount of time and it&#x27;s been really great.  </li>
            <li> For the value, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the brush a lot</li>
            <li> it being a cheaper brush, so quality would be cheap.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a fantastic job of evenly distributing shaving cream onto my face.</li>
            <li> When using it on my face, the hairs just lay over like a cheap child&#x27;s water color paint brush.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, he said it&#x27;s the best lather he&#x27;s ever had, and so far there is not a nest of hair clogging up the sink like with the boar hair brushes.</li>
            <li> It was great for 3 weeks and then since last week</li>
            <li> The price was great and we will definitely buy again from this shop.</li>
            <li> You need to feel important?  </li>
            <li> I got this brush because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> This brush compliments my merkur heavy duty razor and fits perfectly on the escali stand.</li>
            <li> Great Valentines present!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product and serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I purchased another for my travel kit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 6 months and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Brush gives smooth finish of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is a well constructed and comfortable gadget to hold and to lather.  </li>
            <li> wood handle is discernibly cheap in quality and of finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> For the price it did a great job and seemed solid.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this brush because it was one of the cheapest real badger hair brushes that I could find.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> A great all around brush for a DE shave noob such as myself.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit light in the hands...</li>
            <li> This is overall a great brush.</li>
            <li> Really gives you a nice lather before you shave.</li>
            <li> Sprung for a moderately priced silver tip, no smell, lathers great.</li>
            <li> I have used a mug, brush, and, cheap soap for years on end .I</li>
            <li> I prefer my cheap boar hair brush to this.</li>
            <li> A quality product that lathers well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a cheap brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> but overall it has performed great.</li>
            <li> It did take several washings to eliminate the badger smell, but beyond that, works great.</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush and wooden handle that works up a great lather.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s the only way to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> It fits in a standard brush/single blade razor holder and looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The handle is quite comfortable while applying shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a beginner or veteran shaver.</li>
            <li> The cheap brushes don&#x27;t perform like this.</li>
            <li> A good boar brush will be better than a cheap badger brush and cost may be similar...</li>
            <li> Badger hair brushes are great for newbies to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of fresh Badger on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily with Taylor of Old&lt;br /&gt;Bond</li>
            <li> enjoy shaving quite a bit now.</li>
            <li> but I use it as my primary for now.</li>
            <li> This brush is so cheap, I dare not put it to my face.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic buy for the price (something like 12 bucks when I purchased it).</li>
            <li> It gets softer every use, and has stood up great to my daily use and irregular care.</li>
            <li> It still makes great lather one year later and hasn&#x27;t lost a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that thus us genuine badger fir.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap drug store shaving brushes before.  </li>
            <li> This one is $3 more, but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was extraordinarily cheap</li>
            <li> Either it was a used brush or the brush is made from some cheap chemicals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap brush</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to cheap out -- and why not do so</li>
            <li> :  Do I enjoy using</li>
            <li> Moreover, the gloss finish over the wood looks fantastic, and hasn&#x27;t degraded over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great value especially for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li> It is a steal, however, for how cheap it</li>
            <li> -- This brush is STILL great with almost daily use!  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaving brush at an unbeatable price.  </li>
            <li> It was not my idea of a smooth shave because I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a cheap one that came in a shave soap kit.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the brush overall!</li>
            <li> The prickly, smooth feel against my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably a great brush for a beginner like me, but I am still losing bristles occasionally.</li>
            <li> This brush is their equal in quality, it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> : Now, after three months of daily use, this brush is still a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with it everyday for about a month now and it holds up great!</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought another for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you - this is a great shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I like it because his face is smooth</li>
            <li> It looks like it was cheaply glued into the handle.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a replacement free of charge.  </li>
            <li> A badger hair brush with a solid feel at a great price.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it fits the bill for being cheap and getting you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel it will wear out and therefore am not saving any money by buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Now if this is an issue with cheap brushes then go buy something</li>
            <li> Much more economical than canned shaving crème, just as good, and I like the old time ritual.</li>
            <li> and if you can get it cheap it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li> After the break in period the animal smell went away and I enjoy using it with every shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth face here.</li>
            <li> wanted a 100% badger hair brush and at $12.95 (prime, free shipping)</li>
            <li> I bought this cheap brush after leaving my fancy dancy one at my sisters house during vacation.  </li>
            <li> and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The Escali brush is inexpensive...and cheap.</li>
            <li> maybe it would fit your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wood on the handle seems a bit cheap, but I guess for the price</li>
            <li> Now after using this brush on a regular basis for months the brush is still working great</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the plastic ones, and a cheap wood</li>
            <li> You can look online for the detailed explanations of this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still fantastic even after all that use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bent a wire hanger into a brush and razor holder and my lady has mentioned how nice the whole setup looks in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap handle and</li>
            <li> I have have only used it a couple of times, it has produced great results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is wood, but its Lacquered with something so that it is smooth to the touch and water</li>
            <li> Light weight, inexpensive and serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> A solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Those turned out to be fantastic, the brush, however, turned out to be a disaster.</li>
            <li> I also use the term badger hair lightly.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, and functions as well as The Art of Shaving one.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but it&#x27;s been working great for me for the last three months.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy overall.  </li>
            <li> Shipping timely and problem free.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a terrific brush for the price, a great value.  </li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s not be fooled, this is a cheap brush for a cheap price, and it deserves a lower review than 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li> The quality and feel of the Ecali brush is excellent by comparison and it is losing few hairs.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great  brush for travel use or as a back up.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a couple of weeks, really like the lather it holds, and brushes up nicely under the whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My job requires me to travel 100%, and I have learned to pack lightly.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is easy too.</li>
            <li> Great job, I will be using this company in all my future needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lathers up my shaving soap effortlessly and transfers the soap to my face smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, and I think it&#x27;s suitable for any beginner.</li>
            <li> amd pronounces it as being quite effective developing the foam he wants for shaving.</li>
            <li> had gotten a boar brush as a part of a cheap shaving package from Walmart (also available on Amazon, however) that included the brush, a bowl, and some shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is fantastic and works well to get plenty of creamy soap in cup , in hand, or on face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t fall our like the cheaply made brush that I purchased at Meijer.</li>
            <li> Uses it daily - great brush</li>
            <li> I do not understand how this brush got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> I guess I should go badger hunting if I want it cheap.</li>
            <li> It took several uses for that smell to go away, but now he&#x27;s quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a great shaving brush that gets the job done, at low cost, this is your badger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times with great results.</li>
            <li> Great brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It distributes the cream evenly and its easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Holds lather longer and easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used both, I can honestly say this one not only works up a better lather, it also has softer more flexible bristles.</li>
            <li> Found a holder on Amazon and this brush fit the holder</li>
            <li> I concluded that I had tried to get by too cheap.  </li>
            <li> Buy cheap, get cheap.</li>
            <li> Great shaving accessory for those of us using a traditional blade razor.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap prickly bristle brush, does not soften up with use, suffering some bristle loss, I have pastry brushes that are softer.</li>
            <li> Two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> its great....and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Produces a much thicker lather than using your hands and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> After using this brush for 2 months, it works really great with various brand of shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> I replied back saying I&#x27;m happy with the brush</li>
            <li> I will update post with any relevant information as i get it.</li>
            <li> Paints the cream on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it&#x27;s cheap and will keep my face lathered until all the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> overall great brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a low price</li>
            <li> and I much enjoy it</li>
            <li> I make him homemade shaving soap because well I am cheap and I have prefected a recipe he likes.</li>
            <li> I also picked up a cheap stand ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Washed the brush lightly and the smell no longer bothers me.</li>
            <li> OK, in the end I find that synthetic shaving brushes are actually softer and more effective.</li>
            <li> A cheap badger brush.</li>
            <li> My great grandfather used one daily, and I always wondered what it was like.  </li>
            <li> The ad stated that it creates great lather, this is totally incorrect</li>
            <li> Its a great brush if you are just starting into DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Fits the Escali Deluxe Chrome Stand very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The brush I use is this cheap thing I bought at a pharmacy somewhere during my travels.</li>
            <li> Badgers are primarily solitary animals</li>
            <li> I do not feel comfortable with it nor looking forward to shawing with it ever again.</li>
            <li> Just fantastic.</li>
            <li> The brush works great however the fur was not properly cleaned.</li>
            <li> The important thing to remember is that you have to care for this product correctly.  </li>
            <li> Great brush especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush revolutionizes shaving for me, and feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is far superior to the cheap ones I have.  </li>
            <li> If you like an old fashioned shave this is superior tool.</li>
            <li> It produces a better lather, and it&#x27;s more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> After such a good experience with this brush at around $12-$13, I can&#x27;t imagine paying $50 or more for a &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, not excellent, but it&#x27;s the best brush you can buy at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I believe almost all boar brushes have good scrubbing action to lift your whiskers and exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush Very well priced and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Has been a good experience so far.  </li>
            <li> hair stays very together when using a proper lather which is great!  </li>
            <li> IT was cheap, but not cheaply made, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good brush for beginners, but will leave you wanting more if you&#x27;re hoping for actual quality.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and it picks up lather well, hasn&#x27;t started to completely fall apart, and seems to have fairly good fit and finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are just experimenting with shaving with a straight razor and don&#x27;t know if it is for you, this is the perfect brush because of the low price point.  </li>
            <li> Soft and good brush though 1-2 hairs fall out during each shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Good and soft lil problem with the hairs falling out</li>
            <li> And if there are better out there this is still a great brush to get started learning how to wet shave.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel incredibly soft and offer a good amount of lather</li>
            <li> We had looked at brushes priced above $120.00 and he feels this one is just as good or better quality than those.</li>
            <li> I think I need to buy the good old shaving soap.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are soft and feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good . . .</li>
            <li> There was no need to contact customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to upgrade my old shaving brush &amp; this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Soft on the face, lathers good.  </li>
            <li> so I was looking for items that were good but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, and so far this one does the job well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this has been a good way to ease into old school brush shaving.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, but the main problem with this brush is it&#x27;s too floppy to be of much good.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised at how nice this brush performs and lasts for what you paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft and good lather.  </li>
            <li> brush has a good handle, and the bristles are firm in a good way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good with this brush, just took off a star for the hair loss</li>
            <li> This is a nice light shaving brush which I find holds water and shaving creme really well.</li>
            <li> and so far it performs just as good as a 50$ one I had before it.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> This brush is far superior to any that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> Good brush, fairly soft, but it sheds a lot.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of weeks and this brush seems to be really good so far.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is a good quality, haven&#x27;t lost many hairs after the initial couple shaves.  </li>
            <li> So far so good on this brush.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s in the form of Ron Swanson, Mr. Rogers, Ronald Reagan, or Teddy Roosevelt, people want to feel self-reliant and they want to smell like the good old days when you had to walk to school uphill both ways.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is excellent, and it holds water and later very well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and works up a really good lather.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a good quality, works well, and has lasted so far.</li>
            <li> bristles feel good, and are soft</li>
            <li> Also, this brush has a classy look and when applying the lather, it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So, so far, I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> I liked my old brush better.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s soft, and works up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Awesome brush, just what I needed and just as good as the expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned that one of the cheapest brushes on Amazon might not be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This is a good brush to trial shaving the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed with how well (and long)</li>
            <li> I could whip up a good lather, it is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and produce a good lather.</li>
            <li> It had good recommendations and looked like a clear winner in regards to price.  </li>
            <li> So far, brush seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> when matched with good shaving cream from bath and body works by co bigelow, I would have thought I was at an old world barber shop and</li>
            <li> It did not create good foam out of the leather shaving cream (I use Old Spice).</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> water/soap/cream well and whips up a good lather both in the cup and directly on my face.</li>
            <li> Good brush, quality is good but a few bristles do come out from time to time.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and feels like good quality.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now so far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is plenty soft and the quality seems good as well.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good intro into the world of classy shaving without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get a good quality shaving soap to go with the brush, it makes a big difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> I also like the wooden handle better than the plastic handle and this one feels good in the hand when using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is soft and creates a good lather.</li>
            <li> Feels like the good old times.</li>
            <li> I own three brushes so far, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Superior to my old one which was inherited.</li>
            <li> Now on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being The Thing and 1 being Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s lovely parts, I am a good solid 6.</li>
            <li> Good brush, natural badger hair.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Soft, well put together, and generates a fair lather.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel like it does a good job, feels good against my skin, and leaves my face ready for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Not bad for being the first shaving brush I own.</li>
            <li> the bristles are stiff but soften nicely in water and work great to lift every whisker.  </li>
            <li> Like many brushes, it does have a strong odor when you first use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick and effective -Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would have easily been willing to pay more per brush for a stand to be included with it.  </li>
            <li> Mu husband is very pleased, brush is soft, lathers well and easy to use</li>
            <li> The bristles hold moisture well creating a rich lather that has made my whole shaving experience such a joy!</li>
            <li> The one I selected was perfect and actually came much sooner that originally thought.  </li>
            <li> The wooden handle seems a bit light, but over all very nice.</li>
            <li> Right away there were many bristles coming out every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I am very pleased with how much lather this is able to create from so little cream.</li>
            <li> hair comes off it easily so it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
            <li> A nice rich lather that really lasts.</li>
            <li> Compared to many other badger brushes out there, this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This would be a good starter brush, but not a very stiff brush.</li>
            <li> My first one has lasted OVER A YEAR and is still used in my travel kit!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect, but it really works well!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> very useful brush</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago I decided I wanted to try using shave soap and a safety razor instead of my collection of Gillette products that just weren&#x27;t very fun to use.</li>
            <li> Out of the packet you&#x27;ll get a very distinct smell but it disappears after you use it for about a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush, or if you find yourself fully satisfied after learning how to double edge shave, it&#x27;s a good long term brush too.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> The consensus indicates badger hair is best mainly because of its absorption quality, it retains water which is essential to the lubrication process.  </li>
            <li> I like the brush, good clean and soft when applying the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break the bank and you get a decent quality suit; the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half-canvassed suit referenced above is this brush.</li>
            <li> Lather quickly and smoothly with easy spreading about the face and chin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not losing to many hairs after first week of use and it lathers just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is my first pure badger shaving brush, and I think it is a quality piece at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> After leaving the original review below, I was contacted by an associate from Escali letting me know they&#x27;d like to send me a replacement free of cost.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth and rich lather that gets under my bristles.</li>
            <li> Originally I started TOO cheap.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now since my original cheap brush came apart.  </li>
            <li> use a combo of soap, glycerin-soap and cream and learned to take about 2 + minutes to whip the shaving lather into a rich smooth application before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best badger brush is slightly softer and more absorbent, but it was also 4X the price of the Escali Pure Badger.</li>
            <li> Excellent low cost yet high quality badger hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT starter brush if you are interested in testing out the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> After the first week, it stopped losing hair, and it&#x27;s been a great performer so far.</li>
            <li> The handle has a decent heft to it and holds nicely in my hand, but again, I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as an upgrade from an older boar hair brush I own.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet shaving brush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great so far in my first two weeks.</li>
            <li> it had a strong smell (badger, I suppose), but that quickly vanished, just by using it.</li>
            <li> It hold water well, and it rinses super easy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, item was exactly as described and posted in good time.</li>
            <li> Most important is that this brush does not require a user to be an expert latherer, just a willing one.</li>
            <li> Every now and again you come across a nice half-canvassed suit with decent quality for around $600.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving brush and decent price.</li>
            <li> The brush is inexpensive, decent looking, and works nicely.  </li>
            <li> It cleans easily and dries quickly once the excess water is removed.</li>
            <li> It has a nice look to it and it has been holding up great for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> but I think it does a decent job creating and holding a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This brush arrived quickly and the package was quite easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy and the bristles fall out very easily.</li>
            <li> It makes applying shaving soap very easy and without much effort.</li>
            <li> The book repeatedly suggested using a badger hair shaving brush (no other hair was suggested) as being superior to using the fingers.  </li>
            <li> It does loose a bit of hair, especially at first, but otherwise it produces a good lather and it&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Having just completely revamped my shaving approach, I was in need of a brush which would be dependable, provide a rich lather, and have an exceptional quality for value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of the materials used is high and I really liked the wood handle.  </li>
            <li> Old enough to remember the good old days used a number of the shaving brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li> I have a tweezerman brush that looks very much like this that I love.  </li>
            <li> The brush gives a good even layer of shaving foam, is very durable, easy to clean and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I started with a Boar&#x27;s-hair brush from Walgreens, which was very much pricklier, but I didn&#x27;t know any better -</li>
            <li> Brush is excellent and I certainly recommend it, particularly if you are new to the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This looks very sharp and elegant, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving properly but this brush has been excellent.</li>
            <li> New to the fancy double edge shaving world, so I can&#x27;t tell if this is an excellent brush.  </li>
            <li> easy and quick to clean up.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it works amazingly well allowing your brush to dry, is cost effective, and saves on counter space.</li>
            <li> Getting a good lather with it is easy enough.</li>
            <li> Good brush, super soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> but I found this one to be more than adequate and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is soft, makes a nice lather, and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush, lathers soap quickly, rinses out fast, holds shape .</li>
            <li> nice and soft and the animal smell was easy to get rid of by letting some lather sit in it overnight...</li>
            <li> Great little brush at a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> I am sure high end brushes are better but for my money , not bad .</li>
            <li> What more can a person say about a fine 100% pure Badger Shaving Brush?</li>
            <li> Original</li>
            <li> Well worth it in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as my first shaving brush and I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Has significantly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda funky at first but after a month of use the aroma is mostly gone from it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be able to lather up for a shave as soon as I got it, but as soon as the brush touched hot water an over powering odor was released.    </li>
            <li> It is definitely the best value that I found on Amazon, but I did find a better one on ebay for a similar cost.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I bought and have since bought three more.  </li>
            <li> As this is my first shaving brush I don&#x27;t have the cache of ethos that many pro shavers do.  </li>
            <li> Still in the original shape.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;-You will lose hairs the first couple days/weeks from the brush, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I did some research and decided to go with a badger hair shaving brush as part of my start up kit, and this brush has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I originally gave it three stars...</li>
            <li> I have since switched to a higher end brush from Slate and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great first brush to get.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it foamed up much much better than my boar ever did.</li>
            <li> I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> hairs themselves are really nice and soft, and can really hold a nice lather.</li>
            <li> was significantly fewer.  </li>
            <li> Many people buy this as a first brush as well as the tweezerman brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you soak it in hot water for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this brush,I use shaving soap myself make a nice creamy head lather,feels good on my face,keeps its shape a few hairs may come off,but that&#x27;s to be excepted.</li>
            <li> The reason I got this brush was because I didn&#x27;t know any better when I first started.</li>
            <li> There may be a bit better quality brushes out there, but for his starter brush and the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with it and will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t rated it after the first use.</li>
            <li> the original scent is no longer perceptible.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed it, a couple of hairs came off, but I haven&#x27;t seen any more fallout for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Worth  it for the foam!</li>
            <li> He called and was so excited.</li>
            <li> I was excited about using the brush.</li>
            <li> My first brush in 40 years glad I am shaving with a blade again</li>
            <li> It will take time to determine whether the bristles are well glued to the handle and if there is any significant loss of bristles over time then replacement time will be shorter.  </li>
            <li> Either way, will use until bristles are gone and then spend more money on something higher quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks, and it has maintained its shape, and softened up significantly.</li>
            <li> Did lose a lot of the bristles at first but seems ok no that I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> It holds sufficient water to work up a rich lather.</li>
            <li> No more tugging away, this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, and altogether I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I soak it in piping hot water, squeeze most of the water out, and swirl it around the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> But after a week no more hair loss and the brush has turned into the best part of my morning shave.</li>
            <li> For the price I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the fact that no hair come off (after the first couple of uses).</li>
            <li> not enviromental friendly products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First saving brush I&#x27;ve purchased for many years.</li>
            <li> It occurred to me that shaving brushes were Man&#x27;s original exfoliant.</li>
            <li> When I first started using a badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d keep using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the quality of the brush, given the price.</li>
            <li> Dont know if that is normal for this kind of brush but</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash it first</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; soft, really feels nice on your face.</li>
            <li> My first experience with brush shaving....really enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it I wasn&#x27;t sure what level of quality I would get at this price, but when I first used it I was impress.</li>
            <li> I think I may have lost 6 bristles - most of them the first time i used it, but not 1 since.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t spend that much money at all,and every penny was worth it for the tears in my friend&#x27;s eyes (he probably just had something in his eyes, of course, like TEARS) and the satisfaction of knowing that he has a quality brush that will serve him for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far very pleased.</li>
            <li> Worked okay at first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know any better as this was my first brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product (I use this with a metal shaving bowl, shaving mugs seemed too small).  </li>
            <li> I was really excited for this brush, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These minor complaints aside, it is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> A good, general purpose shave brush, lathers well, semi-soft, retains moisture and shaving foam well.</li>
            <li> My first brush and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well to create a rich lather.</li>
            <li> And I was told it makes shaving fun!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased so far with the Escali.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but have been nothing but pleased.  </li>
            <li> The brush is full and lightweight without feeling cheap.</li>
            <li> Original post:</li>
            <li> when I read all the reviews on here I was pretty confident I was getting a quality brush.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but will not WOW you</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Maybe there are better ones for a higher price, but for this price I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Bristles come off on the first use, but better after that.</li>
            <li> Creating the lather directly on my face feels great, and if you do it correctly you get the shaving cream up UNDER the hairs and on the skin directly, as opposed to smearing it around on top of all the hairs if you are using shaving gel from a can and your hand.  </li>
            <li> Great brush have not used it long</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a brush, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose Escali.</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving brush for many years, but this is my first badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ALMOST fun to shave!</li>
            <li> This is normal and the brush will whip up a nice lather for shaving.  </li>
            <li> A poetic man.</li>
            <li> So many hairs fell off within my husband&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li> Not any significant loss of bristle is noticed.</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks, and am pretty pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Just imagine, looking at yourself into the mirror, admiring the vessel that contains all that testosterone for hot love making and being the epitome of manhood.</li>
            <li> Creates a rich lather with ease.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I paid for this higher quality brush and would buy one again.</li>
            <li> It sheds a bristle or two on occasion,  but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is about par for the course.</li>
            <li> so excited when I found this one.  </li>
            <li> Creates a rich lather.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to love me myself</li>
            <li> Gives rich lather.</li>
            <li> Ok backbone, no smell, but pretty scratchy for my skin.</li>
            <li> Holds lather well, nice and soft, holds water nicely, and dries without too much fraying or misshaping.</li>
            <li> Bout 5 uses in, and its starting to break in nicely and become very smooth.</li>
            <li> After receiving the brush, I used it for a few days and it was very comfortable on my skin and worked up a great lather.</li>
            <li> There is a break in period, and once you&#x27;re through that, you will have a fine brush that will be much softer and will build a much better lather than the Escali ever will.</li>
            <li> users commented that there was a strong animal smell to the brush, but aside from a very mild, musky smell during the first couple of uses I have noticed no odor problem at all.  </li>
            <li> sure to wash it and clean it out before your first use since it is animal hair and will smell a bit funky at fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works fine, feels good, actually.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into the old school way of shaving, this brush really lathers and creates the right texture for you to have an incredible shave.  </li>
            <li> Although this is a cheap brush, I&#x27;d certainly expect more than a month&#x27;s use out of it.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok as a starter brush I think; he says he&#x27;s happy with it, but that it sheds a little bit.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Does a great job creating a lather quickly, and it feels pretty soft on the face when applying the leather.</li>
            <li> like the badger bristle, it starts off a little softer than the boar bristle but it generates a good lather and is nice on the skin when lathering up.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, very modest price, very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt scratchy at first, but now, when I apply my shaving cream, it creates a nice lather and seems to be doing the job, and is at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I am loving my new method of shaving</li>
            <li> New DE Shaver is loving the experience.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and quite honestly I wouldn&#x27;t know badger hair from cat hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m new to this kind of shaving</li>
            <li> As a new wet shaver it was nice to be able to get a goos brush at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new shaving brush and wanted the best quality one for the most reasonable cost; local stores don&#x27;t carry shave brushes here in south</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent choice for a basic shaving item,  If you were ever interested in using a badger hair brush for the first time then this is a very good choice considering the low cost and high quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall I find the brush to hold a good amount of water, lather well, have a comfortable feel.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s clean now</li>
            <li> It works but having to pick hairs out of the lather is less than ideal.  </li>
            <li> Hairs fall out every time I use it and that can get in the way of a clean shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely the best badger hair I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> so guess who gets to have super smooth legs?</li>
            <li> He was thrilled and said he was told the Badger shaving brush is the finest quality and will last for many years.</li>
            <li> It will clean off the bristles.</li>
            <li> Better then expected product wise.</li>
            <li> The two combined give me a much closer shave and much more comfortable skin afterwords.  </li>
            <li> Nice and soft with no smell that you sometimes read about with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells kind of funny at first.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped quickly and securely.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and the product description was accurate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped greatly by using a brush stand to allow it to dry after use; before then I&#x27;d wedge it in my shower caddy to prevent it from laying on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean it off, and give it the smell test.  </li>
            <li> My Simpson Chubby Best Badger or even the Semogue Boar brush I own would be an unfair comparison to this Escali Badger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost forgot make sure you soak the brush in warm water prior to each use.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel great and massaging against my skin and dry well in between uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good brush, definitely worth the price, but bristles fall out quite frequently.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, economical brush.</li>
            <li> I expected a better product with all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> After every use I have to clean my soap.</li>
            <li> Love it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, soft bristles yet holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li> He really likes the badger brush and this was a great replacement for his old, worn out brush.</li>
            <li> Want that rugged, clean WWI balanced budget feeling?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I get a nice, thick foam and feels great.</li>
            <li> and I had to clean it and my shaving cup.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to start a better wet shave regimen, this is a good brush to start with and experiment.</li>
            <li> This brush, costing only 3-4 dollars more, was a spectacular upgrade.</li>
            <li> but I think it suppose to be in order to clean the face and get those hairs to stand up.</li>
            <li> far it is comfortable and leaves a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This really helps to create a more comfortable AND closer</li>
            <li> The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor.</li>
            <li> do fall out each time I use it, but I expect that with a natural brush - each bristle can&#x27;t be exactly he same, so there can never be perfect tension to keep the bristles in place.</li>
            <li> in getting lather all around the hair and ensuring a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might just be the nature of the beast with this kind of design, but in the future I would try for something with a more water-resilient handle.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this new/ old shaving I will never go back to cans.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the bristles get stuck in the shaving soap forcing you to clean out each handful of bristles every time I shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed smelling funky after I clean up, but during the shave I do.  </li>
            <li> It is now clear that the Escali brush was far from ideal</li>
            <li> When you rinse it out, run water through it until it looks clean.</li>
            <li> The bristles rinse clean now, after a couple of weeks, but there&#x27;s still a musky smell.  </li>
            <li> Bought the Escali brush as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a huge amount of money initially on a brush, and it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a hassle to clean at times.</li>
            <li> So far i love it. :)</li>
            <li> I decided to try a really good brush and some high-quality soap instead of whatever was available at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> This brush is really good, however after using it a few times the hair are kind of coming off of the brush.  </li>
            <li> It is great for applying a nice thick layer of suds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does a great job providing a nice thick application of lather.</li>
            <li> brush builds a good lather, holds the cream in it very well, and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that the brush fits into my stainless steel brush/razor stand and looks really cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush I bought in 2012 and is still in perfect condition today after using it regularly and it never lost any hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, nice handle.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice lather and is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, does a nice foam and does its job.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and makes a nice foaming lather.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews on this site were positive.</li>
            <li> think this is the true Art of Shaving to be honest and way better than anything they sell at the local stores!  </li>
            <li> It is almost perfect, but at the first couple of uses you will lose some bristles and that is annoying, after that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Feels full and rich when lathered up.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush so far!</li>
            <li> * - I&#x27;m leaving this original review info in place for full disclosure/historical purposes, but</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about this brush - it is nice and soft and seems to be working well for him!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, exactly as advertised, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> He said he loved the lather but that is was kind of rough when he first started using.  </li>
            <li> great quality never leaves loose bristles on your face.</li>
            <li> Apart from the loose bristles that fall off initially, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> The brush is great once all the loose bristles are gone.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality but a little pokey.</li>
            <li> getting any funny smells, though I have read that some people have used a mild borax solution to wash it safely.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for this dang fine badger-hair brush!  </li>
            <li> I am not a connoisseur of different types of bristle, but this brush is comfortable to hold, lathers well, looks great and holds more foam than my old (boar bristle) shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Product is just what I was looking for, solidly built, feels great in your hands which comes when such things are made with great quality, it&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and gentle brush.</li>
            <li> It feels great against my skin; not too rough, but not too soft, and it holds enough water to create a perfect lather.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a decent quality brush and a very good value for a starter.</li>
            <li> So I have a new brush, new shaving cream, Dreadnaught, and a new razor, and I&#x27;m achieving an excellent shave, comfortable, smooth, and economical.  </li>
            <li> The brush works well and mixes with my soap easily, may lose a few hairs but for the most part a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Bruch creates rich foamy lather; soap goes on thick and creates a superb shave!</li>
            <li> Thanks due in part to this wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> I have now used my Escali 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush for two weeks and have enjoyed two benefits from it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pure Badger Shaving Brush &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like using 100% pure badger hair to apply your favorite shave soap.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure badger hair...</li>
            <li> I certainly couldn&#x27;t justify spending any more on a brush though</li>
            <li> I was right to do so!</li>
            <li> The price is right on this one!</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and it feels very good on the skin.</li>
            <li> The best way to get that process started is to use a little hand soap on the brush before you even use it the first time.</li>
            <li> the pruduct arrive pretty fast and everything was nice and clean, im going to reorder again one set for my father.</li>
            <li> From the first time this Escali brush met the soap puck, it&#x27;s been love at first shave!  </li>
            <li> I am super excited about using this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been to specialty sites and found that most decent brushes start in the $45 range and go on up to the mid-200&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> but it holds up perfectly, even after whipping up the hard soap surface.</li>
            <li> USA vitamins customer service was friendly and quick to send me a replacement brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to spend little but still make your shaving more enjoyable, I think this is effective.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if the packaging was a little more interesting or even included tip sheet on shaving.</li>
            <li> Special thanks to Perella&#x27;s and their outstanding team.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush so much, that after we bought some special Basin shaving cream for our 17-year-old son, I bought him his first Escali Badger Shaving Brush, and HE loves it, too.  </li>
            <li> Its a very pleasant earthy smell that evokes emotions from the past, maybe that was a smell from the barber shop as a kid.  </li>
            <li> However, this works just fine for right now</li>
            <li> I bought the Escali brush mainly because it looked nice and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor but it seems to be nice quality and works fine for lathering.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t poke his skin, isn&#x27;t rough at all, and does a great job of exfoliating and lathering.</li>
            <li> great addition to any wet shaver&#x27;s medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much, very well designed and finish was of high class!!</li>
            <li> Not much volume, and the lather isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush, however this is my first and only brush that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> But after the first few shaves, it has been lathering up perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great brush works as expected.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a great introduction to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Quality was great though, no real issue (yet) with losing hairs</li>
            <li> Great product, was just as described, well made and seems like it will last for a while, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> The quality is great and after a few of the hairs coming out initially it has been holding up great.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush but quality seems great and it has definitely improved the closeness of my shave</li>
            <li> What hasn&#x27;t been so great about this brush is that it smells rather like an unwashed badger each time it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed smooth lather application and the warm lather makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> The brush is truly a great value, but should not be expected to perform like a Kent.</li>
            <li> It is priced for a beginner and a nice starter brush; however, I wonder if it saves more in the long run to upgrade at the start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> It works great and with minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Great brush with minimal fall off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really all that happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is great if your&#x27;e trying to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> as I know now, I had taken a huge step to becoming a real man.  </li>
            <li> I am still looking for one that creates an amazing lather and is soft to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li> This brush offers an amazing value.</li>
            <li> i,am not worried about it,i clean it real good and let it dry out completely before using</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; if you were ever wonbering what a wet beaver smelt like you can sfop woundering after using this.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel amazing as you lather, they&#x27;re both soft and invigorating.</li>
            <li> The second reason is that the badger hair is supposedly superior to boar hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have come to LOVE the whole experience.</li>
            <li> good solid shaving brush.</li>
            <li> how good it would actually feel.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely, and I did for months before I learned of much better options in a comparable price range.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve used this brush almost every day for a full month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is the one to use for most shaving applications; much softer than boar hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my badger didn&#x27;t have good personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Soft, and effective.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve admired straight blade shaving for years and have always heard about the better shave a shaving brush</li>
            <li> It is quite soft which is nice</li>
            <li> Plus, let&#x27;s face it, it looks kinda cool as opposed to slapping that stuff from a can on your mug.</li>
            <li> The brush is of good quality, especially for the price, he just prefers a softer brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, feels nice and does the job perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really ask for much more in a shaving</li>
            <li> You get a full head of foam with it, and it doesn&#x27;t separate.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, by the time this one wears out, I would feel that the full value of the product - and beyond - had been realized.  </li>
            <li> While this is true, the finish of the brush - namely in the imprinted name, the wood handle, and the lacquer finish - expose the budget side of this brush.  </li>
            <li> While this is true, the finish of the brush - namely in the imprinted name, the wood handle, and the lacquer finish - expose the budget side of this brush.  </li>
            <li> On time shipping, lovely product high quality, husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Overall a good brush to start with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the last 10 or so shaves and it still feels good to the skin when I lather up.</li>
            <li> Real badger makes it better.</li>
            <li> While that might be true</li>
            <li> The brush feels nice and soft on my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and helps make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> A good solid shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but it broke after a short fall from the counter to the floor.</li>
            <li> This brush stays full during its use.</li>
            <li> Overall this purchase was a good experience.</li>
            <li> I would say overall good for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is just the product for giving oneself a shave that is a pleasure to took forward to.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes on an entirely different perspective with a lather made with this brush that makes your face feel good.</li>
            <li> This brush is not as soft on my face as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I got this Escali because of its good rating and low price.</li>
            <li> hair is much finer than the boar brush, and does a much better job holding water.  </li>
            <li> Solid build feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> I would have a sink full of hairs.</li>
            <li> So far my own Badger Shaving Brush surpasses greatly my father&#x27;s unknown product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product with a good feel and works well.  </li>
            <li> Initially couple of hairs fell off but after that it is all good</li>
            <li> A good friend who served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War told me he used such a brush to care for his M16, and I&#x27;ve used these brushes ever since.  </li>
            <li> but the hairs are not as soft and effective at whipping the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> PS, The brush is also good for female friends.</li>
            <li> After moving to a double-edged razor and Proraso pre-shave oil and shaving cream I figured I&#x27;d go full old-school and get a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the brush and it makes his shaving so much easier &amp; better</li>
            <li> The brush is usable after a good vinegar and baking soda bath and some essential oils added.  </li>
            <li> Also, since the bristles are so soft, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting the soap under my beard hairs, which results in far more nicking when I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is a newbie on old school shaving and he is loving it.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works like it is supposed to do and gets the job done, I also really like the design for the brush.</li>
            <li> It has since stopped but it is not as full as the day it arrived</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and does the job.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of this brush as compared to some of the others, you really can&#x27;t ask for much more.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to worry about, but a bit surprising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> Was a good starter brush but the low price for badger should be a warning.</li>
            <li> The brush holds a lot of soap, and the bristles are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Although the handle is a bit short for me, the wood is good quality.  </li>
            <li> There are good boar brushes, like an Omega, for the same price.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars for the brush, extra star for the good customer service.  </li>
            <li> Very well made and keeps its shape through many shaves...will always buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> If not for that this product would have received the full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> , the brush doesn&#x27;t feel a whole lot better than rubbing a paint brush on my face.</li>
            <li> is now nice and soft, and smells like shave soap.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go for the full wet-shave experience and purchased this Escali Badger Brush and some TOBS shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my synthetic brush until I find a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> For the price it looks good and with practice provides proper service.</li>
            <li> I probably have not been kind to it in terms of drying properly, but even still it&#x27;s been good so far.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality of the product and it seemed to be reasonably priced compared to some others I looked at.</li>
            <li> Good quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> I also wanted a true badger brush and not a synthetic or boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The brissels are full and do not fall out in a shaving mug as some others do.</li>
            <li> But overall good value.</li>
            <li> It is a good price on the basic badger.  </li>
            <li> I love stuff made from real animals.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to take on a cross country trip and did not want to risk &amp;#34;loosing&amp;#34; my good brush to the TSA&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush handle looks really cool.</li>
            <li> Dont have anything to compare it with,but its doing a good enough job for me.</li>
            <li> Much stiffer which I like better.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall I feel that it was a good starter brush</li>
            <li> Never made a better lather or had the best wet shave after 3 weeks of converting to traditional shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has my shaving soap usage been reduced, but this brush has sped up the time it takes to build a good lather.</li>
            <li> Good overall product.</li>
            <li> Looks good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely sets the standard.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, soft, and husband loves it</li>
            <li> but the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> love the looks of it and it feels very well</li>
            <li> Thankfully after a couple weeks of shaving with good soaps the smell finally went away.  </li>
            <li> Holds a good amount of lather with just enough water to keep everything well lubricated during the entirety of my shave.</li>
            <li> I get full use of it.</li>
            <li> A good solid beginning brush for those who want a close shave.</li>
            <li> You really won&#x27;t find a better brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Kinda cool.  </li>
            <li> I got a boars hair brush but the badger hair brush works a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Good quality and will last if its not abused, I believe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, soft brush, feels nice, I&#x27;m unsure how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> It helps get a good lather and lift the hairs prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> May be is a good choice for start, but if you want go to next level, maybe choice another one.</li>
            <li> After some time and some comparisons it might be a good one to keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> This one is so much softer and lathers better on my face.  </li>
            <li> A soft, well-made brush that whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> No need to spend the big $$$ for a good performing shave brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before, so I have no frame of reference, but it is doing a nice job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor and needed a good shave brush.</li>
            <li> I spent a while reading about the various options for each of these products and was impressed most by these.</li>
            <li> I have also had a good experience with a similar brush by Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to look totally sweet for the ladies.</li>
            <li> bought a wood rack to go with, and not only is it a great shave tool, it looks pretty darn cool on my counter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I know fresh brushes are supposed to have a light &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; odor of a badger....</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true when people say you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> But overall it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much softer and it seems to hold a lather better than the Van Der Hagen brush.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have ever used and for 12.99 it is a good deal</li>
            <li> The brush is good quality, but considerably smaller that the one I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> This allows the soap to fill up the brush more as well so you can really lather up your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice an soft.</li>
            <li> If it lasted longer I would give it a full 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I will probably avoid Escali in the future.</li>
            <li> So far a nice brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and effective.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out more money for something nicer until I had the hang of things.</li>
            <li> Good brush overall</li>
            <li> Nice and soft touch and feel.</li>
            <li> The wood handle is nice looking and bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> It does the job but not as good as the larger brush I bought from CVS for $3.</li>
            <li> Its soft, and lathers on the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li> This brush is at a good price point, but my brush continued to have hairs fall out DAILY even after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> The badger hairs are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It feels ok on the skin, but hairs come out of it every time I use it even though I&#x27;m trying to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs warm water very well for pre-shave &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34;, lathers well in shave bowl, and does a nice job in exfoliating skin as you spread the later across your face (circular motions).  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but I prefer synthetic.</li>
            <li> It has not shed many bristles and has maintained its shape very well.  </li>
            <li> know that it is true Badger hair because my dog went nuts sniffing it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed too much, or any more than I expect it to.</li>
            <li> I love it; they really bring up a lather.</li>
            <li> Works great for being only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up nicely and seems like it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Barking her brains out in full attack mode as if the brush were going to kill me.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A good, basic brush that does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice soft hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this brush on my skin, and it really seems to hold up for quite some time.</li>
            <li> The brush itself has a good deep lathering massage feel to it.</li>
            <li> It took me a second try getting a soap that makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> Cool company name printed on handle to remind you how hipster you are.</li>
            <li> It works up a nice lather, and the hairs are holding together nicely so far.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft ,it whips up well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as good on your face as the higher end brushes, but is a great alternative to those who can&#x27;t afford the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner in shaving with the safety razors and using shaving brush, but as faw as I can tell - it&#x27;s a good starting product!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good beginners brush.</li>
            <li> A true value.</li>
            <li> I wish the handle was heavier but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I just hope it holds up over time, that will be the true test of its quality.</li>
            <li> and I found this to be true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really liked an old Barbershop brand</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush.</li>
            <li> The brush holds a lot of water and when used with a good cream (not regular spray cream) it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> and it is good to go the next day.  </li>
            <li> Good looking and solid to boot too.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice thin layer and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> If you not really a big fan with Badger brush, I recommend Omega 10048 Boar Bristle, Omega S brush (synthetic brush) and Semogue 1800 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> Fair price point for a solid product.</li>
            <li> He has asked on more than one occasion if it was Honey Badger hair as that would make it that much cooler if it were.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that badger hair is chuck full of anti-oxidants and testosterone.</li>
            <li> Maybe they could of cleaned them better haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and helps to make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> (go to youtube for instructions on how to properly use a shaving brush) and is fairly sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Love having it out by the sink in the Escali stainless steel stand.</li>
            <li> Works well, soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Not the quality we had hoped for but not bad.</li>
            <li> First time using a brush like this and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Just bought this brush, not a bad deal....</li>
            <li> maybe a bit, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> No bad odors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad stepping stone</li>
            <li> It is not bad but couple of hairs do tend to come off so watch out for that.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for the money.</li>
            <li> Lost some hairs, but not nearly as bad as my CVS boar brush.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush for the price</li>
            <li> Not a bad buy...</li>
            <li> Still not a bad brush</li>
            <li> No bad smell either.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised on receipt of the brush finding it was as of good of quality as the first one.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s holding up pretty good .</li>
            <li> it is a fantastic little brush at an exceptional price!</li>
            <li> well, dries quickly and, most importantly, does a great job of creating and applying a thick lather.</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave now because of this brush and my new sandalwood shave soap, which this brush lathers incredibly well.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving, awesome valued brush.</li>
            <li> this may result in being able to use less shaving cream to produce a good amount of lather on your face-</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly too, which I appreciated :)</li>
            <li> It will tremendously improve your shaving experience and greatly facilitated my transition into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> With advertising the way it is, that can mean it is not the best hair, but it is all hair.</li>
            <li> The handle is very soft and comfortable but could be more rigid.  </li>
            <li> just run water through it, take the bristles from right under the handle in the web between index finger and thumb, and squeeze downward once or twice, and the brush is in shape and free of all water and soap.</li>
            <li> The price is right on this item, and the service by Perella&#x27;s was fantastic.</li>
            <li> The brush picks up just the right amount of shaving cream from the container with a light twirl then spreads it evenly across my face.  </li>
            <li> At that price point it could be a very attractive brush, and it&#x27;s hard to argue with the MANY high product ratings.</li>
            <li> After soaking the brush in hot water for a couple of minutes, latheting soaps and creams are easy.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to rinse and is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, it smells strongly of badger hair and the smell decreases after repeated use.</li>
            <li> It was pretty strong, but not overly offensive.  </li>
            <li> I likes the reviews the brush received making it a pretty easy choice for me.</li>
            <li> purchased first time - returned, bristles are coming off easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty gentle with it, but I bet it could take a bit more roughness than I give it and do fine.  </li>
            <li> I let it soak in hot water before shaving  and immediately noticed a strong smell coming from it.</li>
            <li> Also, its probably a good idea to soak it for some time in very hot water to break it in and soften the bristles up as much as possible.</li>
            <li> The brush is great and works the cream into a nice thick lather (maybe I will try it on my legs?!).  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali brush about a week ago, and it&#x27;s been treating me good thus far, iv only seen about 2 hairs shed, it lathers great, its soft on the face</li>
            <li> Works great, makes a very smooth and thick lather.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no question that it is a higher grade product, the bristles are softer and more consistent, the handle is made of &#x27;real&#x27; material, and there might be more hair inside the handle (the knot)</li>
            <li> This is a very large boar brush with a huge knot, 28mm knot.</li>
            <li> Classic wood handle looks nice, not flashy</li>
            <li> This brush works great for shaving - bristles are soft enough not to irritate, but strong enough to provide a good lather.</li>
            <li> You can certainly get more expensive badger hair brushes, but for the money this brush is very effective and did a good job.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice brush, shaving with the right tools changes it from a chore to a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Part of the self-reliance mindset is buying items of quality while taking your budget into consideration; given these parameters I found a few brushes made of quality materials within my price range, but the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush had the best reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little brush at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes since i haven&#x27;t used any others, but i can build great lathers and it will hold plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> for about the same money a nice Omega brush would be a better first choice.</li>
            <li> This is my first real shaving brush and it has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the issue other people are talking about with hair falling out, works great.</li>
            <li> Got this along with some other shaving products for my dad who has eveything, he likes the well construtive design and bristles, along with the durability,  great price also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, I keep it clean and dry and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> a couple of the bristles came out but other than that it works great and hasn&#x27;t happened again.</li>
            <li> I recommend that the brush be washed with warm water and shaving soap prior to first use; most of the stray badger hairs will fall off this way.</li>
            <li> Great brush for wet shaving!</li>
            <li> This little fellow might miss his coat, but it sure feels good on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a little over a month now and all I can say is that it is a very well made shaving brush and excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush creates a good lather quite fast and the bristles have not fallen out, so that&#x27;s pretty much what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When you get a good load of soap and start to lather, the brush falls flat.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking into buying a good brush you are looking into paying a little more money and a price range of 30-70 dollars.  </li>
            <li> Only used it 2 or 3 times so far, but the quality seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> First impression: fits my hand, soft bristles, does a great job whipping up and holding lather, no matting or balling of bristles, easy cleaning and dries completely.</li>
            <li> Of course with an attractive price.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I loved the results: less irritation, smooth face and the shadow lasts long to appear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend this to any one who wants a badger hair brush without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I am new to safety razor shaving, I got fed up with paying the high cost of the Gillette blades, so I got a razor and this brush and some shaving soap, first couple of shaves were a bit of a learning curve, but after three or so I am now proficient, I should have switched years ago</li>
            <li> I love my new shaving brush!</li>
            <li> The quality of the bristles are great - it creates a nice rich lather and are just rough enough to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving, so I was looking for a nice brush for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a good beginners brush, but if you are like me and quickly throw yourself into a new hobby like wet shaving you may want to skip a step and go with a nice silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li> It was fine for the first 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li> Seem fine first time purchasing a shave brush.</li>
            <li> The first one was fine.</li>
            <li> Sheds a bit for the first week, but then its fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, effective.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used a brush in a while, just got back to using a traditional shave setup and this brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be sturdy, dries quickly and has not lost bristles despite vigorous use.</li>
            <li> A decent &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; brush feels soooo much better on the face.  </li>
            <li> I actually like this one better than the $60 bc its stiffer and raises the hair better.  </li>
            <li> Now it hangs on a hook in my shower and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It does an adequate job with the cream</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> , the brush will become softer fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> only beef is that it tends to lose hairs more than most.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up the soap really quickly.</li>
            <li> While boar hair is a worthy substitute, it doesn’t retain water as well and has a reputation of retaining a noticeable odor.  </li>
            <li> Creams are easier to lather, they moisturize better, and just overall create a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> (I have Lavender which i really like, but i&#x27;d say go for Avocado or another scent that you find pleasurable) because it really just is a piece of cake to lather up and make an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> Its def an adequate brush.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is a great present to give to someone who really enjoys the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> but I suspect it is adequate for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> the seller:&lt;br /&gt;The brush was delivered quickly, within three or four days.  </li>
            <li> I received the package quickly.  </li>

            <li> It is adequate in every way.  </li>
            <li> Delivered  quickly</li>
            <li> It really is a better way to shave--much better for the skin and smoother, closer shave overall.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me it isn&#x27;t worn out yet.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliates, doesn&#x27;t lose a ton of bristles, makes it really easy to lather up and distribute shaving soap and rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this brush is smaller than I thought it would be, it still does a great job of getting my face ready for a blade.</li>
            <li> It does have some pokey bristles but it&#x27;s worthy of four stars.</li>
            <li> The vendor, Perella&#x27;s, shipped the item quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I was in too much of a hurry and didn&#x27;t do the proper break in technique I read online, so had some issues, but once I used it and broke it in, I may find a hair every once in a great while.</li>
            <li> So far, after a week&#x27;s worth of shaves it has held up nicely and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> It works up a lather quickly either off your face with a cream or in a bowl.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time and use a brush that&#x27;s worthy of your face.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brush at such a low price.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I never thought something so simple could make shaving that much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> This smell goes away fairly quickly - you won&#x27;t notice it by the 5th shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I have some chlorhexidine solution lying around</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> the only gripe I have at all is the wood is kind of cheap</li>
            <li> My order delivered quickly and ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone starting out shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This brush is great especially for the price I might want to get a nicer one if I had been straight edge shaving longer</li>
            <li> It soaks up and distributes lather well and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and has helped to reduce razor burn on his neck tremendously.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, no difficulties with product or seller.</li>
            <li> Super glue and patience got it working again, but there&#x27;s no doubt quality is an issue here.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> far, after about six uses,no hairs on my soap.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice lather,soft on your face, and almost makes shaving fun.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for several weeks now and it was replaced today by a Simpsons Colonel 2xl in best badger (Not recommended for starting out</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with the smoothness and quality that I thought was only possible with higher-cost brands.</li>

            <li> broke in quickly</li>
            <li> but I think it would be better to spend the extra 4 bucks on a better brush.</li>
            <li> After a quick underwear change I applied the remaining lather.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, as described.</li>
            <li> The lather I get from this is better than with the brush I paid more than double the amount for!</li>
            <li> My old Escali brush provided many years of comfortable, efficient application of shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush and I will definitely come back when I need a replacement</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Received the brush quickly.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly after I ordered it and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I use shave soap and it&#x27; holds a good amount of water to create a nice thick lather quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the bristles had never been washed, the wild smell of badger was very strong and you could smell it on your face after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really makes the whole experience fun and enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Honestly have no other brush to compare this to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brushed based on numerous reviews and it works great and feels very comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li> This one had high marks from many reviewers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the one from the high end store visited.</li>
            <li> Very fast and secure shipping.</li>
            <li> Make sure to soak it in hot water for a good long time before the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my original primary brush as my trip brush and now exclusively use this Escali Pure Badger Brush at home.</li>
            <li> This feels good on my face, keeps the right amount of water in place and seems to last.  </li>
            <li> you need a good badger brush for the right shave, look no further!</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with the brush, and my wife says the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I have no previous experience with a shaving brush, but this one works great so far.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers noted, this is a great shaving brush; really holds water and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Broken-in boar brushes will be more comfortable than this, because it uses clipped Badger hair, which makes it more prickly and less comfortable.</li>
            <li> the brush itself is great, helped provide a perfectly smooth, close shave DAILY, even with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> First off let me start off by saying that ever since I switched to the &amp;#34; real&amp;#34; way on how to shave I have seen a huge difference in my face.</li>
            <li> wish I read the B&amp;B forums earlier to learn that a cheap boar is substantially better than a cheap badger.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it, I definitely like using this brush.  </li>
            <li> (see my other review), is quite light and has a good grip.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped the item VERY fast!</li>
            <li> It helps whip up a nice thick lather, and it feels great while lathering my face, very luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied by the quality and the overall construction of the brush.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and won&#x27;t be going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hair started falling off in a very first shave!!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> My very first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I ignored the comments I read about the this brush shading it&#x27;s bristles, BIG MISTAKE!!&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous!  is the best description, dozens of bristles everyware between my face, the soap and the sink on the very first use , further more , this thing is not soft at all, it so prickly it feels more like a $1 paint brush, except</li>
            <li> I would mention is that it did lose a couple bristles the very first time that I used it.  </li>
            <li> they where finding while using this brush, so I was nervous about buying this, but I&#x27;m cheap first and foremost!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, and I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> After using them again, I wonder why I ever left, and in these times it sure is more economical.</li>
            <li> The resulting lather also feels creamier, maybe due to the fact that it can introduce air and water to the cream more effectively.</li>
            <li> thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and is comfortable, but I think I&#x27;ll be finding a higher quality brush soon.</li>
            <li> I needed a cheap and affordable badger brush and thats exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my very first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Its a great starter brush, but will definitely invest more on a future brush.</li>
            <li> This is my very first badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> but I could tell from my first lather that this brush is cheap.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of various brushes, I chose this one and, after a month or so, am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issue with bristles falling off and overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> - this is the very first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used</li>
            <li> Light shedding when I used it the first couple of times, but it has since stopped.</li>
            <li> this is my first genuine badger hair shaving brush, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier by both the purchase and the reliability of the vendor (Perella&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> And was pretty cheap too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> This is my very first Brush, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this, would buy again, and definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> My very first shave brush.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this brush though, I retired my first brush to the backup role, and am using this item as my primary shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Very first time using a Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to using shaving cream instead of the normal shaving gel that most men use.</li>
            <li> This is my very first badger brush as I delve into the world of shaving.</li>
            <li> I recently made the jump to DE shaving, and I am VERY glad I did.  </li>
            <li> But for this matter, someone that sensitive to scents may be better off finding a synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this brush has done a fairly good job and for the price it seems like it will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> last brush was nowhere near this good and cost me considerably more money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Minor shedding, but makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> Take good care of it and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> But the shaving brush looks good and we hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The hairs themselves are soft and the wooden handle gripped nicely and felt nice on the hand.</li>
            <li> - initially I found myself using a lot more pressure and mashing the whole thing into the bowl which wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li> it should be good for a long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this badger brush for very long so I can&#x27;t attest to its durability, but I can absolutely say that its bristles are softer and more comfortable to use, and its wood handle is also more pleasant to look at than my last brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is not too large and the shape makes it easy to pick up shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Thank  you for a fine product, and please congratulate your staff on producing a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;Regards from New Zealand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill the brush with shaving cream, and it&#x27;s also easy to wash it out completely after use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> But it it has been a very good brush so far, has only shed a few hairs from what I can see, and does a great job of lathering.</li>
            <li> this is my first shaving brush, but I did make sure to buy one that is pure badger hair.</li>
            <li> This old fellow (68) just started to &amp;#34;Wet Shave&amp;#34;.... bought the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and very pleased with it.....</li>
            <li> A great brush for a beginner or long time shaver; soft, lathers well, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I recently was given a vastly nicer brush with a much-softer (and non-shedding) \\&quot;best badger\\&quot; knot in it and decided to see just how many more bristles the Escali brush would loose.</li>
            <li> It is an essential shaving tool if you are using a more traditional cream like the Proraso since the brush is much more effective at lathering up the cream, and preparing your beard than using your hands alone.  </li>
            <li> This product is the perfect travel companion, fits nicely into my travel bag, holds it&#x27;s bristles, and gives me the same lather-up feeling as my more expensive brush that I use at home.  </li>
            <li> Great product, glad I bought it, fast shipping bad great service</li>
            <li> Really great brush especially for the price I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight, affordable shaving brush that does not loose its badger hair in application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Snaps back to &#x27;original&#x27; shape after being wet... just an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It lathers better now than it did when new, so it&#x27;s gonna be around my bathroom for a while longer.  </li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a brush and soap, but I can say that I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying my new Escali brush.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to lose more bristles than I would expect from a new brush of any sort.</li>
            <li> It has lasted for a year, and I see no signs of needing a new one anytime soon, so all the better on reliability.  </li>
            <li> my new brush and my shave is better than ever.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many brushes over the year and even thrown one or two out while they were new.</li>
            <li> but as I am new to shaving with a safely razor I have decided to make a hobby of it.</li>
            <li> Brush feels great, is affordable and actually looks more pleasant than other brushes in the same price range!</li>
            <li> This combined with the soap I use have led to much less irritation when I shave which is a win in my book.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, works great.</li>
            <li> It seems okay, smooth and soft and easy to clean thus far.  </li>
            <li> This brush holds the lather, the price of the brush was less than in the stores , it was a great price too.</li>
            <li> Great brush, nicely finished wooden handle, performs on a par with more my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs here and there, but this brush makes me feel like my cool as all get out pop-pop for a great price.</li>
            <li> but overall it seems to be a pretty good brush and does the job.  </li>
            <li> I love it, first ever shaving brush and it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush that will last long</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and should last a Long time</li>
            <li> A good 10-20 hairs fell out the first use and each subsequent use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the medium to small side-- good for travel but OK at home.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, especially if it is your first one.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price, but will probably spring for a higher quality brush the next time around.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a hanger for the brush to dry and a good dish for whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping of the product was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It works very well at lathering up shaving cream, holds water well, and it is easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li> Twice around the soap bowl is all I need to make a nice full lather with plenty left over to go over my mouth and chin area twice.  </li>
            <li> You can easily spend 2-5 times as much on a brush, but this one will work just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a good job of storing mine upside-down to dry...</li>
            <li> Easy ordering and fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Just rinse really good and dry then hang up.</li>
            <li> I really want to rate it better, and honestly it is pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a slightly higher quality brush out there selling for 50 or 60 dollars - but at $13.00, this brush is really excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lose that many hairs when first used, and makes applying shaving soap so much easier than synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> This is probably a good brush for the price, especially since it&#x27;s the first one I bought and</li>
            <li> So far I found that this is true and this brush suits my needs better than the Escali.</li>
            <li> I expect this brush to last a long time in great service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing with it&#x27;s glossy wooden handle and never fails to deliver a good lather.</li>
            <li> When I first went to use it I rinsed it out with warm water in the shower, then swirled it around twice in my container of sandalwood shaving cream by Taylor of old bond street, the in a circular motion applied to my leg.</li>
            <li> ;  which might be a good idea since even after washing it prior the first use it let a brown tinge in the lather</li>
            <li> The brush itself works fine as you would expect from a pure Badger haired brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft and much better than the boar brush that I had.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face ( very soft ).  </li>
            <li> It looks OK and the hair is very soft .</li>
            <li> The smell wears away (mostly), and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> smooth and good quality, yet the fibers drops down every use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This brush only goes to make the process that much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> When you first use it, you&#x27;ll end up with lots of badger hairs on your face!  </li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> Was excited at first, but the hairs all started falling out.</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> Also it has a tendency to knot up in the middle which then you have to pull out the knot and lose more hairs!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Parella&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> When I first received the brush it smelled like a badger!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can get a Semogue boar brush for the same price that works better!</li>
            <li> Shedding will occur at first AND if you don&#x27;t prepare the brush in water!</li>
            <li> next will be an upgrade to a better badger brush!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Funny!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> And yes several hairs fell out my first couple shaves, but I am sure that happens with most brushes.</li>
            <li> BUT HOT DAMN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the packages and WOOSH!</li>
            <li> and I consistently get perfectly whipped lather and only very occasionally do I get a stray badger hair on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my teenage son and its handsome style and easy-to-use and care for qualities made it a hit!</li>
            <li> I will buy another one next time for sure!</li>
            <li> it was my first brush!  </li>
            <li> My first shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This is my first time shaving with means of a brush, but I have to say the way the soap and water work together with the help of the Escali shaving brush helps make this daily routine more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working just as well as it did the first day!  </li>
            <li> The lather was in fact significantly thicker than what I could get with my first Art of Shaving brush, and I may still need to tinker with the water ratio.</li>
            <li> Way better than my old wilkenson sword!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush I&#x27;ve bought, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all getting a rich lather or applying it to my face.  </li>
            <li> The hairs REALLY hold a lot of soap!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re new to traditional wetshaving, or returning to it, this a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Dad called me and was overjoyed he could retire his old brush and loved the new badger brush replacement.</li>
            <li> Like most real-badger hair brushes, there&#x27;s a bit of a funk to it right out of the package; give it a good hot water rinse, soap it up really well with the shave soap of your choice, and let it dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> Now my brush \\&quot;floats\\&quot; just under the cabinet - easy access, proper drying, and no lost counterspace. :)</li>
            <li> For anyone interested in breaking in a brush, you first clean the brush with dish soap thoroughly, trying to get as many of the hairs out as possible, then rinse, then put into a solution of dish soap for about 4 hours, then rinse again trying to get out many of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the brush it is easy to use and the shave is second to non!!</li>
            <li> But after contacting Amazon the order was fixed free of charge and very quickly with 1 day shipping.  </li>
            <li> Definitely need a stand to help it dry, but it is a great addition to my grooming rituals!</li>
            <li> comfort and sensation are very good (much better than my previous one, and I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Ordered the shaving brush to replace a brush that I had been using for fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;Had become very comfortable and attached to this old friend of a brush.  </li>
            <li> Sure, you can pay five or ten times more for a fancy handle, but in the end, this brush does the job and makes me smile knowing how much money I&#x27;m saving!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very good price point, considering the alternatives tend to be either terribly expensive or very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly, and does the job just right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recipient was happy with the brush, and is super excited to be a new member of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Its a good beginner brush and great value for the price if you don&#x27;t mind a little loose badger hair.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hold as much water in the bristles as my previous brush, which is actually a good thing because I can better control how watered</li>
            <li> The brush holds its shape, has a crisp feel on the face, and rinses clean while maintaining its shape.</li>
            <li> Other than that the brush is great and really creams up my cream!</li>
            <li> He has to be clean shaven for his job and he loves this brush so much that he even uses it and shaves on his off days!</li>
            <li> I did not get the stand, I leave it in my stainless mixing dish which works fine.</li>
            <li> After a thorough cleaning, the brush functioned fine, and I reported as much.   </li>
            <li> If you enjoy smelling like a wet badger, you will LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> The badger hair is soft and provides great lather - much better than the previous brush.  </li>
            <li> Every day more and more loose hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I have used it for a few weeks, the brush is very soft, it forms a lovely lather of shaving cream, and exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also i wouldnt spend more on a fancy handle for me anyways considering i would much rather save the cash and purchase a nice new brush then having a used old one with a fancy handle.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it and would certainly recommend its purchase.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for an inexpensive shaving brush, I would skip cheap, \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; brushes altogether.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality and handsome brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Make sure I soak the brush in warm water for a minute or 2 prior to using it, make sure I get all the soap out after (squeeze, don&#x27;t twist the bristles), and hang it to dry in a razor and brush stand.  </li>
            <li> When armed with some warm water, a decent hunk of shaving soap in my surplus mug, and a proper blade, I have no doubt that the goal of a clean, close and comfortable shave will be met.</li>
            <li> Escali is a great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I detect no unpleasant odors, it does a great job of making lather and it is definitely soft enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Great little shave brush.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scritchy but that tells me the bristles are getting under my beard &amp; lifting the whiskers to provide for a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> Great little Shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush they got here.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  </li>
            <li> This little brush is a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Great brush..sheds a little</li>
            <li> Great little badger brush.</li>
            <li> purchased four of these little beauties at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also able to be more precise with where I apply lather without making a mess.    </li>
            <li> My first brush works just fine and feels pretty well made,  </li>
            <li> so I use it over a larger area than most and can say that it works just fine for these legs.  </li>
            <li> works fine make sure you break it in and get the apoxy smell out of it before you start using it regular.</li>
            <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly soft or comfortable, although it felt fine and never bothered me.</li>
            <li> Works up a good smooth lather with little effort.</li>
            <li> I liked my shave soap before, but this little brush is helping me to love my soap.</li>
            <li> Handle is wood and feels good but a little light for my taste.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you don&#x27;t have a shaving brush, get one right now!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush, very soft and it&#x27;s been working well for me since last 1 month.</li>
            <li> this is the first brush i have ever bought,so far nice product,holds soap very well and clean up is not a problem.</li>
            <li> and it should be good to go, (also helps get rid of loose hairs at this point instead of on your face!)</li>
            <li> I enjoy my shave so much now.</li>
            <li> It really spreads the lather well for a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> Great Brush, just a few bristles falling of from time to time during lather process.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, I have had only one bristle come out.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs in the beginning, works great now.</li>
            <li> it had a bit of an odor, and shed a few hairs, but now it keeps all its hairs and smells great.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves it softened up and feels great.  </li>
            <li> Received within a few days of ordering, which made me happy.</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought it was probably a gimmick and obviously more trouble than it would be worth.  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and after a thorough rinsing, it is ready to go again.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for a quality product and smooth transactions.</li>
            <li> A few bristles lost, but this item is performing great.</li>
            <li> This is my second shave brush and I have to admit that going with badger over boar is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up fast and spreads smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving for a while and enjoy luxury shaving items, but the reality is they are very costly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare to a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; as I have not used one but compared to the real cheap one I got locally</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and it is great.</li>
            <li> It arrived the next day, which was amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a much closer, comfortable shave than ever before.</li>
            <li> if you bowl lather, apply fast and with light pressure...</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheap badger hair brush to start with since I didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wanted an introductory brush at a reasonable price and Escali seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend too much, I opted for a cheap beginner brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li> Very well made and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product that should for years of comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> Once you get this brush soaked, the water really stays in there which leads to a fantastic lather.</li>
            <li> found the Escali product available at a reasonable price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Buy a few, they are a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 7 months now and while it is great for the price I still have a few badger hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> Made of real badger hair just like my grandfather&#x27;s, not that cheap synthetic stuff.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out in the beginning, great brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this purchase as it was quite cheap.</li>
            <li> What I heard was correct, and this brush has been nothing but a success.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a product of this quality anywhere near this price range.</li>
            <li> Already got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This hair is fresh off the badger.</li>
            <li> It starts out prickly and doesn&#x27;t really get better; instead of gently working lather into my skin</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a good brush, but don&#x27;t want to pay to much, look no further.</li>
            <li> The bristles have started to fall out much earlier than I would have liked</li>
            <li> Before that I had used my Grand Father&#x27;s brush, that would be over 100 years old.  </li>
            <li> The wooden handle is nicely made, but the bristles themselves have a foul animal smell, even after using it 4-5 times.</li>
            <li> Honestly l think who that happenhappens to are the people that don&#x27;t store it properly.</li>
            <li> My grandfather was a barber and he had several brushes but not as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I would have liked it to be a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> Ya know... fresh off the Badger.  </li>
            <li> Shaving has been better since I used this brush, It&#x27;s unexpectedly tingly/prickly when lathering your face</li>
            <li> If you are curious about making the jump from can-o-gel to brush and mug, this is a good place to start.  </li>
            <li> He was in WWII so he was old school about most things.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be perfect and broken in after two shaves.</li>
            <li> finally decided I&#x27;m going to use a brush indefinitely, so went and got a nice brush--worlds apart.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the close comfortable shave that only a badger brush will allow.  </li>
            <li> Much better that my old plastic razors I used to save with.</li>
            <li> They also have the blades, but worth shopping around for both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gentle on the brush, but I take reasonably good care of it.</li>
            <li> If you just want to know if this is worth the 15 bucks you are going to pay for it:</li>
            <li> As a shaving newbie, I honestly can&#x27;t say how this brush matches up to others in the same price range.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> (As far as boar goes this smells much better than boar</li>
            <li> I LOVE old school shaving</li>
            <li> Your face is worth it.</li>
            <li> This in itself was nice, knowing that there is a manufacturer/distributor that cares enough.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see needing more than what this brush offers.</li>
            <li> But if you really want something nice, look at the Simpsons.&lt;br /&gt;All together, kind of a waste.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden handle, badger brush that does its job.</li>
            <li> A cheap brush, though for the same price you can get much better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not only is it more comfortable</li>
            <li> it was soft yet obviously doing a great job with exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The badger hair gives extra holding power of your favorite lather with smooth application and moisture content.  </li>
            <li> I have done both with my own, nothing compares, nothing, same here..</li>
            <li> Bought this as an upgrade from drug store quality and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft while holding lather for a real close shave.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nice and works the facial hair into place.  </li>
            <li> One tip - soak the brush in warm water for a minute to get it nicely soft and ready for the shave cream.</li>
            <li> For the same amount of money ($12.95) you can get a great boar brush (like the Omega Professional made in Italy or the Semogue Boar Bristle Shaving Brush made in Portugal.</li>
            <li> Good entry level brush for me as a novice wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> Wet badger hair isn&#x27;t a good smell</li>
            <li> this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely does a great job at providing that old timey shaving experience.</li>
            <li> was given as a gift and it is far better than what they had.</li>
            <li> More like the Tweezerman of old.</li>
            <li> I MUST say, after about 2 months of shaving, this brush has become well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good starter brush to learn all ropes of wet shaving</li>
            <li> but this really does a good job lathering and raising the facial hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Annoyance I have is that with 700+ good reviews and me not really having an opinion, I was being spammed by either Amazon or Peralla&#x27;s for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I dab a finger&#x27;s worth of cream into a wood shave bowl and lather up with the Escali.  </li>
            <li> not that many bristles have fallen out and the smell is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> The brush is inexpensive and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving fun.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed going old school shaving.</li>
            <li> This a good brush if you are just starting out with DE or Straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought the Escali on a chance after much success with the Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> The Escali badger brush is worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s far more</li>
            <li> Its good but its rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to wet shaving I was looking for an affordable brush that would give me a good lather and hold up well.  </li>
            <li> This same company makes a good razor/brush stand at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For me it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice big plume.</li>
            <li> You would be surprised how many men still ise a cup and brush.</li>
            <li> This brush holds more water and soapy lather than my old boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with this brush.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the soft application.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price though.</li>
            <li> this is a good brush to start off with letting you experience a badger brush for not a lot of money just in case you decide you don&#x27;t want to continue with the wet shave.</li>
            <li> Take a finger print sized dab of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream and place on top of Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my face is about 90% clear or more</li>
            <li> , it hasn&#x27;t been this good since I didn&#x27;t grow facial hair (more than ten years ago).    </li>
            <li> This is worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Paired with a quality shaving soap or cream it creates a wonderful lather, however, you can tell the quality is not equal to the 30+ dollar brushes as the bristles are a bit rough.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it so much he asked me to get him another as his old one was showing wear.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Buy this nice inexpensive brush which works just the same and hold on to the rest of your money.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping to get better use out of The old school stuff when it arrives.</li>
            <li> Worth the price though.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is true that it smells a bit funky at first (its fresh animal hair)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the $13.</li>
            <li> The brush has a wooden handle that fits your fingers nicely.</li>
            <li> Got my husbands birthday gift early :-)))</li>
            <li> Since I have nothing to compare this brush to I cannot give it 5 stars, but so far it is doing OK.</li>
            <li> It creates abundant latter with just a couple of swirls in the soap.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this should be used only if you&#x27;re trying to decide whether to switch from a foam (e.g. Gilette) to a brush, as I was.</li>
            <li> at a much more modest price.  </li>
            <li> The purists would rather use a bowl to work up a lather, but in my opinion its quicker and feels a helluva lot better when one works up the lather directly on the stubble.</li>
            <li> Found out about shaving this way from a friend could not say enough good things to say about shaving with straight edge.</li>
            <li> In the early going, of this brush produced way too many in the sink.</li>
            <li> The brush works up a good lather and there has been minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Some stray hair will come out of the brush, but after about two weeks of use, I rarely see that anymore.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up far better than I could have hoped for given the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This Escali brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> did just what I needed it to do, and I feel like I got my $&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> but it made my soap look kind of gross.</li>
            <li> Dont know if shaving would be as fun without it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it would work as well with the old fashion soap-in-a-can type.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of brush will last.  </li>
            <li> There were several options available and i am glad that I purchased your brush.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use to use shaving cream out of a can, but this is far and away much better.</li>
            <li> As a reference point when I say that, I started shaving in the 1960s and experienced the horrors of the old Gillette Blue Blades.</li>
            <li> I went from a switched from a multi-blade with shave gel to this Escali Badger brush, safety razor, and nice quality shave soap and will never go back again.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller than some I&#x27;ve seen but still fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a nice product that not only holds up well with constant use, but one that looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> Price ok but expected more.  </li>
            <li> have no complaints at all, the Badger is well worth the money</li>
            <li> It was on my brother-in-law&#x27;s wish list, and he thought it was a nice present.</li>
            <li> This will extend the useful life of the brush, and help prevent premature shedding/rotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying my escali brush.</li>
            <li> It produces much more foam with my inexpensive soap than the old one &amp; when I used it with shaving lotion, it helped give me the smoothest shave I can remember.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> While not as soft as I would personally like, but it works great when I shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li> The Omega does not knot and it rarely sheds brush hair.</li>
            <li> The price for this type of brush is amazingly economical.</li>
            <li> It has a nice combination of softness and roughness at the same time.</li>
            <li> I thought ok maybe this is just normal for the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> he said he was thrilled with the quality, especially considering what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the smell, even if it lingered longer.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is a nice touch, but the brush does shed some bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the wooden handle and this brush feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the brush but really thought that a badger hair brush would not shed as much as this one -</li>
            <li> , I cleaned the brush with shampoo and conditioner and then made a baking soda paste, thoroughly worked this paste into the brush, let it sit overnight, and finally proceeded with several cleaning cycles of warm water and shaving soap and again with warm water and shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Have a distinct smell, which might not bother others but it does bother me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Soft, affordable, functional, stylish.</li>
            <li> Feels much better than my old cheapo</li>
            <li> Works well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> really worth the hassle to return/replace, and it is functional, but I will not be buying another.</li>
            <li> I also got him Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream in grapefruit, his favorite scent, and it&#x27;s just a fun gift he would never have bought himself.</li>
            <li> Economical brush for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> for about twice the cost of this brush, you can buy one that&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it was worth the money</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s got a nice wood handle and the bristles are rock solid in it.  </li>
            <li> This brush is incredibly soft, creates a great lather, and it&#x27;s become a part of my daily shaving ritual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth recommending a BUY on this one, as it does the job of a $100 brush and is well built.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased a Van Der Hagen badger at Traget for $20 and it seems better so far.  </li>
            <li> Still worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li> it is a snap by simply running it under some warm water for a moment or two.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, in terms of bristles and although a strand or two of badger hair comes out periodically, it&#x27;s not enough to affect the quality of the shave or application of lather.</li>
            <li> or they just have more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and wooden.  </li>
            <li> and was not disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Also, the brush had a musty animal smell which went away as it absorbed the scent of my shave soap.</li>
            <li> and if you could afford to buy it, it is worth it</li>
            <li> Good brush for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Easy maintenance and care and creates a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice, it feels nice, but chiefly it applies thick and even coats off shaving cream with ease.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a shaving brush like this to anyone who really wants to get back to getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> Some things to note on keeping this product in good condition:    1) Do not let water leak into the handle  2) Do not be overly rough with it  </li>
            <li> This is my intro into wet shaving and badger hair holds more water and is denser than boar hair - it is just technically better for this purpose at any grade.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this help some of you guys who look for a good wet shaving brush</li>
            <li> Still it does the job of serving as a useful implement in shaving.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old boar brush, but has a tendency to matte together with vigorous lathering in the cup and on your face.  </li>
            <li> On first use, it smelled remarkably like a wet badger.</li>
            <li> but i definitely like wet shaving and this product has been perfect!</li>
            <li> But well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the second kind.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good beginner brush which is what I was with this brush for a wet safety shave.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing that compares to a warm shave in the morning starting of with this brush.</li>
            <li> but well worth the price from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it all.</li>
            <li> I can comment the brush is soft and seems elegant.</li>
            <li> Sure fixed my problem</li>
            <li> It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> Over a year has passed and, while I don&#x27;t straight shave very often any more, I use this brush ever time I shave.    </li>
            <li> I also noticed the distinct \\&quot;animal\\&quot; smell</li>
            <li> The smell has mostly wore off and is a bit more noticable when wet.</li>
            <li> The Semogue and Vie-Long are far superior for only a couple of dollars more, so I would recommend spending a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li> This brush is not bad for the money, my wife uses this brush to shave her legs and its held out pretty well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just a bit smelly at first.</li>
            <li> Makes a very nice, thick lather, quick!</li>
            <li> High quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A very nice little badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Very nice brush with little shedding.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash it to get all the loose strands out first, I&#x27;m sure this is pretty normal for most brushes though.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong that I was more interested in reducing it rather than thinking about its use later.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels good, great cheap brush but the hair did start to fall out little by little after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is kind of coarse at first but softens up quickly.</li>
            <li> Having never owned a shaving brush before, I thought that perhaps the smell was normal for a new brush and would go away, but after talking with friends that shave with a badger brush they assured me that they had never noticed any smell in their own brushes.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews I read before ordering it were very positive</li>
            <li> I am saving up for a new, higher quality one, since I am not fully satisfied with this one</li>
            <li> Initially, I&#x27;d recommend using a strong scented soap as the natural smell of wet hair isn&#x27;t great, and easily overpowers light scented soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good brush, small and easy to use but hopefully for others it&#x27;s just my brush that has that problem.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on this much cheaper version, and like many of the other ratings before me, found it to be an amazing deal for the money.</li>
            <li> It is nice and soft and produces a rich lather when I mix up my Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> I have an older shaving brush that require replacement , So what better replacement that a 100% pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is of great quality and makes me wonder how they sell the other ones for so much money.</li>
            <li> The brush seems well made, has a decent heft to it, and does the job fine.</li>
            <li> and it has held up great and much softer on the skin than my other one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s normal, they seem to come out easily.</li>
            <li> If it were my main brush, I&#x27;d would not enjoy shaving as much, but on the road it is perfectly acceptable, temporary solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> My overall impression is smooth, I get a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Having used several other brushes at this point, I can say this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment!  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and was exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> Even a mild shave cream or soap will cover the smell for the first couple of uses till it goes away.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my brother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some comments about how these brushes can smell out of the box, and yes, this one had a mild scent to it out of the packaging, however after the first use it was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just know that if you buy this, and you really fall in love with DE shaving, you will almost certainly be purchasing a brush of higher quality construction and material within a year.</li>
            <li> Better than using my hands to get my face wet and able to cover more area in less time, overall I am happy with this brush..</li>
            <li> If you are like me and appreciate a great value for a badger bristle shaving brush that feels as good, works as well, and lasts as long as its more expensive cousins, then this may be the brush for you.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and appreciate a great value for a badger bristle shaving brush that feels as good, works as well, and lasts as long as its more expensive cousins, then this may be the brush for you.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good considering the price, but altogether not a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Our son is 16 and shaves regularly as he is part of the JROTC program at school, so he has to have a pretty good shave on inspection days in particular!</li>
            <li> the fact that silvertip tends to be the most expensive, that does not mean it is the best for everyone.</li>
            <li> so I was able to clean it  properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - it&#x27;s a good price for a decent brush, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li> , the brush feels great, very soft after a few uses, and it definitely makes shaving more enjoyable, rather than &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a boar hair brush for years and liked it just fine, but since I was getting a new double edge razor</li>
            <li> Great little badger brush, really improved my shave!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product, the price,  and the company in general!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t lost too many bristles and looks like it will last for a good long time</li>
            <li> Good, like any other brush he had before.</li>
            <li> Good money spent!</li>
            <li> Its packaging was good, having arrived in a box with other items.  </li>
            <li> If you do enjoy wet shaving, then you&#x27;ll have a nice first brush to continue.</li>
            <li> This brush makes a rich and frothy lather and really gets under my stubble in order to bring the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> Dries very well and keeps the original softness.</li>
            <li> The brush holds enough lather that after I have hot ragged my face I can dip the brush in the hot water, shake it out and will still have enough warm lather for my first save, probably for both shaves, good lather, hot water, sharp razors, and a good brush</li>
            <li> Much softer than my original brush from another company (it may have been a boar hair brush).</li>
            <li> It has a good price point but the distinction between boar or badger is not evident with this brush at this time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel due to its compact size and good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush, and have had this for about 6 weeks so far and love it!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a better or should I say the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; shaving brush ever.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced with a nice wooden handle which fits well with brush holders.</li>
            <li> Not up to the standards of my Art of Shaving brush (which has more badger fur and feels more robust) but far better than my previous cheapo brush.  </li>
            <li> been using same bursh long time.and quality very good.</li>
            <li> Will def upgrade to a better brush later down the road, but for the price, it is a great starter brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is made right and holds up to the job.</li>
            <li> Just the right stiffness without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> The escali badger brush is 100% functional and the price is right.</li>
            <li> No pain of course, it is just that signal you are doing things right.</li>
            <li> That is right-</li>
            <li> Maybe I caught everything at the right time.</li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> It whips the soap up sudsie &amp; applies soap to the face just right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not whispery-soft right out of the box.    </li>
            <li> Right size and weight.</li>
            <li> Absorbs the right amount of shave soap.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to not go out right away and buy a $70</li>
            <li> + brush right away</li>
            <li> The delivery was right on time</li>
            <li> The bristles are pliable and smell-free right from the start</li>
            <li> I think that they set the right price.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Its been 13 hours since I shaved, and the thought of putting this against my face right now is making me cringe.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try face lathering right from the start since a)</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> The size is just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the functionality is there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brand name being right there,</li>
            <li> Bristles are just right firmness for what I would expect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> need 5 things to do it right, and this is my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hang it up right below my bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> It was priced right and the vendor shipped it promptly.</li>
            <li> It has a horrid smell right out of the box.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re hear for, right?</li>
            <li> Amazon was right.</li>
            <li> and I was right, as it did happen.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> Used with the right cream it whips up a wicked lather.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but its just a bit off.</li>
            <li> Leathers it up just right.</li>
            <li> The way it felt in my had felt oddly right, like it was ment to be there.  </li>
            <li> so you can just pull the lather soap right off and</li>
            <li> It is just the right weight for agility and control.</li>
            <li> , it was the right move.</li>
            <li> The price was right for me, being a beginner.</li>
            <li> it can in right on time.</li>
            <li> When you get the brush take it out of the package, put it in your right and, stick</li>
            <li> It arrived right when it was supposed to</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> and I noticed right away that when rinsing it after shaving, the rinse water was brown colored.  </li>
            <li> but the price is right.</li>
            <li> Works well, priced right.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality and bristles dry soft not stiff.</li>
            <li> does feel a bit lacking in keeping the bristles in a good formation, but that issue is very minimal.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit for the new brush smell to leave, but it&#x27;s a very worthy brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> Makes my new shave soap easy to use.</li>
            <li> From other reviews I have high hopes for this brush and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> A few bristles drop off at first, but then it becomes great.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell how it holds up long term, but so far it seems great.</li>
            <li> A few of the hairs came out with the first use, but since then, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great value, and after losing a few hairs at first, it performs well.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap and really gets the lather going.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but again, I don&#x27;t know if that is normal for a real badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> First time using it was great, lost a few hairs</li>
            <li> It does shed a bit during the first few uses, but lathers and holds soaps great.</li>
            <li> It holds water great and creates a thick lather, and shipping was also fast and easy.</li>
            <li> We got this product super quickly, and it was perfect - a product of a small company, not a big faceless corporation.</li>
            <li> It really helps to clean up your skin, as well as lift and soften your hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush with badger bristles and it is far softer and lathers better than the boar variety (VDH).</li>
            <li> At first, it looses a good bit of hairs, which is really to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Soft out of the box, I used some shampoo with conditioner to soften it even more before first use.</li>
            <li> As someone who has experienced unannounced months-long back orders and excuses from some shops, I appreciate being left alone but for polite updates letting me know that my item is in the mail, and quickly, too.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like I probably lost more bristles out of this brush in the first three weeks than I did in about eight months with my old brush.</li>
            <li> This Escali brush smells like they didn&#x27;t bother to de-musk or clean the hair, and it is really off-putting.  </li>
            <li> I think for the money its not a bad brush, but I will spend more next time.</li>
            <li> i found that the middle part gets tangled up and the soap doesn&#x27;t rinse out of that very easily</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and easy to lather up.</li>
            <li> It has an easy grip handle and it very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and pliable and spread the shaving cream evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy on face.</li>
            <li> And when you finish with it and have rinsed it, it&#x27;s very easy to get it back to</li>
            <li> you must be sure you rinse, then flick the water out -- then be sure it is stored bristles down.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s pretty fast!!</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I think it&#x27;s important for me to admit that my original review of this brush was only three stars.  </li>
            <li> This was my first brush, and I can&#x27;t imagine what more could be offered by other brushes that cost twice as much or more.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect, soft but not too soft, just stiff enough for a good lather and they don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced few loose bristles and it has a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is not the softest of brushes but for half the price of the apothecary near me and for being a first time straight edge shaver, this product got the job done at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smoothly and high quality</li>
            <li> High quality, wish a brush of this quality was available at my drug store</li>
            <li> The silvertip brush is softer and carries a bigger load, but if your objective is to create a creamy thick lather for a good shave, well, it loads well with water and lathers with the best of them...</li>
            <li> It feels much softer than synthetic and and lathers nicely, one difference I notice with the badger hair than the synthetic is it absorbs water MUCH more, so you really gotta soak it to get the soap wet.</li>
            <li> It only cost me like $2.25 to fix it and its as good as new.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed a very satisfactory experience using Perella&#x27;s - Amazon market place to purchase a new shaving brush and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ruin your face with synthetic brushes, this is the real deal right here!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now, and it whips up a great lather, but more importantly, after the initial week or so of minor shedding, it hasn&#x27;t lost more than a hair</li>
            <li> Lifts the hairs for a great shave prep, and all using very little shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> very little hair falling out, and a great feel.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush with very little shedding.</li>
            <li> the brush works great and very little shedding .</li>
            <li> Seemed like the guy there was able to work up a much better lather than I can with less shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that there are less bristles that fall out initially and the handle fits perfectly into a shave caddy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about shaving brushes, but saw this one had great reviews on Amazon and was much less than some of the others.</li>
            <li> It holds water very well, builds lather easily, and behaves much like a brush 2-3 times the cost.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a MINOR issue, soft and very nice.  </li>
            <li> Holds a good amount of water, lathers very well, rinses easily and after rinsing give is a shake or two and the brush is left barely damp.</li>
            <li> The new one seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> great item, does not shed like some I have used in the past .</li>
            <li> When it came and he tried it, he was full of thanks to me and promptly asked me to get him another one, which I did.</li>
            <li> This is the third shaving brush I&#x27;ve bought in the last year or so, and it is by far the best of the three.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the past couple of years and they&#x27;ve been great.  </li>
            <li> Happily, 10 shaves into its use, no more hairs came out.  </li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; brushes on good - but just used for 2nd time - and the same as the 1st time - the hairs keep falling out &amp; sticking on my face and in the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> From such amazing reviews, I expected an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> He really enjoys it along with the stand I bought to hold the brush and razor, and now his face is extra smooth :)</li>
            <li> Not too happy with the bristles falling out and small bristles sticking out the side.  </li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Nowhere is this more apparent than in the growing popularity of the barbershop cult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This badger brush is everything I expected it to be, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush I noticed a distinct animal smell.</li>
            <li> All in all I would recommend it to other people but only because its the best of only a handful of brushes I have used mostly purchased from drug stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush that does the job and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and I would say the quality to cost of the brush make it well worth it.</li>
            <li> , it did shed a bit for the first week or so, but after about 6 weeks it rarely throws a bristle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to sand the end completely bare and coat the wood with some spar varnish or appropriate coating.  </li>
            <li> I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall satisfied with the quality for the price--and definitely after looking at the price of others, will likely buy this kind again.</li>
            <li> Good value for your average guy.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty good upgrade, although I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes besides these two.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advice in other reviews and washed the brush before he used it the first time (I used shampoo and conditioner) and it softened it up a fair bit.</li>
            <li> Probably not bad for someone who wants to try it or for a travel brush.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how one 100% pure badger shaving brush can sell for $12.95 and another 100% pure badger shaving brush goes for $175!!  </li>
            <li> The Escali brush is great, very reasonably priced, quality Badger hair, which is always stiff before warming up in hot water.  </li>
            <li> This brush certainly gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> quick fast and right on time</li>
            <li> Good care meaning drying upside down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that you really NEED to clean it before your first use or you will do as I did and smear badger smell all over your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first badger brush I bought him lasted a good number of years but finally fell prey to a new puppy.  </li>
            <li> This brush is so much better than a synthetic bristle type, and the bristles are soft, while the brush holds a large amount of lather.</li>
            <li> Has a little bit too much shedding at start, but works great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you spend a little more money and get something better.</li>
            <li> Better brush for just a little more $$.</li>
            <li> Or splurge a little extra money and buy a best badger quality brush.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, spend a little more for a better quality brush.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a little more backbone than my silvertipe badger, so I use it mostly with my cella</li>
            <li> with most of the other users, I have lost my fair share of bristles; more during the first few uses than after.</li>
            <li> Bristles come out a little easier than I care for but overall, this is a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> Order was fulfilled quickly and the brush is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very few of the Badger hairs fall out, and the comfort is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this one to hold out for long, but I enjoy the ease of lathering up with a brush, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll do more research next time and purchase</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have ever bought or used a brush like this, so I&#x27;m a bit green and don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but so far I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Great Brush at an outstanding price - only lost a few bristles the first couple times used.  </li>
            <li> My bro said it was soft and that he had a hard time finding one and was impressed.</li>
            <li> I am no expert - I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes for I have used no others - but it works up a nice lather, quickly.    </li>
            <li> Says that it makes shaving more pleasant and even a little fun, which is saying a lot, coming from a teen.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s an economical choice in comparison with many other brushes available on Amazon, however, don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking it lacks in quality...  </li>
            <li> Coupled with my new double-edge razor and shaving cream, I now get a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a new one free of charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and still looks new, even over a year after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> That first brush started losing hair right away, and then it started losing LOTS of hair.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll never regret buying this Escali pure badger shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush and I&#x27;d definately say it is softer right out of the box than ANY boar hair bursh i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I would certainly do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li> I purchased an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, and what a difference!  </li>
            <li> First time safety razor user and this one started me off right.  </li>
            <li> I did not drop the brush as it is kept in a nice holder\stand to dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide any scrubbing action to lift your whiskers because the hairs part too easily once it touches your face.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is more effort then just using a can of shaving cream, but I find the extra effort is well worth</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and lathers easily.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not shed much.</li>
            <li> The smell has mostly dissipated, I haven&#x27;t noticed it shedding lately, and the bristles are nice and fluffed out</li>
            <li> the less it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Great texture--not too soft, not too rough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks - so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have ordered; you might be asking why in the great land of shaved faces is this guy giving it five stars if this is the second one he is ordering.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily and has so far maintained its shape while drying with the stand.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping and the product arrived just like advertised.</li>
            <li> It creates a different lather (more velvety) and feels like rubbing up against a freshly clubbed baby seal.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and rivals the more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> Shave a bit more and repeat to rub against a dry clean towel.</li>
            <li> and he said he didn&#x27;t really notice anything but a mild smell that didn&#x27;t bother him at all</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, don&#x27;t care too much for the hairs tend to come off the brush during initial couple of uses</li>
            <li> Spend a few bucks more and get something more reliable.</li>
            <li> Brush looks nice, arrived fast and was priced low.  </li>
            <li> It becomes much softer after probably 3-5 shaves and you quickly forget that it was ever prickly.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to lather up, soft bristles</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to shave with an old &amp;#34; vintage&amp;#34; shaving brush, bowl and razor method.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it is so soft and works very well at spreading shaving soap on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several very different shaving brushes, this one is great for the price.</li>
            <li> it has soft bristles and easy to use.</li>
            <li> As described it is easy to use and so far ibhave not had any issues with the bristles falling out</li>
            <li> I know this will end after more use, but a brush should not lose more than a few a shave.</li>
            <li> Really quality badger brush, soft and supple, durable build, makes for a lovely lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly soft, lathers well, is easy to grip, and, well, that&#x27;s what a shaving brush should do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the old brush, but he says the denser bristles coat the shaving soap better on his face for a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving brush that not only whips up the shaving lather but also deep cleans your skin pores.</li>
            <li> Easily and quickly creates a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped quickly and the item arrived very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Definitely seems to be a great starting point for someone looking to try a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li> The way it magically turned the shaving soap into a nice thick lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will stop after a few more shaves.</li>
            <li> Just a great as the more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> When it dries it is still soft, cleans easy.</li>
            <li> Not the best badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used, a bit coarse and uneven.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hanging it to dry using the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li> I really thought I got a defective product, but since I liked the Escali I decided to give it another try next time</li>
            <li> If you want a real firm bristle brush, then this isn&#x27;t it, but for someone like myself who prefers a soft bristle, this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The wood is nicely finished and I have had minimal loss of bristles after over a month&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li> This came out as a clear winner, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came quick and fast.</li>
            <li> I decided to move from a Mach 3 razor that I&#x27;ve used the last 7-8 years over to a safety razor after constantly hearing how great it was.  </li>
            <li> What really got the smell out quick was proraso.</li>
            <li> The softest, purest badger hair is clearly on display and every morning it helps turn my shaving routine into an exciting activity that I enjoy instead of dread.</li>
            <li> At the Amazon price it&#x27;s a great buy for someone who is wanting to try using brush/soap for shaving or, as in my situation, needs one at a second location for occasional use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, and on top of everything, it just looks classy.</li>
            <li> With proper care it will last you quite some time, all while giving you a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft and odor free.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pleasure to use; small and very effective.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen a single bristle come out, which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush worked just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;Great first badger shaving brush!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaving brush to anyone who would like to have a comforanle clean shave.</li>
            <li> Good price point compared to other pure badger brushes.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic so far!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because it was worth every penny and more this is my second brush but first Badger hair</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first thinking it would be to rough for my face, but it&#x27;s extremely soft and whips up a great lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for the price, it&#x27;s nice, especially if it&#x27;s your first brush or need a spare travel to not worry to much about if you lose it.</li>
            <li> Only shed a couple of hairs in the first few uses, afterwards it&#x27;s been perfect.  </li>
            <li> Clearly an entry level brush - you may be interested in looking for a better one once you really start shaving.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, unbelievable price from the research I did online, and overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It will make your shave cream last longer - generates a great lather from a small amount of your favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Nice lather, comfortable (no pricking me with stiff whiskers).  </li>
            <li> This was my first brush because the price was right, and I know that badger is higher quality than boar hair.</li>
            <li> The experience of applying shave cream with this brush did not feel &#x27;right,&#x27; and I can&#x27;t expect this brush to last more than a</li>
            <li> Makes a nice crema and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Excellent brush, I highly recommend it, as long as you take care of it and hang dry it</li>
            <li> Tight, wears well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Not the softest of brushes, but get the job done at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Of course, very fast shipping as fulfillment is by Amazon.    </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> brush is a quality product, a pleasure to use, and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The brush is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you who have experience with brushes, you&#x27;ll find that the wooden handle is very light.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush comes in at a very reasonable price and has performed well for me.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very fast as well.</li>
            <li> The hairs feel very smooth against my skin and have not come dislodged after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It is very much like the one I remember.</li>
            <li> had a very fast turnaround in shipping, and I received it sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> For those complaining about losing hairs, all brushes lose hair upon first use, my Kent BK8 which many would consider a top of the line brush shed hair the first few weeks, these brushes have literally thousands of badger hairs of course they will shed in the beginning.    </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it very much...</li>
            <li> It was shipped very fast</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was also very fast</li>
            <li> I ordered my shaving brush from Perellas Marketplace on Amazon and their service in shipping my product was very fast.</li>
            <li> Overall it has been a very nice brush, but its the only one I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> it was very very musky</li>
            <li> This shaving brush broke in very fast.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to friends as a good beginner brush if they&#x27;re new to shaving with traditional shave soaps and razor or straight edge.</li>
            <li> this brush is soft, full, appropriately stiff and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li> when comparing it to other high priced brushes, this was said to be on par with the best quality ones, and, while i don&#x27;t have extensive experience with them, can say that this was a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No issues so far, held up just fine.</li>
            <li> This brush picked up more soap in less time, held it better and lathered up much faster.  </li>
            <li> If you like really soft shaving brushes and don&#x27;t mind the shedding, it will do you fine.</li>
            <li> Compared to other badger brushes, I think this is a great bargain, considering the ease of use, and modest price.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to really scrub my head in a gentle way lifting the hairs in a rich lather.</li>
            <li> Fine for use with a mug or direct application to face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and works fine.</li>
            <li> I have used the brush with Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood shaving cream for two weeks now (every other day) and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my new shave experience with this brush and the new cream.  </li>
            <li> This brush really aerates the cream and makes a full and rich lather that lubricates and protects my sensitive face and neck.</li>
            <li> A few hairs came out the first time I used it, but after that it creates a nice, rich lather and helps to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> Good little brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good little travel brush.  </li>
            <li> The quality was good though expect it to shed a little when beginning use.</li>
            <li> a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good little brush.</li>
            <li> The N-ice one is also good but a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> For the price it good, it sheds a little</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving, after many, many years of buying cream in a can and shaving with whatever the latest fad multiple blade shaver is out</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try my new brush along with Razor and all the bells and whistle&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Brush works very well, it was cheap but of a decent quality.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this brush to clean my weapons (in the army) and couldn&#x27;t find a cheap one overseas.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would have an odor, and the brush is made well enough where it dries fairly quick and stores easily.</li>
            <li> Decent, but not as comfortable to use as the much cheaper boar brush it replaced.</li>
            <li> Soft, very durable, cleans up easily, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This brush has not disappointed and I would definitely recommend for the beginner or experienced wet shaver!!</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of an odor at first, but the construction seems good</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush, although it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> I prefer boar hair over badger, but this little brush is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The cup is no winner for looks but it works great and being made of maid of hard rubber</li>
            <li> The brush has a dense, thick head of soft fine bristles that produces a great lather.</li>
            <li> Still using this product after several year from purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat pure badger for a good old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how this kind of product receives such a high mark.</li>
            <li> It is a little more coarse than I thought it would be, but it does the job well and is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference compared to my old boars head brush.</li>
            <li> As far as shaving goes, using a shaving brush is a huge upgrade from whatever aerosol gel you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush.</li>
            <li> It did have a funky smell at first</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up pretty well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> Recently, I have considered purchasing a badger brush because I heard it was better than using my hands to apply shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I soak the bristles in a cup of hot water while I shower and then lather and shave when I get out.</li>
            <li> It does lather pretty well however.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 6 months and it keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li> I may upgrade to one of the higher end</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his first brush of</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time at home to see what type of lather it would produce and to my surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a second Escali badger shaving brush for travel and may buy one or two more as replacements for when I wear these out.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally decided to shave like a man with a brush.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve used so far is a boar hair brush and some cheap soaps.</li>
            <li> I would say you get what you pay for, but there are brushes of better quality for around the same price.</li>
            <li> Oh, on the plus side, it holds lather pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first badger brush, so take my comments with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than my last two boar brushes.</li>
            <li> He really enjoys it!</li>
            <li> The brush did not smell until you first dip into water.  </li>
            <li> but after the initial use, I haven&#x27;t had any more come out.</li>
            <li> My Semogue brush hasn&#x27;t shed any hair since the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> There was maybe 2-3hairs lost in the first day when I was washing it, but haven&#x27;t shed since.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it came pretty well put together.</li>
            <li> Lost quite a few bristles in the beginning, but it&#x27;s worn in pretty well, and I tend to get pretty good lather out of it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pig&#x27;s ear was OK, but the feel wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But I docked it one star because it does seem to lose more hairs than my last brush.</li>
            <li> My first brush.</li>
            <li> my last brush worked for many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since his last one had lost too many bristles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you need - a quality badger brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first endeavor into DE shaving.</li>
            <li> sure you shampoo it several times when you first get it to get rid of any lingering scents.</li>
            <li> First use had a bunch of hairs come out</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it first time water turned brown and it has lost a lot of bristles.</li>
            <li> After that, look to upgrade to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> A tad bit prickly at first,</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as his first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It works well....was not &amp;#34;pinchy&amp;#34; on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Saved a ton of money on a badger brush thanks to this Escali!</li>
            <li> I used a boar hair brush before this one which was a much more bristly and coarse shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> you could get a lather that was closer to those hot shave machines they use at barber shops.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Retains water well be sure to drain some before starting a lather</li>
            <li> Brush hairs consistently fall out.</li>
            <li> is higher, and &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; is higher still.  </li>
            <li> and it feels smooth and soft across my face.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well -</li>
            <li> Brush is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Here is the story, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> The brush does shed for the first 5-10 uses and after that maybe a bristle comes out every so often.  </li>
            <li> The quality of bristles appears to be the same as brushes that go for more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li> This is my first dive into the world of safety razor shaving</li>
            <li> I did notice that it lost a couple of hairs in the first week.</li>
            <li> Hi, first time owner of a badger brush here.  </li>
            <li> I talked to a friend and he said that all badger brushes have that odor at first</li>
            <li> It works for starters but I will try a better brand next time.</li>
            <li> Have gifted the same.</li>
            <li> Using the Escali shaving brush (and a safety razor with shaving soap) has really, really helped!</li>
            <li> Even so, I like it ok, and it will probably last a couple years (at most).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (really guys - can you lay off the toxic formaldehyde?!)  </li>
            <li> It works  consistently and shows no signs of wear at all.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase another one as a backup, but my first one shows no signs of giving up any time soon.  </li>
            <li> My first brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving brush that I have used.</li>
            <li> it works really well!</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I recommend dipping this in hot water for a minute or longer to soften it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and elegant looking.</li>
            <li> and it still works like the first time.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare this brush to, but it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Upon first use, I dipped a dampened brush into my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and there was still enough lather/foam on the brush to shave 2 more passes.  </li>
            <li> So I thought, maybe this is just a \\&quot;first use\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li> After some hairs that slipped out its been holding pretty well.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that you have to prep this before first use.  </li>
            <li> Looks good, but the first few uses</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and for the money</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> No weird smells like some people have noted.</li>
            <li> par.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed some sort of brown residue out when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the next item on his list!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as part of a shaving gift package for my brother (he loves straight blade shaving!)</li>
            <li> Using a brush, you can get more use from a smaller amount of soap/</li>
            <li> Badger hair brushes are not cheap, but the price of the ESCALI takes the financial pain out of owning a good quality shaving brush.ite pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> It only shed 1 hair but that&#x27;s a much better count than this one has going for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered more brushes the second time</li>
            <li> I recommend for first time safety blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> I lost around 5-6 the first time.</li>
            <li> I washed it before using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The logical explanation is that when the badger&#x27;s family discovered he was selling his hair they urinated on him in disgust.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with shaving with a brush</li>
            <li> For the first couple of uses it smells like cat farts and hair falls off.</li>
            <li> I have now ordered two of the Escali Shaving Brushes, not because the product was defective, but because my first fell out of my bag while traveling.</li>
            <li> Also, I would recommend making lather once before you use it on your face, as the first lather was a bit...gamey.</li>
            <li> I soak the brush in hot water in my bowl for about 2 minutes while I brush my hair, etc.</li>
            <li> but you can get more boar for the same price)  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, so I&#x27;m not by any means an authority.</li>
            <li> Given as gift to son who reports it is a exactly the type of brush he was looking for.  </li>
            <li> After trying many different products I have settled on the Escali badger hair shave brush and Colonel Conks Bay rum soap.</li>
            <li> She caresses your face like it&#x27;s her first time all over again.</li>
            <li> i first used it</li>
            <li> I felt satisfied with the feel and the back bone</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first shaving brush a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> Overall I am fairly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> After my first brush (which came with the Van Der Hagen starter kit) stared falling apart</li>
            <li> This brush lathers up much better than my last brush, and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wear.</li>
            <li> , it was exactly what I ordered, and attention to detail was demonstrated.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> my face thanks you!</li>
            <li> Cream lather was better on the Parker, this Escali is not that great of quality, it did ok as far as spreading the cream and getting the shave done overall, but not great quality.</li>
            <li> I knew that this budget Escali shaving brush wasn&#x27;t going to compete with the more expensive models out there; however, it fit  well with my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand and what it&#x27;s made to do it</li>
            <li> then I see no reason to spend $30 - $100 (or more) unless this brush falls apart in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> First time using a shaving brush was this Escali.</li>
            <li> Also, since first use the brush was releasing hairs as a spread the shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> The first couple of uses caused some of the bristles to come out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This has gotten better with use; now I only notice this once in a while.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush/safety razor Ive ever used so</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> No shedding, no weird smells.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> the first 2-3 shaves with it.</li>
            <li> I suppose that may be the trade off from the higher end brushes</li>
            <li> Brush arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;higher end\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first two or three uses</li>
            <li> Technique: I fill a coffee cup with hot water and place the badger hair brush in it while I shower.  </li>
            <li> I may be inclined to score this brush higher</li>
            <li> I have two boar brushes and wanted to try a badger brush after reading multiple reviews and understanding badger bristles are better than boar.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend on his birthday and it was definitely one of his favorite gifts.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush and what a difference a real brush makes!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It shed a 5-10 hairs per shave for the first 3-5 times I used it.</li>
            <li> Brush, Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Most of my Brushes and shaving soap came from the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> I am sure there are more expensive and technically better</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Maybe two or three hairs will fall out every time after the first use.  </li>
            <li> First shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable, and the bristles holding their shape well so far.  </li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations, these fellows are the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; what they advertise is what you get!  </li>
            <li> If I could go back in time I would of invested more money into a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first one at a neighborhood drug store.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li> Well&lt;br /&gt;-I have had some hairs coming out with use, but its my first brush.  </li>
            <li> An OK starting brush.</li>
            <li> but none after the first shave or two.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Recommends to anyone interested in their products.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because it seemed brittle.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely buy another one for travel.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot of hairs at first</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many others my brush sheds bristles but only 1-3 per shave--this is subpar but tolerable.</li>
            <li> soap, the lather was mediocre at best and did not transfer to my face well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it; the bristles caused some irritation.  </li>
            <li> First brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a $10 brush, and at first examination is of quality build</li>
            <li> This brush looses some whiskers the first couple of times you use it</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to substantially reduce the amount of cream that I use per shave - maybe a third or quarter of what I used to apply by hand.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> First purchase that lead me to leave a review.</li>
            <li> : the first couple shaves</li>
            <li> When lathering my face for a shave, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; badger brush.  </li>
            <li> I think I had a camel&#x27;s hair brush last time but this Badger Hair brush outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It is an OK shaving brush, but it is already starting to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> It smells like a bager ;)</li>
            <li> I would give this item a higher rating if the smell could be removed before delivery.  </li>
            <li> My first Badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Expect some shedding for the first half-dozen times you use it.  </li>
            <li> ...........if you dislike the badger on this brush you can replace the knot with a silvertip for most times cheaper than buying the entire brush with handle.  </li>
            <li> This is really the symbol of quality in shaving brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this brush the first time I used it was the smell.  </li>
            <li> next thing I noticed was how many hairs were falling out as I tried to whip up a lather with my proraso soap.  </li>
            <li> Soak in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> hairs will fall out during the first 1 month of use, then one hair will fall out every 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> I will update this later as I break it in more.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush it shed bristles.  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I purchased when I started wetshaving.</li>
            <li> Next comes \\&quot;best badger,\\&quot; and the most expensive one is \\&quot;silvertip badger.\\</li>
            <li> Next comes \\&quot;best badger,\\&quot; and the most expensive one is \\&quot;silvertip badger.\\</li>
            <li> It stunk a bit the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Also some bristle fell out for the first five shaves or so, but that has subsided.</li>
            <li> Using this brush for the first time</li>
            <li> Its the first time I&#x27;ve shaved with a brush and shave soap</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I would want it to.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li> The bristles are ok, just not enough of them.</li>
            <li> Smelled like horse hair when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as my travel brush and am pleased overall.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The lower price point compared to some other badger brushes makes it even better!</li>
            <li> The concern people to have about buying inexpensive shaving brushes seems to be that they will shed hair, so let me address that first.</li>
            <li> This brush lost maybe 3 hairs in the first two shaves, and zero after that.</li>
            <li> the first thing i noticed when i opened the box was the hairs sticking to the plastic that it was in than the hairs where falling out when i ran my hand threw it ....</li>
            <li> but take my comments with a grain of salt because this is my first experience with this type of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first badger brush I ever had, so I do not have anything to compare it</li>
            <li> I will not buy another badger brush until I am willing to spend the $$$ for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li> He says that it lathers well and feels soft and smooth against his skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> There are much better brushes for the same price.</li>
            <li> brush fell apart during first use.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#</li>
            <li> I must admit that I did not know how to care for these brushes when I bought my first brush.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!   </li>
            <li> I am not an expert as this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> Well this is my first brush ever</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, the product had a repugnant chemical smell that seemed like it was trying to cover up the stench of badger/animal.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush lost a lot of bristles on the first shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> Started losing hairs from the brush the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned cheapie boar-hair brushes before and this is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly... yes, the bristles do have an animal odor about them at first.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> The brush did shed about 12-15 bristles over the course of the first three shaves, but none since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure goes away after multiple uses.)</li>
            <li> This is the first shave brush that I have bought.  </li>
            <li> First ever shaving brush purchased for husband at Christmas.</li>
            <li> First time DE shaver.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50 or more on a brush and the Escali packs a big bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> This was my first journey into safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush</li>
            <li> It did lose hairs as well during the first couple of weeks too</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t sure why he ever left this way of shaving.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you pay for</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit prickly, at first, though it softens up a bit after extended use.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that it WILL NOT compete with a higher end brush in terms of comfort.</li>
            <li> I am buying several more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Maybe when I move to a different water district it will work better for me, but just concerning the brush I fully endorse.  </li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The break-in period shouldn&#x27;t last more than 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Most brushes last years, but we&#x27;re not optimistic about this one.</li>
            <li> The first 2 times I used it</li>
            <li> Some hairs started to pull out easily at first, but after a few uses it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, you&#x27;ll find it sheds hairs.</li>
            <li> The bristles started coming out with the first use.</li>
            <li> This brush has been working well for me, however the first time I used it</li>
            <li> At first use, a couple of bristles came off</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s probably something better out there, but this has yet to disappoint me enough to go searching for it.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The most interesting, and unexpected aspect of the badger brush is the smell of the wet badger with shaving cream on it.  </li>
            <li> this is the first shaving brush i have used</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush</li>
            <li> so this is my first experience using a brush.</li>
            <li> Since my first shave with it</li>
            <li> per shave.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; at first but is softening with use.</li>
            <li> Thank You Perellas, I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall its ok, not the softest brush out there.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> After the first application of soap, it smells of the soap.</li>
            <li> First Badger brush for shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item two weeks ago and have used it twice the first time there was a lot of hair coming off of the brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> My first brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I had an issue with the hairs coming off.</li>
            <li> My next brush will probably be a boar&#x27;s hair brush since I like a more bristly feel.</li>
            <li> After using this Escali for several shaves, these problems have mostly gone away (or perhaps I have grown used to them).</li>
            <li> It lathers ok, but doesn&#x27;t create enough for two or three passes......  </li>
            <li> This has been my first experience with safety razor shaving and this is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> Just a negligible number of bristles lost during the first uses.</li>
            <li> It first it shed some hairs, probably for the first three or four shaves but not any longer.  </li>
            <li> This first couple shaves</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first brush when I started DE shaving.</li>
            <li> He told us that the first time he used it the bristles fell out and were stuck all over his face.  </li>
            <li> This brush is my first</li>
            <li> , it does have a smell the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a higher quality brush that has secured the hairs within the handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush that i have brought.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> On the initial use, I noticed many of the hairs came out.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it the brush shed hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush and have been using it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This brush smells a bit funky at first, but it&#x27;s quality is undeniable.</li>
            <li> After its first use, a bunch of what looked like dye can out while rinsing.</li>
            <li> It smelt a bit funny the first 3-4 times I used it</li>
            <li> It is his first shaving brush</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife and I were looking for.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipment!</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush, didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this one works well.  </li>
            <li> but I found that just soaking it in hot water while I take a shower, and then the act of using the proraso made that go away in two or three shaves.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved this for the first few weeks he used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when he first took up safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> and if you are looking for something for a reasonable price this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this exact brush again, but will try another cheapo for now...</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t have many bristles left.</li>
            <li> First time user to this style of applying shave cream.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> found that it needs to be cleaned out when first received.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend soaking it in hot water in a cup, and swirl in some shave soap to cleanse the bristles before you use it the first time.</li>
            <li> Sheds some at first though.</li>
            <li> I am a first time safety razor user.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Item looks exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li> lather- and since you use hot water-</li>
            <li> a bigger brush will retain a lot more of the lather.</li>
            <li> It did smell the first time I used it like another reviewer</li>
            <li> This was my first brush purchase.</li>
            <li> At first some of the hair will dislodge and stick to your face and the soap.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no doubt you&#x27;ll get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> First brush I ever had.</li>
            <li> The brush worked well with the first two creams I purchased</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the hairs flattened out and couldn&#x27;t get any soap on the brush.  </li>
            <li> sure if this should be an entire point or not</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> It was rough out the box, but after 5-6 uses, it&#x27;s now softened up a lot and is nice to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably an Omega boar brush at some point, since they&#x27;re better quality for about the same money.</li>
            <li> The brush does exactly what is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> recommend purchasing a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> A good starter if you&#x27;re interested in trying brushes - a few hairs come out, but that seems to stop after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Also the first three uses This brush shed about twenty hair each time.</li>
            <li> My first brush.</li>
            <li> shaving brush came extra fast, and has proven to be more than worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> First one so don&#x27;t know what to compare it to</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned because some of the reviews said a lot of the hairs fell out at first use and although they did after first use, after that everything is now staying together.</li>
            <li> At first, he did not like it compared to his old (cheap) brush.  </li>
            <li> We would purchase again but maybe wash well before using the first time.  </li>
            <li> My first and my mainstay brush.&lt;br /&gt;Price is damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite the falling bristles the brush lathers up well and spreads the shaving soap pretty evenly.</li>
            <li> The badger shaving brush is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so take my review with a grain of salt</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> It was better than my Art of Shaving brush that I had, However after several uses, I began noticing the whiskers to start falling off.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I imagine this thing wouldn&#x27;t last much more than another week if I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase for a shave cream brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but it&#x27;s on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> Further more I&#x27;m still losing one or two hairs every time I make a lather (it&#x27;s been used for about 40+ shaves), which causes me to not want to use tubs/soaps and instead use creams, so</li>
            <li> This  is my first badge brush.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> (the first couple of shaves</li>
            <li> I lost a substantial amount of bristles during the first 10 uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a smell when I first used it and when I first rinsed the brush the water would run brown like there was oil on the brush.</li>
            <li> First month there has not been any bristles falling out or deformation.</li>
            <li> Even though this is the first Badger shaving brush I have purchased it has served me quite well.</li>
            <li> its the first brush ive tried..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to be back to safety razors, too</li>
            <li> With the amount excellent reviews, and the shear number of reviews, I figured I can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Brush does not whip the shaving soap as well as a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> for the first day, but</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find them again if the first one ever wears out.</li>
            <li> A real treat to use!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!  </li>
            <li> There will be others, but this is my first.</li>
            <li> - I was constantly picking bristles off my lathered face (maybe 10 bristles or more fell off)  </li>
            <li> Used this brush with my first safety razor with shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> However I would be able to deal with constantly cleaning bristle hairs out of everything if it weren&#x27;t for the chipping on the handle.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I ordered from Escali.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> The bristles began to come off on the first use.</li>
            <li> This brush would rate higher but I have two problems with it.  </li>
            <li> First, it routinely sheds bristles onto my soap and face.  </li>
            <li> If it is your first badger brush, don&#x27;t be concerned on the first use</li>
            <li> Most mornings I end up shaving in the shower with regular shaving cream and razor.</li>
            <li> The merkur ois also the ONLY razor to buy made in Germany its top of the line.</li>
            <li> exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> Got this for my birthday from my lovely wife, who just got me into old-fashioned double edged safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that most brushes come with a brush stand that is used for drying.</li>
            <li> Real lather!</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t lost many bristle after daily use and nothing shows signs of wearing.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot at first</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re not 100% on what you need you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of cash on your first brush.</li>
            <li> It sheds and is light, but is fairly soft as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Second week, it softer, creates more lather, sheds less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
            <li> First noticed it has a funky smell when applying C.O. Bigelow shave cream.  </li>
            <li> you probably shouldn&#x27;t be having kids.  ;)</li>
            <li> Whether you are looking for your first badger or just adding to your collection I would recommend this brush, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first brush with my first safety razor and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> I wish the density of the brush was higher.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time shaving with a brush, so</li>
            <li> brush lost a some hairs during the first two weeks of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Since then, none have come out, and I have used the brush several more times.  </li>
            <li> So satisfied in fact that I bought a second one to use at a cabin I have.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a safety raiser, soap dish, and brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what was described in the ad and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out on my first brush</li>
            <li> This is my first time using one of these.  </li>
            <li> Overall, pleased.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> But I guess I will invest more in a shaving brush next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first shave brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This was must first brush</li>
            <li> First, it started to shed the hairs and continued to do so for 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll still hang on to this brush, most likely turning it into my travel brush.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush I got had a funny smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also my first shaving brush, so I am in no position to claim expertise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to point out that the fever for \\&quot;manliness\\&quot; should more properly be thought of as a fever for self-reliance, integrity, and discipline, but \\&quot;The Art of Self-Reliance, Integrity, and</li>
            <li> I read that it should shred for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to purchase a shaving brush and so there are some learning curves at first.</li>
            <li> This badger brush was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strongest when the brush is used for the first time</li>
            <li> Some have said they like to let it soak with in the soap mug with hot water for a bit before using in order to soften the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Now, when this brush first arrived, it did have the smell of badger hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I soak it in hot water before using and it fattens up.  </li>
            <li> , mediocre at best at building a lather.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, having received it in February, when I first started DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I lost a couple bristles at first too but that seems to have dissipated.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Overall I feel I got more than I paid for.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Applying the shaving cream was comfortable and the bristles feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Yes it shed a bit and smelled when I first got it, but after combing it with a fine-tooth comb and using some shampoo on it, both problems were solved.  </li>
            <li> Will make sure my brother gets one for his gift, and I will probably get a second one for for my shaving bag.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a shaving brush</li>
            <li> Brush has held its shape and most of its hair after one month of daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought it along with my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> First shaving brush I bought.  </li>
            <li> There could be better brushes but not likely at this price.</li>
            <li> It seems to be holding up pretty darn</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The bristles are amazing soft, and it takes the smallest amount of shave soap/cream and spreads it so thick and even (I could never get that kind of application with just my fingers).  </li>
            <li> Disclaimer: this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Then I dunked it in hot water...........</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get all technical in my review as I think many others here have already done exceedingly well in that area.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed the first time I used it, once I rinsed the brush out</li>
            <li> First brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Although this is my first shaving brush, I have a had no issues with the product.</li>
            <li> For those who are considering moving over to a wet shaving system here is a nice tutorial link:  http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/double-edge-razor-guide-de/.</li>
            <li> Brush works well, and exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> No complaints and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to shaving, again, after many years of having just a trimmed beard.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush in about 40 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be forewarned: You WILL, consistently, get stray badger hairs on your face and hands the first 5 or 10 times you shave with this brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> And yes, I soak it in water first.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for several months now and it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll spend the money and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li> Using it the last month, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle a short breaking in period, go pay more for a company to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> mine wears out, I will most likely buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> It was enough to shave comfortably, but my face did not look like it was covered in Cool Whip.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used enough shaving brushes to comepare, but this one seems OK.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, what a difference it makes when shaving.  </li>
            <li> My wife threw out my first accidentally so I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> Quick break in, quality brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Recieved fast!</li>
            <li> The Escali shaving brush is exactly what one would expect it to be.</li>
            <li> The brush broke out/off of the handle during the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time shaving</li>
            <li> but this is my first badger brush</li>
            <li> and I had around 2 dozen bristles come out when I first went to use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is something that stops after consistent usage</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap on sensitive my skin.  </li>
            <li> Does the brush stink of badger when first used?</li>
            <li> Just soak it in hot water to assure it&#x27;s fully hydrated before using.</li>
            <li> I will do more research before buying my next one.</li>
            <li> On my quest to go old-school with my shaving I purchased this brush and love it for my daily shaving routine.</li>
            <li> maybe, the first time I used it, but that was it.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the very low price - I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the company after posting my first review.  </li>
            <li> For the first two uses, I had some string coming out, but now none of them do.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up pretty well.  </li>
            <li> My first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> However, this is my first brush</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old brush, which served me well for two years but was cheap and fell apart.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on different brushes and what they were made of... decided to purchase this brush, based on the many reviews.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job as intended; as this is the first time I used brush &amp; cream, I can&#x27;t be a more critical judge -</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not too happy so far and probably will go back to my old brushes - they don&#x27;t shed like this Escali.</li>
            <li> I tried the brush the next day to see if I could have a better experience.  </li>
            <li> First time using the brush I had hair falling out of it before I even put any shaving cream on my face with it.</li>
            <li> Some hair fell out when I first started using it, but after the break in it stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby for his first attempt at using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, it mostly does the job</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I buy my second, hopefully better, shaving brush.</li>
            <li> the first couple times I used the brush on my face, but that problem soon faded after a dozen uses or</li>
            <li> Got the brush for my husband since he recently switched to a double-edge razor and wanted a better lather.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it it was all frizzy and looked like it was used before they put it in the package.</li>
            <li> This is my first animal hair brush.  </li>
            <li> but it does exactly what I need it to reliably.</li>
            <li> He likes it a lot better than his last shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it&#x27;s exactly what is promised in the description.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a shaving brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first badger brush, I&#x27;ve never owned a boar or synthetic brush</li>
            <li> This is my first entrance to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li> The first had synthetic bristles and a plastic handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever shave brush</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This was the first shaving brush I purchased and could not be happier.  </li>
            <li> This was my first brush I purchased and</li>
            <li> At the current rate of hair loss from the brush, it will be bald in 6 more months.</li>
            <li> This is my First time using aby type of brush for shaving</li>
            <li> shelling out more next time and getting a Parker.</li>
            <li> It continually left my face sore after most uses.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is exactly what is described.  </li>
            <li> it self the first time I used it</li>
            <li> This is my first brush with the introduction to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I saw many different types of brushes including boar and bear bristles; however, I decided to settle with a badger brush after some research.</li>
            <li> Twice as much lather!</li>
            <li> After using it for several months, I purchased a more expensive best badger brush.</li>
            <li> If the shedding turns out to be more than this, I will edit my review later to say so.</li>
            <li> Smelled funny in the beginning but not now.</li>
            <li> I switched to safety razor shaving recently after 10 years of cartridge shaving and it feels SOOO much better.  </li>
            <li> Overall an OK brush, maybe time will mellow it.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and my first time using shaving cream not in a condensed can.</li>
            <li> And, even in the first use, I found that NO HAIRS fell out for the Jagger.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> That said, this is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> This is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The smell from this brush once wet with warm water was overpowering and nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair fell out first use.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush to my fiance for Christmas and on the first use</li>
            <li> Much better than the last sheving brush I used.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush when I first switched to using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> This was his first time trying shaving soap and a brush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first badger hair brush and it has changed my life.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s priced low compared to most badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving brush I ever bought</li>
            <li> Jumping into a reasonably-priced badger brush should be the FIRST brush I picked up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush for anyone interested in saving money.</li>
            <li> This was a pressent for me and is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll be sure to replace it with the same brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will shed hairs for about the first week or so.</li>
            <li> Has the quality of a much higher priced brush.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I have ever bought</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is my first brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what it was advertised to be</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first brush, and it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> there were a couple of shedding hairs at first, but none after that.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else says, smells for the first couple of days, but after that, goes away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using a double edge again after many years away from one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Escali shaving brush in the same order as the Old Bond Coconut shaving cream and have been very pleased with both purchases.</li>
            <li> There was some shedding the first couple of days, but that seems to have tapered off.</li>
            <li> This is my first Shaving Brush and well.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the way I started shaving too many years ago, brush, DE Razor and a cream.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well lathering and getting soap everywhere evenly.</li>
            <li> The first week of use the brush shed its share of hair.</li>
            <li> First...</li>
            <li> size is something that I am willing to overlook...</li>
            <li> Make sure to soak and rinse prior to first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a wealth of hand-on knowledge of competing products, but I can say this product seems to be well-constructed in the month</li>
            <li> It generates a solid lather and holds sufficient amounts of cream when used with a quality cream and the appropriate amount of water.  </li>
            <li> When I first converted to DE Safety Razor shaving, I decided to go with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush shed maybe 20 bristles on my first use, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> I guess it will work for me until I buy something of a higher quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> First shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> It lost about 20 hairs the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but none since then.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it lathers, and how it feels on my face!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit concerned that the wood will begin to wear a bit when wet, but perhaps that will make a nice hand-worn patina.</li>
            <li> , it felt so much like his, brought a smile to my face.</li>
            <li> First shave resulted in bristles all over my face and soap cake.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I soak it in hot water first then whip up the cream and apply it.</li>
            <li> This brush takes me back many years when shaving was an art and not just an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> The the difference between the two is pretty</li>
            <li> However, there was a noticeable odor for the first week that I used this brush that has since vanished.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> a funny note.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a plastic handled one on the first go around</li>
            <li> Definitely a recommended item for someone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> As just noted, I have not been aware of a musty animal smell at all.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, there was a lot of shedding of the hairs, now it doesn&#x27;t do it as often.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> These actually last many years and will turn your shaving experience from chore to luxury.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed to lather for a shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> It also lost about 20-30 bristles the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his favorite part of the entire gift!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a high-end brush, and was losing bristles from the first use.</li>
            <li> Two or three bristles feel out first couple times using it none since.</li>
            <li> He soaks it in hot water while we shower and then uses it without issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible brush in terms of softness, but spending the extra $10 makes all the difference in quality.  </li>
            <li> and I love dipping it in hot water to really open the pores!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Did the job, Husband liked it, Bristles are medium density and not much shedding</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t smell funny and actually worked up a better lather than the one I have.  </li>
            <li> Better quality that the Art of Shaving brush my wife gave me last year.  </li>
            <li> Problem is I dont really want to ever spend $200+ for a brush!</li>
            <li> Holds lots of water and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> Overall a pretty okay brush; I&#x27;ve never used another shaving brush before</li>
            <li> Shipping was FAST !  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush.  </li>
            <li> But be aware it sheds a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> During the first use, several hairs came out of the brush, but not so many as to create a noticeable difference in its thickness.</li>
            <li> He had been looking locally for a replacement for his and wasn&#x27;t able to find one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush.</li>
            <li> Husband has had this brush for over year now, he says it&#x27;s his first badger brush</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described &amp; arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t get much better than this, after 8 months of use, bristles are still solidly mounted and no weird smells.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this brush it was the first shaving brush I had used.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time realy indulging in brushes, lathering, legit shaving soap.</li>
            <li> We immediately replaced it with the Body Shop&#x27;s brush, similar priced, much better quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush that I bought after switching from multiblade cartridge razors to safety razor and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I must say since this is my first brush</li>
            <li> It holds the water really well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush, and here is what I got out of it:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The first one I bought was just on a whim</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased and</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> It was a pain in the ass at first leaving bristles in my shave soap and on my face.</li>
            <li> First brush i ever owned.</li>
            <li> Way better than my last one.</li>
            <li> I noticed some coloring of my soap on first use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare with others because this is the first one I ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve purchased having switched to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This brush serves exactly what my needs are.</li>
            <li> You may a fuller brush with a unit priced around $30, but if this brush is in your price range, you will likely be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> &quot; I continued to use it for four days, soaking it for about 2 minutes in hot water and then using it,  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> First off I like the handle on the brush and the hair of the brush</li>
            <li> The quality of the item is comparable to much higher priced shaving brushes.  </li>
            <li> One thing I dislike is that the brush sheds when you first use it.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it would stay in one peice on a more permanent basis.</li>
            <li> First experience using a badger hair brush for shaving.</li>
            <li> Couple of things: This is the first I&#x27;ve tried using shaving soap and a brush, and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a woman, my shaving needs are different from most of the reviewers.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles will come out at first</li>
            <li> The brush knotted it up the first time I used it..</li>
            <li> I paint sometimes and even with good paint brushes you will see a few bristles come out the first couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be, spreads the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li> I just want to go ahead and say this is my first shaving brush that I ever bought.</li>
            <li> The first thing I like about it is the price.</li>
            <li> But some people have had luck with this brush so if your willing to take the risk buy it</li>
            <li> and it has a funny smell.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> That works pretty well.    </li>
            <li> Escali is not my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> I looked at brushes for up to $80 before buying this one, and can not imagine that I would have been more pleased with the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> #34;real badger&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I tried dish soap, head &amp; shoulders, every shampoo I could find in the bathroom, and hot water.</li>
            <li> Sort of helps keep you from slathering on too much soap!</li>
            <li> The first time I touched this brush to my neck</li>
            <li> This is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I was needing a second brush for my weekends away from home but didn&#x27;t want to spend another $30 or more for another brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li> this brush lose the backbone compare with the first used.</li>
            <li> First Badger brush...</li>
            <li> During those years I have used many brushes made of different materials.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon after I submitted it, I got an email from the seller apologizing for my experience and offering to replace the brush or refund my money.</li>
            <li> I noticed it the first couple times I used it, but it is going away.  </li>
            <li> The brush did shed a few hair the first couple of times I used it, but since then it has been good.</li>
            <li> Use hot water to make your foam in a cup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and has help up well</li>
            <li> arguably that is its only redeeming quality.</li>
            <li> My first brush</li>
            <li> But its also pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush</li>
            <li> First brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Finally you can upgrade to a better quality badger brush too</li>
            <li> One piece of advice, make sure you soak it in hot water and rinse repeatedly prior to the first use to get the excess dye out of it.</li>
            <li> There are higher grade brushes that reek of badger when you first get them, from what some have told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> quite a bit first use, but</li>
            <li> Lathers pretty well and does its job.</li>
            <li> When wet and full of shaving cream, the brush works more like a paintbrush - It just smears the shaving cream on my face, which I can do with just my hand.</li>
            <li> These things are supposed to have a smell to them, at first, and I know this.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for as a starter brush.  </li>
            <li> Not expensive, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> figured that if I stick to it, I&#x27;ll just purchase a better one later on.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll buy this one again if, and when, my first one needs replacement.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush.</li>
            <li> I can run over my face with the electric razor once, and still able to re-apply several times if needed.</li>
            <li> Soaked it and used it and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This one is soft and fits in the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend as a first badger brush, or first brush in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> As my first brush, i have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush</li>
            <li> I then noticed that the brush was losing bristles with each use - on the order of a dozen or more at first, and now - after several months of use - it still drops 6-10 bristles per use.  </li>
            <li> of the hairs came out on the first use (~8-12), more on the second use (</li>
            <li> brush was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I must say it did smell kinda funky the first couple of times i used it.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Lost that badger smell (ha ha) after the first week or so.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush that I purchased.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Let me preface with the fact that most people&#x27;s complaints can be solved by running shaving soap through the brush 3 or 4 times prior to first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Seems to make a better shave with my double edged razor.</li>
            <li> It shedded at first but not since</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> I know they are attractive because my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about them detracting from the bath decor.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this brush when I first got into straight-shaving.  </li>
            <li> The first maybe 10 times I lathered up, I would lose 2-3 bristles each time.  </li>
            <li> Since he uses a shaving brush everyday, I was looking affordability and good quality.  </li>
            <li> the brush is firm and builds up a good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few weeks now and its a really good brush.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses it was all good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of picking a few up with some good cream for Xmas for friends and family.  </li>
            <li> (3)  work up a good, heavy lather  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my badger brush for a good few months now</li>
            <li> it arrived clean with no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it very frequently</li>
            <li> Im new to wet shaving with a double edge razor, and this brush makes it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Decent brush, doesn&#x27;t lather extremely well, but good for beginning shavers.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and is a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is of high quality.  </li>
            <li> However, I will say that this brush is a good starter brush for those new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> So far, the badger produces a better lather than camel without the bristles adding new hair to my beard.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving products is a fairly new company who makes really good brushes that in my opinion are cheaper in price from comparable brushes from companies like Simpson,Rooney &amp;Omega.</li>
            <li> I get a much better lather with my new Escali Badger Brush than my old brush.  </li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving, and got this brush because it was well priced and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and wanted a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> The hairs have become soft and slightly fuzzy, it holds a ton of lather, and provides a great shave prep experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and well balanced, and the handle makes it easy to hang on to, even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> You really have to rinse the lather out and shake the brush dry for it to stay nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I did enjoy making the lather and have since practiced making a lather on nights when I&#x27;m not even shaving just playing with things like thickness, adding more or less water etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Why anyone would really forego shaving cream and smoothest 4-blade shave in 2013 by using a shaving brush and primiitive safety razor when there are other, better options available?  </li>
            <li> It took a few shaves to break it in and soften the bristles, but since then it has been very soft and produced great lather.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and does a decent job of working a lather but the hairs clump very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t loose hairs very easily, and is ergonomically well made.</li>
            <li> The lather was much finer and if you did things right</li>
            <li> ordered it and shipping was so fast that the delivery guy was knocking on the door right after I click on finish my order.</li>
            <li> Just the  right amount of exfoliating &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and still gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> badger brushes, but maintains the stiff spine for good scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Good stiff brush for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a good stiff brush.  </li>
            <li> Good stiff badger hair.</li>
            <li> I like that one a lot - properly stiff, no shed and a good feel on the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before buying, which for the most part were positive.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brush has so many positive reviews, don&#x27;t make a mistake people, simply put this</li>
            <li> It was easy to break in and is not rough on you face and has held up well.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say I am thrilled to now be a wet shaver!  </li>
            <li> I hope this is not a typical issue with badger brushes as I do enjoy using it -</li>
            <li> I do wonder if it is normal for the brush to lose bristles as quickly</li>
            <li> , contacted escali customer care, they sent me free another one, a little better, but still bristles are coming off from the first use.</li>
            <li> This a nice brush that will more than likely get better and feel softer as it gets broken in.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes the daily monotony of shaving much for more fun as it can be a very old-timey experience.</li>
            <li> Very soft and full shaving brush that fits stands well, with wood that blends well with any type stand and razor.  </li>
            <li> I have stored the brush with the bristles down in a brush holder, the shape is holding up perfectly after 2 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li> the bristles is very good; it is a pure badger hair brush, and does every bit as well as my silvertip brush - only for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I purchased it because of the positive reviews and the prices.</li>
            <li> Used a natural bristle brush previously, and this is MUCH better!!  </li>
            <li> but, just know that the Parker is a large step up for only about $10 more.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Escali Pure Badger is a better value.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing compared to other brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cheap way to get a brush but spending just a little more</li>
            <li> Great little addition to complete a set.  </li>
            <li> It is a great combination of firm and soft which gets my stubble ready for a close shave!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really review the brush because we haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far worth the price!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a nice brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve used so far for wet shaving and does a good job lathering up my Proraso shave cream.</li>
            <li> There are far better brushes on the market, at a far higher price.</li>
            <li> My original Escali brush has handled everything I have thrown at it from Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap, to Taylor of Old Bond creams.</li>
            <li> other users here mentions, this brush seems to lose a lot of hair with each use which is kind of an annoyance</li>
            <li> but I liked it other than that.  </li>
            <li> Using this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream helped reduce razor burn and skin irritation significantly for me.</li>
            <li> This 100% pure badger shaving brush works very very well.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and using this brush for two and a half years it is apparent that either the quality control in the making of these brushes varies greatly or they&#x27;re made by different makers.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> Only used it once since I received it, but it produced a rich lather fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My first brush was a typical drugstore brush and it was not soft at all, it did not hold water well or lather up very good.</li>
            <li> I still got a wonderful lather with very little effort and the animal smell is long gone.  </li>
            <li> So first the good: sharp, pointy bristles produce a nice thick lather and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Initially I had several bristles wash out but after breaking it in I haven&#x27;t noticed any more and have no odor that people have experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li> Gave it to new wet shaver who seems to enjoy it more than I did.</li>
            <li> it really helps lathering up a cinch and its rather large in size!</li>
            <li> Finally fed up with the mounting expense of buying the latest and not-necessarily “greatest” innovations in the disposable razor market, I discovered there are a few essential items I needed to buy before I could completely transform to using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> it creates a fantastic lather, the bristles are thickly packed, and it feels amazing against my skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is great at what it&#x27;s intended to do: serve as a low cost brush for those introducing themselves to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It holds water very well and creates a nice wet lather on your face.  </li>
            <li> I have owned and used this brush for about one month and it is working very well thus far creating and comfortably administering lather.</li>
            <li> The reason it has such great ratings is because people switch from cartridge shaving to wet and see this as the number one seller so they buy it</li>
            <li> Great for starting to wet shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got one of these already for myself, and liked it so much I gave one away as a gift to my brother who is just getting into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> But after using it for a few weeks it&#x27;s stayed together and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It does not shed particularly and is very much worth the price you pay.  </li>
            <li> that the brush is actually clean, the smell is completely gone and it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine</li>
            <li> This brush is not too soft nor too firm in that it easily creates a nice creamy lather in a mug that I can work into my beard.</li>
            <li> After about 5-10 cycles it finally looked and smelled super clean.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a shave brush (for a straight razor or a regular, safety blade) be sure to get BADGER hair.</li>
            <li> In a word, every bit as good as the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve bought and tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after a week of daily shaving the brush became very floppy and lost most all of it&#x27;s backbone.</li>
            <li> This brush is as good as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each shave I am sure to shake as much water out as possible, reshape the bristles then set out on counter to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do, the bristles are nice ands soft (especially if you soak them in hot water), and it is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> So here I am getting a second one and planning sweet sweet revenge.</li>
            <li> A few months into using this it still scratches my face more than the cheap boar brush I used before.</li>
            <li> Gently squeeze excess water and give a few good shakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally found this brush, and it came with a low price tag and good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are nice and soft after only a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some badger brushes selling for big money, but no reason to buy those when this one is such good quality.</li>
            <li> so you may be able to get it for that much too instead of the regular $13 or so.  </li>
            <li> The things that cleared up my facial skin (surprisingly): Selsun Blue Medicated, face scrubber, and Escali badger brush.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden handle and natural bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, outside of the brush slowly going bald, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> ; command for my wife was all it took to grab the dog and toss her into the bathtub as I quickly placed the brush back and began running the water to clean the pup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got back into straight razor shaving and having this brush lather up the soap is better than I remember.</li>
            <li> ThuS far Seems like a good shaving brush as expected.</li>
            <li> This brush gets soft over time and it&#x27;s easy to charge / load with soap and holds a decent amount.</li>
            <li> Good buy compared to more expensive options</li>
            <li> Granted I&#x27;m shaving my head and have some real estate to cover so if your only shaving your face you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> Good brush but my first shaving brush so not many to compare it to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that I don&#x27;t feel like it lifts my whiskers, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to drop too many hairs.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure that I really load the brush to produce enough lather for 3+ passes.</li>
            <li> Also, mix the soap with enough water or you won&#x27;t get a good enough lather.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles</li>
            <li> I frequent about wet shaving for good reason.</li>
            <li> I can’t say enough good about the entire experience.</li>
            <li> B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]], and a regular disposable razor; feels nice to handle and use</li>
            <li> such a good deal I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second as backup</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it seems to me that this will last a good period of time if taken care of properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Described it as nice and soft compared to his existing item but rigid enough to hold soap.</li>
            <li> went for this brush mostly on price, but I have been very, very pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
            <li> It seems to really prepare the facial hair way better than applying a gel or cream by hand.</li>
            <li> use a large coffee cup and fill it with hot water and soak the brush while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other brushes on the market with better handling, better bristles, better lathering, etc, but for $14, I&#x27;m not sure you can find such a quality, real-hair, wood-handle brush to break in to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is my first pure badger hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor and saw this shaving brush as being highly recommended -- they were right.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this little badger brush by Escali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a starter brush and it&#x27;s worth keeping around as an inexpensive travel brush when you upgrade.</li>
            <li> Also was surprisingly &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;, especially when new, but that seems to be getting a little better with time.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush has soft, but stiff bristles, that make it easy to generate a nice lather while softening the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost</li>
            <li> Makes rich lather with little effort what more can you say about a shaving brush?</li>
            <li> Funny how some can get a new cell phone every year for hundreds but cannot afford $13 to keep a fresh shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my cousin who has sensitive skin and needs special treatment for his beard.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son with a special shaving cream for sensitive skin and they recommend using a brush to get up a lather</li>
            <li> Moving from a Gillette Mach 3, and Gillette shaving cream in a can to a nice Merkur safety razor, using &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream&amp;#34;, and the Pure Badger shaving brush is like taking a short trip to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brush is not too stiff or soft a great in between stiffness.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how short the handle is...not that easy to use for me.</li>
            <li> There was a slight chemical scent on the bristles at first but dissapated over week or two after a couple uses with some nice shave soaps.</li>
            <li> As a first time buyer, this purchase was based solely on other reviewers and boy were they right - this brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The Escal fells solid with a very full brush of hairs.  </li>
            <li> For $8 it was a good buy, but I knew I would need a new brush after reading reviews and losing so many bristles after only a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews here and ordered one.</li>
            <li> Positive:</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews; However, what I missed is that it doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette shave gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on a combination of all the positive reviews and the price.</li>
            <li> and I will say its been a positive experience.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush being on a budget and having read positive things about it on forums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this brush because the reviews were positive.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Be sure to soak the brush in warm water to soften the bristles because it can feel a bit hard and prickly to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The price point makes this 4-star worthy; If it cost any more, the star level would go down a notch or two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying lather to my face felt so soft and gentle that I actually enjoy the whole process.</li>
            <li> This was my first real badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> First time using it was a real treat.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty sturdy and hasn&#x27;t seemed to lose much hair after about 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush was purchased at The Art of Shaving, and it cost me four or five times as much as this brush.  </li>
            <li> brush was my first try at a real badger shaving brush, and</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I really like the Escali brush.  </li>
            <li> My fiance has commented on the difference, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> And of course, the more expensive brushes are incredibly soft, and feel great.</li>
            <li> i also absolutely love that when I use it, there&#x27;s this faint animal (I can only assume badger - think woodsy smell) smell that is just incredible.</li>
            <li> First time shaving with a straight razor and applying shave soap with a barber brush.</li>
            <li> I suppose if I really crammed my nose into it I could detect something, but that would assume I know what I should be smelling in the first place.</li>
            <li> This brush whips up lather without effort, straight out of the box (please see below to prepare your brush for first use, however).</li>
            <li> After about a month of use the bristles are falling out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> My first shaving cream brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to go off of.  </li>
            <li> For the price it works wonders, and that&#x27;s all that really matters if you don&#x27;t feel like spending a fortune in a higher end brush.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it all that much, but the times that I have it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This is the first brush that I have used so do not have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it was made for and does it very well.</li>
            <li> My first badger brush, so i don&#x27;t have much experience with them.  </li>
            <li> My first badger brush so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> soak the brush in warm (not hot) water for a minute or two, then shake gently to unload some of the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure before long</li>
            <li> The first time I lathered it up and gently squeezed it out</li>
            <li> I think I will be able to use this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably spring for a higher end brush at some point, but for now this one is working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I removed it straight from the package and used it the first day with no issues at all.</li>
            <li> This was a first purchase on shaving brushes to see if he&#x27;d like the change at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> As long as it lasts, I see no need to pay any more than this.</li>
            <li> Also, it looks great next to my other shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as it was very affordable, and since it was my first, if I did not like it, I would not be so out of pocket.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to which I can compare, but I can tell you this:  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about two weeks</li>
            <li> so this is my first shaving brush and dont really have any complains,hmmmm maybe one and its that some hairs fall out,</li>
            <li> It takes a few times of usage to get the smell off it but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> I am pleased, but this would not be a choice I would make as a long term purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first real badger brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if there would be much of a difference if I paid 5 times as much!</li>
            <li> Also still a very prickly brush even though I let it soak in hot water for about 10 minutes before each use.</li>
            <li> There was some shedding the first week but not so much anymore.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.  </li>
            <li> The first time, the smell lingered for a whole day.</li>
            <li> This brush was my first brush trying DE shaving, and I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case I didn&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
            <li> I got this at a stellar discounted price and for how much I got it for I would buy over and over again.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much a slam dunk.</li>
            <li> product came well packaged and free of any apparent damage.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very prickly against my face even after soaking it in hot water and leather it up with soap.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these 4 years ago and they have pretty much held together.  </li>
            <li> First lathers were very prickly.</li>
            <li> Really, it gets the job done, but hairs have been falling out consistently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much experience to compare it to, but this brush is exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for - a low cost brush that wouldn&#x27;t feel cheap or fall apart.</li>
            <li> As long as I am able to shave, I plan to do so with an Escali bruch.</li>
            <li> Rinse it out VERY well BEFORE you use it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soft and  gives me a full lather on my face</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t shed any hairs after a few months of use, but the handle is tiny and does not have a good ergonomic or secure feel.</li>
            <li> The soothing warm water and soft brush makes you completely forget you&#x27;re getting to old to party like that.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still full and soft.</li>
            <li> It is quite small for a brush and it does not produce a good lather.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice full lather, well built and well designed, it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Turns out that as I&#x27;m soaking the brush in warm water, it starts to change the water&#x27;s color to a dark brown.</li>
            <li> in all a good starter brush, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the value of this purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to commit to a more expensive option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 6+ months, it works good to get up a lather and apply to face.  </li>
            <li> very impressed with this brush, as long as you rinse it and hang it, it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I purchased this that it would fall apart right away, but after using it for a few months it still works great and is holding up well!</li>
            <li> Most badger hair brushes are considerable higher priced and I just figured at this price that it was a cheap imitation of a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> quality is high and it holds shave cream &amp; water to lather up my face just right.</li>
            <li> either is pretty much fine especially for a beginner learning what you like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely get this if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving and want a nice brush for a decent price.</li>
            <li> handle has an adequate weight, and is shaped for easy griping with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to creating shaving cream foam with a brush so wasn&#x27;t excited about spending a large chunk of money for a high end silver tip brush.  </li>
            <li> It did have a little smell when I first set it in the water to warm it.</li>
            <li> I just love watching my husband use this sweet little tool to shave.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the brush is super easy, just run it under warm water and work the brush a few times with your fingers, then just shake it out once or twice, the brush comes out almost instantly dry.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the cheapest 100% badger brush of high quality available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that is deciding to take a more traditional approach to shaving.</li>
            <li> The instructions are concise but very useful, mainly where maintenance of the brush is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not shed bristles like other reviewers have found, and with better technique and practice I am able to get to the economies that justify this style of personal care.</li>
            <li> I liked the other reviews and this is cheap enough that if i didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive for a first time wet shaver, Badger instead of Boar, and on my very first try I got a fantastic lather.  </li>
            <li> Cons - not as soft as some other badger hair or synthetic brushes, handle is light weight wood (would prefer a bit more heft), packaging is unremarkable for gifting purposes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and create a great lather with very little shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I rinse the brush thoroughly and let it dry, following proper care instructions and after a couple of months of moderate use, it conserves its original shape perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush churns up rich foamy lather with very little effort and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why badger hair was so essential to making a good lather until I tried it; it holds in moisture between the hairs that other synthetic hairs simply can&#x27;t, making a rich lather that you can apply right next to the grain of your beard that you can&#x27;t with your fingers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues in the past of brushes going sour because my pre-shave oil adheres to them too quickly and saturates the bristles; the treatment on these bristles has successfully kept them oil free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-NOT super soft.</li>
            <li> I find this a very decent brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the skin, lathers well and dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to shake dry and leave on side.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting super soft bristles, but I was thinking the hairs would soften after use and conditioning.</li>
            <li> it kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;There is an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t expect it to break that easy, but such is life.</li>
            <li> It has none of the floppiness of the higher grade badger brushes (best, super, and silver tip), but it is still soft and thick enough to hold water better than the average boar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers up quick and is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Only complaints are that it looses hairs easily and smells a bit like a taxidermy shop (made from badger).</li>
            <li> bid coarse, not as smooth as some of the higher end</li>
            <li> easily 20 hairs of various thickness shed from the brush.</li>
            <li> Important to soak it in hot water (in a cup) for several minutes before using.</li>
            <li> Much better than the really cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The brush was packed in a simple packaging and was easy to get out.</li>
            <li> The bristles absorb water quickly making for a soft application of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Make sure to let it dry on</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does hold water well, and creates a nice lather and has a slightly &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; feel which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> The wood handle also adds a very classic look.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the packaging it came in as it was easy to just open and have someonr take the contents out.</li>
            <li> My experience so far with this brush has been adequate to this point.</li>
            <li> Cleans easy enough.</li>
            <li> Be sure to dry in horizontal position.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for dry makeup or powders, but as for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Be sure to dry brush per instructions.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of hairs that came out at first, but that has not really happened any more.</li>
            <li> If you like super soft silky brushes, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out for next usage too.</li>
            <li> The bristles keep their shape and the brush rinses out quickly and completely when I&#x27;m finished.  </li>
            <li> He has super sensitive skin, but this brush gives him a close shave with no skin irritation,</li>
            <li> I dry it with the bristles (handle on top) so that whatever it is that holds the bristles in doesn&#x27;t suffer any water damage.  </li>
            <li> I know my Dad had a super old horse hair brush</li>
            <li> I purchased it to use with the SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Black.  </li>
            <li> make sure you put it in its side when letting it dry.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to let the brush dry standing upright.</li>
            <li> The brush left badger hair on my face and as i washed the brush it started shedding very quickly in my sink.  </li>
            <li> Nice feeling brush, it did lose a few hairs at first.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, 4-5 badger hairs would dislodge every time I tried to make a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my Tweezerman shaving brush that is still going strong two years after its purchase.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe with the product is that it had a strong odor of, well, badger.</li>
            <li> Some loss of bristles during first few uses but seems to be holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Looks like it was last a good long time.</li>
            <li> After the first week however it softened up considerably and I rarely lose any bristles now.</li>
            <li> I do expect a brush like this to have a smell, but the smell from this brush was simply too strong.</li>
            <li> Although it looks good at first sight, it loses bristles continuously.  </li>
            <li> It helps if you let it soak in warm - hot water for a few minutes while you prepare for the shave.</li>
            <li> The quality of manufacturing seems good and I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs at first but is breaking in nicely.</li>
            <li> Initially there was a strong smell to the brush, but that went away.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> It looks like  it  will last for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> Instead of filling the entire area between the two, which would have produced a strong bond, the glue had a large hole in it.</li>
            <li> Good brush for those of you who likes a little more rigid than average hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li> I take good care of it washing it out in lukewarm water and patting it down with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> But every single time I have used the brush, a dozen or more hairs come off.  </li>
            <li> When I found a pure badger hair brush for this price point $12-$13 as if this writing), I figured I would try it out.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison to a pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> and then I ordered the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and believe me there is no comparison in the softness and shape of this brush.</li>
            <li> Whenever I replace my brush or gift one to a friend, I order the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> PURE BADGER SHAVING BRUSH proved to be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased an escali pure badger shaving brush from USA Vitamins</li>
            <li> It was a smart buy.</li>
            <li> Wholeheartedly recommend the Escali 100% pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade my shaving routine by picking up a Merkur Safety Razor and a pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to buy pure badger but find another brand not escali.</li>
            <li> is, as claimed 100% pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush is everything one would want in a shaving brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly I would suggest this brush to a friend(s).</li>
            <li> The lowest is this one, the \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li> &quot; The difference is in what parts of the badger the hairs come from, with pure badger brushes considered the roughest, and silvertip ones the softest.</li>
            <li> The lowest is this one, the \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li> &quot; The difference is in what parts of the badger the hairs come from, with pure badger brushes considered the roughest, and silvertip ones the softest.</li>
            <li> Bought this Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush as a gift for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Pure Badger shaving brush is all it claims to be.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pure badger, it works well, and it&#x27;s twelve bucks.  </li>
            <li> My one experience with the brush is the surprisingly large number of bristles that flaked off the handle while I lathered.</li>
            <li> Smart Buy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a boar or even horse hair brush instead of this (or any pure badger) brush.</li>
            <li> , Pure is meant to be &amp;#34;poky.&amp;#34; It is the stiffest of the grades.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to a friend.  </li>
            <li> a couple of razors ,soap and the brush I chose was the Escali pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It held up for over a year, but I switched over to The Art of Shaving Pure Tip Badger brush</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]First time DE safety razor user</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t be doing either of those though.</li>
            <li> You need a certain level of thickness to the brush to get it to work up the shaving cream into a lather.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a pure badger hair brush without the steep price.</li>
            <li> I purchased two Escali Pure Badger shaving brushes through Amazon with plans of presenting them to my grandsons.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand)</li>
            <li> Some have stated that pure badger brushes tend to be of poorer quality and are prone to having knots form within.</li>
            <li> You can search on amazon for Bellus 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> Is a pure pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali 100% pure Badger brush for my FIL for fathers Day</li>
            <li> Supposedly this is the lowest grade of badger hair (pure) given the price point.</li>
            <li> musky smell of the almond soap certainly doesnt help.</li>
            <li> When I replaced his boar bristle brush with this Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, he could immediately tell the difference in how luxurious the lather was on his face</li>
            <li> Got this brush after using a large Omega boar brush.  </li>
            <li> B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s supposed to be pure badger, I swear it&#x27;s losing color as well as bristles.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s pure &amp;#34;dyed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything but a Pure Badger Shaving Brush again.</li>
            <li> It is soft, makes a great lather, sheds very few bristles and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic buy - fast shipping, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Smells like a wet badger at first, but washing with shampoo and warm water fixed that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough hot water, nor does it keep enough air between the hairs to help lather effectively.</li>
            <li> At first a few hairs came out and it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought, but that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have heard that storing a brush with the bristles facing up like that can significantly shorten its life, so bare that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant, but for those sensitive to scent it may be bothersome.</li>
            <li> But, for the price, it is not a bad brush, especially if returning to the more traditional form of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a brush and cream, but I have to say so far I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I have four shaving brushes - this is my favorite - and keep them at the different places I live and stay at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are new to shaving brushes, do yourself a favor and go with an Omega Boar pro48 or one of the many low cost Semogue boar brushes.</li>
            <li> You guys made my new Escali pure badger  brush hit right out of the park.</li>
            <li> THis is a good brush I have been using it for a few weeks now every day, with Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation (from amazon),</li>
            <li> If I shove my nose right against it immediately after wetting it, I can smell a hint of animal scent, but I&#x27;ve never smelled anything unusual during normal use.    </li>
            <li> I went over the brush with my hands and was pulling 20 loose hairs and more kept coming off.  </li>
            <li> and it does not shed loose hairs like many brushes.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a breaking in period and those loose hairs will get worked out.</li>
            <li> High Density Pure Badger Shaving Brush WSP &amp;#34;Prince&amp;#34; Black&amp;#34; is the one I use now, Very Very Recommended.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that there is a slight &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> The price goes up depending on the color of the badger hair (silver-tip is expensive), however, badger hair will ensure you have a long-lasting smooth brush that feels pleasant on your face.  </li>
            <li> It was super soft and much fuller but also $180, so I will keep this brush.</li>
            <li> Finally whip up a good lather and stand the brush on end to let the lather dry on the bristles.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li> Super soft brush really works well.  </li>
            <li> Rinse and 2 good shakes in the sink and the brush is close to dry and maintains softness for the next use.  </li>
            <li> This brush has that new badger brush &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; right out of the package.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush and very cheap quality as expected.</li>
            <li> As long as you properly break it in and maintain it, it keeps its shape, it&#x27;s quite soft &amp; it works a lot better than the cheapo brushes you&#x27;ll get at the pharmacy or in most shaving kits.</li>
            <li> Good firm feel but still very soft tips.    </li>
            <li> Other than losing a few bristles during the first couple of shaves, this is a very good brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do follow general brush care (get a stand, clean it, etc.)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;badger smell\\&quot; that some other reviewers have mentioned, but I sure did lose a lot of bristles with my first shave.</li>
            <li> Soft feel, easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out this should be fine, but it is not *</li>
            <li> Evenly applies the lather and makes me feel like a fine gentleman from the days of yore instead of the hairy wildebeest that I actually am.</li>
            <li> sure to dry bristles-down with a stand or hanger!</li>
            <li> Nothing like a classic shave!</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get a decent brush to lather up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first experience with classic shaving implements</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush for the money!</li>
            <li> but it seem of very high quality.</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li> have three brushes, a very high end</li>
            <li> Its a very high quality brush, prompt shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Never had a very high quality brush to compare this to</li>
            <li> It holds a good among of water to build a good lather in a mug however it did loose about 15 hairs total after three shaves but after that only once in a while does it loose another</li>
            <li> The Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the real deal.</li>
            <li> The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I ordered held water and lather very well for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this 100% pure badger shaving brush to go along with the Merkur stainless steel razor that I bought.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the hairs on this because it just held too much water...and after a certain point the hairs would come off and stay on my face as I shaved....</li>
            <li> To be honest, it smelled a little bit of skunk.  </li>
            <li> Nice little brush.</li>
            <li> Nice little starter brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, wish it was maybe a little softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Really nice little shaving brush for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This little brush works wonders creating a nice lather for your face.    </li>
            <li> Got the brush in, was hoping for the best due to high ratings, however I have used it two days so far and bristles constantly come out, I&#x27;ve probably lose 20 bristles so far.</li>
            <li> This brush replaced a boar brush that was about 4 months old and was so bald that I thought of it as &amp;#34;the CHEMO brush regardless of how gently I treated it, and I have smelled wet, dead, possums that were a lot more pleasant to have in the bathroom with you.</li>
            <li> it is pretty small actually and easy to use and holds good amount of water and shaving cream... soft on the face...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first purchase of a brush like this, and I do not yet know the difference in quality between an inexpensive brush, and a high priced brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend pre-conditioning the brush before first use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li> Not as durable and as high of quality as the higher end brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve owned but seems to be really high quality.  </li>
            <li> a little bit short, but works great</li>
            <li> Great little brush for starting out.</li>
            <li> As well the bristles are fine and soft with a natural feel, which works very well on the face.</li>
            <li> It took several decent lathers to have it settle in it&#x27;s sweet spot where your soap/gel scent gets absorbed and the shedding stops.</li>
            <li> good quality for a hard to find item</li>
            <li> recommend this brush along with Merkur razor and Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and good is hard to do.</li>
            <li> Good brush, it does have that badger smell a bit, but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> But it works very well for its purpose and seems of very high quality.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to be very high quality and works very well</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a high quality item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that the quality would not be the same since the product was relatively inexpensive, but it works great!  </li>
            <li> A year ago I returned to the old double-edge razor, and my old, cheap brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick.</li>
            <li> My fiance recently started using a straight razor to shave, and he had a cheap boards shaving brush to start out.  </li>
            <li> This one has lost a few hairs but overall has been a great experience.  </li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be quite as nice as some of the more expensive brushes, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product especially if paired with Dove Men+ Care Total Comfort Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> This brush is a huge difference from the one that came in my kit from a local store.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t imagine what would justify getting a brush more expensive.</li>
            <li> Anyone who pays twice, three times, TEN TIMES this much for a shaving brush is making a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the initial investment of the hardware, the blades are cheap and the soaps and creams reasonably priced but the shaving brushes were all over the spectrum.</li>
            <li> I kinda wish I had just spent more and went up to a nicer brush that does shed its brussels so much.</li>
            <li> Recently made the switch over from a synthetic bristle hair brush and let me tell you it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li> Working very well for my maiden voyage into DE safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> did a bit of research and settled on this shaving brish because of the reviews and the price (which really couldn&#x27;t be beat).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or low quality at all.</li>
            <li> O course, since I really like the brush, I treat it gently.</li>
            <li> but it lathers really well and fits well in the hand and is getting softer with every use.</li>
            <li> so I really want the \\&quot;best\\&quot; experience out there</li>
            <li> Thanks Escali.</li>
            <li> Asthetically, it looked very well designed.</li>
            <li> it has been a big hit as I get detailed critiques of each&lt;br /&gt;day&#x27;s shave by telephone.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I primarily started this on a low budget and did it to save money.</li>
            <li> This brush makes the shaving process much easier.  </li>
            <li> I really havn&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> More than I Expected.</li>
            <li> He said it didn&#x27;t spread his shave cream around smoothly or well enough.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;re still on the search for a reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li> The brush seems solid however, and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> And the service provided by Amazon and Perella&#x27;s has made the journey that much easier.</li>
            <li> Brush is well made and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast service</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The misconception is that with an Escali you&#x27;re getting a quality badger brush at a fraction of the price, but you&#x27;re really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t name any specific vendors in order to remain free from accusation of marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but I know he uses it whenever he shaves and has no complaints.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized until I got my boar brush recently, but this cheap badger brush has no backbone.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t make much difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took it with me during my vacation and it did not take much room in my toiletry bag since it is not bulky.</li>
            <li> He states he likes it very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like my Escali brush.  </li>
            <li> Brush is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter in the stand</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> It is like a paint brush for me and with the shave cream, i paint it on the spots ready for the razor.</li>
            <li> For the cost and quality of this product,  it performs very well.</li>
            <li> You can really paint very well with it which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> Appreciated the fast service.</li>
            <li> Holds water really well.</li>
            <li> My husband says he really loves the brush.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a straight and so needed a brush for shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well and soaks well also, when I lather up the shaving cream and brush it on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Brush creates a lot of lather, but is softer than I would like since I have very dense hair.  </li>
            <li> It sets up the shave really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very shaving brush, thanks.</li>
            <li> Really works the lather of the cream into the wiskers and prevents pulling.  </li>
            <li> This would&#x27;ve been a 5 star product if didn&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li> After using this brush for a week I gave up and spent the money on a better quality brush.  </li>
            <li> brush hasn&#x27;t lost that much of its bristles...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very prickly, and it NEVER.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the face and lathers the soap very well.</li>
            <li> It lathers and holds soap very well.  </li>
            <li> found it lathered well, and a much softer application.</li>
            <li> I began using boar bristle brushes and really like this over them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but around the 3-4th time it was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price makes it very affordible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> it sheds a lot and is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The brush lathers up really well</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed at how fast it dries out after use.  </li>
            <li> This is a 100% badger brush and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight for 14 bucks and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> brush holds water very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really allows me to get the shaving cream worked into my beard.  </li>
            <li> This brush was much cheaper</li>
            <li> He really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> and it has held up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are probably some softer Badger bristle brushes out there, but the idea of spending $60 for a shaving brush seems a bit much to me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and</li>
            <li> I found this at a reasonable price and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had decided to stick with wet shaving, so I began looking on Amazon for a better replacement brush.</li>
            <li> It took off as much lather as it put on.</li>
            <li> Would recommend the brush stand so the bristles stay straight.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and well packaged.</li>
            <li> The brush spreads shaving soap very well on my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch or itch.</li>
            <li> Very scratchy though.</li>
            <li> A real quality product.</li>
            <li> #34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, well I purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if wet shaving would be for me.</li>
            <li> This is real badger hair.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely reccomend to everyone.</li>
            <li> For a budget brush, this product performs very well.</li>
            <li> While there are certainly much nicer brushes out there</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than name brands</li>
            <li> The knot really has no body to it</li>
            <li> I really like the firmness of the bristles and the way my skin feels afterward....</li>
            <li> Definitely feels like a cheap product (~$15) but gets the job done, and holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped incredibly fast, packaging was efficient, the price was basically unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> which I would expect from any brush with real hair</li>
            <li> (this happens with artists brushes using real hair).  </li>
            <li> He really likes it  </li>
            <li> much fun brushing on old school sandlewood shaving lather.</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s made out of real animal hair.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really compare to anything.</li>
            <li> the quality is much better than i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as I changed my shaving strategy from canned shaving cream and disposable blades to real blades and saving soap.</li>
            <li> I would have saved so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the price was low, the brush seems to be well made and does a fantastic job building and holding a lather.  </li>
            <li> It works VERY well at lathering up shaving cream</li>
            <li> So much for that.</li>
            <li> Is gentle and dries well.</li>
            <li> Have seen some bristles come out into the soap, but this was really just when I started using the brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the brush was delivered on time, looks as pictured, and is perfectly capable of doing its job.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as soft as those $60 silver-tipped brushes, but I can&#x27;t imagine the difference in quality is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very prickly and should be much softer.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well.</li>
            <li> Really works in the lather well.</li>
            <li> brush was very well priced and shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and works real well.</li>
            <li> When the badger brush arrived I wondered how often I would really use it, and the answer is: every day.  </li>
            <li> I am just getting into the whole safety razor and shave soap thing</li>
            <li> I am no expert or anything, so i can&#x27;t say too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> , expect a pretty potent smell on the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> but not so much so given the price</li>
            <li> The price was ok, everything came as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s from a badger, but really who knows?)</li>
            <li> Was told that most brushes lose a hairs the first few times you use it so it did not bother me at first.</li>
            <li> I grew up on straight razors and shaving brushes, and you know what?</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to get a real badger brush, since I&#x27;ve been using a boar brush for years.  </li>
            <li> Shipping from the store owner was fast and the package arrived in a w3ell packaged box....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at lathering up this way, so I wasn&#x27;t going to spend too much on a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Quality product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> It was a bit pokey until I realized that I should spread the lather by using a side-stroke with the brush instead of coming straight on.</li>
            <li> The hairs are very floppy and can&#x27;t stand up well to soaps or face lathering  </li>
            <li> The hairs seemed clipped and thus are very scratchy at the ends  </li>
            <li> It works very well just as advertised.</li>
            <li> so you do not nicked quite so much with the straight razor.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> very &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; when applying lather to the face.</li>
            <li> I considered spending over twice as much for another brush..</li>
            <li> I dont know much about shaving brushes, but my husband thinks this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It also smells like a badger, but I don&#x27;t really mind that so much.  </li>
            <li> Also fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This works really well with the Shae Moisture Shave Butter I use.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> With this brush you really don&#x27;t need a shaving mug.</li>
            <li> When my son saw it he said he wants one for his birthday.</li>
            <li> It lathers up my face very well</li>
            <li> Lathers very well, and applies to the face sufficiently.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Dealer shipped fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I shave with multi-blade disposables and straight razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who is not using one of these brushes should really get it a try.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference for my shave and my skin.</li>
            <li> and the price is quite reasonable for the quality item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-made for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son... Plus bowl, soap, and straight razor.  </li>
            <li> pre shave cream very well and evenly.</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;ve tried to embrace synthetic bristles, I appreciate the feel of badger.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Made with real hair of some sort.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Hang on a holder, and it&#x27;s ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t like picking hairs off my shave soap, nor my face.</li>
            <li> With a toothbrush, gently brush with the grain of the bristles to help remove soap build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a family member and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush - especially for the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s a badger brush, and I knew it was a real badger brush because it smelled of badger.</li>
            <li> Comparatively though, the badger brush doesn&#x27;t have hair falling out nearly as much as the boar</li>
            <li> not the highest quality but for what i paid I didn&#x27;t expect much and it exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now, every day, and I decided to spend the extra money on this badger brush instead of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I will continue to support your  efficient and appreciated customer service &amp; shipping standards.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this alone without a stand or method of it being inverted, it&#x27;ll deteriorate really fast.</li>
            <li> But he really does like it a lot.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really got a basis for comparison, but I like it</li>
            <li> B000WNCD32 Williams mug shaving soap - 1.7 oz]] and the combination seeem to work very well while not breaking my wallet.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li> HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li> This brush is high quality and works well!</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys this brush.  </li>
            <li> Some brushes need to be replaced after a year they had shed so much.</li>
            <li> feel that I really like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience yet with safety razor shaving, but this brush is doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> I can lather up within a minute to get ready for my shave.</li>
            <li> This really helps get rid of the smell, and the lose bristles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like my Escali badger brush.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this brush for shaving and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> He uses it to lather&lt;br /&gt;a soap puck in a shaving mug, and the soap spreads really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like using a DE razor and shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it looks in the stand!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the very beginning</li>
            <li> By the way I grew up using straight razors and brushes...which gave me no problem.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There isn&#x27;t to much you can say about a  brush however you can&#x27;t beat this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well for dusting LEGO models.</li>
            <li> and now I am much happier.  </li>
            <li> The synthetic brush does not shed, is softer, and builds lather much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice shaving brush, only negative I will say is sometimes the brush hairs come out more</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> This brush is priced very well, and will do everything a shaving brush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It does its job very well</li>
            <li> It handles well in water and is very absorbent with shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold shape very well</li>
            <li> Smelled very animal like..  </li>
            <li> I really like this item, but I wish it did not shed as much of the hair as it does.</li>
            <li> The brush really picks the whiskers off my face and makes the shave so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Yes you&#x27;ll save some money, and yes it&#x27;s supposed to be real badger, but I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> and now that I have this brush and some real shave soap I am experiencing a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job in a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now got a synthetic brush for $25 that I really like.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It sometimes retains too much water, but this means an adjustment on my part.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking of starting to do some real shaving and dumping the pressure can chemicals and need a nice, low cost brush that performs well</li>
            <li> I think it does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;He says it really does the job.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks for the brush to really break in.</li>
            <li> I really like how well it works.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain much, but I have to say I would probably prefer Tank Riot.</li>
            <li> But, on the whole...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It feels very well built</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much being</li>
            <li> Its made very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems very durable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the seller shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and I find the quality is solid for its price.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of straight razors and sometimes a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Price was quite reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Very well produced and has increased my cream production and defiantly glides well with the 100% badger.</li>
            <li> i really like this brush,enjoy using it</li>
            <li> However, in my experience, the bristles on the Escali are much stiffer than the Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really a non-issue.</li>
            <li> this brush is a high quality product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not too much to write.</li>
            <li> so I feel comfortable writing a brief review.</li>
            <li> You do indeed get what you pay for, I did not expect much at all from this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the brush is very acceptable, holds plenty of water, makes plenty of lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used the brush it lather really and did the job.</li>
            <li> This brush does lather up very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay too much yet, as I figured it out, so I settled on the Escali Badger.  </li>
            <li> it does the job and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t shed much..</li>
            <li> It really builds lather well when paired with a scuttle.</li>
            <li> All very AOK.</li>
            <li> I really should have known - you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it over the weekend, it can expediatly fast as i was hoping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re ready to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is working really well</li>
            <li> Works as well as my parker, which cost 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The bristles hold up very well and don&#x27;t seem to be coming off any time soon.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really matter because the razor removed the badger hair just as well as it did my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush for anyone looking to get a real shaving kit.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than boar brissel.</li>
            <li> This brush was much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price I consider it a real bargain</li>
            <li> much to these</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> gets the job done as well as the one I have that out three times as much</li>
            <li> I wore out a boar brush from the drug store in about two months, so I was ready to upgrade to badger, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a fancy one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This one is much nicer</li>
            <li> They really scratched up my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hairs keep shedding but its nothing to worry much about.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> very bristle-y brush, i have had some hairs come out</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone using a straight razor to shave.</li>
            <li> Does have an interesting scent when wet.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a travel brush, as well as a cheap boar brush from the local grocery, and both outperformed this brush.</li>
            <li> Appears to be comparable to brushes costing twice as much.</li>
            <li> it dripped real hair oil.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this product for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really find this a very functional brush for lathering up for a shave.</li>
            <li> The part that goes against your face is wood, which is unusual.  </li>
            <li> The brush works well but the shave cream doesn&#x27;t penetrate the wood applicator very well</li>
            <li> I hope that the Badger did not suffer too much.</li>
            <li> Not too much,</li>
            <li> For the price you can really beat it.</li>
            <li> But once the cream was on it i couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few shaves, it did shed perhaps 6-8 long bristles per shave, but that seems to have stopped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much softer than the boar hair brushes I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This one is much nicer quality, and my husband likes it.</li>
            <li> Very prickly and the brushes keep falling out of the brush and get stuck to my face.  </li>
            <li> brush works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Wooden handle is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Soooo much softer than a boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, is very well made, bristles do not fall out or otherwise cause problems.  </li>
            <li> This brush really does the job whipping up foam and applying to beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fact I lose almost no bristles.</li>
            <li> Brush is well constructed and has held up very well for over a year.</li>
            <li> I found this brush very prickly.</li>
            <li> Really well made.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> if you get some shedding of bristles, it is normal to happen on the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> The Badger Brush is the absolute best!I bought the stand and the Merkur safety Razor to go with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works as designed.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Item got here fast and intact.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> Shed a whole month for me.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a need for a $100 brush, but I&#x27;ll be making the move to a Simpson very soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expect some shedding at first, it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Might be a defective brush or just a really crappy product.</li>
            <li> For the price I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just got into the wet shaving world (using a DE shaver on my legs has been an interesting transition).</li>
            <li> Great brush, once you get it broken in.  </li>
            <li> It is compact, but lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well with my Poraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It gets all over the place and absorbs too much water.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how much of a difference there was between my boar bristle and a badger brush with out spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Proraso has a much stronger smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!  </li>
            <li> use it every day thanks for a well made brush</li>
            <li> Badger hair is the gold standard for shaving brushes and the wood is of fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> it softens up the hairs and really holds a lot of water.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Check&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast...............</li>
            <li> He was working up to using a straight razor like his granddaddy</li>
            <li> Thanks to this shop</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It really changes the shaving experience, even if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> bought it with a tube of Proraso and works really well together.</li>
            <li> Not the prettiest, but again, for the price, you can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Now, you have two different generations who both enjoy Escali&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> Product works really well</li>
            <li> Makes the lather very well and spreads the soap well on the beard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice stray hairs coming out very often at all, and the integrity of the bristles have remained intact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it has a very pungent odor to it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s from a real animal.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed too much bristle loss.</li>
            <li> bristles are very skimpy and do not hold water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i really didn&#x27;t want a wood handle brush</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about 5 uses it is really broken in and works great with shaving soap and mug.</li>
            <li> My old brush rarely lost bristles.</li>
            <li> but once I go to face lather, the bristles get all bunched up don&#x27;t spread the soap very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t as much brush there to make lather.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li> I also get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> but it does very well.</li>
            <li> It holds a lather really well</li>
            <li> Recommend this seller highly!</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m applying too much pressure or what.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely an upgrade over the cheap low-quality drugstore brush I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this shave brush several weeks ago and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It holds water very well and lathers quite a bit even without tons a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful and knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li> Gentle brush, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> They really help a lot with application of shaving soap and cream.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet a sophisticated wet shaver</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend</li>
            <li> I have owned only cheap brushes up until I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the complaints about this brush and its quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real badger (not boar) and is priced at $13-14 dollars.</li>
            <li> What really bothers me is how much it sheds hair.</li>
            <li> I find that soaking it a coffee-cup full of hot water for a minute or so prior makes everything much easier.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> Ready to go.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> and works really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and very affordable</li>
            <li> and it makes lathering up much easier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> It was a very affordable brush, but it was to mushy on the face.</li>
            <li> Works very well with market shaving creams.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended it because he loves his so much.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing it against your face brings so much pleasure to shaving.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it with shave soap.</li>
            <li> and it should be much softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this brush for anyone starting with DE shaving, or just looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but seems solid.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the $10 brush</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li> Price was extremely reasonable and this is a very well built shaving brush.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It really holds the lather well</li>
            <li> Very well made with high-quality badger bristles.</li>
            <li> but if I rub it on my skin the lather doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very functional and has lasted me six months already.</li>
            <li> He really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> It worked very well in both instances.</li>
            <li> He commended on its styling and construction so much that I bought one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Well after about 2 weeks I cant say it has improved all that much.</li>
            <li> Fast service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth badger fur carcasses my face every morning in a way that camel hair brushes could only dream of.</li>
            <li> For an entry level brush that I wanted to be of quality and last - it has filled the bill.</li>
            <li> It sheds bristles with very use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this brush as much as I thought I would because hairs kept falling out.  </li>
            <li> what would have happened if I had taken it straight to my face from the package.  </li>
            <li> Real garbage.</li>
            <li> so I cannot really compare it to much.</li>
            <li> However I really like this one and its quality.</li>
            <li> Really lathers up nicer than the synthetic brushes</li>
            <li> Low quality but cheap.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much of a difference that this made with shaving.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> The product is really well made.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much...</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> and it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> - you got me a real badger shaving brush?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , everybody is very happy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Smooth coverage and has held up to daily use without issues.</li>
            <li> I guess those badgers are really stinky?</li>
            <li> take the time to learn how to condition the brush and get it ready for use.</li>
            <li> It wicks away water correctly, spreads evenly, and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Compared to a boar brush, the Escali feels prickly and doesn&#x27;t generate as much lather.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t happened since then and he really likes it now.</li>
            <li> It has a real wood handle, not plastic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was reasonably fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, along with a whole set of stuff.</li>
            <li> realize that this much cleaning may have impacted the quality of the brush as well, but I did not care.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> After spending a money on an Edwin Jagger razor, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shaving brush in case</li>
            <li> The thicker lather has changed the quality of his shave, and his skin feels so much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does make lather very well, and doesn&#x27;t retain water at all.</li>
            <li> These brushes are inexpensive and very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the hairs come out for week quite some time.</li>
            <li> but I really like the feel and quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> It is holding shape very well.</li>
            <li> B002WA0QGY Parker Safety Razor SYNTHETIC Bristle Shaving Brush with White handle and Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> has made the process much cleaner.</li>
            <li> So I really like the brush</li>
            <li> It is a very well made brush.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it almost daily.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like having the real thing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to my fellow DE and cut throat blade shavers!</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, also.</li>
            <li> It lost so much hair on every use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> shave straight razor</li>
            <li> Works well but hairs fall out a lot more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never used one before, so make sure it&#x27;s wet beforehand</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not an expert, but it seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> The process of lathering prepares the skin for a very close shave and has also reduced the ingrown hair issue</li>
            <li> but since this is my first brush, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if this was normal or not.</li>
            <li> He really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> I had a synthetic brush from a big-box retailer and wanted to give real badger hair a try.  </li>
            <li> I really like the experience of using the brush</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s a much nicer brush than the one he started out with from Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So it must be real badger hair.  </li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really say much about the durability -</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to replace this one with an Omega boar bristle brush here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush to replace one that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> It broke in really fast and no noticeable odor.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I also have an Escali stainless steel razor and brush stand.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My initial purchase included a cheap brush, bowl and soap.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a nice product at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> really makes it rather unusable.</li>
            <li> I gently squeeze the soap and water from the brush</li>
            <li> The brush is off quality construction, and it doesn&#x27;t get much manlier than rubbing your face with badger hairs.  </li>
            <li> Very afforadable badger brush option.  </li>
            <li> and it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as part of a whole set up for my husband to try the double-edge razor shave and ditch the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price.</li>
            <li> After a year of use it doesn&#x27;t shed hairs much anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it wasent to much</li>
            <li> and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS GENTLE AS</li>
            <li> very &#x27;farmy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend Google on how to break in a badger brush ,it really helped.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the fanciest badger brush, but it suffices well enough to give one hell of a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Makes no difference to me really</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great brush now that it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> my Daddy used to get with his straight razor and the soap I mentioned</li>
            <li> care for the Escali inscription, but that is really &amp;#34;splitting hairs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I can see how that would cause issues with the wood/bristles (for any brush really).</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> After years of applying shaving cream by hand,my husband is amazed at how much he loves using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t take much time to research or read reviews.</li>
            <li> He is much happier with your brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are durable because they are real badger hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Among the brushes featured on Amazon, I found this Escali brush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I bought a (separate) stainless steel stand</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Straight to the trash can.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me think it is 100% badger because the bristles smell like real animal hair.</li>
            <li> It sounds fussy but you can drop $150 and it will rot just as fast.</li>
            <li> After use I gently rinse the brush and hang from a stand so that bristles point downwards.</li>
            <li> and I realized I was using too much soap to load on the brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a travel size brush and very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was the cheapest one I could find (just wanted to try wet shaving), but also it had many favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works</li>
            <li> Much needed improvement for my shaves.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> wery fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The badger is much nicer on your face than boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to check if the badger haired brushes are for them.</li>
            <li> Well I love it, it lathers good with my proraso soap and after the first few shaves no more hairs are coming out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get in there.</li>
            <li> While the price is extremely reasonable for this brush, it is no &amp;#34;bargain product&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but will shed too much on you soon in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Seller ships fast and inexpensively.</li>
            <li> would absolutely reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> But he was using just a very inexpensive brush</li>
            <li> This is the real deal when it comes to badger hair shaving brushes</li>
            <li> I have since bought this as a gift, after liking mine so much.</li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> I guess the bristles aren&#x27;t washed very well before assembly.  </li>
            <li> Makes things so much easier when using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from Perella&#x27;s and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very durable as I have yet to see it lose any strands</li>
            <li> Shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Combined with the ethical concerns about badger treatment, I have no hesitation saying:</li>
            <li> I was very disaapointed as the brush and the ad do not do what they say they do.</li>
            <li> need to pay 5 times as much for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> My fiance said it worked really well and helped reduce cuts from shaving.</li>
            <li> In the end do not expect too much.</li>
            <li> Seller was fast and convient to deal with.</li>
            <li> It does hold lather very well once you get it built up.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed any loss of bristles.</li>
            <li> its real badger hair or what.</li>
            <li> It really sheds in the beginning...</li>
            <li> No issues really.  </li>
            <li> The brush has really softened up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched over to my straight blades, shaving soaps, and this quality badger brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun for years, and never realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a close shave, so I decided to give the safety razor a try.</li>
            <li> Always worked very well.</li>
            <li> It seems to lose a couple hairs here and there, but I really like using a brush.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m not paying $30 for a brush when I can get one much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift about two years ago, and I really prefer this method over shaving cream</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t shed much as yet.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday (a whole shaving set) for his birthday</li>
            <li> This one is inexpensive and does the trick very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money on some fancy pants silver tipped badger brush, not knowing if I would continue using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Bristles are more sturdy and the wooden handle is unblemished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good beginner brush, but as the title says, it loses a hair or two with every use.</li>
            <li> Also thanks for the easy open package as he is older and has arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li> There are far better brushes out there at a similar price point.</li>
            <li> I tried soaking it in a solution of dishwashing liquid and warm water for a few hours and after rinsing it i tried it out.</li>
            <li> Overall, for an economically priced brush you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my shaves since I got this.</li>
            <li> It must be soaked in warm water for a few minutes before lathering soap or cream.  </li>
            <li> Soak the brush in warm water for a few minutes, shake excess water and lather up cream and soap mix.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the brush the few times I used.</li>
            <li> good news is that at least the bristles don&#x27;t come off the brush</li>
            <li> He was so pleased with this brush he actually threw the old one away.</li>
            <li> Thought the Escali would be at least as good as the one at Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Good brush and soft enough on my face, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I would bet dollars to donuts that the people giving this brush good reviews simply have not experienced better brushes.  </li>
            <li> After a few months the bristles did soften but personally i liked them stiffer.</li>
            <li> So far it has stood up to the abuse of my daily shaving and not being able to care for it as well as I should.</li>
            <li> Mine is kind of &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; in how it was applied and dried.  </li>
            <li> My review was not overly harsh, but it was honest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush for a few weeks, it does a nice job of lathering up the shaving soap that I use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to see that, after only one use, many of the hairs fall off this brush into my shaving cream when I apply it to the brush.  </li>
            <li> Have recently started using this and Taylor of old bond street shaving cream and love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the feel (not too soft, not too coarse).  </li>
            <li> It has a nice wooden look and holds water well for proper lathering.  </li>
            <li> Really nice feel, bristles are firmly in place.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast but bristles shed a bit more than expected.</li>
            <li> It was good when I initially started wet shaving, but I have moved on to better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush seems pretty durable, the first couple uses so far I have had hairs shed from the brush into my lather</li>
            <li> so I wan to be honest.</li>
            <li> Going from a disposable blade and canned shaving cream applied directly to my face to this makes a daily chore into an enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li> Holding lots of warm water and producing heavy lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old and am now enjoying a proper shave the way it should have</li>
            <li> Only the second brush I own</li>
            <li> Good performance for the price but did lose a lot of bristles initially even with careful handling.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not honey badger, but good luck killing one of those suckers.</li>
            <li> will say it loses bristles a good bit</li>
            <li> I have had a good experience creating a thick lather without tons of lathering experience.</li>
            <li> Did have a good amount of sheading early on, maybe first three weeks, then no more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a comfort knowing that in addition to the sheer enjoyment of using the brush with its good robust bristles in play after tuning up with the aforementioned warm water enervated lather, at the end of the day I also will find this an economical way to stay in the game.</li>
            <li> I can get a good thick lather in not time at all.  </li>
            <li> I can whip up a good thick creamy foam without too much trial and error.</li>
            <li> Provides good and thick lather</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is not a huge deal.  </li>
            <li> This is a great basic shaving brush - it&#x27;s a little stiff, and will shed bristles if you abuse it, but overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> One great little shaving brush, it&#x27;s holding original form if needed will buy another down the road!</li>
            <li> Not a little, but more like I&#x27;d just shot one and thrown it in the back seat of my car.</li>
            <li> Super soft and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> However my experience so far has been very positive.  </li>
            <li> A little smaller than i was expecting but very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> Also, some reviewers say that the brush feels a bit stiff and prickly at first but in my opinion, it felt nice and soft since its first use, maybe I have tougher skin</li>
            <li> The wet badger smell goes away pretty quick after a few good rinses and soaks.</li>
            <li> The Brush is great... a little stiff at first but smoothed out wonderfully quick.  </li>
            <li> The brush does exactly what I expect it to do and cost a good bit less than the \\&quot;next level\\&quot; up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product,,  Arrived when stated,&lt;br /&gt;Quality of brush is good&lt;br /&gt;Would have been better if it included a stand, as has to be left upside down to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor and this is my first shaving brush, which is just to say that I am no expert and don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this to, in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try shaving with a safety razor for the first time in years just to see if there was much difference, and that included buying new shaving soap and a brush.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this as a set with my new safety razer, at first i didn&#x27;t think i was going to use it as much</li>
            <li> Recently in New York I had my first straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this brush is great.  </li>
            <li> Mine fits perfectly and allows the brush to dry properly with the bristles pointing down.</li>
            <li> Fine brush overall, particularly at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I dry it (as prior experience taught me) with the bristles hanging down from a holder, and each shave is perfect.  </li>
            <li> ( I skip the mug and rub the brush loaded with soap directly on my face) and this one is very nicely done , the bristles are soft on your face and the wooden handle has a nice grip , remember to get a stand since brushes must be stored vertically with the bristles down to keep them dry .</li>
            <li> I wash mine out, dab it on the towel to take out the excess water, smooth the hairs out to keep the original shape and hang it back in the rack, not rack - that was unjust, the &#x27;double edged razor and brush cradle&#x27;</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not doing as much research as I should have and wound up on the page for this brush due to the fact that it had such good reviews.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps losing a few hairs but overall very nice feel.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the box, I was prepared for that NEW badger smell but to my surprise NO ODOR.  </li>
            <li> Being new to the safety razor, and  first time using shaving cream, it should be noted that I&#x27;m still learning the art of application.  </li>
            <li> Using this for the first time along my new Proraso Shaving Soap has been an awakening experience for me to say</li>
            <li> new brush lost 1 or 2 hairs the first two shaves, but since has not lost any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> when new (maybe one or two strands the first two or three times I used it).  </li>
            <li> Being new to safety razor shaving, this is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> First lather on shave soap showed some brown oily residue, I figured since the brush was brand new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this is my first brush.  </li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving, this is my first brush</li>
            <li> It was my first &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; shaving accessory to use with my newly acquired shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The store jumped right on the problem and fixed it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, a bit stiff, but it may soften with use.</li>
            <li> * Doesn&#x27;t require break-in, soft right out of the box</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this brush is just right; some brushes are too prickly.</li>
            <li> He uses it every day with a Merkur razor and just bought himself a stand so it can dry upside down and stay in great condition.</li>
            <li> Not very expensive is matched by the quality.  </li>
            <li> After every shave, I have long badger hair in my blade that washes off easily</li>
            <li> Very first brush, decided to try this after using regular shaving cream, then shaving gels (Aveeno), then higher end shaving gels (Proraso), and now shaving soap (Proraso).    </li>
            <li> I love a creamy product from Real Shave and wanted to apply it with something other than rubbing my hads together.  </li>
            <li> Dries back to original shape really well.</li>
            <li> On my very first shave, I may not have known exactly what to expect, but I knew I had watched enough videos on YouTube about loading a brush and creating a lather to know that the Proraso puck shouldn&#x27;t have been caked with &amp;</li>
            <li> so he can&#x27;t compare it to other badger brushes but &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a WHOLE LOT better than synthetic brushes&amp;#34; and for the price</li>
            <li> Now I have no problems at all, no bad smell, and rarely do I have a loose bristle.</li>
            <li> As many before me have said, is is a smelly, stiff brush right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Picked this shaving brush primarily for low price.&lt;br /&gt;Six months into using it, and it&#x27;s performing as well as the $50 dollar shaving brush I bought 20 years ago when it was new!</li>
            <li> does exactly what is supposed to do, very soft, saves a lot of shaving cream..</li>
            <li> before i would have some trouble creating a rich enough lather even with a quality soap but with the Escali lathering up is super easy.</li>
            <li> I am new to all the rage over wet-shaving with a single blade, and this shaving brush more than meets my requirements for value and performance.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it easily lays down a nice layer of cream.</li>
            <li> It retains enough hot water that I can get a nice warm lather at least two times and a decent lather the third time (in case I missed any spots).</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this brush.</li>
            <li> The customer service experience definitely made up for whatever defects existed on the original product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying a boar hair brush off of Amazon, as there are other vendors that sell them at better prices.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s still better than a synthetic brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for father&#x27;s day, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Just glad it&#x27;s not made from other types of hair I guess.</li>
            <li> Badger is better than Boar and these bristles don&#x27;t \\&quot;shed\\&quot; as other brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I was able to glue it back together, but even considering that the brush doesn&#x27;t have the same quality it did after first purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Most other market and drug stores had nothing but shave cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> I realize it is Badger hair, but the first time I used it, WOW!  </li>
            <li> I have read a lot of other reviews on here about how many hairs</li>
            <li> Others reported better performance may be due to quality consistency.</li>
            <li> I know love shaving due to the feel of this as well as the aroma of the shaving cream that I use.</li>
            <li> Got my hubby this brush along with other items for Christmas and he now shaves more often.</li>
            <li> The hair is really sharp and didn&#x27;t seem to get any better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more petite than other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many other hairs in this brush</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other brushes that cost more</li>
            <li> As noted by other reviewers, this does have a &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; scent to it--if you don&#x27;t mind that kinda musky smell, it is okay.  </li>
            <li> , this thing rivals other 100% badger shaving brushes that cost 4x more.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a bit better based on other reviews I saw.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to consider a significant problem, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I could due to hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a month now, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> With this brush I can produce a big handfull of rich foam every time.  </li>
            <li> One of the first things I noticed about it was its distinctive musk, which, while enjoyable, was unanticipated and only served to increase my appreciation for this brush even further.</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m glad I bought this first before investing in more expensive shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that most badger brushes are probably a little &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my original one for regular use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, The only problem a i have is that it sheds a little, i hope its because its new, but other than that keeps a good lather .</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves his new badger hair brush and says it lathers twice as well as his old brush and is 10 times better overall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend using a pure badger shaving brush, specifically this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Pure Badger Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a large, high price, super-duper, silver tip badger brush that I use at home.  </li>
            <li> you can find several online guides on how to make good lather, select right soap, and take proper care of the brush for its long life.</li>
            <li> I like very much the lather this brush produces on my face and am quite pleased with its non-funky smell now that it has been used a few times.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and enjoy using it daily.</li>
            <li> He gave me a cheap plastic stand to have the fur/hair facing down after a good rinsing and said I should think about buying another brush to rotate if I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, hardly sheds bristles, and I like it so much</li>
            <li> Hands down best brush I have ever owned, it is very soft on the skin, but strong enough to create thick foam.</li>
            <li> Good for starting out, perhaps, if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend extra clean up time cleaning the scuttle /</li>
            <li> After a shave, it&#x27;s easy to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say nothing out of the ordinary -- great brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I feel for the price it is a decent brush to start with when one looks at how much a high-end brush would cost.</li>
            <li> More than a few hairs fell out on first use, but it seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> handle is simple and clean...  </li>
            <li> the stink was nearly completely gone, and the brush was much softer than it was when I first got</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It is comfortable on my face and performs exactly how I expected it to.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that it has real badger hair, the hairs in the brush even have a natural smell and the first time I soaked it in water</li>
            <li> I am not one to indulge the &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;S GREAT&amp;#34; reviews, because they don&#x27;t really give you a realistic expectation.</li>
            <li> All the same, you can&#x27;t argue with the cool factor of anyone that shaves with a brush and straight razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and dry.</li>
            <li> I think this is normal first-use wear out of a badger brush as I only lightly whipped up the soap</li>
            <li> I lost something like 15-20 hairs the first use and a few more reliably on each use.  </li>
            <li> For the first week or so bristles would come off regularly but it is quite rare now.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the $80 brushes can offer that would make them worth $67 more than this brush.  </li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean than my prior brush.  </li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs in the first couple uses, but not any more</li>
            <li> The overall design of the brush is a bit small, which is great if you like to lather while holding with your finger tips.</li>
            <li> I had to wash and rinse it several times before it rinsed clean.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, if you are on a budget this brush is perfectly good.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to completely void the brush of shaving cream after each use to maintain the integrity of the brush for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice brush and yes a few bristles will be lost but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> can see that we will have a long lasting and loving relationship together.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would add that this has a good sized handle for those of us with bigger than average hands.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, but not the one that will last in the long haul.</li>
            <li> Seriously, mate... take good careof this brush.</li>
            <li> Not only was it made of durable, natural materials, but also the bristles were 100% pure badger hair-- the most frequently recommended bristle material for an old-timey shave.  </li>
            <li> have the super cheap &#x27;Van Der Hagen&#x27; set as well, and the Escali brush, while an improvement, is not a significant improvement over the plastic handled boar hair brush included in that</li>
            <li> I had a $60 AOS badger before (last almost 3 years) which was really good and this badger has less bristles than it but still gave the same rich lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a large brush but certainly more than adequate for my shaving needs, I actually like the size.  </li>
            <li> On first use it shed a few hairs but other than that it was great.</li>
            <li> After the first week, the brush was extremely comfortable to use, sheds very little, and smells like whatever shave cream I most recently used with it.</li>
            <li> It holds a very large amount of water and it is very fast to clean to be put up for later for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> This brush does loose a lot of hair initially, but a great brush overall.</li>
            <li> a few hairs have come loose, overall an excellent starter brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost very few bristles and it makes great larger.</li>
            <li> Sure there are more expensive brushes, but for the price this one seems well constructed with a smooth wooden handle.</li>
            <li> It is soft, made of quality bristles, and was very reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable, high quality badger hair shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It is built well, from high quality materials,  and is very aesthetically pleasing to have on your counter in a brush and razor holder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a well made brush, it really gets the saving cream into your beard, evenly spread--I highly recommend from anyone, beginner to expert.</li>
            <li> Nice later from regular soap, smell of badger was stronger when I first got it, but now after a year it is barely there.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and lathers very very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced starter brush.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> After recently switching to the big leagues of shaving, with natural shave soap/cream and a safety razor, I needed a good brush to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of practice to learn exactly how much water to leave in the brush, and it turns out I like a little more water than most men.  </li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and I am thoroughly enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, but this brush has made it an extremely enjoyable experience.  </li>
            <li> And finally, a hint if you don&#x27;t want to take up counterspace with a special brush drying rack.  </li>
            <li> So, with that in consideration, I have been using this brush for only a short time and it does most certainly shed, to the extent that I had to fish out the hairs out of the shaving cream bowl as it was looking rather</li>
            <li> Be careful just with the name, 100% PURE is the lower end of badger brushes; they go all the way up to silvertip which I learned is much more soft and</li>
            <li> My father wanted to try traditional shaving, so having watched barbers on film for years, we went for the Escali shaving brush (with some special shaving soap).  </li>
            <li> I chose this brush because of the low price and high reviews; I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> You can easily see loose hairs that are protruding from the brush before you put it on your face - it&#x27;s nothing truly bothersome.</li>
            <li> great brush, slight smell, but expected with animal hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Some soap like more or less soap, so you will have to figure out how much water to shake out.</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry it completely before putting it away.</li>
            <li> He loves it and it is super soft on his sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brush was not super coarse and felt good against the skin.</li>
            <li> Most real boar bristle shaving brushes typically cost $30-$50.</li>
            <li> a week).&lt;br /&gt;The badger-ish aroma was strong, but after several uses, it&#x27;s faded away completely on</li>
            <li> I found one badger hair brush that was about half the size of this brush which, by the way, is probably a standard size brush which is a good size to me.</li>
            <li> I previously was using a tweezerman in the same price range, and based on good reviews ordered this one.</li>
            <li> After almost half a year of use I am ready to upgrade to a better quality brush.</li>
            <li> I use it with a wet / dry razor and it all works good.  </li>
            <li> More often than not, with the first few uses, you notice hairs bristles come out before it get settle (high end brushes).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent choice for someone new to wet shaving, though it does shed more than a brush should.</li>
            <li> I started researching for a new, inexpensive brush and selected The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews the brush did shed a bit when I first got it then stopped after a week, so this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li> Wow, Using a badger brush makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this brush is good, and the weird &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; smell weans in about 2 to 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check back in a few months to review the durability, but so far, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other posts that it did feel a bit prickly at first, but now is butter smooth.</li>
            <li> Essential tool for a great traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and everything that I read made it clear a badger hair brush is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a great bush to use daily or add to the daily rotation as some wet shavers are doing these days, ask me how I know...</li>
            <li> Now I know that my brush will last a long, long time and looks great sitting in the stand on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for a few weeks, and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice firm brush and he loves it!</li>
            <li> The brush feels really soft and applies the cream pretty evenly</li>
            <li> It is nice to buy from a small company.  </li>
            <li> and is really soft, granted it looses bristles from every use, the majority that do fall are in the first use, after that it&#x27;s maybe one or two here and there.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, it&#x27;s a good brush, IMO, but not really as good as the Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> the smell went away for the MOST part when i squeezed the water out, but as i did that, a the water was a dark reddish/brownish color.</li>
            <li> Everyone complained about bristles falling out, but I have experienced the same problem with many other brushes.</li>
            <li> Run hot water on it for a few seconds and enjoy the hot lather.</li>
            <li> On the first use the brush lost nearly 50 hairs.</li>
            <li> My old one was pretty shot.  </li>
            <li> Being conscious about hygiene i thought i should first give the brush a wash before using it.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush and still frequently used in my rotation.</li>
            <li> Was not sure which kind to get</li>
            <li> This brush has held up pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> you know exactly what the material is because your face is a sensitive area of your body.</li>
            <li> This is my first time going old school and using a shaving brush with a merkur razor.</li>
            <li> This is the first badger hair brush I have used, and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Kind of a small handle</li>
            <li> I think he feels extra cool using it to whip up a shaving lather :0</li>
            <li> I was surprised that all the hair was falling off at the first use - this never happens.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty soft out of the box and holds water and cream</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll continue making my own shaving lather.  </li>
            <li> (as this is my first one), but I was kind of surprised :/</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scratchy; 2) the hairs are already loosening after only a few uses; 3) most importantly, it smells like a badger.</li>
            <li> Soft, holds hot water longer.</li>
            <li> The full badger is a definite step up from</li>
            <li> It works well, dries quickly, and I very rarely lose any hairs out of it even with some heavy lathering.</li>
            <li> spreads my shaving soap just fine, but it lose bristles every single time and it forces me to scratch my face while removing the bristle, and then i have to reapply shaving soap to the area.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, outstanding quality and no problem whatsoever like other shaving brushes with any distinct unpleasant odor!</li>
            <li> and Amazon shouldn&#x27;t make me put down more words than I need to review a product.</li>
            <li> If you use a badger brush to shave, make sure it is bristles down in a holder when not in use.  </li>
            <li> sure that you store it vertically, with the bristles hanging down.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you hang it upside down or on its side though to help it maintain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sure to care for it correctly by hanging it bristles down in a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll leave an updated review down the road after some more use.</li>
            <li> Be sure to store with the bristles down so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the handle and loosen the bristle glue.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hang this brush side down when storing it or the brush may get ruined.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are pretty soft, but I have an older brush from Tweezerman that is</li>
            <li> Very natural and pure badger hair.  </li>
            <li> I have found everyone usually trys to find the cheapest they can live with while the select few will drop a butt load on the best without experimenting.  </li>
            <li> A nicer and more expensive brush would be nice, but I&#x27;m stepping into these waters slowly and this brush was perfect for where I currently am with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> far as the seller goes, they shipped a terrific product, shipped quickly, and the item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I can afford the pricier models, but I get this one and bank the savings in my little girl&#x27;s college fund and feel good about the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten a much bigger bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> I can afford the pricier models, but I get this one and bank the savings in my little girl&#x27;s college fund and feel good about the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten a much bigger bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush but a little smaller than what I was used to .</li>
            <li> The overall feel is good after I learned that I have to apply at an angle an not perpendicular to my face as it is a little bit prickly that way.</li>
            <li> Good brush, lathers well but just a little big.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves his new shaving brush!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this new shaving brush!  </li>
            <li> But an average boar brush will scrub better unless you go with high end badger brushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Produces a good lather (using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream), and while it did lose 7 or 8 bristles upon first use (and a couple during each of the next few shaves), it no longer sheds.</li>
            <li> I also made sure to order the stand for the brush &amp; razor after learning how important it is to let the brush dry with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also capable of whipping up a nice lather with hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality seems very high and so far it is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t top of the line Silvertip Badger, the badger hair in this brush provides a rich wet lather with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that only the loose hairs were falling out and that after a while It would stop, but no, I have had it for months and every morning more hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole shave soap, brush, and safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Much like another reviewer, I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and using a brush to apply cream/soap.  </li>
            <li> I like it even new, and not broken in</li>
            <li> He really likes his new shaving brush and tells others too.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush, but I am very impress with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of safety razor shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this brush to, but ice used it for a week now</li>
            <li> I just received a new brush that cost twice as much,  Guess what?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with these brushes because I am new to using them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an entry point into &amp;#34;shaving like my grandfather&amp;#34; and while I am really sold on the new way of shaving this brush has shed every time I have used it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this like 2 years ago and still does the job really well ... thinking about ordering a new one again</li>
            <li> My husband really loves using his new shaving brush with the shave bars I made him.</li>
            <li> You can get a highly regarded quality Boars hair brush like the Semogue 1305 for just a few dollars more, but if you are committed to wet shaving, you might want to go a little bit further and get the Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great, just a few hairs have come out which was expected.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for a while now and the Escali brush is easy to recommend.</li>
            <li> Cost less than most boar hair shaving brushes I&#x27;ve seen in stores.  </li>
            <li> But even if they don&#x27;t I&#x27;m ok with that because it cost me less than $15</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the typical drugstore brands I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can get a better brush for less than $60 in the mall or antique shop as I have tried both.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush makes shaving less of a chore and more of a ritual to start your day or night.</li>
            <li> Some days it would be just a couple, others easily a half dozen or more.</li>
            <li> The brush creates a much better lather than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> handle is stout and fairly easy to hold even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with shaving cream (from Bath &amp; Body Works) instead of shaving soap, but I am using much less of the cream with this brush, plus i feel like i&#x27;m getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li> and all i can say this has improved my lathering alot and get a better shave then previous times.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to lather up, and it isn&#x27;t rough.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure pricier brushes lose less though).</li>
            <li> I have had this brush less than a month, but am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> My previous supermarket cheapy went 9 years and still had more hair than I.  </li>
            <li> and it is a better brush than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I tried the shaving brush and Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream and feel like I&#x27;m getting a better shave, easier to apply and using less cream</li>
            <li> previous brush was one of the ones you buy off the shelf in Walmart, and this one does perform better.</li>
            <li> As a wet shave beginner, this seemed like an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> He says he can tell it&#x27;s much better than the camel hair brush he was previously using.</li>
            <li> is to just use the top half of the brush in rapid circular strokes</li>
            <li> The reviews mentioned the boar bristle brushes typically have more body to them.</li>
            <li> Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it creates a much better lather than previous brushes I have owned.</li>
            <li> it is slightly prickly, but thats ok.</li>
            <li> Better size than the previous one was I was using from a start up package.</li>
            <li> Bristles are firm, but not at prickly as my old one, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes great lather and does not leave behind bristles, ever, so far anyway.</li>
            <li> my older brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely be looking for a better product and different brand!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a decent shaving brush for a while</li>
            <li> I would recommend soaking it it warm water for a few minutes to take away the natural smell it has.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving brush to replace my older shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The critter odor does dissipate after a couple weeks of steady use.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying a cheaper product that is rated decently, because that&#x27;s what this brush is: decent.    </li>
            <li> A classic, &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> So, I mainly went off the reviews from others.  </li>
            <li> Got this to replace an older bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help reduce irritation, which is my main purpose for buying the brush.</li>
            <li> Badger hair brushes are not cheap, but the price of the ESCALI takes the financial pain out of owning a good quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I had bought an inexpensive brush from a local store and it fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li> Good enough for everyday shaving, and priced so that you can toss it into your shave bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Its decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased an older shaving brush at an estate sale, which got me started using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Has lost a decent amount of bristles.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I have with it is hairs are coming out of it in clumps and at this rate it will only last me a month or two at most.</li>
            <li> Three main problems&lt;</li>
            <li> Once you use it a few times it fans out more and really works well</li>
            <li> It works very well, I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and so far it&#x27;s holding up very well</li>
            <li> Decent brush for the money</li>
            <li> A decent shaving brush for beginners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> A decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am sure that&#x27;s why some are much more expensive</li>
            <li> I ordered a much more expensive brush, hopefully its better then this.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a decent, no frills shaving brush...</li>
            <li> It is a decent beginner brush and will do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve never used any of the more expensive, high-end brushes, I&#x27;m sure there are nicer ones out there</li>
            <li> Classic cream-colored wood handle.</li>
            <li> hope I don&#x27;t have to replace it any time soon, but if I do (accident, loss), I&#x27;d most likely buy the same brush, from here!</li>
            <li> I will most likely give it 5 stars in the future if it stops losing a couple bristles with every shave.</li>
            <li> You actually end up applying lather with the side of the brush more than the actual tip.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my husband because he wanted to keep a brush in our downstairs bathroom and our main bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Better than products 5-6 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> Be realistic when considering this brush.  </li>
            <li> Looks classic.</li>
            <li> This brush is of decent quality.</li>
            <li> It is adequate but just a tiny bit skimpy in that regard.  </li>
            <li> After having a beard for many years, I decided to go back to a younger, cleaner look and started shaving again.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend for people on a budget and still want a decent shave.</li>
            <li> No odor like tweezerman, decent size, works well.</li>
            <li> He loves it and I will most likely purchase one in the future.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;would definitely consider choose a better quality the next time !</li>
            <li> Decent brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does shed off some hairs over time, but even after almost daily use for a more than a year it  still seems to have about 70 percent brush hairs left.</li>
            <li> This product just works and for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that that bristles get all stuck together and matted.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li> My old brush which I&#x27;m ready to replace does a much nicer job than this one.</li>
            <li> The main reason I gave this 4 stars is the price.</li>
            <li> I have three main points as to why I deducted stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems you gotta spend fifty bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li> There is no funky smell, it works well, and has not fallen apart after 2 weeks of steady use.</li>
            <li> This was more a brush to ease my way into wetshaving without spending a lot, and I&#x27;ll likely make a future purchase for a nicer brush.</li>
            <li> A decent Badger haired brush can cost you over $100.00.</li>
            <li> as I started using my Lavender shave cream daily, that smell quickly</li>
            <li> main point is that the brush works and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Even if you could work up a decent lather with it, it can&#x27;t hold the lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since any experience has made me want to repeat it as quickly, and often as possible and this brush help&#x27;s make DE shaving that experience.  </li>
            <li> After only three days in my shower (NOT in direct contact with water) the plastic-y film that makes the wood smooth and shiny looking is chipping off.</li>
            <li> Why spend any more money on a much more expensive brush?  </li>
            <li> but it gets the job done for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick fix by throwing some epoxy on it and sticking it back it</li>
            <li> A decent starter brush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use a mild soap, consider a different brush.</li>
            <li> My main concern at the moment is the amount of hairs it sheds.</li>
            <li> After several cleanings the brush has lost its odor and softened up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I recently left my Art of Shaving (lower end) brush in a hotel room and needed one quick.</li>
            <li> The issue with my particular brush was a one time issue.</li>
            <li> and I cannot see how much better it can get with more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to appreciate this Escali brush more, now that I&#x27;ve compared it to a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> But for now, it works, and for the price, I would say it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been shedding steadily into my soap since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent shave brush</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but want a decent brush get an Omega than.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not losing too much bristle when I clean it and comb it once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> After watching a couple YouTube clips on proper usage (newbie to using a safety razor/shaving balm) use this brush every morning to make a great thick foam.</li>
            <li> It lathers the cream, and puts it onto your face before you shave, and it does a decent job of it.</li>
            <li> Whips up a nice fluffy lather in no time and then applies the lather softly.</li>
            <li> This product is decent.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection, but I was expecting a decent product.  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, but I am wonderfully satisfied with it over against the boar brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> several week late, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> first couple of times there was some hair loss and a funny order, but the last 2 times no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find maybe 3 hairs that fall out each shave, but it isn&#x27;t really an issue--I think most of these lose a few each shave.</li>
            <li> Decent badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li> The local retails store offered a similar shaving brush for more than three time the cost of this produce.  </li>
            <li> I will likely buy a couple more for my adults sons for their next birthdays.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, nice heft to the handle but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I finally got around to using my brush tonight after my old fairly cheap badger brush broke.</li>
            <li> The brush held water well and helped give a quick lather, but I noticed that the lather started to go from a shiny white to off-white and eventually darker and darker.</li>
            <li> This newer one has a different finish on its handle, it is more of a sealant, similar to Semogue wood handles, than a varnish like on the older version.</li>
            <li> more than several bristles have fallen out and still occasionally one comes out after a couple weeks of shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Decent brush.</li>
            <li> so it may give off a smell initially, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> After that initial wash / prep, I only had 2-3 more bristles fall of during my shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the history to compare and rate the quality of the brush, seems decent.  </li>
            <li> I discovered the benefits of the badger hair brush and bought this particular based on the price point and reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> Use short quick circular motions to apply the foam to the face.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to get some decent equipment.</li>
            <li> As a result...shaving is quick and simple.</li>
            <li> a bit smaller than I expected but nicely made</li>
            <li> but then i just put super glue and left it over night.</li>
            <li> Decent brush.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ever shaved with brush and regular razor before, but I love the feel of both and the low cost!</li>
            <li> Most people who only get 6 months out of a brush are not properly handling it during use.</li>
            <li> As soon as I am able I will try a more expensive brush to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Mother downside is the strong animal smell when the brush was wet.  </li>
            <li> The hairs seem strongly seated in the handle after about 10 shaves, with minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> Not really that strong.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a brush so some of my complaints might just be part of the whole dynamic of a pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little stiff vs. ideal for me, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> The price is fair, but it does loose hairs like some other people have said.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as my thirty-year-old fine English badger, which would probably cost in the hundreds now, but it makes foam easier and seems to be a little better at raising the stubble.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little pokey to my sensitive face, but love the hot lather shave that results.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and holds in the soap very well when I shave.</li>
            <li> This brush has worn in well and has become very soft and bristle fast.  </li>
            <li> The brush is reasonably priced and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and pliable giving a very even application of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO INTERESTED PARTIES: this brush MUST be stored hanging upside-down or on its side; the flat part of the handle easily supports the brush in an upright position, but if you store it that way after using it, the brush will not only start to get a funky smell</li>
            <li> Also, most brushed result in using less shaving cream, but this brush actually requires more than normal.</li>
            <li> I observed very very few hair loss from the brush in the first 2 months of use which is really phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well so far!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are a little softer than I would prefer, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Most of which complained about quality and hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the brush pretty fast</li>
            <li> I bought this brush when I was first getting into double edge razors and wet shaving, and did not know any better, and hope this review saves someone else money</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is made with quality and has very soft badger hair!</li>
            <li> Delivered very promptly, I think even one day early!</li>
            <li> My very first use with this brush and it was relatively coarse, although it did get the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very soft and supple!</li>
            <li> Spend an extra $5-8 and get a good boar brush, that will last you a long time</li>
            <li> told there are some cheap ones at walmart i can try until i can shell out some more money for a higher priced brush, and i think ill try that.</li>
            <li> It left a few bristles on my face and I would expect that over time it will lose some bristles but it kind of worried me when it lost some the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> nice wood handle, lost only a few bristles at first, and has been stable</li>
            <li> I expected and compared to others I&#x27;ve tried using before, the bristles seem not to be as firm as the higher dollar ones, but for $12 or so, its a good way to try out the brush/shaving soap method.</li>
            <li> It produces a good, thick lather and makes shaving a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am new to the old school technique of shaving and this is the first brush that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Great brush for price a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> Stiff but soft bristles make a nice lather and scrub the face well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough so that I can build a good lather.</li>
            <li> Started out kinda of stiff but, over time has become nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for more than a month of daily shaving and can report that it is sturdy, soft and just as good as the more expensive products I have previously used.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the brush performance relative to my previous synthetic brush.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the brush thoroughly and hang it with the bristles down to dry.</li>
            <li> It had a strong animal smell for the first few uses, but the smell is almost gone now.  </li>
            <li> For my first few shaves, the scent of animal hair was extremely strong.  </li>
            <li> That said, I do not notice the brush being any less full or useful, just a bit disconcerting that it keeps losing bristles.</li>
            <li> The smell from the brush faded over the first few uses, but remained strong.</li>
            <li> It shed quite a bit over the first few uses, but I&#x27;m now at a month in and it is holding strong.</li>
            <li> I will mention that is has a pretty strong animal smell at the beginning and is somewhat rough but after running it through hot water and shaving cream several times, the smell has gone away and the hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money,had it a couple of weeks with no major issues, still sheds a little</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone who is looking at getting into the correct was to shave.</li>

            <li> When it is time for me to get a new one I will more then likely purchase this same one.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it about 100 bristles fell out, making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean , Shake to Fluff &amp; Dry .</li>
            <li> It has a very affordable price compared to some of the other available shaving brushes, $12 vs $50 approx.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot of hair and has a smell of a dead animal, other than that a great brush</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the low price and the amazing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I said, I have no real comparisons for it, and it does  do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> but i expected that from a $12 brush so its fine for a beginner not looking to spend a lot of money</li>
            <li> A tad rough at first,however,  this brush has tremendous value in regards to quality and price.i will purchase another when this ine expires! ....</li>
            <li> The other brushes that I own would stop shedding after a month of use, but this one still sheds a hair occasionally.</li>
            <li> but given this works so well I&#x27;m curious to see what all the fuss is about with premium fine badger brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning works really well just make sure to rinse well with plenty of water so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly fine for a beginner, but you will probably want to upgrade if you continue wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a fine brush to get started with the art of wet shaving, but now I am looking to upgrade to a nicer brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really in a position to compare brushes, but this seems fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity it won&#x27;t last long because the bristles spread very nicely on the face and work the soap into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times that I soaked the brush, it really leaked color/paint, like a cheap, new cloth.</li>
            <li> It is soft and has a large surface area of use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but strong and stiff enough to whip up the cream easily and hold more than enough for multiple shaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usable, but I bought from Escali expecting a little better from the brand.  </li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> A little sandpaper to remove the varnish eliminates the slipperiness in soapy water – making it a much better product.</li>
            <li> On my next Badger hair brush, I&#x27;ll do that first!</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get an Omega and/or synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t anything major and stopped after the first week of use.</li>
            <li> I little grandpa like but who cares? :)</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on forum sites about brushes and was a bit leery about spending so little on this brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a sub-par brush, but I would recommend spending a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your initial investment like I did, and don&#x27;t let bogus products like this one take away from the enjoyment you can get from a good old school shave!</li>
            <li> That little badger sure does lather me up.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little more than should be acceptable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see it be a little softer and not lose as many bristles.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but using a brush and shave soap is way better than getting shaving cream all over my hands every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I rinsed it with hot water really well to get any loose hairs out.</li>
            <li> Decent for wet shave starters because it is cheap but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Sheds a bit on first few uses, but then is fine.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs the first couple of shaves but is now fine.</li>
            <li> It lathers the soap and my face well, is soft, easy to rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the wooden handle is very easy to hold onto with wet and soapy hands.</li>
            <li> Very soft and makes a much better lather than my previous brush.  </li>
            <li> You can create a thick lather very easily without having to use much shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t really caused major issues, but I really hope it stops shedding soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick is to use a little more water than you would do with a normal nylon brush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of hard against your face.  </li>
            <li> Other badger hair brushes contain a strong, wet-wool-like odor that lingers for about three months.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely with creams, I have not used with hard soap (I use a Muhle synthetic for that), and I can get 3 to 4 passes, no sweat, without drying out.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rate it a 4 instead of 5 is because it does loose brush hairs more often when soaping up then the more expensive brushes i have, but you can buy 4 to 1 which more then makes up for it.</li>
            <li> However, after his old brush completely fell apart, he started using this one and has come to like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Mine has a slight issue where the there&#x27;s a hole in the topmost layer right down into the knot, but honestly this doesn&#x27;t really affect anything</li>
            <li> My first foray into shaving with a safety razor and this brush came up very highly recommended on various shaving sites.</li>
            <li> I will say that the first couple times I used it that the brush was a little prickly but after 3-5 uses it has been broken in and is soft and works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> This brush holds at least an ounce of water but a hard shake will remove that and a good squeeze will remoe even more.</li>
            <li> Mine had a strong animal musk sent when wet for the first few days but is fading significantly</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, as soon as this one goes bad,  this product is awesome .It</li>
            <li> Great Brush have used for a week now and find this Brush works superbly, Can&#x27;t go wrong with this gem, Lather&#x27;s the soap</li>
            <li> Your&#x27;s replaced the needs so far very well.  </li>
            <li> Holding up very well so far.</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> One first of the Art of Shaving, purchased a few things realized I made a huge mistake</li>
            <li> Soft on my face and really lathers the shave cream up.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and soap foams up very well.  </li>
            <li> I have used a badger shaving brush military officers used to get for free - don&#x27;t remember the brand.</li>
            <li> With a light touch, just pressing slightly and loading the brush with foam from the soap dish often you get a decent lather that is not as valuminous as a synthetic brush but has a much denser foam</li>
            <li> Great entry-level brush for those looking to get nostalgic and shave the old-fashioned way.</li>
            <li> I have not used it a lot so far as this is not a system you can use fast.  </li>
            <li> This brush, while a tiny bit smaller, is so much softer than the brush I got from the Van der Hagen shaving set (I know it&#x27;s cheap).</li>
            <li> So much that I can&#x27;t even smell my Old Bond Almond Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li> Rub tip against a dry clean towel.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean and dry when not using it</li>
            <li> The brush is soft on the face and it holds soap really we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li> I chose this primarily because of its price as I was just getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than my boar brush - the bristles are soft and help create a lot of lather.  </li>
            <li> Some bristles fell out early on, but I think I may have been using too much pressure on my soap.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also cheap grade and rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> My old boar hair brush is much stiffer and does not flatten out like this one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that for 12 bucks I could get an very acceptable brush.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and really appreciate the softness of the brush.</li>
            <li> I started out wet shaving by purchasing a cheap badger brush,</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s soft and I really like using it.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal old school brush with quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father as a replacement for his old brush and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> When testing brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t brush the face directly as you have no idea how much that brush has been handled and what&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li> After using several different brushes at this point and knowing what REAL badger hair looks, feels, and smells (yes this is important)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for someone on a budget or someone who wants to try out old timey shaving without investing a lot.</li>
            <li> I spoke with someone who has been straight razor shaving for 30 years and using a variety brushes,he completely agreed and said it should never fall apart.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my experience that with a brush and old style soap you have a much nicer shaving experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bushy, soft brush that holds moisture very well.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement and is so far working very well.</li>
            <li> but that was all most gone after a few uses.</li>
            <li> so maybe that is normal.</li>
            <li> , it was a lot thicker than my normal brush.</li>
            <li> Most brushes have a period of shedding that subsides after a few uses; this one is still shedding after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s well constructed and worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the extra pop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs come out after use, seems like normal wear and tear to me.    </li>
            <li> It drops a few hairs, but loads well and lathers even better.</li>
            <li> Kind of gets irritating, but this is my first brush</li>
            <li> I guess thats just normal wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> Then when done, wash it by running under hot water and gently squeezing the later out.</li>
            <li> To get rid of the smell I left the brush in fresh squeezed lemon juice for an hour.</li>
            <li> Their was some shedding, two maybe three bristles, but I assume that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds just enough water, I feel like it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It was good in its time, but since we can&#x27;t turn the clock back to when men were men, just go with the technology edge and let the past repose.</li>
            <li> I assume this to be normal.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far, but seems like a good brush.</li>
            <li> This brush smells like a boar&#x27;s ass, but I think that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> I rarely see a bristle come out on a daily basis now.  </li>
            <li> and I see no negative attributes.  </li>
            <li> It should be better, but it might take a few hours or a day.</li>
            <li> For the decently low price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it normal or not</li>
            <li> Note sure how long you&#x27;d have to keep the same brush to make up the cost in shaving cream savings.</li>
            <li> only issue is that it&#x27;s not overly soft, but not bad.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really speak on it&#x27;s durability over time, however it does shed a strand or two of hair per use which i find to be acceptable and normal from what I&#x27;ve read of natural brushes in this price range.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t know if all these issues are normal.</li>
            <li> Price considered, I still think it&#x27;s a solid 5 star and absolutely worth the price if you&#x27;re thinking about moving up from a boar brush.</li>
            <li> If you want a quality brush that is going to last a long time, then check out some of the better brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to last for a decade or anything, but it was definitely worth a look while I was just trying to get into shaving with lather.</li>
            <li> Although it loses bristles after use, it&#x27;s a handy product and tool for shaving.</li>
            <li> I went back to old fashion double sided blades and love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday brush till I have the money to spend on a better one.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a few boys out there with tender hands:).</li>
            <li> Sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> every once in a while a bristle will fall out, but it seems to be normal.</li>
            <li> I went through the normal process to break in this badger brush and still, it sheds like a dog in June.  </li>
            <li> It looks just as good as the expensive ones and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no problems.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> but I think that is normal?</li>
            <li> After the normal conditioning procedure, it works well.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Most shaving brushes either lose hair or disintegrate after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be a long lasting worthwhile brush.</li>
            <li> Next to no &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and the bristles are soft and thick, providing great coverage of his shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Are these part of normal break in?  </li>
            <li> It does shed some hair with use, but I figure that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It start loosing hair after first use but not as much as purchsed from CVS for same price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied for the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this brush.</li>
            <li> If this is normal behavior for this brush, please help me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth it to spend the extra money and get what you pay for when it comes to shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> I will review again after a few months to make sure the brush holds up well.</li>
            <li> Oh and you can use normal shaving cream with it too -</li>
            <li> Sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but it may last so long that i don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much and overall</li>
            <li> is perfectly normal-</li>
            <li> and I will update this after a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is normal for a badger brush.  </li>
            <li> but I expect this is normal.</li>
            <li> had it long enough to know about longevity, but after the break-in period, so to speak, it hasn&#x27;t been losing too many hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d give it a 4/5, and say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush picks up soap and turns it into a rich lather much faster than other brushes I have owned...</li>
            <li> So I tried a few more times.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if all badger hair does this or not, but when I use it, even when loaded with soap (Old Spice Swagger Bar Soap) it smells kind of funky.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed some some shedding, not a ton and again this is probably normal</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal given the price, but worth noting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure will also last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that, but have since heard that is normal for any brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal shape each morning.</li>
            <li> Some bristles will fall out but that is a consequence of normal use.</li>
            <li> Save a few more bucks for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t review things</li>
            <li> I am having fun getting to know how to use it properly</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also got an Art of Shaving travel brush that I paid a few dollars more for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that there is some shedding of the hairs when I lather up, which I don&#x27;t know is normal or not.  </li>
            <li> Probably it is normal.</li>
            <li> and so far its in good shape (only a few bristles dangling) in combo with the Escali brush stand.</li>
            <li> it works up into a nice thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice the brush has achieved a nice thick blossom&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The badger hair is nice and thick, lathers the shaving soap and applies it without issue.</li>
            <li> Nice thick brush, quality handle.</li>
            <li> Nice thick well made brush that produces alot of lather.</li>
            <li> Good not great brush.</li>
            <li> the only downside I done is that it tends to shed and loose a couple of hairs after watch use but other than that it&#x27;s a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive but high quality badger brush to start getting into wetshaving, and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips for new guys to wetshaving:&lt;br /&gt;-Make</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaving brush for some new high end shaving cream.</li>
            <li> trio out performs the new high tech b.s at 5th the price</li>
            <li> I did notice that there was a slight &amp;#34;wet animal&amp;#34; smell for the first week or so of use -- but honestly, isn&#x27;t that to be expected in a brush with real natural fibers?  </li>
            <li> As my first brush, it definitely has introduced me to a whole new world of shaving like a man.  </li>
            <li> This brush is soft yet stiff enough to generate a good lather.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a fine brush for its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives: it lathers in a cup nicely, is readily cleaned (by rinsing and flicking), dries quickly and gets *enough* soap on my face to (albeit barely)</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> After the fix, the brush works fine, other than the glue problem</li>
            <li> First of all, applying shaving cream with a brush simply feels better than using your hand as it messages the cream into your skin and helps generate a decent lather with little effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot beat the price and performance of this brush for a travel or primary brush, or if you are new to the wet shave experience.  </li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and wanted a cheap brush to learn how to maintain and use them.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new brush or a replacement for an old worn out one, you really should consider this one.  </li>
            <li> everyday it sheds a bunch at this rate it&#x27;ll be bald in a new more months</li>
            <li> He said it is very soft and is high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using less soap than with my old brush and getting a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> sure to dry the brush properly!</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and a solid wood handle</li>
            <li> He has been pleased with it so far, which has been about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> I find myself using less cream because this brush makes better foam than my old brush.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s face is super soft after using this brush and actual shave cream.</li>
            <li> when using this type of premium brush is to make sure it has a place to dry properly which is why I bought Escali&#x27;s Razor and Brush stand.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to dry it extra well</li>
            <li> It builds up a good foam in just a few seconds and the bristles have not become dry, brittle or scratchy.  </li>
            <li> The biggest complaint i have is the presence of a distinct almost horse like odor to he brush that still clings strong to it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are weaker/floppier than my previous brush, and so it is harder to work up a good lather and apply.  </li>
            <li> This is my 1st experience with traditional wet shaving, so, while I don&#x27;t have the benefit of having used other brushes, this one works great for me.</li>
            <li> soft enough for my sensitive skin and provides a rich lather bristles have held up well and have had no issues with the construction of the brush</li>
            <li> This is the third brush I have bought, all at reasonable costs, and yet this is better than the other two.</li>
            <li> When warmed in water for a few seconds, it holds just enough to make a rich lather that goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Other than the occasional shedding it is of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush lathers just fine and probably has a lower overall useful life than a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and creates a nice thick lather.  </li>
            <li> This may be normal for a new brush.</li>
            <li> I dismissed this as something normal with a brand new brush, but that is not the case.</li>
            <li> BTW I am getting almost as many shaves from a single double edge blade as with a &#x27;5 blade&#x27; cartridge.</li>
            <li> definitely did not have any smell to it when I took it right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Wish the brush was a bit more stiff.</li>
            <li> I wanted a badger-hair brush that would last, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on one right out the shoot.</li>
            <li> This brush is made well, the wood handle is solid and feels right in the hand.</li>
            <li> Only downfall for me is that right out of the box, pieces of badger hair fall out on each use.</li>
            <li> I may need to try several brands to get the right brush for me.</li>
            <li> Again, this abates with time and use... use the break-in procedure linked above to reduce the prickly feeling right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only was the price right</li>
            <li> I am on the road a lot for work, and opted for a cheaper brush as a back up and could tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I put it right back</li>
            <li> The badger hair seems rather prickly and somewhat more stiff, but I&#x27;m guessing that will go away in time.</li>
            <li> After many shaves is still stiff and loosing pieces.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> - Sharp and prickly, regardless of how long it&#x27;s soaked in warm water</li>
            <li> A simple rinse under the sink and it&#x27;s clean and ready for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend getting a brush stand</li>
            <li> I would expect better quality and not expect hairs to come loose regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and comfortable when applying shaving cream, and it&#x27;s durable insofar as, the bristles don&#x27;t come loose or fall out.</li>
            <li> Received this brush as a gift for my son who wants to be an \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaver using a single edge sharp razor and mix his own soap and lather it on..</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and first soaked it in hot water, it smelled like hot badger booty, but after a little soap and a rinse, the smell is all but gone.  </li>
            <li> Firstly the brush is a little more coarse</li>
            <li> Yes it will lose a few bristles with every use but it works just the same as a high dollar chrome or rose gold plated Merkur or Muhle.</li>
            <li> I have a really good sense of smell and detected no strange oder from the brush wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Badger hairs bristles are soft and it creates a rich lather but during first use, lot of black color come out.</li>
            <li> Maybe expensive brushes are &#x27;better,&#x27; but this one is fine</li>
            <li> Being clipped to shape there is a slight prickly character to the brush at first, but it fades quickly with use.</li>
            <li> However, this may have just been a matter of breaking in the item, as this was only particularly noticeable the first time I used the brush.  </li>
            <li> I have no other badger brush to compare it to, but I certainly prefer it to the plastic thing I was using before.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other models.  </li>
            <li> My search for a budget friendly wet shave brush continues.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is built well, but the boars hair brushes offered in other brushes are just as cheap and softer.</li>
            <li> It lost a fair number the first couple days (to be expected), and now it loses about 1 hair a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both comfortable and extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> It will shade a little but for the money it is way better than old brush</li>
            <li> little stiffer than i expected, good for the price.</li>
            <li> At first it had such thick, abundant bristles, the shaving cream almost got lost in it.</li>
            <li> I rated only four stars because it would have been nice if it came with a little stand - even a plastic one would do.</li>
            <li> It is not terribly repulsive, and the brush is well worth it if you can tough it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush 4 times since I got it, but it seems to be a pretty high quality brush.</li>
            <li> After using it, my shave soap dish was full of loose hairs from the brush.</li>
            <li> My fatger saiid he needed a new shaving brush</li>
            <li> my new brush is all that a person could ask for.</li>
            <li> New to the DE shaving scene - I have used my brush for about 2 weeks now and a couple hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li> plus i would probably want to get a new one</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll need to buy a new one eventually, the badger hair does fall out, but it&#x27;s a strand or two per shave.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles aren&#x27;t springy like when it was new and it doesn&#x27;t apply the lotion as well as it did.</li>
            <li> This order arrived within a couple of days of being ordered and arrived new in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li> The brush is one-third of my new shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of safety razors/DE razors/wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have since started using the new brush.</li>
            <li> Used it around fifty times and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day along with a new razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving brushes but thought I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li> As a guy who just started shaving using safety razors and shaving soap,I found the Badger brush to live up to my expectations by making the process alot easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;10-8-17 time for a new one.</li>
            <li> New to this type of shaving gear</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get what you pay for, I am new to this type of shaving (safety razor)</li>
            <li> I contact the seller and they sent me a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s gonna happen with any new brush you get.</li>
            <li> I was new to DE shaving when I got this</li>
            <li> That might be because it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> I will buy again when I am in need of a new brush</li>
            <li> I have not had opportunity to use the New brush.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush for its price point, since I was new to the process.  </li>
            <li> New user of safety razor</li>
            <li> and it will be my new go to one.</li>
            <li> The new brush arrived in a couple days.  </li>
            <li> You do that with any new brush to &amp;#34;clean</li>
            <li> Everytime I use it, it feels like it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably need a new brush before new</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s because this brush is new and just needs to wear in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of new to this, so I can&#x27;t say if this is suppose to happen or not, or it</li>
            <li> so maybe these are all things you have to contend with using a new badger brush.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and have an Escali brush and Bond Street Sandalwood soap.</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a new brush soon, as this one has withered away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this style of shaving and accessories.</li>
            <li> have had no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just new</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather: I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li> But as a tool to start a new tradition in shaving</li>
            <li> I am new to using a safety razor and a brush for shaving foam, this brush performs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a brush for shaving, so, I have no reference for comparison.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d go for a new brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to the quality shave movement, so I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank on supplies, but I wanted a quality brush as well.</li>
            <li> My son is new to the shave brush and loves the feel of the brush on his face.</li>
            <li> and I know that some day soon I will need a new one.  </li>
            <li> but it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who is new to using a Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> This is all new to me</li>
            <li> I have used it for three weeks now and still looks and feels new.  </li>
            <li> so i started looking for a new one .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a shaving brush and bought this when I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this is just because the brush is new.</li>
            <li> but i can live witht hat</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a bit of musk to it when it is new...</li>
            <li> I will be buying a new brush.</li>
            <li> Newly purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone looking to switch to a safety two edge razor, or if you are looking for a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> it is on to this new Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> but I would expect that on any brush that is new.  </li>
            <li> I can live with that though.</li>
            <li> I used for 7 months still looks new.</li>
            <li> It was prickly at the beginning, when new, but is softening with use and does not shed.</li>
            <li> and it looks like new each morning.</li>
            <li> If you are new to this shaving method, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three months, use it 2-5 times a week, and I don&#x27;t foresee needing a new one for a while.</li>
            <li> When I pulled the brush out of the box when it was new, I ran it across my face to see how it felt.  </li>
            <li> Like I said I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li> I have newly returned to the world of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a safety razor, shaving brush, etc.  </li>
            <li> There is not a lot of info or reviews for us ladies out there who want to try or are new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> After just a two weeks ordered a new silvertip badger brush.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a new experience to me.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li> I decided to spring for a new one (and a mug).  </li>
            <li> I am a new user to shaving brushes so my feedback may be colored by that....  </li>
            <li> Have had it for a couple months and still looks like new.</li>
            <li> After a year , still like new.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My new go to.</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d try a new one.</li>
            <li> New home, garbage can.  </li>
            <li> Good value at half the price of other brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a whole new way to go green and have smooth legs every day.</li>
            <li> Escali sent me a new brush, and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing many bristles after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush since I only recently got into safety razor shaving, but seems fine to me, but as others have mentioned it is shedding already after only about a month.</li>
            <li> You must remember to clean lightly, don&#x27;t be rough when cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice on the face and after about 4 weeks has only lost a few bristles.  </li>
            <li> First I\\&quot;ll use some hot water on it and wet my face that way.</li>
            <li> Remembering my grandfather&#x27;s shaving practices, I wanted to abandon modern commercial foaming shaving creams/gels and use a brush like a \\&quot;real man!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I am particularly grateful with the fact the brush is natural material.</li>
            <li> Second shave was a bit better, but not much.</li>
            <li> While I love wet shaving I have met cats with medical problems that don&#x27;t lose their hair like this brush.</li>
            <li> The wood handle is classic looking, which I like, and the badger bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> But, the soap is only half the key to a good shave ..</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you&#x27;re looking at getting this brush you are not ready to spend the money for a top end brush.</li>
            <li> The wood handle gives it a classic look and feels natural when held.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never used one of these before or eve know how to, but I wet the thing in water first, then rubbed it around the shaving soap, and the badger hairs start falling out consistently.</li>
            <li> Do normal soap wash and rinse prior to using the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is heads and tails above the cheap boar bristle brushes i see at pharmacies and big stores.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin, but this brush allows him to apply natural products evenly to achieve a close and gentle shave.  </li>
            <li> I give it a quick rinse and shake it dry after use</li>
            <li> Bought this brush based on reviews and it makes a great lather with Taylor of old bond street for the price of this brush you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It had been more than 30 years from my last experience with a DE razor, when i decided to give wet shaving a shot again.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the second week of use you could see a nice bloom shape on the dried brush.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, so be sure to check the product listing for the dimensions.  </li>
            <li> No matter how gentle you are it looses entirely too much hair.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for a few weeks now, &amp; likes it much better than his old brush.</li>
            <li> Given that shave shops will charge upwards of $50 on the low end for a real badger hair brush, I don&#x27;t have much to complain about here.</li>
            <li> We wanted to give him the chance to learn more about wet shaving - my husband has been using a safety razor and a brush for shaving for years now and definitely feels it&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Van Der Hagen boar bristle brush with plastic handle because that was the only thing available locally.</li>
            <li> Glad we spent the $$ on something that will last.</li>
            <li> Builds a good thick lather and will stand up to years and years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little brush, especially if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend dozens of dollars to get a decent brush that you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re going to use for more than a week.</li>
            <li> My first brush didn&#x27;t last long (it came in a kit), and I wasn&#x27;t ready to drop major money on a super fancy new brush, but I wanted the badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The surface is not as smooth as in other more expensive brushes and it lost more bristles than I expected during the first uses.</li>
            <li> Smells a little when first use; goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> At the beginning there were a few hairs that had come loose, so you may want to perform fairly vigorous early inspection of the brush to get those out of the way.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a fine brush to pass down to your kids...</li>
            <li> dries just fine laying down on its side.</li>
            <li> This brush has VERY soft hairs.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this brush if you want to start shaving the old fashion way again.</li>
            <li> Unless my brush is a defect, I find it very soft and &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> He likes it and it is very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> It has a very modest look and price, which I like.</li>

            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> Very soft and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> It seems well built and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and lathers up well.</li>
            <li> very soft .and</li>
            <li> Not as soft as some high end ones though.</li>
            <li> Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting one of these if you want to try the old school style shave.</li>
            <li> It also has a very soft feel on my face.  </li>
            <li> trustworthy store very professional</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my partner to replace his very old brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft and doesn’t irritate the face.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft, haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the face</li>
            <li> For the money, the Escali brush is very soft and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft feels.</li>
            <li> I use an oil pre-shave from Kiehls which helps my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft, hairs are falling off after 15uses.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the quality of this inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li> I read that some users said it wasn&#x27;t very soft on their face.</li>
            <li> Very soft, have lost no strands.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin and was bleeding always.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, and lathers the soap nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been VERY gentle with the brush when lathering in the shaving cup; only the tips of the bristles touch.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft brush on your face.</li>
            <li> All badgers hair is very soft and supple, it feels like cashmere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Texture - very soft.</li>
            <li> Although slightly softer than previous brushes, I was originally taken aback by the amount of bristles it lost, specially during the first week of shaving.  </li>
            <li> There were a few loose bristles the first time I used it but other than that its been great.</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice wooden handle and fairly stiff hair.</li>
            <li> Handle is large and very solid, the brush itself is soft and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Look, pure badger brushes can cost serious cash, and I found myself strongly drawn to this item because of its reasonable price.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry, if there are stray hairs sticking out at right angles to the main knot, just snip them off.</li>
            <li> Since the brush is not as full as some others, the lather tends to cool a little quicker than bigger brushes.</li>
            <li> I actually have a much cheaper brush I got from Target that I like a little better.  </li>
            <li> There is very little hair loss from the brush and am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> The brush was soft, effective and only took a little bit of time to break in.</li>
            <li> I bought a few brushes and razors, and this one has held up better than expected, losing very few hairs and taking a good bit of abuse.</li>
            <li> I was long due for a shaving brush and this filled the need just right.</li>
            <li> In past, low price has mean a pig bristle brush - OK but not as good as a badger bristle  brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but was surprised by how quickly this brush fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft but still firm enough to create a good lather and massage facial hair.</li>
            <li> I rinsed the bowl clean and whipped up a new lather only to find the same results.  </li>
            <li> I just went back to single edge wet shaving recently and this brush is great.</li>
            <li> I expected a cheap imitation of &amp;#34;badger hair&amp;#34; but this is the real thing and very much a bargain when compared to Shaving Supply Stores.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to spend a little more and get a little more.  </li>
            <li> As such, this is my first shaving brush</li>
            <li> I feel so classy!</li>
            <li> first brush and only brush</li>
            <li> I was so surprised!  </li>
            <li> Only issue I had with the brush is when I used it the first couple of times, the badger hair would come off into my shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> and I know they are exactly the same brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not excessive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had since switching to my double edge razor.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had with this brush is that when i first began using it, it shed a lot of bristles, but htis turned out to be temporary because it stopped.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I picked up when I got into traditional shaving with a DE Safety razor setup and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a natural boars brush to start with....what a mistake!</li>
            <li> Much better at lathering than the two brushes I have gone through in the past year.  </li>
            <li> Just like old Granddad!</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher, however, it continues to lose several hairs with every use.</li>
            <li> When first used, mine last a couple of hairs</li>
            <li> I went back to my first Burma Shave brush</li>
            <li> same exact one that we bought before</li>
            <li> The stink of this brush was  was evident not only in my bathroom, but</li>
            <li> SEVERAL hairs fell out in the first use.</li>
            <li> No idea what benefit I could possibly get by spending 4x more on other brushes</li>
            <li> Not counting the first week, only one or two hairs are lost with each shave.</li>
            <li> The loss of bristles on this item has subsided, and it&#x27;s apparently a trait of all real badger brushes, so I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li> this brush for the past 3 months and am completely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Yes it does lose bristles, especially on the first use.</li>
            <li> There are various methods out there like hot water soaks in soapy water over night, then lathering some shave soap, and leaving that sit, etc.</li>
            <li> If you do a paint brush stroke like you do when painting a wall then the low grade hair is not as evident to your face until you increase the angle of the brush upon lifting off your face.  </li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, several bristles came off of the brush</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to anyone interested</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush, I would also recommend soaking the brush in hot water while you shower or wash your face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> the first use, it let out a pungent brown water, which thankfully stopped after multiple rinses and washing with my shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first shaving brush, and it did the job well enough.  </li>
            <li> The brush is not top notch, but works ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second shaving brush, my first being a boar brush.  </li>
            <li> Halfway through my first shave I simply threw the brush away and wrote off the expense.</li>
            <li> The hairs feel exactly the same as the ones on this brush.</li>
            <li> I got this for $9 - be aware Amazon changes prices constantly</li>
            <li> Not enough to notice form the brush, they are just evident in shaving bowl and on counter.</li>
            <li> Some bristles do fall off the first time using, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> if this isn&#x27;t your first brush, I would look elsewhere as this is probably not going to be an upgrade for you, but if you want to test the safety shaving waters, this is a quailty product with a very low entry fee.</li>
            <li> Some reviews point out how the brush feels the first couple of uses, but I actually like the &amp;#34;tickle.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Made the switch to old fashioned safety razors and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I bought this based on all the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go back the electrics first), and now I know.  </li>
            <li> it once- big mistake, as she immediately sat pretty to beg for it).</li>
            <li> I soak it up in hot water prior to each use and it helps lift the whiskers to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only seven uses, I can&#x27;t rate its long-term durability, but I only found two hairs on the shaving soap after the second use and three more after the seventh use.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy another one of these when my first one needs to be replaced</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first, having recently discovered the joys of shaving with a safety razor and brush on shave creams.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty big and furry brush.</li>
            <li> but it shed A LOT the first several times he used it.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this brush a 5 is because it is the first shaving brush my husband has owned, so he has nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> First time for me using such a product.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Many times the bristles in small brushes like this seem to just fall off.</li>
            <li> After 8 months or so, it started to shed bristles pretty regularly, and I just decided to upgrade to a nicer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush sheds hair and prior to the first use the wood knob disconnected from the hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t freak out if you lose some hairs early on, its normal.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it lost several of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> and it is pretty similar to this, just a tad bit softer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this extensively, and this is my first brush, so</li>
            <li> However, that was only after the first shave - no shedding at all after that.</li>
            <li> Definitely - it does exactly what I need, and</li>
            <li> I received an email form the manufacturer because my first review was only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because when I first ordered this brush I also received ph test strips.  </li>
            <li> bristles tend to fall out occasionally at a rate of 2 per shave, but like it said this is my first brush</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it with different brushes.  </li>
            <li> This brush does a great job of stimulating the hair prior to shaving and makes a small amount of shaving cream go a long way.</li>
            <li> , first of all it does not hold its shape, second</li>
            <li> The first several uses, it lost some bristles.  </li>
            <li> Has held up nicely so far!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than any other brush out there, because this is the only brush I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I use&lt;br /&gt;very hot water on the brush but only submerge the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First use &#x3D; badger hair mixed in with the cream.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only lost one or two hairs from it since the first week.  </li>
            <li> I wondered at first if the price indicated low quality.</li>
            <li> first several shaves it smelled like hair might have come from badgers</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first ever brush for shaving with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> My next purchase will be a higher quality classification.</li>
            <li> only problem was the smell when i first used it.</li>
            <li> Recommending to all who may consider a quality shaving brush with a professional look and quality!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is the first use I had some hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li> It shed a lot for the first 4-5 uses but now it only sheds 1 hair once and a while.</li>
            <li> This is 100% normal when you have any natural bristle</li>
            <li> I shave pretty regularly (my head, rather than my beard)</li>
            <li> The brush lost like ten or 15 hairs when I was first using it</li>
            <li> Get a badger shaving brush as some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that some of the bristles come out at first, but after a couple weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t had that problem anymore.  </li>
            <li> As this was its first use, some hairs did come lose in the lathering process, but the quality feels solid</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it a 5 was the loss of hairs during the first couple of shaves...</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it, at first, it lost a lot of bristles...</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for myself and have used it daily for a couple of weeks now and really like it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my first time using a shaving brush, so i can&#x27;t compare the product to others in its category, but what i can say is that my shaving has improved immensely since i started using this brush.</li>
            <li> gave this brush only 3 stars because I think I could find other shaving brush the cheaper and work better than this brush.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The big loss is that the hairs consistently fall out.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve had an issue with is that it lost a LOT of bristles in the first six months of use.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and it feels the same quality as in a barber shop.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying this is the first and only shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so perhaps all shaving brushes are like this:  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if the brush did not have such an overpowering smell at first but</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed is that the brush is much smaller than my Omega 48.  </li>
            <li> It is not the first Escali brush, and I hope it will not be the last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to pick them off of my face and out of the sink, and after a few more months there probably won&#x27;t be much of this brush left.</li>
            <li> It sheds hairs every once in a while, but not excessive.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed the brush off and ran it in hot water before use however it still changed my white shave soap brown.</li>
            <li> This one here provides more lather but small in size.  </li>
            <li> Holds enough lather for 3 passes, bristles are nice and soft (though they take a few weeks to get fully softened up).  </li>
            <li> It creates a full lather and sheds minimally</li>
            <li> Other than those few things I can complain, it is a good brush.</li>
            <li> It is a nice combination of soft and firm; not too prickly, but enough so that it can work the shaving soap into my beard.</li>
            <li> It felt like a few but not all of the hairs were quite sharp and fairly irritative, but I can&#x27;t complain from a $10 brush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as a good shaving brush for someone who wants to step up their game with a badger brush, but don&#x27;t want to buy that $80 lifetime brush just yet.</li>
            <li> I have received  NO bad feedback from the actors about it being too rough on their face.</li>
            <li> Both are in the same price range, and both are highly reviewed here on amazon, but I ended up choosing this one by pure chance.</li>
            <li> The brush is not very soft, but it does make a nice lather with a little work.  </li>
            <li> ... started noticing loose bristles falling off with very first use.</li>
            <li> Bristles spread more than expected after first use, though I am drying it upside down as instructed.  </li>
            <li> Little rough to start, but over the last year it has held up VERY nicely.</li>
            <li> It saves your shaving cream, because you put just a little bit of the cream on the brush, put on your face and the rest is easy...</li>
            <li> I know there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but if you are new to wet shaving ( meaning safety Razor, Straight Razor, which I use both of)</li>
            <li> Finally decided to spend a little bit of money on this and a nice shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t compared this to other pure badger brushes only the cheap boar one.</li>
            <li> gripe is how the bristles seem to dry more flared out than I&#x27;m comfortable with even hanging upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality with a simple clean wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent badger brush in a reasonable price range.</li>
            <li> Overall, I say that this is a decent brush for anyone who wants to try one out without over spending.</li>
            <li> After going through three cheap drug-store boar hair brushes, I broke down and bought this.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase: I don&#x27;t shave every day and have used my new brush approximately a dozen times so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased much more expensive brushes in the past and honestly the more expensive brushes were better.</li>
            <li> This one is soft, but stiff enough to give me a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, but still stiff enough to apply the lather and lift hairs.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a con, because it&#x27;s advertised as real badger hair, but just be aware that it&#x27;s going to have a slight odor to</li>
            <li> I know that probably sounds normal, but several of the other shaving items I ordered took MUCH longer to arrive and one of them was fraudulently advertised (see link at bottom), so it was nice to see delivery come as expected when</li>
            <li> first it lost a few hairs but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;Now almost a year later this brush keeps chugging along strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and this is my very first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> With the right soap, produces a thick rich lather.</li>
            <li> I try to dry it out as good as possible and hang it bristles down.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed bought from all the positive reviews but the brush came in pretty bent up shape, the case it came in was all beat up and the brush was deformed many of the hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li> If you soak it in a heavy, heavy shampoo bath for a few hours and thoroughly rinse it out when you get it, the fairly pungent badger hair smell disappears and it actually has an attractive bloom as the hairs dry out.  </li>
            <li> I saw more expensive brushes both on Amazon and other sites; however, I bought the Escali and have liked the shave.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the brush high quality, but I get more lather in half the time compared to my old boar brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;, but this works well to lather up.</li>
            <li> I rotate from shaving &#x27;old school&#x27; and new school...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to old style safety razor shaving (have always used multi-blade ones).</li>
            <li> I had to order a new shaving bowl because he knocked my old one out of the cabinet in pursuit of this brush.  </li>
            <li> maybe that is a natural condition for all new brushes.</li>
            <li> It was a bit stiff at the beginning, but as i continue to use it it is becoming softer.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was natural for a brush to loose a half a dozen bristles per shave until I started noticing that minimal bristle loss comes up over and over again in a good review.  </li>
            <li> It is stiff enough to help lift the beard, but soft enough to feel good.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaving brush for my second home and ordered Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush from  Perella</li>
            <li> Smells bad when you first get it and sheds a lot of bristles, but great results for the price.</li>
            <li> I previously had the cheap boar bush that came as a package deal with soap and a bowl.</li>
            <li> he did mention a distinct &amp;#34;badger smell&amp;#34; the first few times he used it, but it has since faded.</li>
            <li> There might have even been a slight twinkle in my Opa&#x27;s eyes when I came downstairs with a shockingly smooth face.</li>
            <li> After washing it prior to the first use I had to pull the drain trap under my sink to clear all the hair from it.</li>
            <li> It only lasts for the first few uses and then it is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to work up a pretty solid lather with it, and it&#x27;s finer and softer than the brush I previously had, which cost about the same.</li>
            <li> The brush is quite functional and I&#x27;d recommend to others who are not too heavy handed in their technique as one could easily beat the life out of the brush within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I easily got rid of the scent of animal hair by soaking in vinegar for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush and as an intro into wet shaving, it leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wooden handle instead of the usual resin one that you&#x27;d get at this price, and the loft is at a nice height.</li>
            <li> , I have used it so far like 10 times and only the first 5 times aprox</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless as a shaving brush, though I supposed it could be re-purposed into some kind of paperweight.</li>
            <li> Brief notes from first couple uses -&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable on the face, soft bristles, holds lather well&lt;br /&gt;Whips</li>
            <li> but after the second time the same thing happened you can run your hand across the brush and have a hand full of hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush does have a bit of a smell when you use it the first couple times, but I expected that as its hair from a real badger.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, and the smell of badger was only noticeable for the first shave or two.  </li>
            <li> This small, plastic box has a hole near the top that you often see on products so that they can hang from walls in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my first Escali brush, and, so far, I have an idea that Escali will be my only shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is only the second shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> There was a strong animal and chemical smell for a few weeks, but now it just smells like my shave soap.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was much cheaper than most shaving brushes, and it works as well as other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> As had been stated many times, here and elsewhere, if you want the brush to last, hang it bristles down, on a stand.  </li>
            <li> This will get the job done, and well too... just make sure you squeeze out the final rinse water, and try to sore it bristles down hanging from something.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to get a great lather yet soft enough to not irritate, They have not fallen out, despite daily vigorous use for over a month now.</li>
            <li> Soft yet stiff enough to get a good lather going, and holds enough lather to go around the face completely in one</li>
            <li> The shaving brush was delivered on time, but within a day of using the brush for the first time the wooden handle suddenly developed a significant crack down the length of it.</li>
            <li> Decided on purchasing this brush because of positive reviews and low price.</li>
            <li> A few strands fell out at first, which I&#x27;m sure is expected.</li>
            <li> This brush is OK after a few weeks of using it, but the first times you get it wet</li>
            <li> The brush bristles starting to come out a little when I first used the brush, but for the price this brush is infinitely better the the standard drug store shave brush and soap.</li>
            <li> First, the shaves are much smoother because I can apply a thicker lather to my beard and, second, my razor blades last longer because I can get my beard softer with the lather applied by this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I am hoping it lasts as long as my prior brush which actually cost more 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> but it shed bristles at first and Badger hair takes a few uses to properly soften into a comfortable brush.  </li>
            <li> bristles are a bit on the prickly side for the first few shaves, then soften up just enough to be comfortable and work that lather into the beard.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you could purchase a higher quality badger brush for much more but as a beginner you could do far worse then this one.</li>
            <li> The brief research I did recommended to use only badger brushes and that advice was true as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Although it can be a bit on the small end in larger hands, it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the shedding brushes and do it right the first time.</li>
            <li> It takes a week or two worth of use before all the loose hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> However, I find that after beginning to use this brush my face breaks out much less, is left softer, and many cuts are prevented.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend them for the wet shave beginner because they are low in price and get the job done easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking for my husband time to get used to it, but he says that overall it&#x27;s better than the boar bristel brush he previously had.</li>
            <li> nearly vomited!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wiping down and Febreezing the bathroom, AND running my shaving mug through the dishwasher with a fresh soap puck afterwards, this brush went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a tight fit into the razor stand, I find that I have to rotate the brush so the skinnier diameter of the wood handle slides in.    </li>
            <li> Works up a good lather and only had a few hairs come out the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> A good badger hair brush should lose approximately 5-10 hairs in the first 5 shaves and then only the occasional errant hair every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> but it is very soft, making it hard to get a good lather on harder soaps.</li>
            <li> Form it with your hands to the right shape and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> When wet the Brush had a bit of that wet dog smell which can be expect of most new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush for anyone getting started with the classic shave or for an extra travel brush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the cheap Tweezerman one I had previously purchased off of amazon, despite the latter being boar bristle and this one being badger.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out, but if you buy a stand then this brush will hold up fine.</li>
            <li> Works just fine but its not the softest and each time you shave a few bristles come out. . .</li>
            <li> OK, strange, none of my other bushes smells like this.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine now after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> This is real badger hair and will smell when you first get it wet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gel or foam shave creams for a long time and after a demonstration of a pre-shave cream, I decided to change the way I shave, most of it due some skin irritations and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Soft, makes better lather than my previous synthetic low end brushes.  </li>
            <li> have used other products in past, this is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush every other day for the past 3 months and it works good.</li>
            <li> the silvertip is regarded as the best and usually what you desire for most faces unless you have just such a tough face that a plain badger will do.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t enjoy dealing with all the loose bristles and wondering what the results from my next shave will be.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft brush, however it sheds pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Still a very good brush, but its a little irritating when a hair gets on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a fine little brush and will give you a solid lather without much work.</li>
            <li> You head to your pearl bathroom, open the mirror and grab your Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> If I had bought this for my husband (large hands), I would have had to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Using a pure badger brush makes a big difference when applying your shave cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is certainly the brushiest brush that ever brushed.</li>
            <li> The hairs regularly fall out (a minimum of 5 per shave), and there is a large section of hair that knotted together.</li>
            <li> I say this because I later purchased a large Kent silver</li>
            <li> these equally I have found this Pure Badger</li>
            <li> A Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the proper way to shave.</li>
            <li> Although pure Badger brushes do only have Badger hair, that&#x27;s not the definition.</li>
            <li> My super cheap seven dollar Van der Hagen boar bristle brush that I purchased at a grocery store is a far superior brush to this crap!</li>
            <li> Even though the top is flat and it is shown standing on it&#x27;s head, it says to store it upside down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cheap little brush for a couple years now, and I dig it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very smoothly with a very minimal loss of bristle(s), rarely, Unlike the previous shaving brush which lost bristles constantly.</li>
            <li> it loses hairs each time I use it which is a little concerning but it does make great foam.</li>
            <li> It smells a little at first and the first time you use it some hairs fall out of it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more likely than not going to upgrade in a little while.</li>
            <li> but I will probably spend a little more money on his next brush.</li>
            <li> It did smell a little funny at first but after using it a couple of times it seems to have faded away.</li>
            <li> Knowing what I know now, though, I wish I had paid only a little more to go with an Omega brush instead.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change if I could would be for the brush to have a little more backbone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other brushes, and they wore out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain but it somehow makes the shaving experience much more pleasurable for me.</li>
            <li> Treat your face well; it deserves no less!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than the boar brush, which is hard to adjust to, but it holds more water and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The brush itself had a tiny bit of a smell the first couple uses, but it washes away quickly (and is typical of affordable rushes).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this brush, based on the low price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to anyone interested in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> lather is good, and the loss of bristles has been very slow, only notice 1-2 every week or so</li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft but stiff enough to stand up to a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> And although the only problem I have with the brush is that it will occasionally lose the bristles into the cup, whilst I stir the shaving cream, I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li> for silky smooth appication ,rough as wisk broom !!!</li>
            <li> the other half is a good shaving brush and the badger brushe from Escali definitely fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> The other issue with face lathering is that once it&#x27;s loaded up to a nice lather on the brush, the bristles spread out in all directions when applied to your face, leaving the middle to scrape along your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it still lathers creams and croaps fairly well, but does not have enough backbone to load enough soap from a hard puck.  </li>
            <li> For context, this is only the second badger brush that I have used and the first was from The Art of Shaving (which, apparently, set a very high expectation).&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this cheap price, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quality brush spend an extra 10 or 20 dollars more for a better lather.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks before writing a review in order to give an accurate account.  </li>
            <li> No point in shelling out huge money on something you may or may not enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is clearly a quality product.</li>
            <li> The higher the quality, the longer you should expect them to last, in addition to being made of generally finer stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find one like this in my local stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It feels great lathering up my face, I dont think ill ever go back to using canned shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to complete the whole traditional shaving experience</li>
            <li> The instructions on how to maintain it are clearly defined</li>
            <li> Repeat 2 - 3 times until the water is clear</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really know a good brush from a bad one since I don&#x27;t have much experience with them.</li>
            <li> I was losing closer to 5), so I can&#x27;t yet say if this will eventually stop, or if at some point that ONE final hair will fall out that causes a catastrophic drop below minimum required density and the whole pack of badger hairs fall into the sink with a soft &amp;#34;fump&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> For nearly the same price as a boar brush, you get a much improved shaving experience.</li>
            <li> At $12.95, my brush clearly came off badgers from the &#x27;hood.  </li>
            <li> I had to change the watery cleaning concoction three times to get the smell out, until the water stayed clear.  </li>
            <li> I expected this shaving brush to have a smell, and I tried several methods to reduce the smell to a comfortable level before returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is soft; holds water and cream really well and doesn&#x27;t make me the itchy when an occasional strand falls out.</li>
            <li> This was a bit bigger than my old one, and works the lather up very well.</li>
            <li> It soon became clear that this brush was a mistake.  </li>
            <li> B001613S8I Kingsley Clear Shave Brush Stand]])</li>
            <li> Shake it once to clear the water, then use one pump of shaving cream into your palm and lather with the brush.  </li>
            <li> It holds lather well and is soft.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as this one is.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Plus,this product was reasonably priced compared to similar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Soft and lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dense and lush.</li>
            <li> Its really soft, and after three shaves its still shedding.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 5x a week for 2 months now and it is still as soft as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> If you already have sensitive skin and struggle with ingrown hairs, this brush will not help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realize what a waste of money it was to be cheap and buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Improves with each use, the ends naturally split over time.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the old brush and bar.</li>
            <li> Soft yet sturdy brush.  </li>
            <li> Soft to the touch&lt;br</li>
            <li> offers.</li>
            <li> It stays soft through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess common sense.and can leat to most of the issues I read on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wooden handle is light and so far everything has worked as expected.</li>
            <li> for the price this is a must have for anyone looking to try out using a shaving brush with either a soap puck or the old fashion tubes of shaving lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving brushes are a product that I think are frequently overpriced</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, feels soft though</li>
            <li> the real shaves they make possible.  </li>
            <li> I have had to for over 3 weeks now and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristle shedding.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Really soft and has become my go to shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Quality brush thus far.</li>
            <li> (the hairs are fairly soft), which makes shaving no longer a chore for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I can apply a much smoother and thicker lather onto my face prior to shaving than before when I was using my hands.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, holds water well and smells like my soap now.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur to replace my old Gillete, that guess what.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the smell doesn&#x27;t transfer onto anything, it&#x27;s locked into the bristles themselves, but it is something to note.</li>
            <li> Like it, so far.</li>
            <li> Loves it so far.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for several months now and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li> This makes it softer then my old brush.</li>
            <li> It makes the facial hairs stand-up and much easier to remove.  </li>
            <li> Then it leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> also did not notice any smell, but I started with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
            <li> use so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this for a couple of months so far</li>
            <li> So far I cannot say I have any issues with the brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in combination with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> but this brush left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> There is an old saying that goes &amp;</li>
            <li> So far no issues</li>
            <li> have to say that this has completely changed the way I shave.</li>
            <li> After the initial hair loss, which wasn&#x27;t much, the brush seems to be holding up</li>
            <li> it feels soft and no smell like some others</li>
            <li> I have always used the old school shaving soap and a brush.  </li>
            <li> It makes applying the soap much easier (especially when you skip the bowl and go from puck to face).</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> But, no way did that old stuff come up to this product of today.  </li>
            <li> He used it a half-dozen times and it completely fell apart.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it has thus held its form, it doesn&#x27;t look like an old tooth brush yet.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the pack are clear and concise.</li>
            <li> I use it with a cup and Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s held up well</li>
            <li> Extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This is nowhere near as soft as a silvertip badger brush, but you probably already knew that.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made, the bristles are soft and dense.</li>
            <li> but I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much since it was only $13.</li>
            <li> Bradger bristles, I guess they&#x27;re not hairs, are soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Eventually stopped using completely.</li>
            <li> Im glad I ignored the negative reviews and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> the brush completely fell off within a week of using it</li>
            <li> I am one of those who discovered late in life that a glycerin-based shave cream in a jar is infinitely better than anything found in an aerosol can.  </li>
            <li> Nothing outstanding or negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> No loss of bristles so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it while it last, but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it.</li>
            <li> So far after about 2 weeks of using it, the brush seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> Its not auper soft but</li>
            <li> Horse hair is fairly soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, Lathers</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and holds a lather well.</li>
            <li> Using it with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.</li>
            <li> when i use it i&#x27;m left wondering if this thing is real badger hair.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped shedding completely after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Just switched to using safety razor and old fashion shaving cream.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SOFT AND SILKY</li>
            <li> It still sheds about 1 hair per shave, but it completely tolerable.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order 2nd one to keep in my RV.  </li>
            <li> but that is as far as it gets.  </li>
            <li> so I went completely old school and bought everything I needed to shave the brush</li>
            <li> So many 4 and 5 star reviews, but mine sucks.</li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars simply because of its low price, and with genuine hope that it softens up and stops shedding after further use/cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use this brush with the &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I used this 3-4 times and every time I shaved I would lose at least 5-10 hairs in my shave mug and another 5 or more on my face while lathering.  </li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to lose a lot of hair, and so far is holding up well.</li>
            <li> The quality seems top notch - some folks have complained about losing a lot of bristles...</li>
            <li> The brush is not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft but durable.</li>
            <li> You know that old addage.....</li>
            <li> It has worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li> Get this guys as it is so soft.</li>
            <li> starters I use Old Bond Street shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I now tend to take care of my shaving gear and so far all has lasted well beyond any cost/value expectation I&#x27;ve had.   </li>
            <li> I like it so much I am buying another to replace the one I just left in Australia.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3-4 months of use, or as soon as too much soap buildup is visible, follow above steps #1-6, but between #2-3 add this step:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> The old brush looks like Donald Trump.  </li>
            <li> Just throw some shave soap in an old coffee mug and lather it up with the brush.</li>
            <li> Old school style is irreplaceable and unmatchable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars because while it is really soft and an improvement over my old boar brush, it still had some flaws.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the paint brush might not shed its bristles at the rate this thing did, I&#x27;m surprised this item in for sale in amazon at all.</li>
            <li> My beard is really soften prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I just started using a DE safety razor and shaving old fashioned, but I have to say the experience has been night and day.</li>
            <li> nope...every shave at least 3 or 4 buried in the Proraso and more on my face and neck...</li>
            <li> It appears that most reviews in 2013 are negative</li>
            <li> I have bought two so far, one for me and one for  my dad.</li>
            <li> Also, the hairs aren&#x27;t as soft as I would have hoped for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially if I&#x27;m being budget conscious.</li>
            <li> I got back to wet shaving recently and purchased this brush as it shows as the top result on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Shows considerable wear after sitting in my shower for a couple months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the negatives far outweight those.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it so far.</li>
            <li> Brush has held up well under use so far.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it has that kick ass old school</li>
            <li> Old school.</li>
            <li> soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li> OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me so much, but it is constantly losing bristles.  </li>
            <li> but I think at least they are OK</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially it did have a wild scent, but that did fade after about 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets the lather going and is soft when applied to your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say that this brush is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the early bristle loss</li>
            <li> I ordered the Escali badger brush along with a Parker razor and Taylor of Old Bond St. shaving cream.</li>
            <li> With the low price just be ready to replace it in a year or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really soft.</li>
            <li> This thing is soft.  </li>
            <li> Bought with razor and soap to go old school on the shaving routine.  </li>
            <li> - I might just go ahead and buy another Van der Hagen kit JUST for the brush, since it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at</li>
            <li> It might just be the knot I ended up with, but it is soft to the point of being floppy.  </li>
            <li> The quality is very close to equal.  </li>
            <li> Brush works well so far no compliance.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not hurt the skin.</li>
            <li> but, after a month so far, the brush is holding up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe 12 times so far and no sign of wear or pieces falling out.</li>
            <li> Its soft and</li>
            <li> Have used it about 10 times so far.  </li>
            <li> So far it is holding up well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using my brush but so far it&#x27;s been what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a shaving experience that was old tyme style and this is the brush just for that.</li>
            <li> The real problem for me was that it lost it&#x27;s shape with only 1 shave!</li>
            <li> I used it as far as &#x27;breaking in&#x27;...</li>
            <li> It is soft, and helps give an even application when using a shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> At first there were a few individual strands that would come out of the brush, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.</li>
            <li> but there isn&#x27;t really a need to look further than this brush</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li> It has been some time since I have used a brush and lather from soap in a mug, nearly 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it will load so much lather.</li>
            <li> After nearly a month of use this brush has lost a substantial amount of bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully customer service will take some action.</li>
            <li> Just enough bristle to massage face but not too much that it pokes.</li>
            <li> The product is of considerable quality and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it to date.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the brush so much that he got a second one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Got into the old way of shaving from my Brother.</li>
            <li> The brush has completely changed my shaving experience and makes it a lot easier, smoother and gentler to do so.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how much I should spend on the next one as the prices range quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Its not too prickly, not too soft, and it holds its bristles well.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to change my shaving routine, so after much procrastination i finally made the switch.</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Was using a cheap boar brush from CVS and was having lots of trouble lathering Col Conk almond soap.  </li>
            <li> It gives me the same smooth cover my more expensive &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; brush gives me.  </li>
            <li> I tried this brush as a start on &#x27;old school&#x27; shaving.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go next time.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after I decided to stop using shave foam and instead decide to go with Sandalwood Shaving Cream of Taylor of Old Bond</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any value conscious shopper.</li>
            <li> It looks classy too.</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a straight razor and this brush is a must have.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and feels quite well on the face.</li>
            <li> but it is by far the softest.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft, hold water without drenching.  </li>
            <li> I take proper care of the brush rinsing it and gently squeezing it (not wringing it) and then hanging it in a stand.</li>
            <li> However, this brush really surprised me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps i shape and stays soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> it is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> A well balanced brush soft in every way.</li>
            <li> So far everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is replacing my old one that was 5 X the cost of this one that I had for 4yrs.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> i recomended to my family and friends to shave old schoold to avoid all the chemicals the shave cans have.</li>
            <li> Escali, go natural.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Holds water well and is quite soft.</li>
            <li> One to use with old fashioned shaving cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and made with a quality handle.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few months but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and for the longest have always used Gillette -brands</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if I will ever need to spring for a silver tip brush because they might be too soft.</li>
            <li> That brush is about 4 HOURS old.  </li>
            <li> I gave the brush five stars because it&#x27;s soft and spreads the shaving cream well.  </li>
            <li> Natural hair brushes can have some odor</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and a standard horse hair one I got for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Works well and is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told), and it&#x27;s soft on the face.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for any wet-shavers - double edged or straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a waste of money, but I don&#x27;t think people that purchase this brush will stop here.</li>
            <li> No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up to old school shaving.  </li>
            <li> They are far softer than boar hair</li>
            <li> no problems with that so far.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going old school</li>
            <li> I would recommend  it every time  soft and plush</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it loses more bristles than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold a lot of water, warming the shaving cream or gel, and softening the beard.</li>
            <li> I had already switched from the old aerosol can to a a pump bottle cream</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this issue with my old boar brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> and they were too soft.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot;  When I asked why, he mentioned that he was transitioning to an old school non-disposable razor because that&#x27;s what his father used to use.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it&#x27;s only mine.</li>
            <li> Now I just need a stand for my brush and razor to complete the ensemble.</li>
            <li> If I really wanted to make a concerted effort, I could shampoo/rinse it a bunch of times in a row, but it just doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend the Taylor Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream with this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even shave with a razor but ever since I have started displaying this in my bathroom the level of classy girls I entertain</li>
            <li> The smell goes away considerably with use.  </li>
            <li> Gives a closer shave and makes it feel old school.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive for what it offers</li>
            <li> Retains bristles and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> Went to old school shaving and have been using this brush for a month now.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal really.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and it dries overnight.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I always thought as a boy of 23 years old.  </li>
            <li> The Escali brush is soft and holds lather well.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this brush.  </li>
            <li> My husband prefers his old boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how my shaves improved.</li>
            <li> I would go \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> Im hoping it stops losing hair after I break it in, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> It is soft but it gets the job done in terms of lifting the hairs and getting out the dirt.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t extend that far into the handle; they&#x27;re just seated in glue.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a wild animal.  </li>
            <li> But still like it its soft.</li>
            <li> I pair this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College.</li>
            <li> It was like a night and day difference between this brush and my old boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Six months old and the brush fell apart.</li>
            <li> Not too soft.</li>
            <li> I like the look of this brush, but I am still using the old one until it wears out . .</li>
            <li> The bristle are soft and I think sturdy.</li>
            <li> but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really soft on my face which I like.</li>
            <li> You will feel like a man using old school wet-shaving methods, and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> Bristles are reasonably soft.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and evenly spreads the shaving cream or paste.  </li>
            <li> too soft.. just flops around..</li>
            <li> I find that lathering with just the fur of a badger is much easier than using the entire animal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t say the brush is extremely comfortable by any means, it&#x27;s soft enough for my delicate skin and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> I have used it to lather my face directly and used a bowl.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine earlier who is really into the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but sometimes i feel like it was a bit prickly to my face.</li>
            <li> Using this with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li> It is soft yet still stimulating when applying shave lotion/cream.  </li>
            <li> back to double edge wet shaving (I&#x27;m glad I did) and upgrading to the Proraso shave cream</li>
            <li> like the handle, but almost wish it could have been made from something completely impervious to water...plastic, maybe?  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s years in the future, and it was reasonably inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Its bristles are are soft and not prickly.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a straight razor about a year ago, but I didn&#x27;t invest in a brush until recently.  </li>
            <li> Soft and sturdy</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to (please excuse the ending preposition).  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for my old, boar&#x27;s hair brush, and I have to say this makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream when I bought this.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and works well with the cup soap.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a shaving brush and shaving soap for nearly 40 years and have gone through a number of brushes.  </li>
            <li> So far . . .</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference it made.</li>
            <li> It is soft and holds a lot of water, which is what you need if you&#x27;re mixing up lather from a cake of shaving soap in a mug or using a brush-type shaving cream from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s real badger hair, and you can definitely SMELL it.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want something too soft (silvertip)</li>
            <li> so the shedding should completely stop.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soft on the skin and does well in spreading out shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Classy.</li>
            <li> Thus far it feels a tad stiffer than my other&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard raving reviews on this product, and it&#x27;s living up to its name thus far.</li>
            <li> I purchased Taylor of Old Bond w/</li>
            <li> Had it for a month now and so far it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart .</li>
            <li> Developed rashes after using the brush.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to receive a premium quality level shaving brush, just one that would apply lather, not shed much and enhance my daily shaving ritual.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Time to go old school and shave like a man</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> The odor is completely eliminated - not a trace.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and lathers well, however it is not as soft as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> but at this point it is not as soft as my Omega Boar Brush.</li>
            <li> A gentle rinse-out the next day</li>
            <li> It gets tender and soft, but still maintains its bushy nature.  </li>
            <li> Holds water well and is soft.  </li>
            <li> The wooden handle has held up well without absorbing water and swelling.  </li>
            <li> If it will last for a reasonable amount of time; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> These bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have used this brush five or six time so far.</li>
            <li> While I was on a trip I got a professional shave and the gal</li>
            <li> His dog chewed up his old one</li>
            <li> Lathers soaps well and is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would not be surprised if this was made of dog or cat hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lathering my face 3 times during the course of 1 complete shave with this shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves using it, describing it as a facial massage.  </li>
            <li> Never had an old fashioned brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> but as far now I do like the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for nearly 6 months and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it held up very well only losing a couple in the sink.</li>
            <li> But since I paired that Mach 3 with this Badger Brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream my life has changed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheap price, so far no hairs have fallen out, and it has a medium firmness to it.</li>
            <li> It lathers me up like a professional barber</li>
            <li> I replaced my old brush because it started shedding bristles.  </li>
            <li> and I dug the old one out.  </li>
            <li> - it gives you greater control when building and applying the lather (at least for me; I use Geo F. Trumpers shave soap).</li>
            <li> gives it a old school feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face at all</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s nearly a hundred years.</li>
            <li> Scent - Old Fashioned for a Luxurious Experience</li>
            <li> Bristles are not as soft as the brush my son bought.</li>
            <li> It has lost a number of hairs and have used it five times so far ... perhaps three to four hairs per use.  </li>
            <li> I really do wish I had gotten this Escali brush earlier, but at least I&#x27;m sure I will get another one when the time comes.</li>
            <li> As far as bang for the buck goes</li>
            <li> So far, there is nothing I dislike about this product.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s an old Army thing).  </li>
            <li> Holds a ton of water and has a soft knot.</li>
            <li> I used a boar brush for years then switched to the Badger, wow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, lathers well, doesn&#x27;t fall out of my hand, and after a couple of months of using it hasn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Brush loses so many hairs, sheds profusely</li>
            <li> The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  </li>
            <li> There were bristles on my face and on the shaving soap nearly every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I am old</li>
            <li> a quality product, soft not scratchy, lathers up a treat.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> Tried it once so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet comment on the durability but so far its holding up.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like a wild animal like some others have said.</li>
            <li> Nothing sucks more than going to work and smelling barnyard on your face all</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Then, load it with water and &amp;#34;sling&amp;#34; the water out in the shower or tub (hold on to the handle and do a short fast throwing motion).</li>
            <li> I wouldnt be surprised if this was horse hair or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, the price is very affordable and the handle design is solid.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s loosing a considerable amount of hair when shaving.  </li>
            <li> The bristles feels soft on your face.</li>
            <li> so I got him this as an early Father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> You will notice the water turns brown when you first get this brush wet but don&#x27;t panic, it only happens on the first use.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush to replace an old one from another manufacturer that had been shedding for some time.  </li>
            <li> This is like by father&#x27;s old shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and works well.  </li>
            <li> A couple of pumps from the shave cream and it completely lathers my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last July and my husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Also started to using the old shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Escali brush as a back up brush to one I had already purchased and paid 3 times as much for.</li>
            <li> Like my face, the old brush was beginning to show the effects of tempus fugit.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s genuine and the smell went away after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s badger fur, it&#x27;s going to be soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently soft but maintains some prickliness, I just wish it would stay together.</li>
            <li> brush, however, is too soft for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve been using a brush and shave soap for at least a decade or so.</li>
            <li> I decided it was getting old</li>
            <li> It sheds like my old cat</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s bristles are about as soft as her fur.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m going to give it to an artist friend of mine - maybe he can get some interesting textures out of it before it loses the rest of its bristles.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, holds water and lather well.</li>
            <li> So I got a complete outfit, including this brush.</li>
            <li> Was surprised to learn not to store it standing up.</li>
            <li> It also still had the smell of the wild.</li>
            <li> No way to get the wild musk out, will stick to my old brush.</li>
            <li> There also is minor loss of lose hairs in the first dozen uses</li>
            <li> I just dab this once or twice into my Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, and then lather up on the lid, and brush and dab on my face.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m guessing the handle will not last for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Great entry level brush, and even though it loses a few hairs each time I use it, for the price</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was in trouble when I first used it</li>
            <li> There is an initial smell, but that is OK as it is a natural fiber brush, it goes away with a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and it is so much better than using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I then cleared the sink and tried it again with almost as many lost in the next round.</li>
            <li> I received this lovely brush just a few short days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Essentially became only 50% useful after two to three weeks of use, at around 3 days between shaves.</li>
            <li> That said, after a few more shaves, I actually started to appreciate the feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it only a few weeks, but I&#x27;m sure it will outlast me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times but it seems to get better each time.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the brush came with a distinct smell of wet animal, in addition to a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with different brushes, but after using this one for a few months, I can confidently rate it at 5 stars for performance and cost.</li>
            <li> The brush did lose some bristles initially (the 1st few uses), but since then it has not lost any more.</li>
            <li> I can see now, why badger is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush in my first foray into DE Razor shaving, but now, a few months into using this brush, it&#x27;s still shedding hairs.</li>
            <li> For that reason I give it 3 stars, its good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical before ordering this brush, but after using it once I was convinced I made a good choice.  </li>
            <li> You might ask what is there in a brush to break in, well good for you that you have those weird questions.</li>
            <li> I cant wait until I get it nice and broken in and it softens up just a hair</li>
            <li> When attempting to shave with this brush many hairs fell out with each use, but most importantly, it smells horribly!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly moving towards &amp;#34;upping my game&amp;#34; by using better shaving products as I find them.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of shaving with the fussion razor and did some research and bought thr murker 34c and this nice brush along with it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but good quality.</li>
            <li> The lather was crap and nothing compared the excellent lather of the Escali brush.  </li>
            <li> Money wise this brush isn&#x27;t going to dent your wallet, but at the same time it&#x27;s not a great brush.</li>
            <li> Makes thick leather.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - satisfied completely.</li>
            <li> It holds moisture fairly well, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost useless if you are trying to work up a lather with a soap puck in a cup (Williams Mug, good stuff).</li>
            <li> Good quality but bristles are little stiff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s down to acceptable levels, and it&#x27;s now sitting overnight with a full load of lather.</li>
            <li> Able to whip up a thick / rich lather with little effort.</li>
            <li> The second reason is that it loses hairs pretty easily.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and bought this as my first shave brush.  </li>
            <li> The only complain I have is that it sheds quite a bit of hair, but being new to using a shaving brush, perhaps this is normal.</li>
            <li> At first, the brush will smell like a wet dog, but if you soak it in dish washing detergent (look online to find out how to break in a new brush and remove the smell) and use it often the smell will disappear.</li>
            <li> For this price I expected a nice, fairly stiff shaving brush that would hold it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this badger brush; it lathers up soap well, with nice stiff bristles for application.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting to move away from canned shaving gels and towards using shaving bars, getting the right equipment is key.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and stiff when wet</li>
            <li> Like others state, bristles are pretty stiff at first</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something ornamental or elegant, this isn&#x27;t it--as you might have already found out from the picture, it has a plain, undistinguished wooden handle.</li>
            <li> I have been really frustrated with the modern razors and decided to go back to the basics; so far so good!</li>
            <li> and it seems to do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and although there are many other brushes for more money, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made (I hate when I purchase something</li>
            <li> The bristles flatten out way too easily when your applying cream using very little pressure.</li>
            <li> My son will inherit this from his grandpa, which will mean more than gold to all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> However I recently ordered one for a relative of mine and have noticed that this brush is slightly different than my original from about a year ago.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but make sure you use the stand that holds brush upside down to help it dry.</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve made sure to always dry upside down on a brush stand, and have no doubt I&#x27;ll get years of use from this brush.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep it dry and hanging brush facing down on a stand.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to buy a holder and dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse well and hang with bristles down to dry.  </li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that the bristles would not return to their original quality after getting wet and left to dry, but this fear was undue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, it just doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles, and the bristles it does have are far too soft to get a decent lather going.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely recommend this brush for anyone thinking about getting into wet shaving without wanting to invest a significant amount.</li>
            <li> The cheap price of it is what puts it above the other options out there on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This brush might be a great deal according to the other reviews here, but this brush shed hair worse than a Persian cat in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> I let it soak in hot water while I&#x27;m in the shower, then hang it to dry when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to use</li>
            <li> has increased and the brush is noticeably less full than when I started using it.</li>
            <li> It seems to drop a lot of hairs, but it&#x27;s still going strong now past the one year mark.</li>
            <li> As others mentioned, it does have a slight odor -- not bad or overpowering, but noticeable -- however this went away after two or three uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times so far and it does loose a couple of bristles when you first start using this</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the bristles splayed completely and immediately, so you&#x27;re swiping with a very broad expanse</li>
            <li> They are all glued in as a clump, and I was able to super glue them back in and reglued it every month or so for the past few months, but I am finally moving on and getting a newer and higher quality</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush that I&#x27;ve bought, thus my frame of reference is limited</li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush purchase, so, my experience is somewhat limited.  </li>
            <li> Okay guys I hate to write reviews, but I do love this really soft brush and thought well this time!!</li>
            <li> It is affordable, comfortable to use and clean without going through a difficult learning curve.</li>
            <li> It is has a soft texture and retains enough moisture to generate a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> It is has a soft texture and retains enough moisture to generate a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> The brush drys quickly by hanging it up side down as Badger</li>
            <li> Not to bring down the sales to the shipper,because the delivery ways quick and customer service oriented.  </li>
            <li> Working very well so far for the few first shaves.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger hair brush for wet shaving with a double edged safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li> In the original review I wrote, I mentioned a few hairs fell out of the brush with use.</li>
            <li> Shedding of loose bristles were probally 2 or 3 the first couple uses.    </li>
            <li> I first got it, there were a lot of loose hairs, but once they came off the brush was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I used it, there were loose hairs that came out and got into the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> recommend letting it soak, rubbing it on your palm under water, and getting rid of any loose hairs before using for the first time.</li>
            <li> seems to loose bristles on the first use</li>
            <li> Lots of loose hairs on this brush even after months of use, but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I tried washing all of the loose hairs out of the brush before my first shave but it still shed for about 4 or 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> At this rate, I&#x27;ll have to look for a replacement soon, as all that pure badger hair is going straight down my drain.</li>
            <li> Other than some minor early shedding (which has mostly stopped), it has been very solid.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there a few of the hairs have come out after only a few uses, however, the number is 1 or 2, and the overall quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other “pure badger” grade knots and they are exactly the same in performance...</li>
            <li> Overall a good quality brush with only a few loose hairs.  </li>
            <li> New to the world of wet shaving, this was the brush i bought, and a smart choice it was.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much of the shaving soap experience is affected by a decent brush, but so far I really like it with the soap.  </li>
            <li> Brush does not appear to be of really good quality seems to have not much body however the company got it to me in less time than expected</li>
            <li> My shaving experience is better and definitely less abrasive on facial skin from daily shaving.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, may upgrade at a later date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I could say the same for a brush I paid over twice as much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I purchased the local drugstore&#x27;s only shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> The first one was crap (the $12 starter set) and this one was great for about a month.</li>
            <li> A decent quality shaving brush was one such item.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews stated that this brush had an odd odor after opening it from its packaging, but mine luckily did not.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot (as a gift, no less).  </li>
            <li> brush is decent, but I think for my next brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to invest in a more expensive, higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Now, I understand that for a Badger Brush you would need to spend around $35 and above to get a decent one (</li>
            <li> This is my first Badger brush, I only recently moved from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> By using the brush, it always seems to have enough left on it after my first shave for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Starting with the first time I used the brush, and continuing up to the present, stray hairs began coming out.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for any classic gentlemen looking to take their shave up a notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never previously used a badger brush because of its exorbitant cost &amp; this is a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Overall is decent for the price I paid</li>
            <li> Upon first use I noticed the brush shed a few bristles, which one could reasonably expect.</li>
            <li> On the same note, there are tons of shaving brushes many times this price point that seem to get reviews which are no better.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is particularly valuable for those with curly hair that will tend to curl back into the skin (</li>
            <li> I was using an older (5-6yo) boar brush, the badger is a definite improvement!</li>
            <li> I had not previously used a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I just went back to the double edge razor and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The 1st I bought was for myself 2nd one as a gift for my older bRotherham that was using a terible boar brisle one that swe</li>
            <li> I typically do 20 circle swipes to get the soap on the brush, then it takes another minute of applying the brush to the beard to get an adequate lather.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with this brush is that hairs constantly fall out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough brush that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> you want an alternate brush for around the same price, but significantly higher quality, check out the Omega line, specifically the 20102 or 10066.</li>
            <li> The brush I received had several coarse hairs noticeable on first inspection.  </li>
            <li> My replacement brush has since arrived and proved to be much cleaner and had fewer coarse hairs apparent.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and does everything the more expensive brushes do - fast shipping and zero complaints!</li>
            <li> The only reason it lost a star is because for the first several times you shave with it, it will smell like a zoo.</li>
            <li> This brush was one of my first badger brushes when I started traditional shaving several years ago.</li>
            <li> When it runs out of bristles, which looks to be soon, I will replace with a more expensive and higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely a decent value to determine if you want to experiment with traditional shaving, but I will be upgrading</li>
            <li> This brush was purchased as a gift for someone who wanted to try the older, traditional methods.  </li>
            <li> The first time several hairs do fall out though, so don&#x27;t panic if you think your brush is falling apart, thereafter only one or two hairs fall out.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy an Omega S-Brush (not the Omega Syntex, they are an older variety) or an Omega Boar/Semogue Boar as a starting brush.</li>
            <li> It seemed to do a decent enough job making lather.</li>
            <li> If the brush was bigger and less smelly it would be fine</li>
            <li> The first one I have had and used regularly for several years.</li>
            <li> The water from the first wash on mine actually turned brown and murky, and the brush actually did smell like badger.</li>
            <li> More expensive companies wash this smell out first.</li>
            <li> Considering how damn expensive and fancy these brushes get, I want to point out that this brush is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny for the first few uses, but maybe that&#x27;s the smell of freshly plucked badger hair.</li>
            <li> It was still wet from this mornings use, 13 hrs ago, I guess I need to take more care drying it because I hung it upside down.</li>
            <li> The brush does not shrink down too much and spreads the shaving cream on my legs very well.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad little brush.</li>
            <li> not bad but wished the handle was a little bit longer</li>
            <li> It will lose a few bristles at first (like any brush), but after a few shaves it will hold together strong, even against intense lathering, and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The price was right and quality seems to be about on par with other entry level brushes.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The bristles are high quality and do not fall out under regular use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two high end brushes also do the same to me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> He says it is reminiscent of the high quality ones his father and grandfather used.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it because of it&#x27;s premium feel for this low price.</li>
            <li> so I had to purchase another and the second product is of equally high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price may be low but the quality us high.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but from my personal experience, this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - especially for the price point.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting a stand to hold your razor and to hold the brush so it dries properly.</li>
            <li> it left so much hair in the lather that I had to throw the whole thing away, third the lather was of white, almost brown color that leads me to believe that the hair on this brush are painted.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this brush, it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Not much to add except it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Having used this brush for several months now, I highly recommend this purchase to others.  </li>
            <li> you can, try visiting a store that carries various brushes (for example, Art of Shaving but beware that their prices are HIGH).</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a quality brush</li>
            <li> The brush dries quickly and very few bristles have fallen out or escaped the main group.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are thick, soft, and installed into the wooden handle very securely.</li>
            <li> This slightly improved the smell, but it was still very strong and difficult to even test smell once wet with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent enough first brush for getting introduced to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I just put hates a new better brush as I am tired of trying to use this one.</li>
            <li> Being new to the whole wet shave thing, I bought this brush off of a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li> found my old double edged razor ordered new blades,soap and this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving, and recently decided to dump the Gilette Mach $$$ and switch to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> As a new wet shaver, I do not have anything to compare it to, but it works very well with the 2 soaps that I use --- Arko and Pre-de-Provence --- lathers well in the can with minimum water, and holds sufficient lather for a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> This being my first shaving brush my experience is very limited.</li>
            <li> Fibers tend to come loose a little more than I would like.</li>
            <li> No regrets!!</li>
            <li> Makes it a little more difficult to use, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li> Buy something a little more expensive to avoid losing quite so many bristles</li>
            <li> Recommended from someone with no other experience!</li>
            <li> The badger brush feels a little coarse but it does a great job of building a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lather with very little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Gently run the brush over a soft towel OR hang in a stand to air dry.</li>
            <li> It is soft and rinses well and dry fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about a month, and it more or less what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> eventually went ahead and shaved with it anyway, and noticed that the brush wasn&#x27;t as soft and gentle as it felt when dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brushes and this is easily one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made my own stand to hang my brush up to dry (brushes should be stored upside down to dry)</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because if you do not dry it very well it smells mildewy.</li>
            <li> This is the second Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I have bought,  The first one of several years ago has lost no bristles so the new one is serving at present as a spare.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not fall out no matter how hard he can use it at times and we love that the product is all natural and the handle is wooden and not plastic.</li>
            <li> The first one was from a better known name brand, but was very poor quality and the hair was coming out in clumps.</li>
            <li> During the first use it shed a few of the bristles which worried me, but I guess that must have been normal for the first time, because it hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle since.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is true of all shaving brushes, but be sure to rinse it well afterward and dry it on it&#x27;s side or upside down, otherwise it develops a smell.</li>
            <li> With this type of bristle loss, you will enjoy the brush for a minimum of 5 years, if not more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that its comfortable and saves me a lot on shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I spent several minutes rubbing the brush on my palm over the sink and coated the porcelain with more than 50 bristles which promptly jammed up the drain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give you any long term test but as of now I really like this brush..</li>
            <li> My husband had really wanted this one to replace another that had lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although there are some minor flaws, it&#x27;s really well priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> and it feels cheap - because it usually means it is)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved a woman like I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I am using this brush in my first adventure in wet shaving</li>
            <li> Exactly  Wat I expected</li>
            <li> I can say aside from some initial shedding wich seems normal with anything using natual hair</li>
            <li> Of course there was some brush hair loss initially, but I assume this is normal.</li>
            <li> It is pretty inexpensive though, so I guess that could be expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that it is expected that some hairs will fall out on the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> First off, as soon as it gets wet</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, spend a few extra dollars and get a better quality brush,</li>
            <li> When wet the brush smells exactly like a Badger.  </li>
            <li> So, I was looking forward to my first badger brush, after having to use a boar brush that got ratty and rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Minimal hair loss at first use.</li>
            <li> The Brush is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I expected this to stop, after the first couple uses but it continues.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I had some hairs come out in the first use, but as to be expected.</li>
            <li> Had a smell the first time i used it like wet dog.</li>
            <li> As it stands I can&#x27;t recommend this brush as anyone&#x27;s first foray into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Not having any prior experience with a badger brush, I&#x27;m guessing it might be normal not being a synthetic brush</li>
            <li> The brush was synthetic bristle and was pretty rough on my face.</li>
            <li> a couple bristles during first use, as expected, but have not lost any since.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first to try out wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid I&#x27;d say it was money well spent as my first shave brush.</li>
            <li> It lost a lot of hair initially, but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, it is animal hair, so it will give off a bit of funk the first time it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Please note that all natural brushes have some smell initially because they&#x27;re natural products (they come from living creatures!)</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what I ordered and expected to receive.</li>
            <li> The first 2-3 uses there&#x27;s a smell, which is expected of a badger brush</li>
            <li> The safety razor shaves pretty well, but you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> first brush or travel brush for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is normal, but it is definitely a gamey scent.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Following a few simple care suggestions and it seems to do OK.</li>
            <li> and that is expected after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say as I haven&#x27;t exactly checked out the market on badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> A few hairs fell out the first time I used it, but after that it&#x27;s been pretty solid.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it is everything i expected.</li>
            <li> At first it has a bit of a smell (wet badger?), and also in the beginning it stains the soap</li>
            <li> This was the first badger shave brush I purchased when I started wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My first experience into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> It also has that distinctive badger smell when you first wet it, but that disappears after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving mine and having a first shave with it, I noticed a pungent odor not unlike that of a wet badger.  </li>
            <li> expected a bristle here and there to fall out with the first couple uses, however, after about 15 uses 5 to 6 bristles continue to fall out during use.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The Escali has been exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> Minimal hair loss when i first started using this.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it would smell like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> Seems good..not as full as The Perfecto, but the Perfecto is beginning to shed bristles heavily</li>
            <li> High quality affordable product, complete with instructions on cleaning and care that were lacking for other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased; I wish I had purchased this one first!</li>
            <li> At first it was shedding some of its hairs, but I read it was expected and that it would just settle down after a few uses and it is good that it did as I kept picking long hairs off my face.  </li>
            <li> Properly using the safety razor has significantly cut down if not eliminated razor burn</li>
            <li> No more shall I bow down to any more boars and their whiskers for my shaving needs!</li>
            <li> It lathers easy and just stiff enough to lift hairs.  </li>
            <li> Soft brush, a little small but definitely feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> It does shed a few hairs every so often, but at the current price, that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> Holds water fine, but the hairs are coming out after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Gave up a few hairs the first couple of uses, but holding steady now.</li>
            <li> I drilled a hole and epoxied a rare earth magnet for &#x27;sticking&#x27; it upside down underneath my sink.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving I first made the mistake buying a boar brush at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to solid shaving cream--versus foam from a can-- and use the Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> Pure badger hair is the only way to go to ensure a proper lather that gets into the beard.</li>
            <li> although the brush is 100% pure badger, it is only badger fur, not the entire beast.  </li>
            <li> and so I was quite intrigued to see such a relatively inexpensive brush that was \\&quot;pure Badger\\&quot; ... which I incorrectly assumed meant that the brush has nothing but Badger hair.</li>
            <li> Not really a significant issue, this is to be expected from most brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is it feels &#x27;sloppy&#x27; and limp, like using a wet cotton ball.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars was because it lost quite a few bristles the first few uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There will be a few hairs that fall out the first couple of times, and I suggest letting it soak in hot water for a few minutes when you first get it.</li>
            <li> A little prickly the first few shaves but just fine after that.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse it properly and do dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> Letting it air dry upside down helps keep it fresh and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Due entirely to those crummy disposable razors that wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush sure is nicer than the old cheap rough, stiff, brush I used the last few years.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and does not loose hairs or bristles.</li>
            <li> But it has faded after a few uses and I attribute it to the real material it&#x27;s made of as well as the fact that my other one im used to is just a cheap synthetic bristle with no smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to all this traditional shavin stuff.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush, but I have watched several maintenance care videos on youtube</li>
            <li> I got this Brush recently, eventhough I am new to the DE shaving, (approx 1.5 years), I had a Prker Brush as a 1st one, that one fell apart as well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving, and boy did I change the entire experience with this product.</li>
            <li> This new Brush is shedding quite a bit, I&#x27;m left with Hair in the Soap, and on my face.</li>
            <li> Not enough to bother me into buying a new one though.</li>
            <li> If you are new to traditional wetshaving and want an affordable entry-level badger hair brush, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I would guess the brush will last through another 2 or 3 months before a new one will be needed.</li>
            <li> But at this rate I see myself having to purchase a new brush sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I am New to shving with what I call &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; shaving equiptment, such as this Escali Badger Brush.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush as part a gift set with a new Double Edge Razor by Merkur.</li>
            <li> The scent is essentially GONE from their new brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush has remained stable and essentially as it was when new.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks the brush looks like new.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item, especially over using live badger.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m currently shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the same  to anyone who has a new brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a double edge razors.</li>
            <li> I have no intention of going back to cartridge razors after just 1 shave with my new safety razor</li>
            <li> My only word of warning is that if you are new to using a shaving brush</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush and with quite a bit to choose from finally decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new Escali badger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the long-term durability of the brush, since I&#x27;ve had it for only a couple of weeks, but in my regular shaves, I am loving it; the badger hair is tough enough to give you some tingle and agitate the hairs to stand on end while remaining soft enough that it does not irritate sensitive skin like a boar&#x27;s hair or synthetic brush would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter brush if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> As it seems I&#x27;m one of the few that experienced a poor</li>
            <li> A brush is essential because it allows you to build up a better lather with less product resulting in a closer shave and more efficient use of expensive shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well and there isn&#x27;t a floppy characteristic to it when it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I gently squeeze out excess water before storing the brush hanging handle-up for a drip dry.</li>
            <li> I dry the brush hanging from the handle, keeping the bristles always expanded and ready.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking to upgrade their daily shave should consider using this all natural bristle brush that is soft to the touch and gentle on even dry winter</li>
            <li> - the whole hair bundle broke off the hand when I was squeezing water of out of it to dry it.    </li>
            <li> I only have a couple months&#x27; worth of wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li> When first used it had a chemical smell and left the lather a grey color.</li>
            <li> Does the job well though, and soft enough for sensitive skin if used correctly.</li>
            <li> At the rate this is happening, won&#x27;t be much brush left in short order.</li>
            <li> when I first got it a few hairs of course fell out, this is normal.</li>
            <li> Loses hairs on a regular basis, has no rigidity, doesn&#x27;t build lather well, pokes into the skin even more than bear hair brushes</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the hair falls out more than I would like.</li>
            <li> It does lose a lot of hairs during the first few uses, but I can see that being normal.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and pick up and Omega boar brush for the same price OR spring the extra money for a real badger brush.</li>
            <li> (second use and later) with just a gentle squeeze.</li>
            <li> . . . before it had completely shed the entire finish on the handle.  This means the wood of the handle is now completely exposed to the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine immediately developed a void of hair directly in the middle</li>
            <li> so I simply rinse thoroughly, shake out as much water as I can (~2 minutes of working, shaking while the cream softens facial hair) and then rest the brush on its side in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also is comfortable, firm enough to massage in the cream but not so raspy as to irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I was concerned after the 1st shave because it shed a few more hairs than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and hope it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> have noticed some discoloration of the wood around the knot (where the bristles meet the handle), as well wear around the top edge of the handle, as if the finish is wearing off, not sure how the brush will hold up long term</li>
            <li> only complaint with the Escali is that it does shed a bit more than desired.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to discover many of the hairs coming out and becoming lodged in the soap with each use.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re willing to soak it overnight in white vinegar before using it.</li>
            <li> Hairs falling out at first is normal, after a few uses, it stops happening.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, holds together (a few hairs came out for the first week or so, but that&#x27;s fairly normal and it hasn&#x27;t had a shedding problem</li>
            <li> only complaint is it tends to lose more bristles/hairs than I think it should.</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating would be that I have lost a few of the badger hairs after some light use (once a week).</li>
            <li> Badger brushes have always been my favourites;  I decided to get one for my husband, who had last year gone from those god-awful shaving foams to real soap, but had only bought himself a cheapy brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Escali brush isn&#x27;t very expensive, yet it lathers beautifully and, oddly enough, the lather stays on my face.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how a brush this size can have more bristles than the Escali without some pointing straight sideways and being totally useless.</li>
            <li> While this brush isn&#x27;t terribly expensive, it&#x27;s twice what I paid for my cheapo and definitely not twice as good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to keep up with the Joneses, they&#x27;re huge D-Bags with nice crap and no money.</li>
            <li> It Lost a few bristles in the beginning but quickly stopped doing it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Break it in: (1) soak it for five minutes in hot water (2) load it with a good shaving soap  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and adequately secured within the holder.</li>
            <li> Lathers and applies with a few quick brush strokes.</li>
            <li> While the bristles were a little stiff for my liking, it&#x27;s done my face nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush to new wet shavers or anyone looking for a bargain brush.  </li>
            <li> Excited to get this new shaving brush, I have had some badger brushes in the past, and I was looking to replace my current brush of 5 years from Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Opened the box, and the smell of manure hits me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are all matted once wet and stiff making the process of working up a rich lather very cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> maintain it by rinsing thoroughly after use, holding the bristles right below the wood when I shake it out, and storing it bristle-side down from a hanger that I bent for the purpose.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last Shaving Brush, which didn&#x27;t shed at all, until it got very old.</li>
            <li> , seems to holds its bristles well, had a standard sized handle and is very soft.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and appears to be a solid product.  </li>
            <li> But, It&#x27;s very soft to the touch, but a little prickly on my face the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the directions that are on the reviews and the internet to learn how to properly whip up shaving cream -soap lather, and especially how to clean your brush (run under water till clean, blot dry on towel, put in brush holder - handle up to dry - brush down).</li>
            <li> Glad I got this brush, have been using this for a couple of months and it sheds very little and dry</li>
            <li> It had a cheap plastic handle/base, and the bristles were too long, too soft, too uneven, and fell out with every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am value conscious, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to buy cheaply made items.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected and he loves it!</li>
            <li> have seen other brushes at a much higher price</li>
            <li> Mine continues to shed hair after three months, but that has not affected the shaving experience in any major way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, isn&#x27;t prickly, and only lost a few hairs when I first used it.</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> The brush sheds like no other and it is still releasing a brown tint when rinsed.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, it is a bit prickly at first, but within five or six shaves it softened up.</li>
            <li> It seems to shed a little more than some of the other brushes I&#x27;ve encountered</li>
            <li> Most of my brushes in the past simply fell apart after a short time.  </li>
            <li> This brush has major manufacturer&#x27;s defects.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my primary, and very expensive brush, this one is cheap and priced nearly as if it was disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ** 03/05/2016:  TWO Major</li>
            <li> You got rid of the one major complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First experience owning a badger brush - so I can&#x27;t offer experience in comparing to other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush with low expectations, and boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I had my first one from walmart until it began to fall apart due to reaching it&#x27;s end of use point.</li>
            <li> There is no other way to &amp;#34;describe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> NO worries and NO regrets... ACES!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush but other reviews prompted me to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any major problems with bristles falling off as some reviewers described.</li>
            <li> The other three went into the Christmas stockings of the sons-in-law (&amp;#34;My Three Sons&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> This brush is also a bit more forgiving with the amount of water used to make lather than the more expensive brushes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> some other users reported the first couple times I used it.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some decent ones around $50 to as high as $300 + for a single silvertip badger brush!!!  </li>
            <li> It does have a &#x27;&#x27;new&#x27;&#x27; smell for the first few times that you use it</li>
            <li> Right before first use and after wetting the brush, the wet brush scent was a little off-putting, but after lathering-up and using the brush a couple of times (x3)</li>
            <li> Smelled fairly strong like wet animal initially - which is not unusual for a natural brush, but this continued for the first three weeks of near daily use which seemed longer than with other brushes.</li>
            <li> After owning for a year, this whole time I have been losing hairs from the brush in my shave soap/cream and they come loose on my face or stick in the shave soap.</li>
            <li> For the first two uses there was a slight &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and completely went away after 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to get this inexpensive shaving brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like wet shaving and wanted to keep my initial costs down.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised with the quality and would have bought this as my first everyday brush had I&#x27;d known,</li>
            <li> I first soak the brush for a few minutes in a small ceramic bowl in really hot water (tea pot hot water).</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving and so far I see no potential for me to ever go back to a 6 blade razor and shaving cream from a can.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very strong chemical smell which has faded a little after washing it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The only real complaint we have is the bristles come out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> There is a real difference in applying shaving cream with badger hair over other types of natural and synthetics.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the handle is comfortable and the bristles are not too rough, but I would choose another brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has lasted one year and is still going strong with regular use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will lose quite a few hairs initially, and a couple every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Apparently I have super hard water, so getting a really good lather is difficult and is easier with a boar bristle brush for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, the first time that I used it, about a dozen or so loose bristles came off - no big deal.</li>
            <li> Holds water and lathers very well, and barely any loose hairs on it.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t loose much, only on the first use.</li>
            <li> Again, not my first brush, but this one constantly has hair coming loose.  </li>
            <li> Initially (the first week of use) loose hairs kept coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding or smell as some other reviewers have noted here but make sure to sanitize the brush before your first use and then maintain it properly during it&#x27;s life (rinse, blow dry if possible, hang upside down to continue drying).</li>
            <li> The bristles are both stiff and soft in just the right way.</li>
            <li> It works well, and certainly lasted longer then expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving and ordered the brush due to its high ratings.  </li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and decided on this brand due to the high ratings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any other shaving brush to compare this to since this in my first foray into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Also, I installed a powerful disc magnet in the bottom of the handle and now hang it tip-down from a little cubby that&#x27;s set into the wall beside my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really more of a $25-30 brush at less than half the price...and the reason I shop on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the brush does tend to lose hairs during every other shave, even following a normal routine of rinsing the brush and allowing it to dry while hanging from a stand, being sure to keep water from getting on the knot, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into shaving with soap, that a friend makes,&lt;br /&gt;over shaving with shaving cream, and had a decent brush from a big dept store chain.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This Escali brush gets bonus points for having an Italian name and a classic wooden handle!  </li>
            <li> A decent shaving brush can retain enough soap and liquid to allow several applications without having to “reload”.  </li>
            <li> It has decent sized handle seems small at first</li>
            <li> you really are a small company and want to reach a large market, make a gimmick brush (100% Vaginal Hair) instead of spamming.</li>
            <li> The brush will shed a little a first then stops completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a full 5 is because it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> - this did shed a decent amount over the first few uses, but now it&#x27;s just the occasional hair here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush was not stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> Seems as high a quality as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> There is also a section of hair in the middle, but a little off center, that has more backbone that the surrounding hairs.  </li>
            <li> Smelled a little funny at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a badger brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are skimpy, it is not a very full brush, so much so that even wet, the handle makes the unit top heavy and want to fall out of the shaving mug.</li>
            <li> Almost uncomfortably small it&#x27;s hard to get a good whip going.</li>
            <li> It will lose a little hair the first few uses but that seems pretty normal.</li>
            <li> I would recommend paying a little more and getting L&#x27;Occitane Cade shaving brush for $30, you can get down to $24 if you join their rewards program</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend a substantial amount on a real badger brush.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating, because my opinion is positive, but I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes to use superlatives.    </li>
            <li> I bought this due to all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Its not the best brush but its far, far away from being the worst.  </li>
            <li> (badger brushes are generally easier at creating lather than boar.</li>
            <li> is a cheap brush does its job, but loses a lot of the quills/hairs (it sheds like a dog).</li>
            <li> but you generally won&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> I like it for it&#x27;s weight and thickness, density and softness of the bristles, and general quality.</li>
            <li> I generally see a hair or two fall out during every shave, but otherwise it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have generally used a boars hair brush and decided to try a badger hair.</li>
            <li> Having nothing to compare it to, I will give my general opinions.</li>
            <li> It is very well built and with care, yes, it is a tool gentleman and they should never be abused, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a &#x27;life long&#x27; straight razor user, but will be considered one as of last year.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Perella&#x27;s went above and beyond in this instance; I did not submit any complaint to them directly, nor did I offer a terrible review, but they still reached out to me in an effort to make me happy.  </li>
            <li> Ok I know nothing about shaving brushes, and as a result I may be complaining about something that is normal even with expensive brushes</li>
            <li> not sure if i notice much difference between real and synthetic</li>
            <li> These smells are pretty common with real animal hair brushes</li>
            <li> This brush works well like any other, the packaging was fantastic, but like any other brush....</li>
            <li> I use this as my traveling brush because it is small enough to fit in my shaving kit without being damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has only used it twice so far, but it has lost a lot of bristles both times.</li>
            <li> I will probably upgrade to a silvertip here in the near future!</li>
            <li> I find the bristles are too soft to lather the shave cream properly.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as my CVS Pharmacy brush but this one does not shed hairs and the price is the same.</li>
            <li> I also changed to Proraso shaving soap when I started using this brush, so I can&#x27;t directly attribute the awesomeness of the lather to them individually, but as a pair.</li>
            <li> hair is soft on your face if you have sensitivity to the rougher brushes this would definitely be the way to go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly a year (11 months) of constant use, I have probably lost 5 hairs (which is nothing).  </li>
            <li> About a year ago I decided to go back to the old way of shaving that my Dad and Grandfathers did it...</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;ve only seen 3 bristles fall off so far).  </li>
            <li> I would recomend this to anyone thinking of starting out shaving \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> I would still absolutely recommend this brush as an entry-level brush to those who are getting into DE shaving and just want to get their feet wet.</li>
            <li> I recommend starting out with a Taylor of Old Bond Street</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of weeks ago and have used it only two times so far.</li>
            <li> I am currently using EJ &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; DE razor with Taylor of Old sandalwood cream.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s manufactured, but the quality is apparent nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> Using a shaving brush may seem old fashioned, but once you try it you&#x27;ll never to back to shaving cream in a can.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of time so far.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it two times, but the brush is still as soft as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that there are some in the $100 range if you get really into the wet shaving lifestyle and</li>
            <li> Well i can tell you its not because of the day my doberman got a hold of it and uses it as a toy, barely lost any bristles that day being</li>
            <li> Pretty rough for the first few shaves, but after a while it softens up.</li>
            <li> I get using this badger brush, Taylor of Old Bond Street avocado shaving cream, and a double edge razor...</li>
            <li> the brush, when wet, didnt hold form very well.</li>
            <li> but wow such a difference.</li>
            <li> They all do what is necessary: create lather from soaps and creams, either directly on the face, in a bowl, or in your hand.</li>
            <li> I have barely lost any hairs in it, and it keeps the shape well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as soft as my last brush</li>
            <li> the brush lasts longer than my old one, I will come back and upgrade to five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, works well, and while not a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; item, seems like it will stand up to daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out often developed an odor rapidly even with proper care.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas present to my son who has decided to go old school.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets about buying the Escali brush and will buy another when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take it from a guy with sensitive skin who HAS TO SHAVE DAILY!</li>
            <li> Solid construction, hair is quite soft, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> after about 3-4 uses, i was flicking the water off teh bristles , and the bunch of bristles completely came off of the wooden body..disappointed..</li>
            <li> The bristles fell completely off the handle during its second use.</li>
            <li> Holds lather very well and makes wet shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I saw that it was going to lose some hair, so, for the first two times that I used it I combed it out with the coarse end of my comb, it rarely loses a hair now.</li>
            <li> This brush irritates and barely lasts.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so far</li>
            <li> Finally decided to give old time shaving a go</li>
            <li> the bristles come out frequently interfering with shaving (with a double edged razor anyway).</li>
            <li> So far, its a throw away, but, for $13.00 bucks, well, it&#x27;ll do the job until I find my next one.</li>
            <li> Will have to wait on the durability with use, but everything is terrific so far.</li>
            <li> , it is soft enough on the skin and spreads the soap in an even manner.  </li>
            <li> stated but that is to be expected with real animal hair.</li>
            <li> I recently got into acoustic shaving, old school style.</li>
            <li> but it should be rinsed thoroughly before the first use to remove the dark dye(?) from the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The stink nearly turned me off from it entirely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hanging mine from some string on a towel rack until I have time to make a proper stand, but it&#x27;s treated me well so far.  </li>
            <li> I have brushes that are years old with no such problems.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li> Well; I have purchased dozens of things online over the years and, as far as I remember, this is the only item that I have ever returned.</li>
            <li> Therefore I invested in a German razor, the Escali shaving brush, and a jar of sensitive shaving cream that lasts quite a bit longer than the canned foam.  </li>
            <li> It works well for anyone how wet shaves, and wants to decrease razor burn by preparing your skin for a blade to slide on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that my brush is getting old, the finish is starting separate.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe you spent that much on me.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Consequently the brush struggles to produce a proper lather.&lt;br /&gt;Using real shaving cream with this brush just wastes the cream and much is needed to get a</li>
            <li> Apparently the glue gave way</li>
            <li> After shaving a couple strokes I rinsed my razor out and noticed that I had apparently grown badger hair because that&#x27;s partly what rinsed out of my razor.</li>
            <li> The brush was is soft enough on the face not to bother me.  </li>
            <li> But it is of course real fur, and it had a persistent wet animal smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you want change the way of shaving, old school shaving is totally recommended !!</li>
            <li> Careful though honey badger may pretend not to care, but can be very jealous at the sight of another freshly-shorn badger.</li>
            <li> When his old brush finally needed to be replaced, I chose this one as a birthday gift .</li>
            <li> The brush barely lathered before that fix.  </li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason not to buy this product, the laminated clear coating on the wooden handle has delaminated and is peeling off like a 2-day old Sunburn.</li>
            <li> I just got into wet shaving and did not know much about quality of brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a year now, bristles are still soft and has retained it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times so far and the smell is still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush once thus far.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to go with a Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap in a Wooden Bowl.</li>
            <li> (As far as badger brushes go, this is the only one I have</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far), but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I followed the same practices that I was using with my old brush...</li>
            <li> , I went back to my old brush for now.</li>
            <li> The reason for this is simple - it ensures that the brushes natural hair bristles don&#x27;t chip off or</li>
            <li> Really helps to lather up for the wet shave.  </li>
            <li> My 2yr old female yorkie saw it and must have seen the hair pattern or something.  </li>
            <li> used a brush and actually whipped up the cream in a cup like in the old westerns.  </li>
            <li> I see one hair from the brush on my face about every 3rd complete shave.  </li>
            <li> and now I barely see any.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to Badger hair.  </li>
            <li> I have only used six or seven times so far.  </li>
            <li> and I have not regrets.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised, but the smell was definitely stronger than I anticipated, and</li>
            <li> Been shaving my head on a daily basis, and had to replace my old brush.</li>
            <li> I discontined to use this brush, went back to my old brush, and my face cleared up after a couple of days, and have had no further problems using my old brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and it is back in</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t relish going through a return process for such an inexpensive item, I just broke out the epoxy and fixed it on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for nearly four months now and it continues to perform well.</li>
            <li> Far closer than using standard shacking cream or the lotion w no brush.</li>
            <li> My Dad had a worn out brush, and being old school, only uses brush to lather before shaving.</li>
            <li> No regrets, I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I expect it will stop completely after a couple weeks of use, also like my last brush.</li>
            <li> After years of shawing with commercial brands of shawing cream, I decided to try a natural shawing cream and</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this brush, a dark gray dye ran out of the brush and made the shaving soap</li>
            <li> Soft, supple and TOTALLY retro!  </li>
            <li> Looking back, I wish that I had gone to WhippedDog and purchased a silvertip badger hair brush for $26 from the beginning and not wasted my money on this brush - just my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a wooden handled, badger-hair shaving brush, pretty much exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been soaking this brush in steaming hot water (a few seconds after boiling) and it sits for about 5-10 minutes as I shower, and it has held up so far.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, not sure if it is normal</li>
            <li> There is some minimal shedding especially the first use</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the animal smell at first, which frankly I expected.  </li>
            <li> At first, several of the bristles come out, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly as described and delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It lost a few hairs initially, which I hear this is normal, and I haven&#x27;t lost any hairs since the first week.</li>
            <li> When I first used it several of the hairs fell off, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> But hold on: this brush is well made, is not too expensive, it applies soap exceeding well and the handle nicely fits the nifty brush and razor holder</li>
            <li> The handle is kind of cheesy.</li>
            <li> I almost returned it for that reason alone but it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to go to the post office.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the slow leisurely manner it takes to use it.</li>
            <li> but I own expensive brushes &amp; inexpensive brushes and this one</li>
            <li> bought mine for under $15, and I think it was well worth it, seeing as how you can waste a ton of money on fancy brushes.  </li>
            <li> But from my experience of using this shaving brush the past few weeks, I can honestly say that it does its job</li>
            <li> I used the brush (given to me by my family for birthday)&amp;#62; I enjoy using it with the cream when I have time for a slow shave.</li>
            <li> You could do much worse, you could do much better.</li>
            <li> (some others have had better, and others worse experiences in that regard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an ok brush for the money but not great.</li>
            <li> Once properly broken in, the brush is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
            <li> Hoping it will stop soon, will update after more use and broken in.</li>
            <li> it shed routinely and smelled a bit like a small animal (not a bad smell, but it did smell).</li>
            <li> The bristles were a little stiff on my face for the first few days, but they have softened nicely and no longer feel like they are pricking my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush for my son to use as he started with a straight razor - it high quality and quite stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut shaving prices down considerably, and get a much shave.</li>
            <li> The first couple shaves I was losing 10-20 hairs, but now it&#x27;s down to a hair or two per shave.</li>
            <li> It has lots a few bristles which is a little surprising compared to other badger brushes I&#x27;ve used, but we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend buying a brush stand to hang the brush to dry.  </li>
            <li> The more expensive brush doesn&#x27;t shed, but is about 1/3 less &#x27;full&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Having shaved with a brush for over 20 years I recently found myself in need of a new one and ordered several from Amazon to try.   </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this especially to someone new to this method of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I utilized 5 minute epoxy to join the two back together, but a new product should require such measures.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this will last me for a very long time and I won&#x27;t have to throw as much away.</li>
            <li> Very little smell that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> The other was lower in cost, but wasn&#x27;t 100% Pure Badger.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly try other products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a super expensive brush, so it&#x27;s great for beginners in DE shaving to get to start with.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to shed bristles to easily.</li>
            <li> I hang it to dry on the rack, and it dries perfectly, ready for the next shave.</li>
            <li> It will dry much faster and last longer.</li>
            <li> My previous brush would constantly shed and this brush rarely sheds.</li>
            <li> This will tame the natural odor and soften before first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received shipment quickly, and the brush is a well crafted piece, which feels solid and heavy in hand.</li>
            <li> I strongly believe this brush will last me at least a decade.</li>
            <li> cheap brush bristles keep falling out -dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> There was a little minor shedding the first few days, but that has pretty much stopped.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of other better brushes out there at the same price and you shouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this one.    </li>
            <li> When it comes right down to it,  this is a solid product.</li>
            <li> There were quite a few loose hairs when he first started using it, but it has since stopped shedding so much.</li>
            <li> Been so long since I had a new brush</li>
            <li> but I soaked mine overnight a few times in diluted lemon dish washing liquid and the odor came right out.</li>
            <li> For the first month, the brush was stiffer than the previous brush.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight issue with the first one that was sent out to me and without any questions they sent me out a replacement</li>
            <li> Some people mention an odor, mine had a slight &amp;#34;badgery&amp;#34; smell the first couple of uses, but this has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I said in the subject line.</li>
            <li> When I first used the brush it lost a half dozen bristles</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted at a third of the the price of other shaving bushes</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using a shaving brush, so I have no past experience with them.  </li>
            <li> hairs are very coarse and sharp and the density is pretty lacking.</li>
            <li> But I have had no problems with bristles falling out; the only time I lost a few hairs was the very first time I used the brush.  </li>
            <li> I get the exact same performance from this Escali brush at a fraction of the cost of my other brush.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave 4 stars is that the brush was smaller especially compared to my older ones.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend still uses this because we don&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a brush, but the hairs quickly became flattened and somewhat matted after a small amount of use...</li>
            <li> Odor is small and goes away quickly..</li>
            <li> You might get a little softer or a lose a few less bristles if you buy a more expensive product, but for the price it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also got a few other popular products to begin my shave den such as Proraso Green, my Merkur 34C, and a decent brush/razor stand.</li>
            <li> I was worried I would need a more expensive brush, but I feel confident now that this will last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I expected a few to drop during the first few shaves while it worked itself out, but it&#x27;s becoming a bit unacceptable to continue having this</li>
            <li> It holds just enough water to make adding the cream easy without making a wet mess of things.  </li>
            <li> I know other commenters have said it gets soft over time, but when I bought the Van der Hagen kit previously, it was soft right away.  </li>
            <li> Very new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very thick in diameter, meaning it&#x27;ll only hold enough lather for two, maybe three passes.</li>
            <li> No loose hair.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical considering this is a pure badger  brush at a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> (I still use a more animal-friendly artificial bristle brush from the Body Shop, which is fine but less luxurious.)</li>
            <li> I remain with my original brush which I was going to replace, but it loses a couple of bristles a shave, the Escali 4 or 5 times that.</li>
            <li> Why are other brushes so darn much.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to other brushes its much cheaper and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between badger and boar, other than the color.</li>
            <li> This brush does everything that other brushes costing 5 times as much do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about other brushes.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected, a lower middle of the road brush that performed well enough for ~10 bucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but it does get a little messy.</li>
            <li> I had a few hairs fall out from the brush the first couple times I used it, but nothing major</li>
            <li> Only use a few times thus far but exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It creates a really rich and thick lather with my Prorasso shave cream.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create rich thick lather.</li>
            <li> Rich, thick lather and a luxurious close shave.</li>
            <li> I shave about 2-3 times a week (less than average) and it has lasted me 2 years and imagine it will last me several more years.</li>
            <li> What did it in for me was that after about 6 uses, with typical lather technique, the middle part of the brush (essentially the core of the brush where most lather should be) became depressed into the brush, the bristles became tangled down there and that results in a garbage lather.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is strong ( no more loose badger hair creeping up the nose).</li>
            <li> Has a solid wooden handle, 100% full and dense bristles, and it retains heat from the lather as long as any other badger brush.</li>
            <li> After the brush was completely dry, I noticed it was softer than when it was new.  </li>
            <li> First off, I am new to DE shaving and purchased this brush due to other posted reviews about one month ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff at first obviously, but after a while the badger hair gets soft and they have also stayed in the brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this cheap brush if you&#x27;re serious about your shave.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this brush is really smooth.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have a huge base to use for comparison, but I&#x27;ve been absolutely pleased.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the fraying/shedding that never quite goes away, though it&#x27;s easy enough to just trim it.  </li>
            <li> Loads very well and keeps wet for an entire shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about ten times and have only lost a couple brush hairs so far.  </li>
            <li> I have bought three of these; the 2nd and 3rd were for my adult sons.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really have anything to compair it to, I can only tell you this brush has worked as well as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Some minor shedding at first, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> The only reason this brush doesn&#x27;t get five stars is because in the first few uses some of the bristles came out, but this is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so this could just be a normal thing that I am unaware of.</li>
            <li> After only a week or so, there was a &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; in the middle of the brush where the hairs had completely fallen out, or tangled together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot of about shaving brushes, so take this information with a grain of salt as it&#x27;s possible that this is normal for them or that it&#x27;s not going to cause any problems for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has become more difficult to find old fashioned razors and the associated brushes and soaps needed.</li>
            <li> After several shaves that stopped happening and it has been a solid brush so far.</li>
            <li> current brush is approaching 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Please, please, please do not waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;**New wet shavers and old alike,</li>
            <li> It was smaller than what I expected but the build/material quality was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a dew days of staying away from the brush, and going back to my old shawing methods, I used it again, only this time noticing that the brush is the source of the smell.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra few dollars for badger.</li>
            <li> The varnish did not dry evenly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to whip in a cup, but difficult to get a good lather on my face because of how uncomfortable the bristles were.</li>
            <li> A few of the hairs have come out but again, not unexpected and still feels full.</li>
            <li> They must not have used a good enough adhesive to keep the hairs attached to the wood because as I lather up my beard hairs come off and get stuck in the lather, which is itchy and infuriating.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;escali\\&quot; name on the front leads one to believe it&#x27;s an Italian product, however I&#x27;m not sure this is in fact true as there is no indication on the product page or on the product itself as to where it&#x27;s manufactured.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have lost a few strands within a few weeks of purchase, but besides that, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> He suggested since I was just getting into the wet shaving trend, I buy this particular brush.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m not gentle at all.  </li>
            <li> I just switched to the single blade razor and my friend told me I needed the cream and brush to go along with my new shaving system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just transitioned to the wet shaving, and Escali brush definitely plays a big part in making it a positive experience.</li>
            <li> It lays down the most uniform lather on my face in comparison to any of the non-Badger hair shaving cream brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> the brish itself, it smelled a little at first.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty stirdy little brush.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little prickly when you first start to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I give it 4 stars because off all the hair that came out at first, and because it is a little prickely.  </li>
            <li> a little at first-</li>
            <li> It shed a little the first week or so, but shedding is now a rarity.  </li>
            <li> It did have a little odor at first</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little prickly at first</li>
            <li> This little brush could not be of higher quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of basis for comparison with other more expensive brushes, but this brush gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li> I use it with some hot shave soap lather and it&#x27;s like a little luxury in the morning.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the hair loss was due to the break in, but months later I was still losing several hairs on every shave.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it did have a little bit of odor.</li>
            <li> I lost a little bit of hair the first couple uses</li>
            <li> The brush sheds a little bit here in there in the first week but nothing to warrant spending twice the price on another.</li>
            <li> I was a little thrown off by the smell the bristles give off at first.</li>
            <li> A little glue from the hot glue gun</li>
            <li> I use barbasol and a little bowl to lather up with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did shed a little the first 2-3 times I used it</li>
            <li> It is a little scratchy at first, but that goes away over time.  </li>
            <li> Nothing major but enough to mention it.  </li>
            <li> This thing feels a little prickly at first</li>
            <li> It was a little smelly (Badger) at first, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so take my review with a little grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> a little badger whiskers on the face never hurt no one ; )</li>
            <li> I never carry big cans of shaving cream, but I do carry a this high quality pure badger shaving brush, and a small bar of shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll loose a few bristles the first couple of times you use them, that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> Firm and tight bristles, with a soft and comfortable feel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for newbies to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for wet shavers on a budget.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this brush to anyone who is getting into the wet shaving trend that is making a comeback.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking to start wet shaving or already are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive brushes in the past but this one lived up to being at least as good.</li>
            <li> It does not come up to the feel of one of my other Italian pure badger brushes (costing around 40-50 dollars).</li>
            <li> Try out the different brushes and you&#x27;ll notice a difference between the pure and other brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, a few of the bristles do become loose and fall off during the first couple uses, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, so I ran it under hot water with a bit of shaving cream and used the brush on the palm of my hand before shaving with it to get rid of a majority of the loose bristles.</li>
            <li> It only gives me a smooth shave everyday, my razors lasts longer!!</li>
            <li> the mean time, for the price and the use I have gotten out of it so far (~3 months) this brush was well worth the price for an introduction into brush lathering.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to last a long time, so be prepared to buy a new one every couple months.</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I wanted it to be, no more and no less.</li>
            <li> Having used it a few days, I am pretty certain it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> thoughts:  If you are on a tight budge, this little guy will get you by until such time you can afford a better brush since this one will not be the last brush you ever buy.</li>
            <li> My husband took a step back a few years ago by switching to safety razors and shave soap - cheaper, less waste, all the good reasons.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that although this is a great starter brush it sheds like crazy!</li>
            <li> He really appreciate this gift and uses on a regular basis due his skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brushes and they were much softer then this, and around the same cost.</li>
            <li> I read some negative reviews but decided to try it since it was 1/2-1/3 or even more of the price of some other shave brushes.</li>
            <li> Although it was bought for someone else it gets stolen on a regular basis and due to that I can say it holds up very well.</li>
            <li> I am rapidly approaching middle age,&amp;#34;I am 72&amp;#34; I have always since age, about 18 used a garden variety Drug Store, or Grocery Store, shaving brush; well let me tell all who might be interested, this brush is; at least for me, far, far, ahead of those garden variety brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as other badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit coarse but apparently need to be for lathering up well.</li>
            <li> After used this brush daily for about a week, it not was a quarter sized bare patch.  </li>
            <li> and I am not especially rough on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up very well for several months of daily, rough use, and I even bought my wife one just like it</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are very coarse to the skin, especially for those who have sensitive skin and are likely to bleed during a shave.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the brush did shed several of its bristles on the first shave, and continues to lose an average of one or two per shave a couple of weeks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a natural product, I was not surprised or taken aback, and now it is odor-free and does not stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also quite prickly, and not near as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The bargain price is no excuse for being covered in badger hair.</li>
            <li> So far it has performed well with minor bristle shedding.</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest brush I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  </li>
            <li> A few hairs came off on the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> Shed a lot for the first few uses</li>
            <li> The Brush came in pretty humble packaging.  </li>
            <li> A few of the hairs came out the first couple of times using it.</li>
            <li> My understanding was that some bristles would come out the first few uses until the brush is &amp;</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, there were a few stray hairs from the brush that fell off onto my face.</li>
            <li> Had just a few hair&#x27;s fall off while using it, for the first time.</li>
            <li> A few hairs fell out the first time the brush was used.</li>
            <li> I noticed a smell for the first few days, but probably wouldn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> A few bristles fell out over the first couple of shaves, but none after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this after my first badger-hair brush fell apart after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Looses a few hairs for about the first week, but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> A few hairs come out in the first use but</li>
            <li> For the first few times the fur was coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li> Prepare a hot water soap with a few drops of dish soap.</li>
            <li> You might want to shampoo it when you first get it to remove the funky smell; I didn&#x27;t, though, and the smell went away after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> It also shed a few bristles during the first couple uses but seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li> up, I did notice that the bristles were a bit prickly during the first few uses.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews of the Escali brush here on Amazon and decided it was worth the small investment to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It shed a lot during the first few uses.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this you&#x27;d think I had lathered up and rubbed my face on my dog.  </li>
            <li> but it does lose quite a few hairs in the first 5 uses but then the problem stopped.</li>
            <li> Note that a few hairs will come out the first couple of times, but that&#x27;s temporary.</li>
            <li> I noticed I lost a few badger hairs from the brush after first use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was acceptable the first few times</li>
            <li> I did notice after the first few weeks</li>
            <li> It shedded a bit in the first few uses, but that tapered off after using it a bit.  </li>
            <li> it did lose some hair for the first few days</li>
            <li> had a few bristles fall out the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> I did lose a few bristles on the first use though.  </li>
            <li> For those saying the bristles fall out, that happens with any brush in this cost range the first few times you use it.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend soaking it a few times in hot water, and remove the looser bristles.</li>
            <li> Where there&#x27;s trouble is the badger hair consistently falls out.</li>
            <li> It will also shed hairs the first few times you use</li>
            <li> Took about a week to \\&quot;break in,\\&quot; meaning for the first few days</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs at first.</li>
            <li> Expect some shedding for the first few days</li>
            <li> You lose some fibers the first few uses but after that nothing.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this brush is exactly what I need for travel.</li>
            <li> There were a few hairs that shed with the first dozen</li>
            <li> The brush did shed a few bristles at first</li>
            <li> first few times I used it a number of bristles seemed to come out, but that seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as entry brushes for a few friends looking to get into higher quality shaving.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have lost a few hairs the first couple times.</li>
            <li> first few uses, it lost a hefty amount of hairs (now it might lose one or two hairs</li>
            <li> This shaving brush does have an odor the first few times you use it</li>
            <li> The first day I lost quite a few, but now the loss is tolerable.  </li>
            <li> just remember to let your Escali brush soak in a cup of hot water for a few minutes before you shave.</li>
            <li> You do lose a few hairs when you first start</li>
            <li> this brush had some coloration that washed out during the first few goes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs the first time I shaved but haven&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> It lost quite a few hairs at first</li>
            <li> After a few came out at first I have had none falling out on me.</li>
            <li> Those are going to come out within the first few times I use it.</li>
            <li> Some hairs did come off of the brush during the first few uses, but that stopped after ~5 uses.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out, but he said they always do when you first use them.</li>
            <li> Yeah, a few bristles fell out with the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Lots a few hairs after first use.  </li>
            <li> After the first shave with it, I noticed that there was quite a few hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> I have lost a few bristles at first</li>
            <li> A few hairs came out on first use, but none since</li>
            <li> It does smell at first as people say, but that is what happens when you use dead animal hair on your face.</li>
            <li> A few strands come out the first couple times, but nothing that effects the product.</li>
            <li> It shed a ton the first time I used it and still sheds a few hairs each time I use it now.</li>
            <li> At first a few bristles would come out when lathering up, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with it after  the first few uses.</li>
            <li> The brush does shed a few hairs when you first get it but that stops after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Upon first use just a few brush hairs came out of the brush but</li>
            <li> As soon as the brush is wet, it smells close to a wet dog but distinct enough to be (what I assume is)</li>
            <li> A few hairs fell out on the first couple uses, but it stopped soon after that.  </li>
            <li> The brush did smell a bit &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; when I first got it, but that wore off after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> To summarize, this brush is WELL worth the small investment.  </li>
            <li> A few hairs fell of the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to using a brush on soap, I think I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to a fuller, more expensive brush (maybe even silvertip!).  </li>
            <li> Not a bad brush, but it loses a couple of bristles every time I use it.</li>
            <li> As expected, the first use or two resulted in a couple loose hairs, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues.  </li>
            <li> It might still be breaking in and loose bristles might be expected at first from manufacturing.</li>
            <li> A man has to shave and this brush certainly makes it less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Pure is the lowest quality classification typically used.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I feel the handle is too small as most of the lather created always drips down.</li>
            <li> new brush was about half the cost of the old one.&lt;br /&gt;JF</li>
            <li> Very few loose hairs compared to the other more expensive brand I own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but it may have been worse than the original brush!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted it has the smell of a new brush on first use, not uncommon for hair brushes, and may be reduced by washing with shampoo before first use.  </li>
            <li> Was a decent brush...not too harsh (and not as soft as hoped)</li>
            <li> The main problem is that the handle is too short to grip when your hand is wet.  </li>
            <li> A decent brush for someone looking to try traditional wet</li>
            <li> Pros - price (mine cost under 10 USD), real badger hair, compact size, dries well in down position.</li>
            <li> I hang it upside down (under my sink) and it dries out very quickly (much faster than the boar brush used to).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving (years of using multi-blade systems with canned shaving mush don&#x27;t count), and this is my first badger shaving brush; it replaced a synthetic bristle brush I was using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I washed it with some dishwashing liquid when I first opened the package (not because it was dirty or smelled bad, but because I didn&#x27;t want to rub something all over my face without making sure it was clean first!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too stiff, but is soft enough for a gentle exfoliation of your face.</li>
            <li> Hello fellow wet shavers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush back in August when I chose to dive right into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I usually lose about 1 per shave currently, although I&#x27;m sure that will become less as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I was a little suprised though at how prickly the tips were when I first used it despite its overall softness</li>
            <li> It did shed a little for the first couple uses, but the boar bristle one i had initially did also.....</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used this, it left a bunch of little hairs all over his face.</li>
            <li> I have since invested in a decent razor - merkur, and have invested in other products.</li>
            <li> A lot of hairs fell out initially, and now it is only 1 or 2 per shave, but I assume the really high end brushes don&#x27;t have any loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I found the varnish on this brush to be way too slick, and had trouble hanging onto it with soapy hands, and so I went through all the trouble to remove the finish right down to the wood, and then, while I was at it, I used a high-speed rotary tool and appropriate burrs to create a random pattern of shallow holes with sharp edges at the surface of the wood (so as to provide a good gripping surface when the handle was slippery with soap).</li>
            <li> It was cheap yet highly rated; I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive brush if I didn&#x27;t like the safety razor</li>
            <li> This badger shaving brush is not cheap, but if an old fashioned shaving experience is what you desire, you need this high quality,well made brush.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I expected so much, and it really isn&#x27;t a big enough problem to make me want a different brush any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice a very few brush hairs fall out after about 3 uses, but after about 1 month worth of use</li>
            <li> I would practice lather making with any strong scent shaving cream or soap a few times to get the smell down to an acceptable level before actual use.</li>
            <li> I held the brush up and purposely plucked any bristles that were noticeably longer than the rest; wow, I gently removed over a dozen with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bulky as some other more expensive brushes but it works really well.</li>
            <li> However, when I wet my brush and swirled Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream in a bowl with it, a rich, thick lather appeared.....</li>
            <li> the bristles will fall out due to the wooden brush handle drying much more slowly that the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing is that I loose a hair or two when I use it, then again I am pretty rough on it.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and so figured i would get an inexpensive brush to get started.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m new to the world of wet shaving, and just about everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively New to wet shaving with a brush and soap, so I was quite unsure what to look for in a quality brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving (6 mo).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to others new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Its loosing some of the hairs but since its a new brush, it is expected to happen.</li>
            <li> but I imagine it is expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to give a bit of assurance to new wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and got this brush because it was an inexpensive option to get started.  </li>
            <li> Im new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and purchased this brush based on all the reviews I saw here.</li>
            <li> I found the bristles to be pretty stiff, too.</li>
            <li> I am new to the classic safety razor and brush shave and didn&#x27;t want to invest a small fortune into something I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like or not.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend over any of the other shaving brushes, could not be happier!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle</li>
            <li> Now, when it said it was 100% pure badger hair, call me naive, but I thought that was some gimmick name for new brush hair technology.</li>
            <li> , there is a slight prickly feeling i really like.</li>
            <li> (it is shiny and chrome and i am a guy, so i dig it) to let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use i&#x27;m finding less and less hair each time so eventually it may stop shedding all together, but i would definitely prefer one that was shed free from day 1.</li>
            <li> This is the lowest of the grade and on a dry face if you put the plume directly to your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;If half stars were permitted I would have given this product 4 1/2 stars based on how much I like it and the price point.</li>
            <li> You can spend $75 on a brush with a fantastic handle and hairs that never come out, or you can buy this one for less than 1/5th of the price, and get the same value for less money...which increases its value....</li>
            <li> Soft on dry skin and doesn&#x27;t shed like a spaniel in August.</li>
            <li> You want to hang dry the brush to prevent early wear.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well and and has lost less than 5 bristles since I have owned it.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for a low cost general brush, especially with shave soap</li>
            <li> This brush provided the quality I was looking for, the smooth lather necessary to cut my not so shave-friendly facial hair, and the price that left it very financially viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely 5 star, and call me naive, but I cannot imagine what else you would look for in a badger brush that the Escali does not provide.</li>
            <li> I cannot really afford lot of money to buy expensive brush but really wanted to get some decent brush...and found it here...</li>
            <li> On my second shave only 2 hairs came off and the brush barely smelled.</li>
            <li> As far as durability and longevity, I don&#x27;t know how long a shaving brush should last.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but so far, only a couple of bristles have come out.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles with only minor break-in required&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hear its super common.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as pictured and came on time to surprise my hubby with on Valentine&#x27;s Day (not easy to find these in stores).</li>
            <li> It shed when I first tired making lather with it, but I didn&#x27;t know you were supposed to &amp;#34;pre-shed&amp;#34; it before really using it.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the brush is that it shed quite a bit during the first few uses and continues to lose a couple of hairs with each use.  </li>
            <li> My brush lost a total of about 3 bristles over the first few weeks of use.    </li>
            <li> I think I only had bristles (and just a few) fall out with the first shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the brush for a few weeks, but it appears to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes I can&#x27;t comment on more expensive brushes, but it is hard for me to understand how much better a $50 brush could be than this inexpensive model.</li>
            <li> The brush had shed a lot of hairs initially (in the first two weeks) then stabilized to one or two hairs falling everyday.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the first few times I used it, some of the hair/bristles fell out while lathering.  </li>
            <li> The bristles have softened with use and the amount of shedding (happens with all brushes no matter the quality) is pretty miniscule only a few hairs after four sessions.</li>
            <li> Works well for about a year and then loses bristles quickly.  </li>
            <li> Initially lost a few hairs at first use (~50?) but has stopped shedding since then.</li>
            <li> and/or loses bristles quickly.  </li>
            <li> for the animal smell; yes it is there, but only for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Mine did not have any odor whatsoever and minimal hair loss at first use as i expected.</li>
            <li> I lost several bristles in the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> The first time my husband used the shaving brush, it smelled like a wet dog - or maybe a wet badger.  </li>
            <li> This product came to us when expected and was exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li> Smells very odd at first, but it seems to go away.</li>
            <li> I usually buy at few Meyers for just a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs have come off in the first month.</li>
            <li> Also, be prepared for a musky smell, especially the first few times, presumably from this being badger hair.</li>
            <li> It did shed a very slight amount and had a hint of a smell at first.</li>
            <li> It loads quickly, lathers well, and rarely loses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lost a few bristles in the 1/2 dozen first uses, but this may just be the initial break-in..</li>
            <li> Little rough at first but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the loss of a lot of hairs as I had read was normal - there were only a few the very first few times.  </li>
            <li> only reason for 4/5 stars is just due to the fact that on the first use, a bunch of bristles came out which gave me a negative first impression.</li>
            <li> big plus is that even though I don&#x27;t hang it upside down; it really dries well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s true that there are a few loose badger bristles left on your face initially</li>
            <li> Hairs falling out constantly and was super hard to get the roadkill smell out of it.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have stated, it is slightly prickly for the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not very annoying.</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin but stiff enough to produce a decent lather with shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and apply the shaving cream in a smooth, delicate manner, while also raising the facial hair slightly to make for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It will lose hairs the first few times you use it, which is annoying but probably not all that uncommon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this again because I don&#x27;t use it that much and the hairs appear to have stopped falling out but still not cool.</li>
            <li> first thing I&#x27;ve noticed during my first use of the brush is an intense unpleasant chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles come out of it pretty frequently</li>
            <li> The Escali is very similar to my old brush; it loses a lot of hairs at first.  </li>
            <li> not long after the third time using it the bristles have been coming off  a lot</li>
            <li> First thing is it is actually animal hair, so it smells like a wet animal when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I only lost couple of bristles the first couple of times and lost none the last few times.</li>
            <li> There was also fairly few loose hairs in the first use, certainly fewer than other brushes I have</li>
            <li> only people that would consider purchasing this brush would be someone new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I looked online and found that an initial odor was to be expected from new brushes and that with use and washing (w/ borax, vinegar, baking soda, shampoo, etc), the smell would go away.  </li>
            <li> Several bristles have fallen out but this is to be expected with a new brush.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving and this is my second brush.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I had done enough research to determine that I wanted to go with a Badger brush compared to either Boar or Horse hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend excessively on my initial brush, soap, safety razor etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all traditional wet shavers!</li>
            <li> However, I like the brush but hair strands continue to come loose and the strands are not as soft as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> : Soft, not very much hair falling out after 4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> He says it works great and doesn&#x27;t look bad setting on the sink (also to dry) during non use.</li>
            <li> It will last longer and dry completely.</li>
            <li> Easily the worst brush I own.</li>
            <li> If dried properly (hanging freely upside down)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another one now for a year, storing it hanging upside down properly, and it&#x27;s lasting very well.</li>
            <li> Whips up lather quick and thick (enough).</li>
            <li> Works really well and have only lost a few bristles the first few times.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, natural, pure Badger bristles whip up a lather quickly and apply it thickly.  </li>
            <li> After use I rinse out the brush in running hot water and let it dry hanging down (handle up)</li>
            <li> Super glued them back in and they have stayed since, but not very happy as now bristles are shedding.</li>
            <li> after four days of use, and I have ordered a synthetic brush which I expect to be better (at least in the smell department), especially when used with the Jack Black Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> It is well put together, and at less than half the cost of most of the other brushes on Amazon, it was a solid buy.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine, but I&#x27;m tired of picking badger hair off my face when trying to shave.</li>
            <li> This brush will do the job just fine, I have shaved with it plenty of time, but there is not much joy in using it and my shave cream is covered in hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Now the shaving brush looks seriously deformed and patchy when it should be in full bloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whereas I&#x27;ve found boar bristles somewhat stiff and horsehair unpleasantly fragrant, badger brushes are properly soft, spread the soap evenly, and clean easily.</li>
            <li> Since the brush is new, I expected quite a bit of hair loss for the first few weeks, but I was very surprised to find almost no loose strands, at least so far.  </li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave and little to no razor burn every shave.</li>
            <li> Very well made and add a little class to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really like this little brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few loose bristles, which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of 5,  but all in all, this brush is worth owning.</li>
            <li> So if you are on a budget new to wet shaving or just want to try the brush I encourage not to delay and give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Only precaution is to store it with the bristles down - easy enough with a rubber band wrapped around a small towel rod.</li>
            <li> Only other point I can add is that if you have big hands, go for a brush with longer stem since this one may prove too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight animal smell, but only if you wet it and stick your nose right in it ( which I did for the sake of this review).</li>
            <li> As the brush bloomed, a large empty spot has appeared in the center of the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is much nicer than applying by hand, and it actually does help to get shaving cream under the hairs to raise them up a little.</li>
            <li> Once this little jewel is broken you will begin to see why this brush is so popular.  </li>
            <li> If you, like thousands of other shoppers on Amazon are considering buying the Colonel Conk Shaving Stand to hold this brush and your razor, you should know that the Escali brush handle is just a shade too thick to slide easily into the prongs.</li>
            <li> Did loose a few hairs right off but not enough to worry</li>
            <li> Also a stand would probably be useful, but I just loosely wrap mine in two pieces of toilet paper and keep it in the little cup I use to lather up the cream.</li>
            <li> It is neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t really use it any more.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, both good and bad, then ordered.  </li>
            <li> Good brush for the money , I use it every day , when it starts going bad</li>
            <li> Works up a good lather&lt;br /&gt;Noticing some shedding but nothing too bad at the moment</li>
            <li> I had hoped that they would be soft but they are not, at least not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> Once it became clear I was going to stick with wet shaving I bought a mid-level Parker shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate its longevity, but it is quite clearly a quality product that I expect will last a long time.</li>
            <li> A few hairs came out the first time I shaved, but this was not unexpected.  </li>
            <li> Everyday I smile because I am not throwing another empty shaving cream</li>
            <li> Its OK, not a great product as I expected.</li>
            <li> What I usually do is let it sit in my mug full of water to get those bristles wet.</li>
            <li> Soak in water for a few mins, warm water makes the smell worse.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion worth it for the price but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but the clear coat on the base of the handle has chipped off.</li>
            <li> Its a cheaper brush, and its a little on the thin side, but it works just fine for getting a decent lather.</li>
            <li> The other day I took my brush out, she became entranced and walked right up to me, standing on her back legs and placing both paws on the sink (she&#x27;s a black lab, so it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s tiny).</li>
            <li> It is a little small and won&#x27;t sit easily on my bowl sideways, but that is just because of the bowl I have.    </li>
            <li> I know, how hard can it be to use a brush right?</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a high cost brush that lasted less than a year before it started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that it would look odd against a black brush stand, but I am actually quite pleased with the contrast.  </li>
            <li> The brush is real smooth on the face and covers your face with thick foam in no time.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating is due to the initial loss of few hair bristles from the brush during lathering which I had to remove from my face in order to shave properly.</li>
            <li> The only cons I had was a odd smell when the brush was wet the first couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Badger fur is a fiber that stays stiff while wet (no dirty jokes intended).  </li>
            <li> Lost very few hairs the first couple of times I used it none since.</li>
            <li> Had the expected loose hairs come out initially, but the proper prep (a thorough washing with some soap) minimized it under normal use.</li>
            <li> I have less irritation and razor burn, and it really doesn&#x27;t take me as long as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Black coloring/dye immediately came out of brush when I wet it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight smell of wet dog when I first got it</li>
            <li> Early on I found a few bristles coming off, but this may have been due to me using too much pressure when lathering and applying the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I had several loose bristles that fell off...</li>
            <li> Normally he uses typical shaving gels, but I bought this along with some shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The bristles are from natural materials and not synthetic like the other one I had and the handle is solid wood as opposed to plastic.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> but a bristle falls off about every other shave so far, but not a big deal</li>
            <li> I can also see a big difference in lather quality depending on whether i use soft water (which we have at home) and other tap water (when I am traveling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as you get it wash it in soap and hot water then let it soak for an hour or so in sudsy water then shake it out, lather it up and leave it like that overnight - in the moning wash it out, lather up and WOW Softer by at least 50%!</li>
            <li> A few hairs will fall out at first but those are just the loose ones.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little funky the first few times I used it, but I suppose that badgers smell funky in the wild, too.</li>
            <li> forget that you should hang the brush upside down from a stand (not included) or lay it on its side to prolong the life of your new furry friend.</li>
            <li> , the bristles are pretty sharp (at least compared to my new brush)</li>
            <li> It could easily have been uncomfortable, prickly, or poorly made - bristles coming out or such - but the Escali shaving brush is fine.  </li>
            <li> me close by saying that the scent thing is really No Big Deal; I merely included the info above to give a full &amp; complete review, not glossing over anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty soft after you use it a few times and the wooden handle seems to not be affected by the water if you let it sit in there for a few minutes while soaking the bristles pre-shave status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very high quality wooden handle and the brush holds a generous amount of shaving soap without dripping, which is an issue I have had in the past with lesser quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Not very happy about that too in light of other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The creamy lather I&#x27;m getting since getting this brush is ridiculous, the bristles are soft and it seems very durable.</li>
            <li> Quite a few bristles have come out, not enough to change the shape in any way, but a decent number have.</li>
            <li> As a new wet shaver my review will be based on my limited experience so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handle is a tad small for my stand but just large enough to hang on it.</li>
            <li> A little rough at first, this brush will get softer over time.</li>
            <li> Yes there was a little bit of a &#x27;wet animal&#x27; smell to it at first</li>
            <li> You just have to get the same size knot of silvertip which usually from what I have seen varies from as low as 19mm to as much as 26mm from my experience.  </li>
            <li> This brush loses hair as well, but I think after the first few times, it gradually stops losing as much.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as the other badger brushes I&#x27;ve touched before.</li>
            <li> I washed it a few times using shampoo and really worked the bristles when I first got it to help with these two commonly reported issues.  </li>
            <li> The brush shed a little at first but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little prickly at first but once wet</li>
            <li> A few natural bristles come off the first few uses, but nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop, Collaborate, and Listen:  </li>
            <li> This was my first and only brush purchase since I started wet shaving with a DE razor a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem which may be normal is that the hairs tend to come loose(only a few at a time) and stay on my face in the lather, possibly lessening the quality of the shave; requiring an additional pass or two.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s worse than I originally thought.</li>
            <li> I hated it because after using it as it should be it lost a lot of bristles and I was left with a face full of beaver hair and more in the shaving mug.</li>
            <li> After a few soaks/uses, the smell became tolerable, but never really went away in the first (and only) month that the brush was used.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff at first, but become comfortably soft after a handful of uses.</li>
            <li> Using this brush is much less annoying than rubbing shaving cream on by hand, does a better job, and it was cheap enough to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to it as other reviewers have noted, but should go away within the first month of use.  </li>
            <li> I am able to get a thick, even lather with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Its a good looking shaving Brush, no problems with the ordering and delivery of the item, but sorry to say I am very disappointed in the Brush, the bristles stick together when soap is applied and does not make good latter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to wetshaving, i.e. less than two weeks in.</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs have come loose and the coating on the wooden handle seems to stand up really well to continuous water exposure.</li>
            <li> I noticed a few loose hairs which is completely normal for the first few days.</li>
            <li> Hairs are a bit hard when you brush it against your face, but after wetting it down and mixing the soap it becomes smooth.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone tired of high priced razors and want to go back to the days of the double edge razor.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is at first, some hairs were falling out.</li>
            <li> Overall when you compare this brush to others I&#x27;m okay with these small issues since it&#x27;s less than half the price of others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check for the same and update after at least 10 uses for some consistent data.</li>
            <li> It loses bristles more prodigiously than any brush I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs came out the first several times I used it, but besides that I have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can go back to not using a brush to get the beard ready for a shave</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that every time I use it I end up with a bristle or two on my face or in my shaving cream, which has been happening consistently since purchased.  </li>
            <li> Loses some bristles at first but no big deal.</li>
            <li> The only negative is a funky smell to the bristles the first couple of weeks, but that goes away, and isn&#x27;t offensive, just... off-putting.</li>
            <li> I purchased five products as a group after being less than enamored with the offerings from local stores, that included a high-dollar N-brand electric razor with goop that stopped being supported a year after purchase, and a gazillion-bladed KoRazor that cost as much for replacement blades that drag on your face like a boat anchor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal because I can pull them off my face, but I want this to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> If you follow the proper care directions for owning a badger shaving brush, it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing noticeable when it&#x27;s wet, unless you stick your nose INSIDE of the brush and inhale deeply, and even then, it&#x27;s barely there.  </li>
            <li> But, by properly rinsing, squeegeeing, and hanging the brush handle-up via stand, this brush should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> or i guess a wet badger for the first use, and a few hairs fell out</li>
            <li> As to be expected with any brush, the first few uses felt a bit prickly, but the bristles softened up for me in about four shaves.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll lose a few hairs from the brush initially, but that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> first time using a shaving brush, in the begining it lost a few hair (to be expected)</li>
            <li> One star off because when using the brush in circular motions it does have a prickly feel and also some bristles do fall out with each shave (only used a few times, so maybe this is normal and will stop eventually as the brush \\&quot;breaks in\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It builds up a decent lather and isn&#x27;t harsh on the face.</li>
            <li> I expected a few to fall out with the first or so uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly getting interested in getting back to the basics with shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush works pretty well, but the base cracks very easily when exposed to water (which you have to as you are wet shaving) and the hair constantly comes out and stick to your face while you shave, which is quite itchy for me.</li>
            <li> However, once the initial batch were lost, I only get the occasional single hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a single edge razor back in early March.</li>
            <li> As I understand a pure badger is usually lower quality than boar.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat small and not as large as I had&lt;br /&gt;expected.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck and by using this brush I have less irritation ofter shaving.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are perfectly stiff, while still soft enough (at least for me, I&#x27;ve noticed others complain about it being too stiff, but I like the stiffness as it helps to liften facial hairs more).</li>
            <li> On the down side, it sheds like an Old English Sheepdog.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, you should expect some hair to fall out, especially during the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, some people prefer using boar whisker brush - which is absolutely okay, but it is not for me - and definitely not for those who cannot handle the loose hair upon their manly faces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the bristles are very stiff and cheap feeling, they stick out unevenly from the brush base--giving further evidence of their ability to fall off.</li>
            <li> 2-3 times around the base of the brush hair to help the badger hair be more stiff and easier to work with to create an easy lather.</li>
            <li> Hard to compare yet because my first brush lasted me 7 years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to control exactly where you&#x27;re applying suds.</li>
            <li> Since this is my first shave brush I can&#x27;t be too hard on it.</li>
            <li> Even though I have given this brush a 3 star rating t is still pretty hard to beat for the money.</li>
            <li> It shed for the first few months, but that has slowed down, and it only occasionally drops a hair now</li>
            <li> New to the whole shaving game that doesn&#x27;t consist of cream from a can</li>
            <li> The Escali seemed to be missing a large patch of bristles in the center, preventing proper frothing with the tips.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to my &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34; but was quickly disappointed after first use.  </li>
            <li> On the second use the bristles shed, the soap won&#x27;t lather and it dripped gray water presumably because it didn&#x27;t dry out properly.</li>
            <li> It is soft and has less of a smell than the last brush I used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After decades of aerosol cans and steadily increasing prices of replacement blades from the company who gives away the razors (you know who I mean) entering the slightly arcane world of shaving brushes, mugs and safety razors has been entertaining, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a boar brush man because I prefer hard soaps, but I thought I&#x27;d give this little pure badger a try since the price was so low.</li>
            <li> Its not very expensive so if you are new to the badger brush game</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little rough, but it IS a Pure bristle, which means they use any part of the badger, not the softest bristles.&lt;br /&gt;-Holds</li>
            <li> Loses a bit of hair at first but that stops after some usage.</li>
            <li> Sure enough comes my entire disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I imagine that is pretty common.</li>
            <li> Fortunately after shave number 5 or so it settled and now only loses a few hairs with each shave.</li>
            <li> Using this brush, the cream, and a small metal bowl, I really don&#x27;t think it takes any longer to apply than a canned product.</li>
            <li> I first bought this brush years ago and since that time I have bought at least 4 or 5 for gifts.</li>
            <li> It loses a bit of hair the first couple times you use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It loses hair the first handful of times you use it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the brushes I had in the past.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> when I purchased it -- I didn&#x27;t know what to expect or how long it would last.  </li>
            <li> The hairs are also only a minor annoyance as they don&#x27;t get in the razor at all.</li>
            <li> Meaning the soap doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Some minor lost of hair bristles initially but has kept its shape well.</li>
            <li> Save your money, and if you are looking to buy a brush that is on Amazon, get a similarly priced Omega, Semogue, or Vie Long.</li>
            <li> I do wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how long it will last</li>
            <li> if you take care of it then it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> My dad  has had the same shave brush for as long as I can remember..20</li>
            <li> Bought a starter kit with the brush and bowl, the brush didn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> I believe it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again (but hopefully a long time from now).</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the proper care procedures.</li>
            <li> I think this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> you know how long this will last?  </li>
            <li> The badger hair seems like it will last a long time</li>
            <li> You want to get a bowl that is wide enough for your fingers and deep enough that the lather won&#x27;t splash around.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> We now have to keep the bathroom door closed 24/7 to keep him away from the brush which he apparently views as either prey or a toy, or both.  </li>
            <li> Later you can invest or ask for Xmas for a more expensive brush when you turn in to a wet shaving geek - like we all</li>
            <li> I store mine laying flat on a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it last long, but for the price, what can you say.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago, and am finally getting around to reviewing it...  </li>
            <li> Do not see this brush lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was, apparently, no issue with the brush being prickly.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels like it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like it will last as long as Grandpop&#x27;s did -</li>
            <li> It seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Last brush I had from another company had a strange smell to it.</li>
            <li> Minor shedding fairly standard with this quality of brush.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews mention, a few hairs come out the first couple of times you use it, but</li>
            <li> Most brushes tend to lose their game after a few months, but this Escali brings the quality to the fore, and imagine this is the same brush that my father has been using for years.</li>
            <li> It does shed a few hairs with every shave, but I guess this is normal.</li>
            <li> I came to understand this was normal after reading a few articles regarding brush shaving.  </li>
            <li> (I assumed this was normal); it seems to have settled in after just a few shaves.</li>
            <li> It has lost a few bristles and a couple are jutting out on the sides but that might be normal.</li>
            <li> After breaking it in, it lost a few bristles, which is absolutely normal.</li>
            <li> A few hairs falling out of the brush is probably normal.</li>
            <li> Loses a lot of bristles early on, but after a few months of use, it is a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> I always notice a few badger hairs in the soap or on my face, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, curly hair, so shaving has always been a pain.</li>
            <li> My first issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get a thick lather using the boar bristle brush and the VHD shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> After it gets broken in, this guy makes a sweet lather.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard and once I started using this brush</li>
            <li> It looks very expensive and it has a nice weighty feel.  </li>
            <li> A true badger shaving brush is never supposed to leave behind the bursh bristles on your face or soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new shaving brush for a little over a week now and it works as intended.  </li>
            <li> I figured this would happen with a new brush, but it&#x27;s a little beyond that point now.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; smell to it, but for the price I paid for it, I can live with the smell.</li>
            <li> It sheds a little when new, but eventually  it will stop that.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, basically to get any loose hairs out, the brush works really well.</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using it, so I&#x27;m waiting for the loose hairs to fall out</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it will start to loose a lot of the hairs</li>
            <li> I soaked it, shampooed it, and brushed the hairs as you are supposed to prior to using it, but i continually get about 10-12 loose hairs during each use.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to a friend or relative, and were I to somehow loose this brush</li>
            <li> The loose hairs is the only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars; I may come back and change it to 5 stars after continued use.</li>
            <li> Only annoyance is that occasionally a hair will come loose in the foam, or on my face.  </li>
            <li> Just as important, the brush has kept its shape well and, resting upside down inbetween game times, it has held up very well and does not seem to make a mess at all (which I thought would be a problem while drying...).  </li>
            <li> bristles stink for the first few shaves, but smell goes down once in regular use.  </li>
            <li> Wore down far faster than it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hairs are very soft but are still stiff enough to work the lather into your face.</li>
            <li> Stiff enough to get the job done but soft enough not to be gougeing your face.  </li>
            <li> Stiff enough to gather soap, soft enough on my face.&lt;br /&gt;recommended.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is stiff enough to whip the shaving soap up into a cream yet soft enough to go on your face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfectly firm to PROPERLY lather up for a shave and invigorate my face while remaining soft enough to lather multiple times during a single shave.  </li>
            <li> Very soft little shorter than I thought.</li>
            <li> It is dense enough to do the job, but still a little soft.  </li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s gotten a little better since it&#x27;s been broken in.</li>
            <li> The brush had a fairly strong odor to it, and the first several rinses resulted in a filthy brackish water pouring from it.  </li>
            <li> But if you can handle a little skunky smell until it gets broken in, you&#x27;ve found one of the better shave brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Escali is a small American company that makes a high quality product.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well with very few bristles lost and no smell.</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs dislodged on the first few uses but after multiple uses it is still holds up.</li>
            <li> Loses some hair every time I shave, but for the $, hard to find a better value.</li>
            <li> In addition, it took less time to produce a rich and thick lather.</li>
            <li> This brush will last a long time!</li>
            <li> but I do have to go to the bowl about 4 times for the amount of lather I need to shave my entire beard, compared to only 2 lathers from my other brush (which is regular sized).</li>
            <li> This brush has the same quality as a more expensive alternative but is extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> I have no major complaints and I would purchase it again if I needed another.</li>
            <li> (3)  Over a month, the brush has perhaps shed six or seven brisitles -- not a major problem.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my only other brush is a Tweezerman, which is so similar to this that they may have been manufactured by the same company.</li>
            <li> I like how the brush feels when I use it, and have had no major issues.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple of weeks now with no major issues.</li>
            <li> Not the other way around, so I get a good covering that&#x27;s not too thick / thin for</li>
            <li> Wanted to get a few shaves in using the new one before re-reviewing it.  </li>
            <li> soaked the new brush in soapy water for a few hours, then rinsed in thoroughly in running water.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I think that is unacceptable, and I do not expect this brush to last very long.</li>
            <li> I now only get very minor reddening every once in awhile from shaving with these two products.</li>
            <li> There is a faint odor when the brush is new that goes away after a few uses but not so strong as to be offensive.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old brush that did not last very long (all hairs where falling apart after less than a year of use).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far no hairs have come out (a typical fault of cheaper brushes).  </li>
            <li> Maybe next time I&#x27;ll buy a synthetic brush though, &#x27;cose this one takes its time to dry.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy a stand or make one with wire or something so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for a week, it has made my shaving experience a pleasure, so much so that I can&#x27;t help but lather and shave at least 3 times in one sitting.</li>
            <li> The bristles bleed color and are limp, and hence whip a watery lather, rather than a thick and smooth lather.</li>
            <li> would recommend a stand to go with this brush so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always use proper cleaning and drying technique to insure longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to dry without brush hair flaring out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> it loses a hair every 5 or 6 shaves, but with daily use of this thing, that is very acceptable.</li>
            <li> Recommend you squeeze excess water out then spin it around with your fingers to dry it before placing back in the brush stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I noticed was it was about half the size of my old brush.</li>
            <li> so it would dry properly.</li>
            <li> so you can dry it properly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a month and have not had any shedding of bristles, but I also take care with the use, alternate brushes and comb it out when dry.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting one of those brush hangers for it to dry it in the proper position.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll dry properly.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it, but still waiting to make a stand so that it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> a Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C.&lt;br /&gt;So far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to endurance, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> and it should last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for nearly a year and only a few bristles have come off.  </li>
            <li> Initially there were several hairs that came out, which I expected.</li>
            <li> My only challenge so far is it leaving few hairs once in a while.</li>
            <li> it did not exfoliate as i expected to, (what i expected was akin to a soft, yet flexible tooothbrush texture.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times thus far and it does the job.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, yet firm enough to work lather into my beard after a couple days of growth.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal or not, but shedding has not a problem with the brush at all, after those initial uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shed probably less than a total of six hairs during the first and second shaves, but after that, no more dropped hairs.</li>
            <li> I carefully straighten them back up to let them dry, but the next time it is the same thing.</li>
            <li> It does occasionally lise a hair or two every few days so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this one a few times I am back to my old boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> It is soft, distributes soap well, and has shed only a few hairs in the month that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a brush in years, using cans of shaving cream, but, since I had a container of shaving soap several years old and not wanting to waste it, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, yet firm enough to lift the whiskers.</li>
            <li> As far as the funky smell, it only lasted a few times and was gone.</li>
            <li> The brush performed its function alright, but the clear coating on the outside started to peel off within a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has lost a few bristles on use, but really the loss is quite minimal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only lost a few bristles so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re serious about wet shaving; it will turn you off quickly.</li>
            <li> You reach a point where you beard is thick enough that it really wants the shaving cream spread on by a brush, not by hand, and they are there.  </li>
            <li> Some quick googling revealed that this is not uncommon.  </li>
            <li> Really decent little brush at an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> Sure it sheds a little bit in the beginning, but I find all shaving brushes do that, and they usually stop after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed at first that the bristles were a little longer than my previous one and that helped me to get the lather made faster.  </li>
            <li> Very soft after you soak it a few times just before use.</li>
            <li> Sheds a lot for the first few uses but then settles down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about a month now and it constantly sheds a couple of hairs with every single use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to create a luxurious lather on your face (Proraso and Taylor of Old Bond Street in this case) while being soft enough to stimulate your skin and raise your beard without being harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to single blade safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I can not believe this item is rated above a single star.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my husband as he wanted to go back to single edge shaving.  </li>
            <li> As some have reported/reviewed there was a limited amount of shedding -- by no means enough for me to consider it a deal</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps it from perfection is the single hair that fell from the brush, as no doubt eventually will come a day when I&#x27;ll have to replace it.</li>
            <li> As long as you properly rinse it out and dry it stays just as fluffy as when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> But luckily my year old previous badger brush out performs this poor excuse for a brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy; this is common in many brushes at first, so I gave it a while.</li>
            <li> For the several first shaves, this brush had an unpleasant smell to it and the water that dripped off it after the first use was sooty.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and questionable construction, does not produce much lather at all, and is strangely sized.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried when buying this, because the price is so much cheaper than other badger hair shaving brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I mean really how much different could their brushes be.</li>
            <li> I only knocked off a singe star because mine has &#x27;shed&#x27; a few dozen bristles in each my first few shaves.</li>
            <li> , the first few times you get it wet (think wet badger smell).  </li>
            <li> many years I have wasted using cans of goop with fake scents and applying them with my bare hand...</li>
            <li> I only had a few hairs shed in the first few days and no shedding after that.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it seems to be holding it&#x27;s shape pretty well, with only a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> A few bristles have fallen out (several during the first few shaves), but that seems to have stopped now.  </li>
            <li> After having used it a few times, it has only shed a few hairs, all of which on the first use.</li>
            <li> This badger brush got here today and the first thing I notice , it is very small in my hand.</li>
            <li> I figured it would &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; a little being new just not sure if this is normal or not.  </li>
            <li> Above all just do a little research about this stuff if you are new to wet shaving of thinking about getting into it.</li>
            <li> You usually get what you pay for, but aside from a few loose bristles that fall out after the first few uses, you get a stellar deal when purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft on my face but stiff enough to raise the hair for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight odor to it initially but that goes away after a few shaves and leaves pure luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only shaved with this setup twice, the number of loose badger hairs</li>
            <li> I did notice a hair came loose hopefully that will be the last one for a while..</li>
            <li> so I was not very clear to the benefits of getting a badger</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that loose hairs in the brush will fray and get stuck to your face.  </li>
            <li> also, it&#x27;s not very soft at all.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get loose hairs in my lather,</li>
            <li> Note to future purchasers - wash brush thoroughly before use to remove some of the loose follicles.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t remember when the last time was I saw a loose bristle.  </li>
            <li> After a couple uses the loose hairs are starting to minimize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; I have noticed only one hair that came loose.</li>
            <li> It also took several uses before it shed all of the loose hair.</li>
            <li> Initially a lot of the hairs would come loose and for a while I worried that all the hairs would fall out.</li>
            <li> The hairs are not very soft, almost prickly.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last a month or so before it was loose and needed replacing.  </li>
            <li> no further loose hairs will show up.</li>
            <li> I brushed the brush with a hair brush to get rid of loose hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, compared to my brush, it was not very soft.</li>
            <li> Steel like, only to have the image twist unto Davy Jones and those loose boar spikes turning you into a monstrosity you don&#x27;t deserve to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shaving experience with very little cash outlay.</li>
            <li> Certainly, this would be hard to beat for the price.  </li>
            <li> All Metal Chrome Trac II razor, Escali Pure Badger brush, a Buffalo Horn 3.5 in Palm Shave Bowl, and TOBS Sandalwood Hard Shaving Soap.  </li>
            <li> It did lose a few hairs with the first half dozen uses, but seems to have settled out thereafter.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that there is a slightly offensive odor at first, but it fades after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it shed lots at first, but now it sheds very little.</li>
            <li> 100% pure badger shaving brush at less than half the cost of competitors.  </li>
            <li> It lost quite a few bristles upon initial wetting and use, but I anticipated this prior to actual use and gave it a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; prior to using for my shave cream.  </li>
            <li> English shaving soap, the Escali Shaving Brush and a long handled single edge razor.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase a badger brush to try as a person new to wet shaving but did not want to buy something expensive until I knew that it would be worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This was a trial for me to switch back to brush and cream (wet shaving) instead of continuing to use the foams/gels which have all kinds of unpronounceable chemicals and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I can attest that this brush shows quality where it counts, eliminating the question of whether a less expensive brush would fall apart at the first sight of water.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell overpowers the sandelwood scent of my shaving cream and was unusable for me (maybe it&#x27;d be fine for a man&#x27;s man like Wolverine or Bear Grylls).    </li>
            <li> At such a low price, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did have a weird smell in the beginning, but after a couple of uses, it was fine.</li>
            <li> but this seems to work just well, only used twice dont know how it will hold up but for 12 dollars ill be glad to get a year or less out of it.</li>
            <li> I used a very small screwdriver and gently lifted the bristles back to where they should be.  </li>
            <li> There are other more expensive models and brands, but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The first couple shaves the brush still smelled a little musty, and it shed a little.</li>
            <li> It shed some hairs for the first 2-3 weeks but no more than I would expect of any other brush.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not as expensive as other brushes</li>
            <li> I find myself going back to the soap to load up again since you just can&#x27;t load this one enough due to its size.</li>
            <li> I just want a close shave, and need a sharp razor to do it and after just 3 shaves with a Mach 3, it can&#x27;t do that leading my to buy more which are just too dang expensive.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something different that I could use and place in a holder since I always left my other just sitting in my shaving mug.</li>
            <li> but this particular brush sheds bristles at an unbelievable rate.</li>
            <li> The brush smells pretty awful at first (hello badger fur) but airs out quickly.</li>
            <li> Some few of the hairs fall off when I am whipping up a rich, thick shave lather.</li>
            <li> Aside from a few stray bristles, I have no real complaints other than it floats in water, so it&#x27;s kind of tough to soak.</li>
            <li> The brush head is large and thick.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very dirty and when I swished the brush in hot water it turned light brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found a lot of whiskers (from the actual animal) that were very rough and coarse.  </li>
            <li> I do hang wet brush upside down to dry and have no major loss of bristles after initial shedding for first few uses.</li>
            <li> But like any natural hair brush, it takes a little while to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Seems well made but a little too soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles, sheds a little each use.  </li>
            <li> It meets the need but is a bit soft and a little too pliable for my taste.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that need a little broke in.</li>
            <li> A little soft but it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a little over a month and so far it has done its job</li>
            <li> Badger brushes like this are known to create the lather quicker than other types of brushes, which is a plus when you&#x27;re using it regularly and can&#x27;t spend a long time making lather (such as when you have to get to work).  </li>
            <li> a little on the soft side.</li>
            <li> The tip of the bristles are a little prickly, and I imagine are not as soft or as a silver-tipped brush, but at this price, I don&#x27;t have any objections with it.</li>
            <li> Does shed a little so far, but hoping that will stop with continued use.</li>
            <li> He uses Taylor of Old Bond shave cream and a Merkur safety razor, and has a little metal stand to hold the brush and razor on when not in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been religious about washing it out, shaking it dry, and laying it on its side to dry.  </li>
            <li> The only problem that I have had with it is that it can be difficult to clean depending on the type of shaving soap used.</li>
            <li> I screwed a small eye hook into the butt of the handle and a small hook in the top of my linen closet so that it hangs brush down to dry</li>
            <li> It is rather small and is by no means a high end brush</li>
            <li> A high quality small handle badger brush, I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure who rated this junk so high.  </li>
            <li> I did not do that, but I have noticed that after the first few uses the scent has faded considerably, and doesn&#x27;t overpower some of my subtle soaps.</li>
            <li> - There was an odd smell when it was wet the first half dozen times it was used.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried on the first use when a few hairs fell out, I thought the thing was going to fall apart.</li>
            <li> It was a little prickly at first, but seems to have improved after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also they do not dry my skin out like shaving gel can due to its alcohol content.</li>
            <li> Will likely try a boar brush next time around or spend a little extra money.</li>
            <li> My husband looked long and hard for a replacement for his very worn shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush did have that &#x27;animal&#x27; smell at first which required some conditioning to get rid of... not really too hard, just look on YouTube for how to break in a badger brush</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor to it, but this is the case for several other natural badger hair brushes that I have tried as well.  </li>
            <li> Soft enough for face but hard enough to stand up to soap and face!  </li>
            <li> Brush is soft, sheds very little initially, but lathers well.</li>
            <li> To be honest it isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Even $13 is too much for only a weeks worth of bad performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it sheds as much as some reviews indicate, at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I understand a straight edge razor gives you a closer shave, but I see closer shave by using a brush- at least this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that the wood is not perfectly circular.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a top quality brush, so was disappointing.</li>
            <li> He complained that it lost too much hair- leaving hair all over his face.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the shaving brush world and it was not a good one.</li>
            <li> This brush loses so much hair with every use.</li>
            <li> I am blind and enjoy using this razor and brush.</li>
            <li> At least you know it&#x27;s real badger</li>
            <li> It was also VERY smelly for a least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Frankly has the fit and finish of brushes 2x as expensive.</li>
            <li> Using a shaving brush always seemed as nothing more than adding an expensive degree of sophistication to a rather mundane task (like using silk instead of toilet paper).  </li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a safety razor, and comparing the price of this brush to the average brush made it a very simple choice.</li>
            <li> I noticed that several other brushes have a flat side to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a perception issue or if it simply is getting softer(to soft) over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear coat on handle cracked and fell apart within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re starting wet shaving</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, with soft bristle firmly seated in the brush</li>
            <li> ; even the longer term reviews have shown this one to hold the hair in the brush for a long life.</li>
            <li> Pleasure to use, once a small number of bristles fell off (normal).</li>
            <li> Use this to learn with and if you stick to wet shaving then later on purchase an upgrade if needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but assume that&#x27;s normal for any brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor annoyance and for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an old brush that was missing 1/2 of its bristles.</li>
            <li> This product is a 4-star all day long.</li>
            <li> Not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I can see, and it&#x27;s a minor thing</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a few weeks, and I have no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this will hold a LOT of water, so I have to be careful to get enough water out</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll save money in the long run - one jar of shaving cream</li>
            <li> I should have had a brush of this quality long ago.  </li>
            <li> This may seem like a starter brush, but I don&#x27;t see myself parting ways for a long time.</li>
            <li> I should have done this long ago.  </li>
            <li> It lost a hair or two upon his initial use which he said is to be expected; he&#x27;s a barber</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for too long so time will tell.</li>
            <li> I believe it will provide service for a long time.</li>
            <li> Its plenty soft after a few uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added an additional star (3 -&amp;#62; 4) since this product seems to be in for the long haul, and for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is smaller than expected, however, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Merkur 180 long handle.</li>
            <li> A minor detail</li>
            <li> : It isn&#x27;t the softest brush, but I don&#x27;t find it harsh and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts as long as I hope it will.</li>
            <li> The Escali wet seemed to develope a lack of hairs in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long and seems to shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be bald before long.</li>
            <li> I just recently got into wet shaving with a DE razor</li>
            <li> adult son and his family were here on vacation a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> He asked me how long had I used the soap, brush and razor to shave with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on it only to find out that I didn&#x27;t like wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I also found it has a tendency to spread wide, leaving a gap in the middle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it  a long time ago</li>
            <li> but hopefully, I won&#x27;t have to for a long time.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s a definite introduction &amp; investment to the world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush holds water well enough for me and shedding is minimal.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if that is normal or not.  </li>
            <li> Also, got a strange brown color coming from it when rinsing it which also lasted a week or two.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have know about the Escali brush long ago.</li>
            <li> It does not keep it&#x27;s shape long and some of the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> Some negatives: it&#x27;s still occasionally losing hair (expected this to stop, it&#x27;s been about a month now)</li>
            <li> suddenly knew what wet badger smelled like.</li>
            <li> Brush is smaller that I expected.</li>
            <li> The brush is much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I kept finding the brushes hairs on my face, but i think that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t wet it enough.</li>
            <li> I put together a starting kit of wet shaving stuff for my husband for Christmas, including this shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I decide to shop for another one.</li>
            <li> He complains that the bristles feel rough on his face, and even after several months of use the bristles shed a bit.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it carries a funky smell , no matter how long I wash it off .......</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I tried shaving with shaving soap and a brush-</li>
            <li> brush took some time to break in, and early on it would shed a few hairs onto my face when I would use it.</li>
            <li> but I just purchased an actual soap so loading the brush is harder.  </li>
            <li> No real issues or red flags.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush, a Merkur long handle razor, and Proraso soap to start with.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Has a funky smell to it, not sure if that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any reason to change, and don&#x27;t anticipate needing or wanting to upgrade for a long time.</li>
            <li> I havent had a long history with it yet, so I cant speak to its long term value.</li>
            <li> but it goes away completely after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is normal, but the brush does shed a hair or 2 every time I mix up the lather.  </li>
            <li> Consequently not much shaving cream was being left on the skin.  </li>
            <li> well looks like it&#x27;s going to hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> The brush is not nearly as scratchy as hog bristle, nor did the smell of badger linger on the brush after is was washed.  </li>
            <li> It has shed a few individual hairs, but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t expect from all but the most expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> If you want a proper wet shave, start with a brush that costs around $60.</li>
            <li> I am going to use it for as long as I can...</li>
            <li> I got this with the merkur long handled razor and a shaving mug.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;paints&amp;#34; your face with a soft yet firm feeling.  </li>
            <li> so no telling how long till they are all gone.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure whether this is normal or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but gets the job done well</li>
            <li> and he had that brush for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been wet shaving for a couple of months now.  </li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have used a brush and shaving cream to prepare for a shave.  </li>
            <li> I recommend soaking the badger hair in shave soap/cream and water overnight to help remedy this minor problem.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is decently firm, but soft.</li>
            <li> If it will continue this way the brush will not lust long.</li>
            <li> Got into traditional wet shaving about 3-4 months ago and purchased this product as my starter brush.  </li>
            <li> look forward to using this brush for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;09/24/2013</li>
            <li> When it arrived and for several shaves it had the smell of what I assume is a wet badger</li>
            <li> I do not use a stand, so I will see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone starting to explore wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This one works well it has a strange smell but nothing to be unbearable or intolerable I would recommend it and will probably replace it again with Escali when it needs it.</li>
            <li> This is a brush that I&#x27;ll continue to use for as long as I need to shave.</li>
            <li> I have just used the Escali brush for a few days after using another brush that came with my straight razor shaving kit a few months back.</li>
            <li> After a long time using shaving gels and brushless creams, I decided to go the old-fashioned way and found the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know but as long as he likes it</li>
            <li> I recently started to wet shave and did not want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Just recently started wet shaving</li>
            <li> I used to shave daily when I was in the Military for 4 years, but now I shave 2, maybe 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And as long as you&#x27;re drying it correctly, the bristles stay on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It initially seemed to shed excessively during the first few usues.</li>
            <li> and you can use it for a long time period.</li>
            <li> I had bought a starter wet shave kit that came with a standard synthetic shave brush.</li>
            <li> long handle brush I bought about thirty years ago and still have in my bathroom as a decoration</li>
            <li> took me so long, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> and I used it for way too long.  </li>
            <li> a few hairs continue to fall out from time to time but this has not been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> i will say it does have an initial funky smell when wet but its gradually wearing off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  been a long time since I used a brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself needing another of these for a long time unless something happens to this one.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a normal occurrence, but every time I use it one or two of the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> I hope that goes away soon, or I won&#x27;t be using this brush for long.  </li>
            <li> I found that the bristles are too long.</li>
            <li> I use this brush along with a Merkur long handled DE razor.</li>
            <li> It does hold water well, and I&#x27;ve had to fluff the bristles out a bit to ensure it dries properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush a few times so far</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars if I had long term experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Some bristles lost in initial use, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself (along with the merkur long razor).</li>
            <li> I did have a few hairs fall out the first few times I used it but haven&#x27;t had any fall out for a while now.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it it lost some bristles, just a few.</li>
            <li> There were a few hairs that fell out with first few uses</li>
            <li> Few hairs fell of the first few times</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs the first few times I used it, but its gotten even softer with use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to extend it&#x27;s life as long as possible, I&#x27;d recommend learning how to maintain it during and between shaves via wet shaving forums or youtube channels.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs on the first few uses</li>
            <li> I had expected to replace my brush once a year, but it turns out, when cared for properly, it lasts for an extremely long time.</li>
            <li> This complet ruins the brush for me, and I am buying another, more expensive one.</li>
            <li> A few hairs came out in use the first few times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You might lose a few bristles out of this brush for your first few shaves, but I&#x27;ve used it about seven or eight times in the month that I&#x27;ve had it and mine seemed to stop shedding after like four uses.</li>
            <li> Lost a few bristles the first few shaves, but none since.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t shed horribly, and has actually done a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Soak in hot water for a few hours, then lather and leave for a few hours before rinsing and using.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you put it away wet with soap still in it, the brush won&#x27;t last as long for you.  </li>
            <li> After its broken in that rarely happens, and the brush preforms to my expectations.</li>
            <li> After a year I have noticed that it sheds a bit - but it still provide a really good base with your favourite lotion/soap.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving, I thought to save a little money when buying in.</li>
            <li> so it will have a slight smell and be a little rough at first.</li>
            <li> it would loose around 3 to 5 hairs each time, after that I only see 1 loose hair each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Other posters have mentioned an odd smell with this brush when new</li>
            <li> I rinsed that lather down the drain and tried again after cleaning the brush a second time, and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> From day one I have dried it out really well and hung it upside down after use, so I know that wasn&#x27;t the issue.</li>
            <li> Nothing major, but it worries me slightly.</li>
            <li> The major downfall with this item is the ask you to dry it with bristles facing down.  </li>
            <li> The hair is quite stiff, which you wouldn&#x27;t know from just looking at it, but not stiff to the point of irritation.</li>
            <li> It did shed a lot of hairs in the beginning and did have a slight wet fur smell for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> But I thought it&#x27;d alert other new wet shavers who don&#x27;t know much about  badger brushes that there are other types aside from \\&quot;pure\\&quot; and that \\&quot;pure\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t just mean \\&quot;100%\\&quot; in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to loose the smell and not loose the hairs and therefore lean towards my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months now and have had none of the usual hairs falling out, it stays fluffy and just th right stiffness</li>
            <li> This would be more of a problem except that this brush was significantly less expensive</li>
            <li> It may be a lot less expensive but seems to use up more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This product was less expensive than many I choose from the list of options for badger brushes.</li>
            <li> After reading several blogs and watching youtube videos on the subject, there is one key attribute for quality brushes:  100% BADGER hair, not boar hair.  </li>
            <li> i just received my brush and while not totally symmetric since it is an animal, I did notice a slight odor to the brush...not a big issue.</li>
            <li> Its a fairly standard brush, may opt for the black badger brush next time.</li>
            <li> Had a slight odor the first 2 times of use (not overwhelming or foul).</li>
            <li> The second time, it was only half a day, and now after a month of wet-shaving, I have forgotten if there was any smell at all.</li>
            <li> The icing was finding 100-packs Personna TwinII for a third less than a 10-pack at my local grocery.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am not sure if it is the brush or me that is not able to whip of the shaving cream adequately.</li>
            <li> I was initially afraid that it would not be strong enough to hold its shape</li>
            <li> The brush was also smaller than expected, my other brush is allot bigger than this one.</li>
            <li> purchased a small hanger at walmart that holds my new razor and this brushwhich stays on my bathroom counter but</li>
            <li> Aside from robbing a poor badger of his or her bristles, it&#x27;s a fine little device.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after deciding to switch from Gillette Mach3&#x27;s to plain, old style double-edge shaving.</li>
            <li> The Escali wasn&#x27;t stiff, however the bristles weren&#x27;t remotely soft compared to Parker&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff, but not too soft either.</li>
            <li> Not too soft, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Beats those hard boar hair brushes!</li>
            <li> At first it was just now and then, but after a year of shaving every other day, it now loses 2-4 bristles per use.  </li>
            <li> I question how long it will actually last due to the shedding.</li>
            <li> Cheap, poor quality, the brush matted into a tangled, knotted mess every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft against his sensitive skin, but firm enough to kick up a thick lather that glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> One negative is that it has lost a few bristles on first few shaves but that could be normal....</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;d deduct a half a star is that it was a little prickly against my skin during the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> With all the good reviews for this product, I&#x27;m not sure if I just happened to get a bad, individual brush or</li>
            <li> and it is only 12.5% of the price i paid for the other one.</li>
            <li> The other issue is that the brush is still quite coarse.</li>
            <li> Other brushes I have used have longer hair and don&#x27;t have such problems.</li>
            <li> I gave it to him for a Christmas gift as his other one was on its last leg.</li>
            <li> ALL OTHER IMMITATORS PLEASE FIND A DIFFERENT PROFESSION.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to bother with sending the other one back.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product over other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for value-better than other brushes I have bought at the same price point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving soap for a little over a year only recently have I switched to the Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands if shaving brushes over the years and have been disappointed in most of them.  </li>
            <li> Lathers extremely well, bristles were solid.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I have lost a few bristles in the first months of using it.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviews mentioned, there was a bit of a gamey smell but it only lasted a week.  </li>
            <li> ( I use every other day and have owned it for several months now).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased one other badger brush, but it was from Elite, and same story.  </li>
            <li> This brush was not like any of the other badger brushes i have, and I finally just tossed the thing.</li>
            <li> The brush will shed a few hairs in the first few uses, which is expected.  </li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;ve really noticed the benefit is on my neck (which usually gets irritated when I shave because of the \\&quot;dead spots\\&quot; where I didn&#x27;t get enough shave lube spread</li>
            <li> That said, I was surprised that it was a little &amp;#34;pricklier&amp;#34; than I had expected (again no frame of reference).</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this over more expensive brushes that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle looks sharp too.</li>
            <li> I considered ranking this as three stars due to the issues listed above, but for the price, I think these issues are acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other cheaper brushes that work wonders and will last you for ages.</li>
            <li> probably should have purchased a more expensive one!</li>
            <li> Other than initial shedding and needing a longer break-in period</li>
            <li> Initially I was turned off by the brush due to copious shedding and an off odor.  </li>
            <li> The brush felt a little scratchy but it seemed to do the job well enough though I don&#x27;t have prior experience to compare.</li>
            <li> It handles the daily dusting over my rifle and other weapons without falling apart.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush, as we have been through 4 other brands that have fallen apart.</li>
            <li> You can use other things though, such as string, Rubber Bands, etc.</li>
            <li> perhaps a different soap like proraso or some other menthol/eucalyptus soap would help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs upon first few uses (to be expected).</li>
            <li> I switched to shaving soap from commercial shaving cream years ago due to skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Wash it a few times before use as it will have a bit of a wet dog smell for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> When my 30 years old shaving brush was down to its last few bristles, I decided to replace it with the Escali.  </li>
            <li> Very little shedding at first and none after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> The hairs do shed for the first few shavings, but after that there is very little shedding.</li>
            <li> Still holding up after a very long time.</li>
            <li> bristles are very soft and very few if any ever fall out.</li>
            <li> If I had one very minor thing I didn&#x27;t like, it would be the smell of the brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those three faults are (in my opinion) very minor when you consider the price and how well this brush makes a lather.</li>
            <li> but I doubt I&#x27;ll have to for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll do its job very long.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that the brush hairs fall out very easily but that may be due to my bad technique</li>
            <li> It shed pretty bad for the first month.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a very well made shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I notice it seems to dry out faster also.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to get a stand to dry it.</li>
            <li> A vigrous shaking gets a majority of my rinse water off the brush and leaves it almost dry to the touch when I set it on its side to finish drying out.      </li>
            <li> You have to care for it, of course, by rinsing it off when you&#x27;re done and NEVER leave it standing brush-side up to dry (always leave it on its side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Need a stand to let it drip dry.</li>
            <li> I just run the bristles against a dry cloth and leave in on it side on the counter.</li>
            <li> I stand it on end to dry.</li>
            <li> Dry on its side or upside-down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After use I wash it out to remove all soap, shake the water out, then swirl on a towel to dry and restore the shape.</li>
            <li> Also, the cream stays wetter and doesn&#x27;t dry out while shaving.</li>
            <li> I use a plastic Brush Guard to keep it dry and ensure the water doesn&#x27;t soak into the handle.</li>
            <li> I use a stand to dry this brush and have had no issue with it.</li>
            <li> Just remember to rinse well before hanging to dry.</li>
            <li> So yes I properly dry the the brush handle up.  </li>
            <li> I do dry the brush thoroughly and leave it on its side between use.  </li>
            <li> Place in a well ventilated area and allow to dry.</li>
            <li> , however, take care of my brush, I rinse it well after each use, shake it out, and hang it from a wall mounted holder to dry.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it was here so fast I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Ahh, the minimun   of care, don&#x27;t squeeze it dry.  </li>
            <li> have a less expensive, no-name boar brush I picked up as an add-on from the company that makes my shaving soap, and it  keeps it&#x27;s shape when wet and gives me a much better lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get a stand to allow it to properly dry after use.</li>
            <li> Take time to shape the brush when dry.  </li>
            <li> and I always hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> Just hang to dry and take care of it.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a stand to let it air dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always remember after using it to dry it up and never leave it facing up.</li>
            <li> Rinse, shake , air dry in an Escali  stand, .</li>
            <li> Just remember to rinse well and let it dry by hanging it up in a stand.</li>
            <li> And let it dry on</li>
            <li> so I dry it propped on its side.</li>
            <li> I dry it on its side and it holds its shape well.</li>
            <li> You want to thoroughly rinse it after every use, then put it in a stand to dry.  </li>
            <li> HANG TO DRY).</li>
            <li> how well I dry it.  </li>
            <li> And yes I do dry it on a stand.</li>
            <li> I got a brush holder to help dry it.  </li>
            <li> I lathered it up and let it sit out overnight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Do pay attention to how you&#x27;re supposed to dry the brush to keep its form.</li>
            <li> so this and my Merkur razor can air dry and stay off the surface, hopefully prolonging their usefulness.</li>
            <li> I hang it to dry</li>
            <li> No need to rinse and dry hands (as with tube and aerosol creams).</li>
            <li> so the bristles can dry facing downward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to take the leap into wet shaving, but was concerned with price and quality starting from absolutely no gear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few stray hairs come out while loading my brush, but overall it seems to be a solid build for the price.</li>
            <li> A shaving brush should be a help without a hindrance at shaving, It should hold water, it should spread shaving cream evenly, it should not be harsh on the face and, if possible, it should be a visual asset to your bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> I had only been using it for a month, and had been careful not to use it roughly, but it still happened.</li>
            <li> Took several tries to get this dye out of the brush, which leads me to believe it is not real badger.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that it left a few hairs on the soap and on my face.  </li>
            <li> During first use a few hairs came out of the brush, but since then no more has come out.</li>
            <li> For the first few shaves it shed a bristle or two, then no more.</li>
            <li> The only problem, aside from a few shed hairs here and there, is that I can only shave once a day.  </li>
            <li> The second time just a few and since it has lost none, despite daily use.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a few strands came out after the first use, but not many.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only lost a few of its bristles in about ten shaves I&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of daily use, I&#x27;ve only lost a few bristles.  </li>
            <li> As some reviews have mentioned, it is a bit rough, but the key is to keep it wet and the soap lathery.</li>
            <li> A few hairs fell off but only because I realized I wasn&#x27;t wetting the brush enough before lathering up with the soap.</li>
            <li> &gt; - When it gets wet, it smells like an animal for the first couple uses (not surprising, given the brush&#x27;s badger hair origins).</li>
            <li> But just a few extra precautions in the assembly process could have avoided it entirely.</li>
            <li> I did lose a few of the bristles initially, but have had no loss in the last week.</li>
            <li> This slowly, but steadily undoes the glue that holds the brush together.</li>
            <li> Invest in a holder (bristles down to dry) and it should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s at least one small knot of bristles that may have been from applying it too hard the first couple times, or I just didn&#x27;t notice when I first opened it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, hairs do fall out at first but eventually slow down; think of it like your brush is getting a haircut.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks and it looses some bristles; nothing major.  </li>
            <li> After using this Escali brush for a few weeks, i now realize that my old, trusty brush was not pure badger.</li>
            <li> Used quite a few times so far and there has been minimal loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I expected to lose a few hairs on the first few uses but the brush is still shedding hair after a month and a half of daily use.</li>
            <li> high price doesn&#x27;t always mean anything except high price ESPECIALLY in a specialty genre such as this where folks have taken a mundane, often hated, hygienic practice and turned it into an enjoyable hobby.</li>
            <li> Have used disposables with regular foam shaving cream in the past and have just recently decided to give traditional wet shaving a try.</li>
            <li> The hairs on this brush initially were falling out like crazy, but after a few weeks of using it, that pretty much stopped.</li>
            <li> Rounded head of bristles can be a little different to use versus a flat or fan-shaped cut</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond St shaving cream, which is pricey,  this brush just needs a little tap and twist into the soap and it loads extremely well.  </li>
            <li> 34;grown-up&amp;#34; shaving brush so my experience is obviously limited.  </li>
            <li> A single blade razor, a shaving brush, and shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> You will be picking bristles out of your shave bowl, off of your face, and off the bathroom counter every single time.</li>
            <li> Also leaves some hair every single time I rub it on my face.</li>
            <li> It sheds every single time for me.</li>
            <li> Every single day I&#x27;d end up with bristles falling out of the brush and ending up on my face buried in lather.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that even after eight uses, the hairs are still coming out of it a little too much (according to my friend who makes the brushes).</li>
            <li> very little shedding so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, no smell to it and very little bristle loss</li>
            <li> Sheds very little and is soft.</li>
            <li> handle is made of wood and, while finished with lacquer (or varnish), care must be taken to properly dry the brush so the handle does not get soaked, dried out, and cracked; stone or plastic handles are generally preferable in this regard, but the Escali brush has held up well.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are soft enough not to prickle your legs/face, but tough enough to hold soap and stand your hairs up.  </li>
            <li> Now, the same tub last two and a half to three months using a brush and an empty tub to whisk up the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, the Escali badger brush brush does the trick and then some!  </li>
            <li> The key factor is to dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> I did buy a stand with it, as these brushes need to be kept horizontal or upside down after shaving, to dry properly (I bought [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> As others have noted the key to longevity is to hang it upside down to let it dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a stand though as badger brushes should be left upside down or on their side to dry out after shaving otherwise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brish for over 5 weeks, and every single time I see loose hair coming off the brush.</li>
            <li> I first got the brush, it was shedding hairs like crazy, but after the first few shaves it slowed.</li>
            <li> Other brushes available at retails stores were quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars since it had some finish imperfections and hairs pressed outside the collar, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it functionally.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because on the average day about 3-4 hairs fall out of it.</li>
            <li> Foaming up the Escali with some good-smelling shaving soap or shaving cream is one of those small luxuries that make time stand still in a busy day.</li>
            <li> If you have read this far you deserve a small award.</li>
            <li> A faint odor when wet but left after a weeks worth of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I do lose at least one bristle every time I use it, which is maybe normal, but</li>
            <li> With the Escali brush, on average I lose 30 to 40 bristles during each daily shave.  </li>
            <li> Though slightly smaller than an average brush the Escali 100%</li>
            <li> It still does lose an average 1-2 bristles per shave but there seems to be quite a bit left.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as I expected, but I think that ultimately will change--and if it doesn&#x27;t, at least it will exfoliate my skin well.</li>
            <li> so maybe this one&#x27;s above average</li>
            <li> I bought (and own :-(</li>
            <li> the 4 stars are because a few bristles would come off (Not sure if this is a normal process) and would get mixed with the soap.</li>
            <li> Will lose some hair at first until it gets broken in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush, so I have no comparison, but it seems a bit scratchy and perhaps poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed that the finish on the handle was poor.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a starter brush and then asked for an expensive full silver hair badger brush for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty poor quality.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought came broken (the wood handle and brush was not connected) when I received it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I wanted to try out wet shaving, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to see if it was something I wanted to do long term or not.  </li>
            <li> Second, it sheds something awful, and lastly, it is rather lean on bristles and does not make up a good lather.</li>
            <li> I had a bowl full of mediocre lather and probably 30 badger hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am kind of disappointed in it</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I ever bought because I was tired of that junk in the can drying out my face and shaving with a plastic cheese grater.</li>
            <li> This is my third brush and it is the only one that smells like a dead animal when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking you if you have that kind of cash to throw around on frivolous luxuries, but if you&#x27;re a working class guy like me, with 3 kids and a mortgage, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this brush.  </li>
            <li> It did the job while I used it and even while I was waiting for the new one to arrive, just didn&#x27;t have the handle to hold on too which made it a little bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> brush does have an odd smell, not sure if it&#x27;s normal badger smell or just exclusive to this brush as I&#x27;ve never had another badger hair brush before (or smelt a badger!).</li>
            <li> So it could have just been that I was getting rid of the loose hairs, and that now I will no longer experience that issue.  </li>
            <li> But over time the loose hairs will work themselves out.  </li>
            <li> It does loose hair</li>
            <li> Continues to loose bristles</li>
            <li> I cleaned it when I opened it and checked for loose hairs.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will stop losing bristles once all the loose ones have fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still picking out loose hairs after my 5th shave now.</li>
            <li> BUT it does loose hairs which is why I give it a 3.  </li>
            <li> From day one the brush has continued to loose bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, with no smell and nary a loose hair to annoy</li>
            <li> Every time I use it to apply shaving cream it leaves loose badger hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> There were some complaining of loose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Maybe once a week I get a loose hair from the brush.  </li>
            <li> Also, massage in some shave soap and comb out any loose bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles come loose in the soap cup leaving an unattractive debris to pick out of the shaving cup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed about 1-2 stray hairs each time after using it, so I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s just some loose hairs that didn&#x27;t make it onto the brush.</li>
            <li> bristles continue to come loose out of the brush, I&#x27;d say a hundred hairs have fallen out after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> but I had hoped it would also remove all the loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I found this also helped get rid of some of the loose</li>
            <li> It helps get rid of a lot of the loose hairs.</li>
            <li> Each time I shave, I loose between 8-15 hairs (on the brush)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seemed well made, but there were some loose hairs in it.</li>
            <li> Have not see even one loose hair yet.</li>
            <li> What bothers me about the brush is the amount of loose hair that comes out when shaving.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are coming loose but</li>
            <li> After breaking in this brush - involving about a week of picking loose badger hairs out of my shave mug - this brush settled down into regular use with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Even though I have been using this brush for less than one month and stored it on a stand so that it would dry out thoroughly, the brush fell out of the wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> Slight musky odor typical of all natural bristle brushes (vanishes with time and use and not unexpected)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is stored properly bristle side down on a stand and rinsed thoroughly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When mine eventually wears out somewhere down the road, I will definitely buy another just like!</li>
            <li> The brush must be left hunging with the hairs looking down.</li>
            <li> I hang it upside down after every use on the stand and use it with the shave soap and looks like it was made to last.</li>
            <li> The brush has always been properly stored hanging bristle side down from a brush/ razor hanger.</li>
            <li> If you want something nicer then later down the road invest in another brush.</li>
            <li> After 2 ½ months of usage, the hair bristles are falling out despite proper cleaning and storage upside down.</li>
            <li> However, it has continuously lost 2-5 hair strands every use, but that does seem to finally be slowing down now.  </li>
            <li> An earlier reviewer suggested hanging the brush upside down using neodynium magnets.  </li>
            <li> you left index finger out, and then slap the brush 10 or 12 times up and down against that finger.</li>
            <li> Need to do a couple extra rinses and shake out the bristles that were smashed down.</li>
            <li> The softness of the badger hair allows for an almost relaxing shaving (are there people who actually like to shave every other day?!)</li>
            <li> It also makes us doubt it will last well, as the bristles are bent right at the base, i.e., ready to break off.</li>
            <li> The brush smells a little at first, but this goes away over time and is common with Badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> One note: if this is your first time using a brush for shaving, expect your skin to sting a little afterwards (at least compared to using a cream).</li>
            <li> It makes my Art of Shaving cream last about 10 times as long since now I need so little and the brush lathers it up so well and spreads it evenly.  </li>
            <li> took 1 star away for the fact that quite a few of the hairs came out of the brush the first few weeks of using, and the slight smell to the brush.  </li>
            <li> then but that&#x27;s a minor price to pay considering how little you&#x27;re actually paying for the product.</li>
            <li> The only complaint, and really it may just be the nature of the beast, is I have used it now maybe 8 times and it loses several hairs</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as some of the more expensive brushes, but not such that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No high tech 5 blade flexible rocket drone razors, shaving gel inna can for me.  </li>
            <li> Just recently went back to the old double edge safety razor because the disposal razors are just way to expensive.</li>
            <li> Does not loose the bristles after the using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit harsh compared to other (albeit more expensive) options out there.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, doesn&#x27;t poke into the face for the dermically weak such as myself.</li>
            <li> Getting past that, it works ok--its very soft, softer than the other two I have used.</li>
            <li> A few bristles have come loose but not a big deal as long as the rest of them stay put.  </li>
            <li> PS, the package says to dry it hanging upside down or flat on the counter.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little stiffer than I expected, but there are no loose ones and there hasn&#x27;t been any shedding.</li>
            <li> While it was the less expensive brush it works fine.  </li>
            <li> When buying something that could be of less quality, not saying this is, extra care needs to taking.</li>
            <li> Previously, I used my fingers to work in a lather from gel onto my face prior to shaving.     </li>
            <li> The slight smell is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The stand means the bathroom gets less dust and the brush dries properly.</li>
            <li> After using it couple of times it left black color all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only lost 3 hairs (out of the brush) for daily use in the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> There was slight odor out of packaging - with regular use</li>
            <li> My bf previously used a different brush he found at Target which comes in a set with the bowl and brush hanger.</li>
            <li> At first I was angry, then I read up on how to actually use a brush.</li>
            <li> And after the second shave the shedding is much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stinky for first couple of shaves&lt;br /&gt;Still loses a hair now and then after a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I bet it will last less than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> This shaving brush compares favorably to the more expensive ones we have ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> I wet it before using it, rinse and wring it after using it, and dry it on its side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple badger brushes in the past but just recently got back into wet-shaving.  </li>
            <li> There has been some shedding but only slightly</li>
            <li> All shaving brushes have a slight odor because they do come from a badger but the odor diminishes over a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will last longer than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> If this brush is representative of the typical badger brush I&#x27;d recommend horsehair in the future.  </li>
            <li> It takes a week or so to break in but after using for several weeks the bristles all stay in tact and the slight badger butt smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I first got into shaving with a DE safety razor and didn&#x27;t want to drop big bucks on an expensive brush without knowing if I&#x27;d like it or not.  </li>
            <li> That having been said, it&#x27;s certainly not top shelf quality; despite properly handling and storing it, I still get the occasional stray hair in my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> so that is less likely to fall out over time.</li>
            <li> In fact I am astounded by what a difference this makes compared to my previous use of Barbasol gel in a can with the same razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the mixed bristle (boar) brushes you typically find around this price point.  </li>
            <li> Although at less than $15, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this same brush again when I have to.    </li>
            <li> I got an expensive one for Christmas from an Artistic Shaving place that was falling apart.</li>
            <li> It does the job and wasn&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and it is hard to beat the price on this brush to get started.</li>
            <li> After disastrous first attempt I gave it a second try, thought maybe I didn&#x27;t left it seating in the water long enough, left it in the water for 20 minutes while taking a shower, same results with a little less hair in the bowl.</li>
            <li> Tough to find a pure badger brush for cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, it was a little bit like wet dog, but more caustic.  </li>
            <li> So IMO its just a regular brush and not worth the extra few dollars if the hair comes off anyways.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is consistent with others that it loses a hair or two minimum per shave.</li>
            <li> Then, the first time I swirled it around the tub of shaving cream, there were a few bristles left behind.  </li>
            <li> You expect a few bristles to fall out of a new brush, and this has lost a few, but in line with what I expect.  </li>
            <li> Expect it to be a bit stiff at first, at least for the beginning 5 or 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;After that the badger hair softens a bit</li>
            <li> When they say pure badger, they mean it!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of less pressure I find only an occasional bristle coming loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the slight prickly feel is normal or not, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is so simple I just run water through it and shake it a bit to get the excess water out, sometimes i just press the hairs with my fingers a few time and before hanging it on my stand to dry off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is simple rinse it out and flick it a few times into the shower and let air dry.</li>
            <li> But do you want to risk spending less than half that and wonder whether it will only last half as long and be of inferior quality?  </li>
            <li> Bristles in the middle seems to have either glued together or some sort of knot i.e. brush is not fully fluffy  when dry or wet, but still manages to produce lather for shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would be upset about the loose hairs if I had paid more, but for the price, it really isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a few loose bristles, but no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other pieces I shaved down and crammed in around to fill the spaces between the edge of the cup and the big piece.  </li>
            <li> Did a little research into brushed and found that badger brushes did well.  </li>
            <li> The size is a little on the smaller size.</li>
            <li> With a little guidance I decided on this relatively cheaper offering of a badger brush and it literally is night and day in producing a quality lather.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be losing its shape on the outside edge a little bit now after a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> The entire purpose of badger brushes is to have a softer brush, with a little bit of backbone to make lather well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It definitely has a little bit of an animal scent</li>
            <li> that it was a little smaller.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller</li>
            <li> I paid a little extra because of the reviewers who mentioned this.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it sheds a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product, with the caveat being that a little preparation and patience is necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little coarse</li>
            <li> This brush is a little smaller than that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took off one star because the second one is a little coarser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is how you get that last little bit of animal scent out of your brush, but it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Would like it if the handle was just a little bit longer / bigger</li>
            <li> Just a little bit on the end can cover the entire surface.</li>
            <li> I had a flash back from when I was little kid and tried my Dad&#x27;s shaving brush</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but no complaints here!</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought but works just as we&#x27;ll on my face.</li>
            <li> I only put a little water in the soap, and then swirl the brush.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush ALOT of the fur came loose which got annoying fast!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our grandson to use to clean and lubricate his small game rifle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been a while since I bought this brush, and finally when I opened it to use it since my previous one had started to shed, I notice a big clump almost in the middle of the brush - it almost seems like there was a big ole&#x27; wart on the badger&#x27;s back</li>
            <li> but it definitely smells a little rough until you mix in the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, I make it a point to rinse the brush well after use, shake it out, and let dry upside-down.</li>
            <li> This one is a winner, not too hard, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Having only read reviews and not tried other brushes from Amazon, I would say that this brush sheds less then others.     </li>
            <li> It has held up extremely well compared to the previous brush that I purchased from a local shop.</li>
            <li> Overall, I agree with the other previous comments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that such differing reviews are about the same brush!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores, a shaving brush is a must to spread shaving cream in a proper way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with the quality--and it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a badger hair brush for under $15.  </li>
            <li> That brush was rather frail, and lost it&#x27;s shape after only a week and a half, despite the fact that I would hang it upside down to dry, as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This item is not marked where it was manufactured - should not be sold in the USA...!!!</li>
            <li> I can tell I&#x27;m going to have it for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with this classy  brush, which is also economically priced.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other brushes, but this one has been doing its job every single day for 2 months without a hitch.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the adhesive comes undone, but as long as you let it dry bristles down, you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Loose bristles on occasion therefore are an annoyance, but always remember to dry it (or hang it upside down after usage like I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are okay, but the handle is so bad</li>
            <li> Makes shaving better -- that can never be a bad thing</li>
            <li> What bothers me the most about this brush is that it smells bad.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nothing bad or potent, just noticeable compared to no smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming I just got a bad one since most everyone else has not had this problem.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The CSR expressed regret that I had been unhappy with their product and offered to send me a replacement for free.  </li>
            <li> I Have used this a dozen times now, works well, lathers my Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream very well, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, but the brush stinks like an animal.</li>
            <li> and I guess I could use glue and stick them back together, but that would defeat the purpose of having bought a product and expecting it to last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be surprised when it loses hairs.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long these brushes are supposed to last, but it is meeting my expectations.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the clearcoat on the handle itself is already bubbling and cracked, but it doesn&#x27;t effect how well the brush works and I only care about how it works, not how it looks.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I am constantly losing hairs from the brush.</li>
            <li> but my only complaint is its smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that the brush is still loosing bristles occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the brush will last at this rate.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at the same time as my safety razor and will honestly never look back.</li>
            <li> I like to use the Proraso cream in a tube and only use a small dab, about the size of a nickel, and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Only a few hairs fell out but none have since.</li>
            <li> but I figure that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This brush, with a wet shaving cream is a dream.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> received as expected.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison I can make between boat hair and badger hair.</li>
            <li> but I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The shedding I was expecting from a lower end brush was actually minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month at this point, and I&#x27;d expected the hair loss to taper off.</li>
            <li> The hairs hold on it, though a couple fall out which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Water got in and the bottom&#x27;s turned a dark grey with moisture damage.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> My brush came as expected and I have used it a handful of times already.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few brushes to compare to that</li>
            <li> Still smells like wet dog.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost any in the last few weeks, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly gentle with this thing, but I know how to take care of tools.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of brushes on the market</li>
            <li> There was minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> Brush hairs would sometimes come off on my face, and then it started coming apart in chunks after only a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> I expected that I would have to replace this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush works exactly as expected</li>
            <li> It lost a couple of hairs and smelled like a wet animal</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> It can feel quite rough if you don&#x27;t do so.</li>
            <li> it was a bit too rough</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s normal, but every time I use, it loses several badger hairs.</li>
            <li> After decades of spraying gel into my hand to apply shaving cream, I never really gave shaving brushes a thought.  </li>
            <li> cleaning the brush after shaving (taking the cream out of the brush) be careful when squeezing, because you can lose some hairs from the brush that way if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about six months ago.</li>
            <li> Minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li> but, I find the bristles not quite firm enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive start to wet shaving, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Seems to me there are brushes out there that will flatten out and become devoid of substance once you start lathering them up and swirling them on your face.</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I decided to give wet shaving a try.</li>
            <li> This one is not matted in the center.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t all that rough either</li>
            <li> Sheds a lot, is quite rough on skin.</li>
            <li> Well, there is not much to say . . .</li>
            <li> and I hoping that the hair loss for the brush will be minimal from on out.</li>
            <li> and Im not gentle in the lather process</li>
            <li> Was shipped as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> Shipping and delivery were as expected.</li>
            <li> Only thing I noticed is that I lost quite a few hairs</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few weeks back and have no issues as of yet.</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving, and was recommended this brush, I&#x27;m no expert, but this brush does what it&#x27;s designed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> However, this is not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> Works well, smelled like a wet dog</li>
            <li> to be expected-</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say about this.</li>
            <li> All of the items I purchased were what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase, I&#x27;ve been using a boar brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Works well if you want to try wet shaving.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> After three weeks the brush is holding up well, no discoloration and with a minimal amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as a gift to introduce a friend to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> and I have noted almost no loss of bristles (of course I have seen scant loss over the last few weeks).  </li>
            <li> Never really used a brush before to shave</li>
            <li> It lathers well and only a few bristles were lost.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thickness when wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was no really distinctive animal odor from this brush.</li>
            <li> If this thing tried slightly harder, it could be a Malamute, too.</li>
            <li> After just a few days, the smell totally disappeared.</li>
            <li> Not a quality as I expected Hairs fall our each time</li>
            <li> He received it a few days later.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush and it arrived quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> One has to know the concepts of wet shaving before rating this brush.</li>
            <li> I used to get a lot razor burn and not a very close shave</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this brush.</li>
            <li> This made it harder to apply the suds to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that some of the fur looks like it gets balled up in the center as I&#x27;m cleaning it after use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is looking for an affordable way to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> : Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner when it comes to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Its only after shaving with it for a few times, I realized the correct way to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this brush for a few years and when I recently left it at a hotel, I re-ordered another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost only a few bristles which I would imagine you will with any brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush started losing hair the firs time I used it and continues to showing wear in only a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks with two different soaps.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush is way to expensive to be worth upgrading to, but if you have the money to throw away go ahead...</li>
            <li> From swirling it in soap the hair has knotted up in the center.  </li>
            <li> Not much animal smell at all</li>
            <li> hairs fall out after only a few months.</li>
            <li> One minus</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about six years, so I&#x27;m accustomed to using and caring for a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> All in all if you are just getting into the wet shave</li>
            <li> Recommended for beginners in the wet shaving space.</li>
            <li> Recommended for beginners in the wet shaving space.  </li>
            <li> I have traveled with it a bit in the last few months, and have not borken the package yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble recently with brushes that would fall apart within a month.</li>
            <li> I splashed some water on my face, got the bristles wet, swirled it around my dish of shaving soap, lathered it up on my chin, cheeks, and neck,</li>
            <li> (A lot like wet dog, it turns out.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when it gets wet, it does smell like a farm animal.</li>
            <li> Really not much strength in the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush started out rather stinky, but I let it soak in some dish soap for a few hours, and then let it soak in regular hair conditioner and at then end of this process</li>
            <li> Has a bit of an animal smell which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> It does lose its bristles but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Our son bought my husband a shaving brush a few years back.</li>
            <li> I dumped the multiblade shavers to return to wet safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I had never really used a shaving brush correctly until I saw a video on how to correctly prepare the brush for shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newb to the scene of wet shaving</li>
            <li> I worried that a wet dog smell would linger, but I notice no smell.  </li>
            <li> Recommended as a travel brush,  not a primary daily use home brush.  </li>
            <li> Not really intended for canned shaving cream</li>
            <li> The brush does what is expected; help prep the beard for shaving.</li>
            <li> When the brush was used, the center of the brush would wold mat up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back on how that works after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> This brush broke after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It functions as well as expected.</li>
            <li> The brush also holds a lot of water as expected.</li>
            <li> Works well, some times hairs fall out, but I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The shedding is minimal and keep in mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wet shaved for over a decade</li>
            <li> It seems to be well put together with minimal lose hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to feel like the &amp;#34;face massage&amp;#34; that a lot of people talk about when it comes to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Does the job, people complain about the smell of wet badger hair</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m to rough when I&#x27;m using the brush to create latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had 4 or 5 bristles come out during the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve used it, but I think that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> If you just plop it on the sink wet, with the bristles up, then it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I spent the majority of the time picking them out.</li>
            <li> For the wet shaver this brush is a must.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit of shedding at the beginning</li>
            <li> After all, guess what a wet badger brush smells like?  </li>
            <li> A wet badger.  </li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t expected, even for what I assume is a machine made brush, was the amount of hairs that this brush has lost.  </li>
            <li> Only lost a few bristles, which does not impact the brush reliability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also did have an &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell (wet badger???)</li>
            <li> but after 5 uses it is still shedding and smells a bit like wet dog</li>
            <li> I use it for wet shaving</li>
            <li> you can find a way to protect the brush it might last a few years as a travel brush in your luggage while on vacation...</li>
            <li> There is a knot in the hair of my brush that makes the center hollow instead of having hair.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> but that was expected from a brush made of Badger hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush not really knowing anything because it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Not much to it.</li>
            <li> It has been some minimal shedding, as I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to see, if it will stop shedding hair...</li>
            <li> but I think that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in the wet shave world</li>
            <li> but with a few uses there&#x27;s definitely some breaking-</li>
            <li> No issue with rough bristles or any falling out.</li>
            <li> When lathering your face, you were rubbing the wooden handle against your skin because the too few hairs were splayed sideways against your face.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were folded (or something) when they were glued into the handle, so they don&#x27;t fluff evenly.</li>
            <li> Gents, or hey-- ladies-- who want to return to wet shaving, the double-edge safety razor and shaving brush:  </li>
            <li> The brush has lost only a few bristles and has softened with use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one biggest criticism I read here is about the scent of the brush when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> does* decrease over time - and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> That is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Just started out wet shaving</li>
            <li> I used a boar hair brush for a few years and finally upgraded and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> hairs smell like wet dog when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also there seems to be a cluster of bristles in the center of the brush that are all clumped and matted together and look like they might be stuck together with glue.</li>
            <li> Minimal badger hair loss.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because I have absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs have come out and only a few at a time</li>
            <li> I just started my foray into wet shaving with a safety razor and this Escali 100%</li>
            <li> When wet it clumps up</li>
            <li> Which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I had ordered it without even looking at the reviews, because at the time I was inexperienced with Amazon and didn&#x27;t think to look.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It smells like wet badger when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> (the scent fades a bit after use), but what else is to be expected?</li>
            <li> Shedding a few bristles initially, but that&#x27;s subsided with each use.  </li>
            <li> You could spend three times as much and get something a lot worse than this excellent-quality badger.</li>
            <li> Not the quality i expected from Escali.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no firmness to it</li>
            <li> Not really</li>
            <li> I carefully checked over this brush comparing it to others.</li>
            <li> The price is minimal compared to the quality shave this brush helps to provide.</li>
            <li> as this has (after only a few shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started wet shaving and needed a brush.</li>
            <li> But this brush smelled like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> While I  am curious as to why someone would $50+ for a bush and how it would feel on my face, I would spend the money on something else.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start wet shaving</li>
            <li> But once I wet it smells like something is burning.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the Escali as my daily shaving brush, I pulled it out and noticed that the badger hairs in a few areas had bound together in clumps.  </li>
            <li> The brush has shed a bit of hairs but that is to be expected in this price point.  </li>
            <li> basically as expected item.  </li>
            <li> Not a very sturdy brush either.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to constantly wet it to mix with the shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs along the way, but take care of it properly and it will work like a brush 3-4 times</li>
            <li> It is a rather poor lather builder and a lather hog (doesn&#x27;t release lather very well).</li>
            <li> I spent a decade scraping hair off my face with a piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> but, I guess I should not have expected perfection, in spite of the marketing.  </li>
            <li> I did lose some of the hair in it as to be expected.</li>
            <li> Only a few bristles have come out from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No shedding, and minimal mushroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a Merkur 180, to get into wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> A few hairs here and there come off the brush, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because after a few weeks of use, I still have hairs coming out of the brush on every use.  </li>
            <li> The merchant promptly sent out the order and everything went as expected.</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> It is about as expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> It has tapered off with use, and some is expected, but this was excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Three weeks of use and only a few hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> hairs fall out, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no lather to speak off.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Brush sheds minimally</li>
            <li> I had a few bristles fall out with the initial usage</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I expected and got.</li>
            <li> Compared to a silver tip badger price this product was extremely rough.  </li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s probably to be expected.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  </li>
            <li> The bristles/hair are very pointy and somewhat irritating.  </li>
            <li> It is everything I thought it would be, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have it 3-4 tries, then it went into the trash</li>
            <li> I guess it was just not as I expected.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been wet shaving for awhile</li>
            <li> Has a stinky smell when wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only lost a few bristles and does everything I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Plus i don&#x27;t waste lots of extra shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Initially lost some bristles but this stopped after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I paid roughly $12 for this, and have no complaints at that price.</li>
            <li> It arrived just when I expected it to and it does everything it says.</li>
            <li> but after just a few shaves the knot started to shed and now after about 6 months there is a hole in the middle of the knot.</li>
            <li> It smells like a wet animal....</li>
            <li> The hair is extremely thin and this prevents hairs from standing straight.</li>
            <li> A few hairs do occasionally fall off when lathering.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a double-edge razor four months ago.  </li>
            <li> When they get caught in the shaving cream, you get irritation as they drag all over your face.</li>
            <li> I expected that.</li>
            <li> These reviews are either from inexperienced people just getting in to wet shaving</li>
            <li> Some people get brushes that hold up for a year and some that break after two uses.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely rough for a badger brush.</li>
            <li> Had the badger smell initially but went off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting softer as I go though, which is expected.</li>
            <li> There is minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except it does what it&#x27;s supposed to... put lather on my face.</li>
            <li> Have only lost a few hairs and they appear to have stopped coming out.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Hair is attached firmly and has not released after several uses.</li>
            <li> However, to save some money, I bought him a boar bristle brush to begin with, and he has been on the fence about whether or not he enjoys wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Yes, but that is to be expected given the price difference.</li>
            <li> It will last you a few hundred shaves, enabling you to stand tall with the likes of Allan Quarterman and Captain John Blackthorne (yes, I know they sport beards...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m matching sheer awesomeness, not smooth faces).</li>
            <li> There have been minimal loss of hairs with use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not gentle with it by any means.  </li>
            <li> *not* stand it up as seen in the photo when wet.</li>
            <li> Red and white base, light bristles, don&#x27;t know who made it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had minimal brush hairs detaching</li>
            <li> but thats too be expected.</li>
            <li> the wet / dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush dark grey, indicates that the bristles may not be Badger.</li>
            <li> Now only a few comes off.</li>
            <li> I also bought a double edge razor which is way better than those triple or quatro blades that rip the crap out of your skin.</li>
            <li> When my skin is being extra sensitive it can be somewhat irritating, but that may be with all shaving brushes.  </li>
            <li> The hair is not as thick around as my old brush.</li>
            <li> Had some shedding at the beginning (expected) and smelled a bit when wet (also expected).</li>
            <li> A few of the bristles have come off, but that is to be expected; similar to paint brushes.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the poor lather and wanted something better.</li>
            <li> The hair smelled like wild game as though the fur was not cured properly.  </li>
            <li> The higher end badger brushes are very expensive and too wispy soft</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slowly softening up with each use (used it about 25 times so far).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge price or a big deal.</li>
            <li> The 2nd brush was all deformed and missing bristles in the center of the brush.</li>
            <li> After having shaved with only an electric razor for over 30 years, a few years ago I decided to try blade shaving again, using the wet shaving method.  </li>
            <li> had I known about this brush, I would have spent the extra few bucks for this.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it would be nice if there were color options for the base.</li>
            <li> It is annoying, but I still find this brush to be effective for the uses that it is intended for.  </li>
            <li> Its kind of annoying to have to pull them out</li>
            <li> Kind of a crap shoot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of annoying having badger hair on your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> Nice wood base.</li>
            <li> Every shave from day one is obstructed due to loose hairs produced by this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush shed quite a few bristles at first but lately seems to have settled down.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells like a wet dog at first, but it goes away quickly and is honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any odor as some other have complained, but then again I am not very sensitive to chemical odors in general.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have for the past year or so - it has held up well and does what it is supposed to - no need to spend money on those other &amp;#34; high end &amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I had previously searched for other brushes, but was turned off by the price due to trying a double edged razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a less expensive brush before investing in a hand-made brush, which might be the exact same result I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brushes in the past, some more expensive and some less.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been drying it the wrong way (right side up, without a stand), and it still retains its softness and fluff.</li>
            <li> But the quills have a tendency to fall out -- not sure that this will last very long.</li>
            <li> It has only slightly lightened up (become less prickly) but is still too harsh to face lather (especially having now had experience with some Boars hair brushes that had been softer).</li>
            <li> It worked well enough, although I thought the bristles were too stiff.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of shaving brushes, so I&#x27;m certainly no expert.  </li>
            <li> Holds the lather well and is just stiff enough to give your muttons a tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not looking to invest in an expensive badger brush right from the begining.  </li>
            <li> It feels really soft and this does not smell like other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Escali shaving brush for my husband when his other brush that he&#x27;d had for only a few months started losing bristles.</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs fall out in the beginning as other reviews mention, but it&#x27;s only a few and doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality of the brush or the shaves.  </li>
            <li> His brush lost about the same number of hairs, it does feel a very slight bit softer.</li>
            <li> This brush was thin and very stinky compared to my other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Now when I use it there&#x27;s no more left over loose badger hairs.</li>
            <li> Usually on the third time you will no longer get any loose strands.</li>
            <li> I have been losing at least one to two bristles with a near daily shave lately, so I may have to replace this before too long.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because its a little smaller than expected but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;You need a stand or have to lay it down on its side.</li>
            <li> So this review is half for the actual brush, and half for the seller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember also that you should dry your brush with the bristles hanging down.</li>
            <li> I rinse it thoroughly after each use and hang it bristles down to dry.  </li>
            <li> After use, dry the brush by keeping it upside down or sideways, not upright.</li>
            <li> And I do dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember to let this dry upside down, so either buy a fancy stand or make one out of a wire hanger (they both work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend buying a stand to hold the brush with bristles down, to let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should dry it with the bristles down, but I don&#x27;t have a razor caddy</li>
            <li> (I dry my brush on a stand bristles down</li>
            <li> Remember to dry it either upside down or on</li>
            <li> Dampen, use, rinse, shake dry, hang upside down, repeat tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I learned that they must dry upside down, so i purchase a stand for the razor and for the brush.  </li>
            <li> They also recommend hanging the brush upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> I just shake it dry and hang from a stand with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower and let it dry by hanging upside down.</li>
            <li> I dry mine upside down on the counter, wedged between a wall and the case it comes in (for about 1 day).&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I think you should also let it dry it hanging upside down.</li>
            <li> care to let it drip dry brush side down</li>
            <li> I recommend a stand to let it dry upside down.</li>
            <li> keep the brush hairs pointing down to dry by tying it to a towel</li>
            <li> so when you are done shaving, the brush can dry upside down.</li>
            <li> Remember to dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> After having used it for several months, it no longer has the unpleasant smell, holds what bristles it has pretty well and doesn&#x27;t give off the strange brown color when rinsing it.</li>
            <li> You take your other hand across your chiseled face to be met with a rough 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviewers the animal scent was minimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite a few of the hairs came out of the brush the first uses, and continued for at least a few weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers who recommend not leaving the wet brush sit on the handle.</li>
            <li> The clipped hairs never really soften even after 8 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few complaints about several other less expensive brushes, and I really think the issues users had (bristle loss) are because they&#x27;re not soaking the brush in water for several minutes before they shave.</li>
            <li> The boar was stiff and hard even after soaking in hot water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Had a few, and I mean literally a few bristles come out the first week.</li>
            <li> I dry mine upside down on a stand after each use and shave about every other day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot recommended this brush to new traditional wet shavers.</li>
            <li> The brush also has a lot of loose hairs even after a month of use and drying it upside down as recommended.  </li>
            <li> Horrible lather, brush is easily deformed when wet and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;starfish&amp;#34; well when applying shaving soap, and first 10 uses produced an odd brown lather, which I will assume is from a dye they use.  </li>
            <li> At first &amp; second wash the rinse water visably dirty.</li>
            <li> It lost at least 20 hairs the first use, and routinely loses approx 5-10 each use since over the four weeks I&#x27;ve had it.  </li>
            <li> The only disappointment is that during my first 10 or so uses, the brush shed some hairs into and onto my shaving soap canister.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really expect much, but was definitely disappointed by the lack of quality control.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this one are not soft, and it shed even worse than the old one.  </li>
            <li> I lost 5 or so hairs on my first use, a common complaint found on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that i get a hot lather rather than the cold out of a can.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the brush is going to wear down over time, but thats fine as the price is crazy lower than others, and Im not sure that they wouldnt do the same thing.</li>
            <li> The brush itself feels a little bit bigger than previous ones Ive had</li>
            <li> I only dig it one star because I felt it was a little less invigorating or exfoliating than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Brush must be dried bristle side down outside a cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I was careful with this brush and always hung it upside down when wet.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it shed quite a few hairs and it smelled bad for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> When wet, for the first week+, you will notice an somewhat unpleasant odor (similar to a wet dog).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anybody who is trying to up their bathroom game.</li>
            <li> however, what I was not happy about is that the brush started losing a high number of bristles from day one.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brush I was very unhappy - a few loose hairs, and the brush hair was very prickly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it bends a little too much, could be too much pressure from me.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and a little harsh on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several months and have seen very little hair loss.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money on all the super expensive brushes, this Escali 100% Badger hair brush is all you need.</li>
            <li> P*!#ies use shaving cream and 5 blade razors that are a total garbage pit, give a crap shave and get clogged easily.</li>
            <li> Once dried you can store it in a closed cabinet, if you don&#x27;t allow it to dry it will smell funky.  </li>
            <li> I get a much closer and less irritating shave with the brush than without it.</li>
            <li> w/ almost every use and while not very stiff is also not soft - poor combination.  </li>
            <li> They pretty much fail to lather up shaving cream I use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is only at the beginning of its use and that it will subside but will know after about another week.</li>
            <li> If you are wet shaving on a budget like I am, DO IT!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews, it&#x27;s under $15...</li>
            <li> Due to the chemicals to treat the hair bristles.  </li>
            <li> That may differ for other people.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does the job well:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try other brands before I buy this again.</li>
            <li> and no hairs sticking out to the sides like with some other brushes I have used (and thrown away) in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use this for my second paint/pass when DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was going to give it to the man of the house for his fuzzy face, but he is growing a beard, and refuses to shave the neck beard other than a trim..</li>
            <li> I have 2 other brushes (about $50 each) and those work like a badger hair shaving brush should.</li>
            <li> As a beginner I can&#x27;t compare it to other badger brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read online that some brushes have a foul odor due to the badger hair.</li>
            <li> will look at other brushes as I&#x27;m still learning the ropes.</li>
            <li> Holds water extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, with the Proraso soap I use it applies extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Not smelling weird as it did at first anymore either.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is related to the quality of the brush or my inexperience with badger brushes, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll compare this to my other brush which is a van der Hagen (the one in the kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands; however, it seems to be made from quality materials and its appearance is satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Hairs occasionally fall out, but that&#x27;s usually my fault.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I can do anything about it other than throw it away and go for a different brand.  </li>
            <li> so I throw the other brushes I had.</li>
            <li> read some of the other reviews about the brush hairs falling out.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was extremely helpful with all the returns and assisting me.</li>
            <li> After about 8 months of use the coating/veneer on the wood began to delaminate which leave a flakey/sort of sharp material on the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience other experience with badger shaving brushes, having just gotten into double-edged shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought a hgher grade brush but continue to reccomend this one as a starter for guys who are not sure about the traditional shaving route.</li>
            <li> My husband had wanted to change his shaving brush, went to the mall and was asked to pay $150 for a shaving kit - that has a brush in it but also other things that he would not need.</li>
            <li> And, an opportunity for you to support a small American business.</li>
            <li> In fact this one was priced below some other boar hairs I had seen.</li>
            <li> I read some other review about it smelling</li>
            <li> It only requires you to use a small amount of shaving cream to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my other in a hotel room</li>
            <li> The brush itself is not soft and I had trouble distributing the cream.</li>
            <li> so I can not compare it to any other one, but I like it a lot</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, it looks like my experience was not an outlier.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> every other shave maybe.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews, so we&#x27;ll see if this brush holds up.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to master the rest of the wet shaving process!</li>
            <li> Lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not sure about that one but universally</li>
            <li> It’s a pleasure to use, and I actually like the small amount of prickly hairs as they exfoliate during a face lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope he likes it based upon other&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li> other brushes in brick and mortar stores beat quality and price.</li>
            <li> other thing is that this badger brush has hair falling out of it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted you will see hakrs in your shave cream rather often, but for the price it&#x27;s acceptable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this baby to, but it does the job at a severe discount vs. other options.</li>
            <li> but once you start using other quality brushes you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Still will have the occasional bristle fall out, but not nearly as many as before.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried a boar hair brush or other badger hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned any other brush</li>
            <li> Faint animal smell, not as soft as expected on initial use however over time the brush gradually became softer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes.</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I purchased Escali since the price wasn&#x27;t going to burn my wallet.</li>
            <li> But the brush even before I was using the other tips was working well for my skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brushes, this one has not yet shed any bristles.</li>
            <li> This product varies in quality and is not consistent.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this brush works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews helped solidify my decision</li>
            <li> The only thing missing from this experience is a cigar and a scotch!</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have had no problems with it falling apart like other people have said.</li>
            <li> I figured this was due to</li>
            <li> The company shipped it faster than expected!</li>
            <li> It was also scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Second and third and foruth times it also shed hair and felt small and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week with the same shaving soap which I usually use but can&#x27;t seem to get any lather.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is an individual defect or design issue.</li>
            <li> other reviewers</li>
            <li> (used every other day).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it was partly due to a handful of bristles falling out</li>
            <li> So no complaints other then the flimsy packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with other shaving brush</li>
            <li> However I bought this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> it feels a bit small in the hand and the brush size is equally  a bit undersized.</li>
            <li> but I am guessing other brushes would be softer.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have experience on other models.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure if these things last forever or the life expectancy, but</li>
            <li> The past several shaves the bristle loss</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is normal for this type of brush or if the brush is made poorly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there are any guidelines to prevent such a thing.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison with other brands.</li>
            <li> the hair on the brush could be softer and not as sharp at the tip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some experiments with using the brush on one side and not on the other</li>
            <li> only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has been periodically shedding a hair here and there for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> In the past I have bought my husband other shaving brushes made from different material and they did not work as well.</li>
            <li> It beats a sharp stick in the eye</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other shaving brush so no comparisons.</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with other shaving items, for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this brush because it is thicker than other brands because of the generous bristles.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> In other words, it works.</li>
            <li> with only a small amount of</li>
            <li> with any other brushes with their fancy bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After not getting a brush for Christmas, I ordered this due SOLELY on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Yes it has a weird odor at first</li>
            <li> I got this brush several weeks ago and was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial shedding of bristles, this brush works well.</li>
            <li> On the matter of bristle leakage, yes, every other shaving session, a bristle may fall out.  </li>
            <li> Expect this to last longer than the drugstore brushes that I have used in  the past.</li>
            <li> As a beginner I have no idea if it is small compared to other brushes, but I don&#x27;t know why the brush would need to be any larger.  </li>
            <li> You can see this in other photos that have been uploaded.</li>
            <li> It does not shed it&#x27;s bristles like some of the other did.  </li>
            <li> Compare to my other that would lose probably 3 or 4 bristles per shave.&lt;br /&gt;Store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a big deal, just not sure if they all do that</li>
            <li> about 2 bristles every other shave.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers don&#x27;t seem to be having this problem.  </li>
            <li> At the recommendation of the book, I decided to go for the badger hair brush, due to</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell from it like some of the of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of other brushes made of a lot of other material</li>
            <li> Its like trying to apply lather with a wet cats tail!</li>
            <li> A few lost bristles is my only complaint, and only while breaking it in.  </li>
            <li> + (what other quality badger shaving products go for)</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush, not impressed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a starter brush, but there are alot of other options in this range.</li>
            <li> With my other brushes the bristles came unglued and fell off, seemingly due to moisture.</li>
            <li> hAVE NEVER USED ANY OTHER BADGER BRUSHES</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s well made, some of the hairs will fall out every now and</li>
            <li> As such the pricing of these types of brushes also usually goes in that</li>
            <li> use the brush every other day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles falling out (other than one here or there).</li>
            <li> searched for other methods to reduce the smell from a badger hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I have two other brushes, one I keep in my travel shaving kit at all</li>
            <li> Not having used any other one, my review may be one sided.</li>
            <li> i will say that i haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes so i can&#x27;t compare it to anything.</li>
            <li> This brush is about like any other.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for my son as a gift along with other shaving products.</li>
            <li> Having used other brushes for DE shaving, was expecting &amp;#34;more of the same&amp;#34; from this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit unfair for me to post a review since it is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a shaving brush, I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> But so do my other Badger, Boar, And horse hair brushes.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m convinced this is in fact some animal other than badger....</li>
            <li> it touches and I have not had this problem with my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Unlike other posters I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell or had any hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any difference at all, it may be that this one is still shedding a teeny bit, whereas the other I think was thoroughly worn in by now.</li>
            <li> i dont have any relatable with any other brush&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smaller brush then others that I have used, but I like size as it&#x27;s not too small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any other brushes to compare it too, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a big deal since I usually shower after I shave, not that it would matter anyway since the aroma of the shaving soap overpowers the smell of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush in all my years of shaving or had any other brush</li>
            <li> There is no smell, as I&#x27;ve read in some other reviews and I&#x27;ve lost maybe 3 or 4 hairs in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> like I was, spend some time on youtube or other websites to learn how to use it and what to look for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush to all wet shavers!  </li>
            <li> Well as other reviews suggested...</li>
            <li> I Have been using it for about a week now; and yes like other reviewers have said it will shed a hair or 2 on you at times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I have other brushes to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand, did not have a coat hanger for some reason to spare.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers described their bristle head falling off after some use.</li>
            <li> This product has other uses.</li>
            <li> the other guys think I have Don King Afro pubes.</li>
            <li> I was never impressed with the brush when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes out, but I cannot complain about this one.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the hair feel softer too.</li>
            <li> I understand that there should be some smell associated with a &amp;#34;badger haired&amp;#34; brush, but that faded on my other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said it is scratching but for me anyway, that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> (The other was purchased for a friend).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if paying double or triple will make a difference because I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but if you want to try out a badger brush and don&#x27;t want to break bank</li>
            <li> Having never used a badger brush in the past, I was expecting it to be initially softer.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this brush about every other day and has done so for 7+ months.</li>
            <li> Too small for daily use, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to lazy shaving again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the glue didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews stated...</li>
            <li> this is minor consisting of a few hairs not strands</li>
            <li> A few hairs come loose but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price.</li>
            <li> Hang the brush upside down to dry - it cuts down shedding and extends the life of the brush.</li>
            <li> The shedding has decreased compared to the first few days; its down to 1 to 2 hairs per shave now.</li>
            <li> I had not expected it to make such a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> The brush stays in a mated down shape in the center.</li>
            <li> but I didnt notice anything too offensive when its wet - boar brushes on the other hand - oh yeah!</li>
            <li> He loves it, because it is soft, but still firm, and firm without being prickly or too stiff, He has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I washed it with some antibacterial soap and its a little better, but still smells bad.</li>
            <li> no smell and very minimal loss of bristles</li>
            <li> While this is Badger, it is very rough.  </li>
            <li> This is a very rough brush.</li>
            <li> It had very minimal shedding</li>
            <li> It does work, but sheds like a husky and is very rough on the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very rough with it</li>
            <li> I lather a mixture of hard glycerin based soaps and soft soaps and have lost quite a few hairs.</li>
            <li> Brush works and I have no complaints except it took a little longer than desired for it to stop dropping some of the loose hairs that hadn&#x27;t been affixed during the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li> I like to switch every few days and let them completely dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lost a hair when I used it the last couple of times, but that&#x27;s the only thing that has annoyed me.</li>
            <li> But the base is lightweight and flimsy, and obviously has cheap glue.  </li>
            <li> This shaving brush creates a thick lather directly on my face with a few flicks of the wrist.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s an ever so slightly musky odor after you wet the brush</li>
            <li> Brush hanger is not necessary, but if you must, place in a dry shallow bowl on its side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose the more expensive brands have some secret way of doing this.</li>
            <li> A few hairs came out early on, but I&#x27;d think that&#x27;s common for any brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real issues I have notices a few hairs come off, but this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to it, and the bristles are somewhat scratchy - which was expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, previously I used my hands to lather aerosal foam, and with this brush my hands don&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li> I have only noticed a few hairs coming out of the brush with a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> Imitation Ivory,</li>
            <li> While initially there were a few bristles that fell out of the brush, after a few uses the brush seems to have \\&quot;settled down\\&quot; a bit.  </li>
            <li> Since this is my first brush maybe it will stop with use, but I&#x27;m so far disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seriously, when you soak the bristles in warm water, it&#x27;s impossible not to feel that you&#x27;re brushing your face with a bedraggled forest</li>
            <li> He recently bought one to include in a dirty santa gift because he loves it so much.</li>
            <li> Initially the brush was a little stiff which I didn&#x27;t mind since it since it seemed to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> Loose a few hair every time I use it, other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> The bristles smell pretty bad and are a little too soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but its not very good.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little softer, but it occasionally pokes you like the synthetic brush and has a very slight smell (unlike the synthetic).</li>
            <li> I hang-dry the brush from the handle each time, and I can&#x27;t remember a single bristle trying to get away from the brush in the few months I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> I hang it upside down to dry using a little innovation</li>
            <li> There is less hairs coming loose than the previous brush he had.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it it instantly produced a bad odor when I got it wet, then when I whipped up my lather</li>
            <li> and I get a THICK, SLICK and Protective  lather in five minutes, enough for three passes and some left over, The brush is not a water hog and produces plenty of lather.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since I ordered based on good reviews, I guess quality has gone downhill.</li>
            <li> The bristles should be stiff even when wet, but these hang like a horsetail once wet, and I can&#x27;t build a lather with it that will cover my face.  </li>
            <li> Dislike the &amp;#34;escali&amp;#34; branding on it, would prefer it to be plain, and hairs do fall out here and there, but I am hoping this stops eventually, I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the bristles to be firm and stiff allowing them to get in and prop</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially there were a few loose hair that fell out during lathering</li>
            <li> I do note a few of the hairs do come loose from time to time but</li>
            <li> First time buying a shaving brush at all, so I&#x27;m not going off previous experience and basically chose this brand/company blindly; and 2.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be hard to open,&amp; it came well protected among some other orders with inflated plastic.</li>
            <li> Other brushes seem to shed like my dog for about a month of use before they settle down.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other users this must be stored brush side down.</li>
            <li> I made a stand from some heavy #10 wire and hang it to dry with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> : I just dropped my rating for this brush from 4 to 3...bought a new one for the wife, who came out of the bathroom sad a few days ago because the knot had detached from the handle after only 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Drill a small flat head screw into the center of the end of the brush and use a small magnet to hang it upside down to dry under your medicine cabinet door.</li>
            <li> Might be difficult for someone with large hands.</li>
            <li> Very soft and yet is loses very few bristles.  </li>
            <li> Ehhh...smells a little bit like a wet badger, but that&#x27;s granted being that it&#x27;s made from a badger...</li>
            <li> Yes it does smell a little funky, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were a little &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; but I figure that can be expected.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to once, and it was a little rough.  </li>
            <li> There is a little shedding from the brush, but that is expected.</li>
            <li> and I thought it may be a little too rough</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little brother for Christmas along with the rest of the wet shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little rough.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard but sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do this a few times, and after squeezing it dry, I hang it by the handle upside down so the hairs are facing down.</li>
            <li> it smells like a weird thick musky rubbery smell, as if the animal they got the hair off of was hideously unclean and they never bothered to clean it or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought 3 other brushes and hair came out in less than a week .</li>
            <li> , had I not read previous reviews of this and other shaving brushes.   </li>
            <li> I think I typically lose a hair from the brush every use or every other use.</li>
            <li> * Sheds like a dog during summer for at least the first few shaves - seriously, hair</li>
            <li> After seeing other badger hair brushes at costs up to 80$ I decided to buy this one because it was much less in cost.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any space around my sink, so I didn&#x27;t want a dedicated brush rack, but I also wanted to prolong this brush&#x27;s life by drying it properly (bristles-down).  </li>
            <li> so they don’t pick up enough hard soap, for example.</li>
            <li> Only one I have tried so its hard to compare to anything else</li>
            <li> The brussels are hard and constantly fall off, even after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I push too hard but it seems like a hair falls out about every 3rd shave</li>
            <li> For those thinking of starting to use a brush take a lesson that I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Because the last two shaving brushes that I have bought (different kinds and from other sellers) have started shedding within a week or so, and then have completely come apart after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, this product has maintained its quality; not even one bristle has come off, and the brush and its base are solidly connected.</li>
            <li> I must have used the brush at least 40 times now and every single time I use it I loose about 2 or 3 bristles.</li>
            <li> There is no way the 5 star reviews are legitimate--all of us with bad experiences are saying the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I am at least the fourth generation in my family to use a \\&quot;mug and brush\\&quot; for shaving.</li>
            <li> Even after I made the DE switch, I stood by, and do so at least twice/week, my Barbasol (yellow) canned cream.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> The brush loses multiple hairs with each use.  </li>
            <li> I personally have never liked shaving.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> This brush loses fewer bristles, but the smell is enough for me to not use it at all.  </li>
            <li> The Brush appeared to be well made, but upon use the bristles are falling out and the soap in the cup is turning dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth paying $30 to $99 to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the hairs fall out while brushing.</li>
            <li> But I think this brush will still easily last a few years, if not more.</li>
            <li> and I seem to lose an average of 3 bristles each use.</li>
            <li> That faint smell faded to nothing after the first few days and all I can smell on the brush now is the residual fragrance of my shaving</li>
            <li> Shipping took the average amount of time.  </li>
            <li> but I expect at least several years if taken care of.  </li>
            <li> This brush is not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I get at least 2 or 3 hairs that detach and stick to the lather on my face each shave.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that some of the bristle&#x27;s seem to fall out (which I would expect) but it&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> only complaint regarding this product is that they don&#x27;t offer a stand from which to hang the brush upside-down; if they do, I didn&#x27;t see the option anywhere here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; quite a bit</li>
            <li> shed a few hairs at first and had a faint smell.</li>
            <li> Been a long time disposable razor user in the past.  </li>
            <li> but that is the only complaint.</li>
            <li> But not worth driving to the shipping store to return</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that my cat likes to steal it and take it around the house with her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soft, it&#x27;s actually quite prickly and does not soften after being broken in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve give this brush an average of 4.</li>
            <li> brush however is not worth 12.95:&lt;br</li>
            <li> biggest complaint for this brush has been when it comes to the actual use.</li>
            <li> Loses hairs fairly regularly despite being well cared for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one issue with it, it loses hair faster than I do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that is common to all such brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It loses a hair every now and again, but it&#x27;s not too big</li>
            <li> I recently tried a more expensive version and was somewhat disappointed by the overall quality based on what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Just not worth buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my cats are unexplainably drawn to it</li>
            <li> It still loses one or two hairs upon each use, but has kept its overall shape and thickness.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the odor.  </li>
            <li> Every shave i get at least ten hairs that I&#x27;m picking out of my bowl or face.&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s gonna last at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is cheap...but still not worth $12.</li>
            <li> Mine lost a few hairs per shave, but it&#x27;s a cheapo and expected.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving for approximately 60 years now and I have tried every conceivable method I have ever heard of during this period of time.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a few weeks now with minimal loss of hair.</li>
            <li> If left on its side or stood up on its handle, the water just sits on the knot inside the handle and causes the brush to fall apart slowly fall apart.</li>
            <li> A few bristle have fallen out through use, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> keeps forming up a knot in the dead center of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Nothing could be more annoying.</li>
            <li> i just hate the hair part and wished they had made a better product.  </li>
            <li> I suspect they might stop after more uses, but it was annoying having to shave with bristles stuck to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately most of the rank bathroom smell is gone, though.  </li>
            <li> After you use it a few times, it starts to lose the wet animal smell.</li>
            <li> you are looking to try out using a bush and wet shaving, but don&#x27;t want to drop a few hundred bucks on all of the nicest gear</li>
            <li> A few bristles have fallen out in this time, but this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed, wood base, and feels pretty soft.</li>
            <li> I have another one by the Art of Shaving, which honestly is a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> Bristles also fall out more often than the synthetic brush, which is annoying if it gets embedded in the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Smells like, well a dead badger when wet.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves, the brush got softer, as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately 20 shaves, thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lost a few hairs but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> (seriously, if you&#x27;re Santa and wish to look like Sean Connery, this brush will bend over backwards and go to extreme lengths for you, but there is no guarantee it&#x27;ll survive after pulling of &amp;#34;Saving Private Ryan&#x27; type feats of valor!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask</li>
            <li> brush sheds like mad, but decent enough as a starter brush.  </li>
            <li> A few bristles have been lost, but certainly not many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely a bit dirty when new.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to wet shaving and didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on an expensive brush.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; quite a bit after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> storing it on a rack, bristles down just as people say you should.</li>
            <li> (down)</li>
            <li> I hang this brush (hair end down) using this:</li>
            <li> bristles down or lay it on its side, not handle down with bristles</li>
            <li> The brush, like all shaving brushes, must be hung bristle side down</li>
            <li> UPSIDE DOWN.</li>
            <li> I would recommend hang it upside down after use.</li>
            <li> Rinse it if you like but not with the handle down (meaning the water rinsing over the brush with the handle with the handle facing the sink) .  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t going to turn that down, so I agreed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s side or upside down in a brush holder or it will not keep</li>
            <li> Whether you use up and down stokes, like a painter, or do circles, let the brush do its work without smashing the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Plus, shaving with this item has a romantic/nostalgic feeling where life slows down</li>
            <li> I do hang it up after use (bristles down)</li>
            <li> You have to follow the instructions for drying (upside down) and rinse with every wash.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll just break down and get a whipped dog silvertip, which can be had for the cost of 3 of these things.</li>
            <li> The brush then hangs upside down for maximum drying time.  </li>
            <li> ( I rinse after use and hang bristles down.</li>
            <li> Store it bristle down.</li>
            <li> Now, keep in mind, I don&#x27;t hang my brush upside down, like recommend.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT LET TRY WOOD DOWN.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does need to be wrung out after use and kept stored upside down</li>
            <li> I have mine on a stand, upside down and</li>
            <li> Note that I am properly handing it up on a stand (lucky find at a Goodwill for $2) rather than just setting it on its base or side when not using it.</li>
            <li> always rinse it and hang it upside down to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> but that has also settled down.</li>
            <li> I store it upside down</li>
            <li> the costs in and hands down</li>
            <li> I always store it upside down to let the water drain out of the handle</li>
            <li> Just keep it on a stand or hanging upside down somehow.</li>
            <li> Those who say the hair comes out must store theirs upside down like in the picture.</li>
            <li> -DOWN</li>
            <li> so you can put a brush upside down.</li>
            <li> as I understand that drying it with the bristles down is supposed to prevent them from falling out.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying a holder to hang it upside down.</li>
            <li> I follow the guidelines of drying brush upside down to avoid hair loss.</li>
            <li> This brush has been something of a let down in every way but the price.</li>
            <li> I really like setting it down on the flat base, hairs up/still with later, in case i need to touch up a spot i missed.</li>
            <li> i only used this brush once and other than shedding the brush&#x27;s hair in the middle section got deformed making it uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It worked extremely well!</li>
            <li> Having done a &#x27;little&#x27; research beforehand, I assumed this was due to my brush method, so I stuck with it, to no avail.    </li>
            <li> As previousely stated in other reviews it does shed a little.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are a little too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> hairs seems a bit stiff to me and maybe a bit course or rough.  </li>
            <li> first the brush was a little rough on my face and lost a number of bristles for the first week or so and picking them out of the shave soap was very annoying.</li>
            <li> less than average quality - tends to lose hair in each use</li>
            <li> : some bristle loss; a little bit of a longer shaving routine; brush is a little rough on the face till you get used to it, although perhaps this helps \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I mean when I&#x27;m walking down the street I actually stride faster because there&#x27;s less resistance from an</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a bit smaller, but only the wooden base portion was smaller.</li>
            <li> Finally, it dawned on me that it should be applied by a shaving brush (I am a little slow on the uptake at times, but am now an unstoppable shaving machine).  </li>
            <li> Other reviews say this smell goes away after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> Other than a few bristles shedding from time to time it is holding up well after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Shreds (leaves hair) in the soap dish, seeming to get a little better after about 10 uses but still annoying to have to pick out the brush hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a very small brownish tint to my soap when I lather up but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but not something I&#x27;ve had happen with other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a plastic-handled, 100% boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> Is that typical?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the soft/light wood look but again, cost a lot less than the nicer brushes out there</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had cats that shed less.</li>
            <li> &quot; It had a slightly musky scent, but after two shaves its gone.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about shaving and searching for a shaving brush look no further.</li>
            <li> What a difference $60 (less) gets you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get less than you pay for....</li>
            <li> My previous ones were from The Art of Shaving shops which lasted longer than a year before losing bristles.</li>
            <li> The cost is significantly less than canned shaving cream and the comfort level can&#x27;t be matched.  </li>
            <li> But, one would expect the brush to last at least a few 100 times of use.</li>
            <li> To solve these problems, I sunk a small screw into the handle of the brush (opposite the bristles), and stuck a small rare-earth magnet onto the bottom of my mirror/med cabinet.  </li>
            <li> is that the bristles have a slight tendency to come out of the brush and stick to the sides of the shaving bowl if I mix the cream too vigorously.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are softer than the boar hair brush I was previously using.</li>
            <li> Have to slightly adjust the amount of cream used vs the boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use now for less than a week so time will tell,</li>
            <li> will result in less hair loss from the brush.  </li>
            <li> I used to go through a 5oz tub in a month and a half using just my fingers to apply the cream to my face.  </li>
            <li> (black)  </li>
            <li> I previously was using a brush made with porcupine hair.  </li>
            <li> and I would prefer the bristles to be slightly stiffer.</li>
            <li> Brush head broke off from the body after less than 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> The brush works as a brush should - lathers, spreads soap, etc., - but after less 9 months the bristles started to fall out.</li>
            <li> Thin in the center, causing tangling of the brush hairs even with very low pressure.</li>
            <li> I previously used the spray foam stuff that came from the can</li>
            <li> and therefore I use less.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting an $80 silver tip for less than $15 bucks, keep on dreaming.</li>
            <li> I bought another brush less than a week after receiving this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and appears to be durable, though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Probably lost 10% of its bristles with less than 30 days use</li>
            <li> It retains heat and holds soap very well, it also doesn&#x27;t shed like a lab like the waste of money expensive one I got for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a brush from a Van Der Hagen set that was softer, did not have a smell and had cleaner (whiter) looking bristles.</li>
            <li> Shaved it once and lost half the hairs… literally.</li>
            <li> It lathers up all my shaving creame jars quickly no matter what brand I use.</li>
            <li> Odd that there could be shaving brushes that costs $100.00 (which I would never buy -</li>
            <li> I use Jack Black Beard Lube, dolloped on face and worked in with this brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out, but not as much as my previous brush.</li>
            <li> Unless it fails in some unforeseen way, I will likely buy this same brush when it is time to replace my &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; brush!</li>
            <li> I use boars that have less scratch than this, this thing never did stop shedding.</li>
            <li> After about a half dozen uses, I&#x27;m still losing 1 or 2 hairs per shave</li>
            <li> It is like night and day compared to my previous VHD boar bristle shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Here is my experience:  - tiny brush  - very coarse, to the point of somewhat uncomfortable to my beard  </li>
            <li> This is prehaps an odd item for a woman to order, but I used to steal my grandfather&#x27;s when I ran out of shaving cream all the time.  </li>
            <li> I notice that I get less ingrown hairs and a smoother closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The slight smell gives it away.  </li>
            <li> My bristles have started falling out after less than 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of getting a shave at the barbershop, and I use a lot less shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It broke in half after using it twice.</li>
            <li> After less than 30 days of use, the handle separated itself from the brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a reason to give this less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My previous brush was a $10 purchase at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> What strikes me about this brush is that the bristles are shorter than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> The brush has an odd exfoliating texture.  </li>
            <li> Why pay inflated prices when you can get a quality product for much less?</li>
            <li> Having said that, it is a (serious) stocking stuffer and won&#x27;t be put to an actual use test until after Christmas.</li>
            <li> Perhaps mine is slightly defective.  </li>
            <li> I chose this brush because it was a lot less than the retailers price.</li>
            <li> I never had a Badger Brush and now I would not go back to any artificial or natural Boar type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product once, briefly, my sink was left with an uncomfortable amount of bristles from this brush.</li>
            <li> There was some slight shedding of the hairs but has lessened to one or so now per shave.  </li>
            <li> My previous brush I&#x27;d picked up at a Walgreens in San Diego area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the brush itself, it was priced much less than some I saw.</li>
            <li> he said it&#x27;s a lot softer than his previous brush, and provides a nicer soap lather.</li>
            <li> my dog sheds less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not shedding horribly, but after the initial break-in period I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to lose so many hairs.  </li>
            <li> Rinses well, and just a slight squeeze to get the water out is all it needs before hanging it up.</li>
            <li> Since I paid less than $14.00</li>
            <li> The smell was less</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scratchy but that&#x27;s typical of a lower-cost badger brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping time much less than stated.  </li>
            <li> As others have seen from previous reviews, this item does smell.</li>
            <li> and that bothers me and my slight OCD.  </li>
            <li> As some previous buyers have noted, it is prone to losing some strands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for half a year or so now</li>
            <li> The only thing that I thought was a bit weird was the initial smell of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Would buy another one in the future if the current fails</li>
            <li> That being said, I wish they also offered it in a chrome or black handle.</li>
            <li> It does have a slightly odd smell.  </li>
            <li> but i was about to buy one at Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and found this one on Amazon at half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> Had this brush less than a year or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try another one to see if mine is just defective, but I think I&#x27;ll just buy a slightly nicer brush instead.</li>
            <li> A half dozen or so hairs fall out every time my boyfriend shaves with it...</li>
            <li> In fact I use less soap than before with previous brushes....</li>
            <li> Also costs a lot less than shaving cream...</li>
            <li> It makes me feel tough, even though I had nothing to do with anything other than putting down $$ American to get it.  </li>
            <li> Tried to apply lather on my face with no success, it does not hold its shape and whatever little lather it created falls off of it.</li>
            <li> Of course it does not even come close to high end products but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They claim high foam, but it totally wrong.</li>
            <li> It smelled really funny at first, (like wet dirty animal) which made the fist couple of weeks of use somewhat unpleasant.</li>
            <li> even though it gets all spread out on your face if you bear down even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I let it dry upside down at least 24 hours before each</li>
            <li> The smell was only unpleasant while applying the lather, and didn&#x27;t stick around, and now it&#x27;s gone completely!  </li>
            <li> First, this brush sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to mess around when it comes to my shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> The first 6 or shaves were extremely disappointing as 15-20 hairs fell out each time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use hot or cold water.  </li>
            <li> It just feels small and not very substantial.</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just prefer a larger brush, but this seemed poorly made and can&#x27;t compare with any of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I find nothing wrong with it other than being to soft for me.</li>
            <li> first, there were some loose bristles that ended up in the cup or on my face, that was annoying, but the loose ones have since worked their way out, and I no longer experience that problem.</li>
            <li> The first shave, I found the bristles very stiff and &amp;#34;poky.&amp;#34; I thought I may be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> However, eventually the shedding slowed down to no more than about 1 hair every other day, sometimes 1 hair every day.  </li>
            <li> Sheds a little at the beginning(few hairs) but settles down afterward with little shed.  </li>
            <li> Buying this brush and using it has made a chore a little less of one...</li>
            <li> It must be dried bristles hanging down.</li>
            <li> I do like the way this brush lathers and is not overly harsh on the face, but it does lose quit alot of bristles despite taking care of it and hanging it upside down on a stand after each shave.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, the loss of bristles slowed down and the smell has faded some.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise a dense and tight brush.</li>
            <li> I have since placed the brush in an air tight bag and set it out with the trash.</li>
            <li> The one minor negative that cost the half point is the perfectly round handle can roll.</li>
            <li> It will last you a long time, if rinsing with cold water and whisk it dry.</li>
            <li> AND DOESN&#x27;T DRY HARD.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I pressed down too hard in the shaving cup and got a few bristles going the wrong direction.  </li>
            <li> Very firm, but not unconfortable or rough.</li>
            <li> Only current complaint is that the waterproof plastic layer over the wood is slowly peeling off but as of yet that hasn&#x27;t had any negative impacts to my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> : after using this brush maybe twice a week for a few months now I can say I&#x27;m a little let down by it&#x27;s performance and durability.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews I expected to see some bristles falling out the first couple times I used it, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This one is not good quality at all, it loses hair, it&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li> A few things in response to previous reviews</li>
            <li> I use a dry lather method, slowly building up the lather on my palm.</li>
            <li> Obviously some badgers rank a lot higher than others.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were too firm and slightly pokey</li>
            <li> But overall I really like this brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> While this is a very soft shaving brush, it is difficult to create the level of suds I would like to have on my face.  </li>
            <li> I tried to save a little money buying this one</li>
            <li> Also, the hairs were a little pokey.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a little bummed</li>
            <li> We should start off with a little terminology.</li>
            <li> The bristles could be a little softer ??</li>
            <li> A little stinky.  </li>
            <li> It works well, and does not have any problem with excessive bristle loss as customers have reported for other products.</li>
            <li> and yes it sheds a little</li>
            <li> Apply a little pressure after dunking in water and shaving cream and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It is a little scratchy and it will probably shed but you will get a quality shave with it.</li>
            <li> I paired this with some sandalwood shaving cream and made a little basket for my brother.  </li>
            <li> Like all brushes, it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Beauty had brushes but they were skimpy little things.</li>
            <li> The biggest surprise,  little to no hair release.</li>
            <li> The end is a little prickely compared to the boar brush, but if you apply with a brushing stroke instead of a dab -which you should do anyway-</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a little stiffer but non</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t shave all that often as I like to have stubble or a little bit of a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I think, a little bit softer and holds it shape just as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Little itchy.</li>
            <li> Still a little itchy after a lot of use.</li>
            <li> Will always probably be a little itchy.</li>
            <li> an wear off just a little bit.</li>
            <li> HANDLE COULD A LITTLE BIT LONGER.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little concerned what chemicals I&#x27;m smearing on my face when I use</li>
            <li> The boar hair brushes need a little time to break in (literally, as the hair tips split and become finer, and therefore begin to cut through the soap bubbles) and could get a bit floppy (think brushing-like).  </li>
            <li> A little rougher and pointier feeling than a $200 badger hair brush</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a significant amount at all.</li>
            <li> I felt hesitant about spending so little for a badger brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles take a little time to soften, but they will.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it was a little of both.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> it is not the way other brushes have been for me in the past</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m being a little nit-picky</li>
            <li> I let the brush side hang off a little ledge in our shower.</li>
            <li> : I forgot to mention that it does shed a little bit</li>
            <li> Since badger brushes are graded by hair, it&#x27;s like the three little pigs story.</li>
            <li> Its a little abrasive too.</li>
            <li> Wash with dawn (just a little), no help.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but sheds a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smelled a little badger-y</li>
            <li> It sheds a little as I suspect any brush does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little over a year now</li>
            <li> have been using this brush for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> The other continually loses bristles and is not nearly as comfortable during application as the other product.  </li>
            <li> A little over a month</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it&#x27;s a little discouraging, having owned this brush for seven months, to continue to get the stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I did notice the water turned a little brown when I rinse bur</li>
            <li> Rather than purchase a shaving brush stand I nailed a little picture frame holder to the side of my medicine cabinet and put a screw eye  into the handle of the brush</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t shave again without this little badger brush.</li>
            <li> but I would like one a little softer on my face.</li>
            <li> some of the reviews say it is a little frickly</li>
            <li> Takes a little breaking in, but lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> Little to no bristle loss.</li>
            <li> Also, no matter how long you use it, clean it, or dry it, it has an awful smell.</li>
            <li> This brush takes a little getting used to if you&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done well but is a little prickly.</li>
            <li> a little bit tan/brown.  </li>
            <li> the brush took a little while to break in which</li>
            <li> a little luxury to your life.</li>
            <li> mine came with the name rubbed off half way (which was no big deal) but the main reason i give this brush 2 stars is that it sheds like crazy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that this brush will shed a little bit, but nothing major.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little softer.</li>
            <li> , otherwise it&#x27;s a little too scratchy.</li>
            <li> Never hurts to have a little man-pampering from time to time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the \\&quot;rough\\&quot; end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> but for my this was a little small, a little stinky and just not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little, but after 22 months, it came apart.  </li>
            <li> It does help with lathering a little bit.</li>
            <li> and it might smell a little, but I see this as a non-issue.</li>
            <li> I just leave a little shave-soap in mine, squeeze it into a point and leave it standing pointed up in the cup.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush 8 months ago and have yet to have a shave where it didn&#x27;t loose at least 5 bristles in the process.</li>
            <li> , it loses a couple of bristles every time you use it but not much to be a problem and is less every time.</li>
            <li> Every brush sheds a few bristles and they all had a slight odor for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, when wet it smells like what I can only assume a wet badger smells like -- not good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks with no problems other than a few hairs falling out (nothing excessive).  </li>
            <li> just had a little trouble with brissils coming out</li>
            <li> They can be a little messy</li>
            <li> I mean that for the first few uses the brush was stiff and a little uncomfortable on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it shows no signs of slowing down!</li>
            <li> and it is defiantly on par with some of my other brushes in my collection that are twice this price!!</li>
            <li> So, if you want a brush that will have a softer overall character than a boar but still has enough backbone for hard soaps, you really can&#x27;t go wrong paying $15 or so for one of these little Escalis.</li>
            <li> but I got an unpleasant smell from it for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I can say that after rinsing the brush, I couldn&#x27;t detect any unpleasant odors &amp; after the first use, no detectable odor at all.  </li>
            <li> Now if this is not an issue not even with the cheap brushes then this brush sucks badly.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing or horrible about it.</li>
            <li> I really dislike writing negative reviews; however, I should prevent others from spending their hard-earned money on a useless product.</li>
            <li> It loses few hairs each time when I use it, but it is expected.</li>
            <li> In short, I do not know if my criticisms reflect the quality of the product or merely something to be expected from an animal product.</li>
            <li> For those starting out or that have been wet shaving for years, you cannot go wrong.  </li>
            <li> My cat must have thought it was a real badger because he was afraid of it and swatted at it.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that it loses hairs faster than higher-end brushes.</li>
            <li> you are trying out wet shaving for the first time and you&#x27;ve never used a brush to lather, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> chicken to use a straight razor yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a few months UPDATE</li>
            <li> but it does shed hairs every few shaves.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not know how this brush is made, but the hair is not holding up and started to get off after few shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> I purposely waited a few weeks before writing this review.</li>
            <li> There were quite a few brushes out there to choose from when I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I have waited a few weeks to review to insure that the brush stood up well</li>
            <li> There were a few.</li>
            <li> It is not a huge brush about a 1in-1.5in when fully dried.</li>
            <li> This brush has held its shape and firmness, stimulating to the skin without being harsh or prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt, this is probably just what dead badger smells like</li>
            <li> BUT, there is another issue: The brush has gone &#x27;limp&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Here are few things that I&#x27;ve noticed:  1)</li>
            <li> I tossed it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> (excess water shaken from it, of course), swirled it around a few times and commenced lathering up my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out here and</li>
            <li> there since I got it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush a few times now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for quite a few months now, about two times a week</li>
            <li> , is that after a week&#x27;s use, it still sheds a few bristles in my cream, which I was hoping would have gone away by now ...</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, yet supple.</li>
            <li> Lost my shaving brush of 14 years a few months age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of having bristles left on my face.</li>
            <li> Likewise the shedding hairs and badger butt aroma go away after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, you didn&#x27;t waste a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Repeat a few times.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months</li>
            <li> A few bristles fall out once in awhile, but the brush is still intact and works as it should.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there are a few hairs that fall out in the beginning</li>
            <li> I was in a store in Dallas, Tx a few weeks ago called The Art of Shaving, and picked up a brush they had on display there and ran it across my face.</li>
            <li> but my was still losing hair after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> It has not shed but a few bristles and continues to serve me well in my travels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and used it maybe 15 times</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a badger brush and shave soap you are missing out.</li>
            <li> The bristles began falling out after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and notice that a few of the hairs become dislodged when using.</li>
            <li> The&#x27;s no problem after a month or so of use with loss of hairs from the brush––a few came out over the days, but that has ceased.</li>
            <li> Since I am not comfortable about applying something to my face that smells like manure, I have thrown this brush</li>
            <li> before using it, i set the brush in a cup of near-boiling water to soak for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> A few bristles fall out now and then, which I would expect.  </li>
            <li> A quality item that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> It looses quite a few bristles with every shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you get one, wash it a few times before using.</li>
            <li> Not a lot but a few each shave.  </li>
            <li> Also you might get a few hairs falling out of the brush every now and then.</li>
            <li> It does shed a bit, and is still losing a few hairs after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I let it go for a few weeks thinking that maybe it would stop, but</li>
            <li> Like a dead badger.</li>
            <li> A few hairs seem to fall out each time when I use it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes just a few, sometimes a lot, and they get stuck to my face, which makes the process messy.</li>
            <li> It shed a bit for the few uses but works well now and doesn&#x27;t shed any.</li>
            <li> , a few dozen bristles would fall out.  </li>
            <li> At this rate, it will be replaced in a few months.</li>
            <li> It does shed a few hairs every few times I shave.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t killed it yet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have trouble getting it to spread a lather without falling apart or having it uneven.</li>
            <li> I would firmly discourage anyone from purchasing the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few faults, but all are forgivable at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few shaves, the bristles soften and the brush stops shedding.</li>
            <li> A few bristles have fallen off in the brushing process, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen every</li>
            <li> Add a bit of water and dish soap and lather a bit, and let the brush soak for a few hours</li>
            <li> There appears to be a crack (or piece missing) where brush connects to wood.</li>
            <li> and it looks as though it will hold up under everyday use.</li>
            <li> But, after a few uses and rinses, the odor fades away.  </li>
            <li> You may want to lather it up and rinse it out a few times, before you plan to start using it.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks in</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> , if you like the smell of dead animals and Badger hair all over your face and in your soap bowl then by all means this is the brush for you.........................</li>
            <li> A few hairs still drop from time to time.  </li>
            <li> Once moistened gets limp and bristles come out on your head</li>
            <li> If you want a close shave and are tired of spending big bucks for 4 - 6 bladed razors, start here with a quality brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read in the reviews that this brush would not fit in a Colonel Conk</li>
            <li> , a few strands of the brush was coming off.</li>
            <li> bursh hair is firm and is holding together well.  </li>
            <li> I have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I soaked it in water and even cleaned it few times.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s become softer and easier to use over the few weeks</li>
            <li> The bristles are on the firm side, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> But, the head broke off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Yeah, they killed a badger to make this thing.  </li>
            <li> A few hair have fallen out</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and have been using it everyday when I shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets the cream on my skin, working in under my stubble even when I have gone a few days without shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles soften up after a few uses.</li>
            <li> a few comments: villi crumble and they are not a lot of prickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also would recommend Marvy * Shaving Mug Rubber Green which I use with this brush.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t seem to get the smell of dead badger out of the bristles.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves though, it has stopped losing bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost my old expensive brush while moving.</li>
            <li> As far as a random bristle here and there...</li>
            <li> It has a weird wild animal / chemical odor, but since you&#x27;re using shaving soap it isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> Poorly made brush which after several months continues to lose bristles both on my face and during rinsing.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the smell went away after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> lose a few hairs on break in</li>
            <li> I have had this now for a few months and performing to expectations.</li>
            <li> I have washed it a few times and reduced the odor.</li>
            <li> I use Proraso green</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Some others may complain of a gamey smell, but that will disappear after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The hairs eventually stop coming out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My second thought was that the shaving soap I was using was poor.  </li>
            <li> I just opened up the amazon box with the brush few hours ago and shaved with it once.  </li>
            <li> It was affordable, so I wasn&#x27;t going to waste a lot of money if I decided I didn&#x27;t like this method of shaving.</li>
            <li> It just seemed like a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble with razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> A musty animal smell for a few shaves/washes of the brush, but doesn&#x27;t linger after use whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The smell went away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Been shaving for 60 years; so few qualified to say this.</li>
            <li> but that goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few hairs fall out</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for about two weeks now ( I shave everyday).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dead set on a badger hair brush</li>
            <li> It seemed to lose a few bristles in the beginning, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any substantial loss since.</li>
            <li> I have pulled a few bristles out of the soap and off my face, but I chalk it up that it&#x27;s a $10 brush, not one of the 25-40 dollar ones.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, a 5 star brush showed up at the door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted a few pictures for you.</li>
            <li> Another plus, the bristles stay firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> Whatever Escali has done, they practically eliminated that &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; which people talked about a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Result is central defect in brush and lathering is poor..  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, the smell has all but gone, but it&#x27;s still lingering a bit.</li>
            <li> The handles finish could be thicker, I feel it may not take the everyday wetting.  </li>
            <li> but a few uses and the hair was falling out getting on my face and in the sink</li>
            <li> a few shavings.</li>
            <li> Each time I use the brush I lose a few bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as a crying child of 24, I went upstairs to the washroom and proceeded to shave my face using the badger brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles fall out with every shave, a few at a time, every day.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, this brush will take a few uses before it is &amp;#34;worn in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> There are a few things you should know about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> To get around this I washed it with Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo a few times until it was tolerable to use, and the smell went away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> few bristles did fall out, but I didn&#x27;t cut my face because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few things that I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the sexier name brands when this will do everything those will and keep your wallet heavier.</li>
            <li> Has lost a few bristles.   </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially it shed a few hairs</li>
            <li> brush fell apart a few mouth in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few brush and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> it is losing a few bristles now and then, but I still like it</li>
            <li> a few of the bristles are falling out.  </li>
            <li> I lose a few bristles a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Occasionally a few will fall out</li>
            <li> I soaked these bristles for a few minutes, then I put some of that shaving cream on the end and lathered it up.</li>
            <li> * Price - quite inexpensive, but not cheap feeling, looking or performing&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both brushes were well priced but the first one I bought (I don&#x27;t want to mention them) felt very uncomfortable on the face.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This took some adjustment, but it is not a problem after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impulsive and impatient though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every few shaves.  </li>
            <li> its actually starting to get thin.</li>
            <li> I bought mine about a year ago and use it everyday, but there is no show of wearing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on over priced brands or marketing.</li>
            <li> It works wonders, especially once it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
            <li> There are a few bristles still coming out, but it does not bother me, or affect the performance.</li>
            <li> a must have for everyday shaving</li>
            <li> I picked this up when I made the switch from my expensive Fusion razors to an old school safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would stop after a few uses</li>
            <li> At this rate it will be bald within a few months.</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday and no problems.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the bristles have begun falling out.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> A few things of note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I&#x27;m getting one or two hairs falling out per use, but it still looks full.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Hairs will fall out for a few days but the it quit.</li>
            <li> Sometimes shaving brushes need a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess that it will probably get softer after a few uses.</li>
            <li> A few hairs fell out, maybe 10, while lathering up the soap.</li>
            <li> Have used 4 times and a few hairs/bristles have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because the brush smells like a dead badger.  </li>
            <li> i got it for my dad who was gonna stay with me for few months.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the shedding has slowed and the odor is gone.  </li>
            <li> now it loses roughly one-per-shave.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> few things you may want to know:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.    </li>
            <li> It shed a few hairs in the beginning, but I think all brushes do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to up their shave game.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this brush, i have one thing to say.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see I bought the brush a few months ago</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not available anywhere</li>
            <li> using for a few months now.</li>
            <li> it does go through a STANK phase after you use it a few times --</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; smell went away after a few shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have not noticed any shedding</li>
            <li> I have used a few times...</li>
            <li> saw a few hairs come out...</li>
            <li> It also lost quite a few bristles.</li>
            <li> Took a few shaves for the hairs to stop falling out.</li>
            <li> I see a few bristles falling out</li>
            <li> Bristles are still firm and intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months and have grown to like it.</li>
            <li> A few hairs fall out when I use it</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but not scratchy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I am finding myself using this brush almost everyday.    </li>
            <li> then after two weeks it was almost gone there were a few stray bristles in the beginning however now</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, just wash it a few times pror to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of the badger scent but after a few uses that starts to wane.</li>
            <li> I generate lather in a bowl, so bristle softness (or lack thereof) is not relevant for me.</li>
            <li> given the price point its not a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li> If a few hairs fall out at the beginning and then occasionally afterwards, don&#x27;t worry about it as it is not uncommon.</li>
            <li> This is not a huge issue, but did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Even after a couple of months of use, I still find a few hairs left behind in the soap bowl.</li>
            <li> I had a badger brush from a starter kit but that brush was a little stiff.</li>
            <li> A little to stiff hopefuly will soften with use.  </li>
            <li> If you like it, you can always purchase a nicer brush down the road, although I&#x27;m not sure if there is a difference.  </li>
            <li> I squeeze the excessive water out and then hang it upside down on a brush stand that I bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I got that down, no more hairs fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have Yorkshire terriers, a breed of dog bred known and bred for hunting down and killing rats and small rodents.  </li>
            <li> One thing I have learned about shaving brushes is you must dry them  upside down on a stand or at the very least on</li>
            <li> Just a word of advise, always let the brush dry upside down on a stand or at the very least on</li>
            <li> Even though I washed several times prior to use and after use it retains a slight unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I am currently expecting a base that I forgot to purchase, you must have somewhere to hang this brush upside down for it to dry properly!</li>
            <li> It was boar, which is softer, but it was very poor construction - the glue failed months ago in it and finally the whole thing separated in two.</li>
            <li> my gentle Jesus, how dead were the Badgers these hairs come from!?!!?!?!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t impossible to get a good lather with this brush, but it is very difficult.</li>
            <li> First, my face smells bad for a few hours -- not very pleasant to have the scent of a wet dog under your nose all day.</li>
            <li> Not much better than the Walmart brush I had been using which costs about half what the Escali costs.</li>
            <li> This brush has been helping me get a closer shave with less irritation for a couple of months now!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s even less work than using a coat hanger!</li>
            <li> I am using half the shaving cream and getting twice the lather with this brush!</li>
            <li> He was fed up with buying the expensive cartridges for his other razor and decided to go back to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Eight shaves later a little less smell but still stinks when wet.</li>
            <li> And it Sheds really bad for a while, but it&#x27;s a decent product for the money, and I would recommend to others that are trying to branch out in the world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It did sting a little while brushing, but that could just be me pressing down too hard.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I have is that the wet bristles really literally stink, what ever they are, the odor is highly unpleasant</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat prickly on the ends, and like other reviewers, mine loses bristles.  </li>
            <li> FYI-if you are just learning to use a straight razor you DO NOT want a brush that sheds like mad.</li>
            <li> This one started out stiff and has remained stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was stiff, itchy, and plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Badger bristles are not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff, but not unbearably so.</li>
            <li> stiff beard bristles</li>
            <li> The bristles are quite stiff-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff but not too scratchy, lifts hairs, and lathers soap well.</li>
            <li> The product has held up and the bristles are still stiff after about two months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Not as stiff a shaft as my $100 plus Jagger Silver Tip.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff or too floppy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff and picks up the soap well as a result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now trying the Schick Hydro Sensitive razors, as the Gillette Fusion Power razors have become way expensive, to the point of being ridiculous, almost $4.00 per cartridge at Costco, and almost $5 at other retailers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there was a foul odor especially when wet and after 7 shaves, the bristles are very limp and doesn&#x27;t provide the intended experience a badger brush should.</li>
            <li> It smells like it has been soaked in raw petroleum for a while, and it hasn&#x27;t improved over the few times I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this is a minor nuisance, but every time I lather, I get at least 3-4 hairs in the soap, and at least one of those picks up and gets on my face.</li>
            <li> It has a bad odor when you take it out of the box and for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> I am not easily stunned.  </li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy and is NOT soft, even after proper cleaning and drying.</li>
            <li> works up a decent lather but sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> Go back to the old way of shaving, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Though he did think it smelled very odd.</li>
            <li> I see no great hair loss, no offensive odor or any other negatives as read in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want the foam to be thick, use a little less water in the brush when working up the lather.</li>
            <li> It is a little small, but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I use to apply the lather and it usually leaves one or two little hairs on my face that I have to pick off and re-apply.</li>
            <li> and it is just a little on the small side for me.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds like crazy and isn&#x27;t nearly as soft as other badger shaving brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually like a little weight</li>
            <li> the indenture is a bit too high up for me and can be somewhat awkward to hold when I am creating a lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing as it was given as a gift and it had been so highly rated.</li>
            <li> Usually when I purchase something I go right to the bad reviews and see if there is a consensus.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last very long at this rate.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller, less expensive travel shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Escali brush has several downsides compared to my previous go-to: 1)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical or not, but it seems excessive to me.  </li>
            <li> but this was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> but the brush is shedding pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This brush smelled really bad at first</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the lather turned an ugly brown.</li>
            <li> helps bring water to the shave used to shave in the shower after health challenges not a good idea this brush helps wet the shave</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the finish on the handle has peeled.  </li>
            <li> It still on average loses a hair or two every time I shave (which is 2 or 3 times a week).</li>
            <li> (1st use I had a few on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than having to deal with the few bristles of badger hair on my face though it&#x27;s basically as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
            <li> Out of the box it had some &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell, but that didn&#x27;t transfer to my face and after a few uses it&#x27;s either gone or just covered by the small of the shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flimsy piece of junk, and their soaps barely lather, and their safety blade handle is lame.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this brush for 3 months now, it did shed a few hairs in the beginning but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> Each time it is used I can expect another 5-10 to fall off even after using it for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to discover, however, that the Escali has much longer bristles than the Tweezerman and lacks the other brush&#x27;s bristle density.</li>
            <li> I have to laugh at people who are disappointed that a brush sheds in the beginning of use, all brushes will shed for a time in spite of the quality.  </li>
            <li> You gulp down the drink still in your hand and begin to lather a thick foam with your brush.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple weeks of use, always storing it upside down, it now loses one every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, it reeks when it gets wet!  </li>
            <li> I think the stand makes a big difference in how long the brush lasts, as it allows the bristles to dry well and in a downward position so water drips off and doesn&#x27;t pool at the base.</li>
            <li> No need to spend a crazy amount of money if you are new to this method.</li>
            <li> The hairs tend to fall out (one or two at each shave), but otherwise very tightly packed.</li>
            <li> Small stiff brush sheds a bit out of the box</li>
            <li> While that&#x27;s a bad thing for a regular brush, I will continue using this for travel where a smaller size brush is preferred.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush was by far the least expensive badger hair brush I found.</li>
            <li> brush is clipped, meaning instead of selecting badger hairs of various lengths, and forming the brush, they are randomly placed and then cut, what this means for the end user experience is a prickly and harsh &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> It will change the tedious task of shaving on a daily basis to something you look forward to everyday.</li>
            <li> I am a wet shave enthusiast and have been trying to convince my son to embrace wet shaving instead of scraping his face with expensive four blade razors.  </li>
            <li> complaint is that the hairs do fall out faster than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> Not only did it seem like a disaster, I also felt completely swindled into buying a totally crap product.  </li>
            <li> Nifty little gift idea that didn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I would expect a little, but this seemed like it would probably fade to nothing if I had kept going!</li>
            <li> My son gave me a single edge razer to try l was tired of all the razor handles I have collected over time</li>
            <li> It also never completely dries between uses (daily shaver), and worst of all, I question the claim that it&#x27;s 100% badger hair because early in using this brush it shed ink everywhere</li>
            <li> &gt; - Quite a few hairs fell out during the first few uses, which was somewhat annoying, as they&#x27;d stick to my face when I&#x27;d lather my face up.</li>
            <li> It loses quite a few Bristles at the beginning, but they slow down after a while.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking to start using shaving soap or cream - you will be hard pressed to find fault with this little beauty.</li>
            <li> so it can dry brush-side down; through a couple uses since then and it hasn&#x27;t failed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this guy with a few other shaving supplies to up my shave game.</li>
            <li> so well I have to use very little soap at all.</li>
            <li> This brush started out well with very little shedding.</li>
            <li> It needs very little care/maintenance.</li>
            <li> And, it costs very little in the event you must replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although I have very little to compsre it, I find that it performs the trick of getting shaving cream to my face.</li>
            <li> Very little shedding</li>
            <li> Very little shedding.</li>
            <li> very little thought,just got it,good brush for beginners.</li>
            <li> Very little shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the finish on the handle or the adhesive, but it is not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> No stiffness to it sheds bad and cost to much for the quality.</li>
            <li> Yes its a bit small</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to accompany me while on small trips away from home.</li>
            <li> I used this brush 4 times per week for the past 2 months, and it shed all over the place from Day 1 until the end.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my brush is defective or not.  </li>
            <li> My wife requested a specific and relatively expensive shaving brush for christmas</li>
            <li> I have a few!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Merkur (German made) safety razor, Escali brush and Edwin Jagger soap bowl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past 3 months, and I must say --</li>
            <li> After using it about 3-4 times, no more hairs fell out from the brush.  </li>
            <li> Soft and builds lather like crazy.  </li>
            <li> one thing does need to be said: it is a tad bit on the small side.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a small guy</li>
            <li> and it got transferred to the brush past a lax quality control person (see picture).</li>
            <li> Im not sure where it is made</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what to compare it to.</li>
            <li> The brush is small is size to takes some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I switched to using double edge razors from the expensive cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have to re-load the brush after two passes.</li>
            <li> I use it at home as well, but I think some would find it to be too small for them.  </li>
            <li> Small size boar brush, 21mm knot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i can only give this brush three stars.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that those low expectations were met.</li>
            <li> Because of the stiffness, I was never really able to get my soap to froth up into a lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving it 4 stars because I usually keep 5th for something extra-ordinary.</li>
            <li> As such, I had no intention of buying one of the expensive brushes on here, or elsewhere, and so chose between the Escali, and the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> not sure how I had ever shaved without one.</li>
            <li> What I do is use a small disposable plastic cup to form my lather.</li>
            <li> Get a small amount of shaving cream in the cup and use the badger brush to lather it.</li>
            <li> The handle is small which you cant tell by looking at it.  </li>
            <li> I usually get the drug store variety of brushes and they don&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> While I know it&#x27;s not a top end brush</li>
            <li> This brush performs as well, if not better, than my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No more cans of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> There is no more dye washing out, and if you hang it up after shaking it out, the hair does not come out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for the past month</li>
            <li> read a few negative reviews</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming and fades with use.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is...</li>
            <li> so I am not completely sure if I should be writing a review?</li>
            <li> but I can say this is the first time I have ever been disappointed from anything I have received</li>
            <li> dog loves this damn thing, though, and it&#x27;s weird because the only time I can get her to volunteer to come across the threshold of the bathroom door is when I&#x27;m shaving as she thinks the brush is a toy for her</li>
            <li> Not many have fallen out since I eased up on the brush when making the lather.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no more smell.</li>
            <li> Further, the bristles are quite flimsy - I find it difficult to work the lather under my beard hairs.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a small amount of Gorilla glue.</li>
            <li> The hairs seem to fall out in the shaving soap, not at an excessive rate, but still...!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting for the price, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it sorta pokes and makes shaving not completely enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the stiffness of the brush but its a bit too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> Will write the seller and request a refund or credit, not sure how that&#x27;s going to work out.</li>
            <li> The hairs get in the shave cream and on the face, and presents an (albeit small) obstacle when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not many bristles come off.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison to the quality of this brush over any I have ever used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure that if that is supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is how it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this will help anyone who is shopping for a shaving brush or not.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a one time thing, but it must be 10% of the hairs out of the brush after just one use.  </li>
            <li> It loses a few hairs every shave</li>
            <li> But for a middle of the road brush, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is my technique or what, but I end up having to use it like a paint brush.</li>
            <li> I needed a small crown brush to work around my beard and moustache.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that will make sense to anyone reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am amateur at these purchases.</li>
            <li> and there is no more shredding.</li>
            <li> I had bought a chrome handled shaving brush in the past and it wasnt</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it was small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s animal byproduct or dirt from manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> Spend the few bucks and treat your face!</li>
            <li> Seems to lose at least a few bristles each time I shave, so we&#x27;ll see about longevity of life.</li>
            <li> I usually lose 1-2 bristles per shave, but I also don&#x27;t shave often</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> It may seem difficult to cut the badger&#x27;s hair with this brush, but persistence is key.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a 100 dollar brush, so it won&#x27;t make a thick lather in a few seconds, but if you take care of it (READ:</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush has a scent to it that my male cat finds irresistible.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the results were the same.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I like the handle design</li>
            <li> I realized that this was glue that had traveled up past the handle into the hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bristles still had the dirty wild animal grime in them</li>
            <li> The brush has been coarse, uncomfortable, and bristles fall out with every use.</li>
            <li> As I broke it in the usual bristles fell out every shave</li>
            <li> Not Sure about what to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing every day for the past year</li>
            <li> It was a horrendous dead animal-smell!</li>
            <li> Creates a lather not much better than the $8 Wal-mart brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the badger hair should be falling out each use.</li>
            <li> We bought this just because of the 4 star rating but my husband is not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I was unprepared for how small it would be.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the product for the money though</li>
            <li> Also wash with small amount of soap.  </li>
            <li> Others complained about the smell but out of the box (and after heavy usage for 2 weeks)</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s causing it,</li>
            <li> I had a small amount of shedding in the beginning, but nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> While this is a small brush, it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> no more cans of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Too small of a brush head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too prickly for me, and the handle is too small for my taste.</li>
            <li> I like the small size</li>
            <li> Not much more to say</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot and is too small.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they are suppose to do that</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am allergic to this brush, however I have had a badger brush in the past without any problems.</li>
            <li> If you do it this way, then you may want to poke a small hole or two in the plastic as well so that moisture can escape.</li>
            <li> The anxiously awaited badger hair brush arrived today.  </li>
            <li> Do it until there&#x27;s no more soap coming out.</li>
            <li> Kinda small.</li>
            <li> brush is extremely small.</li>
            <li> I told him how I used everyday and left it on the counter sitting on it&#x27;s base (as it is in this picture above.)</li>
            <li> No more cans of shaving cream for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Since this was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; badger brush, I was patient and eventually there was no more color loss when rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t used to shave a man&#x27;s face but woman legs, so I might (somehow) be using it wrong or differently from what you&#x27;re gonna use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another small thing was that the brush part fell of the handle.</li>
            <li> I guess I should of expected the poor quality from the price point.</li>
            <li> Is that usual?</li>
            <li> brush runs on the small side, but considering the amount of lather it can generate</li>
            <li> No more plastic razors and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> brush loses a ton of fibers, as the knot is not well-made.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are harsh, and feel like they scratch your face when you lather.&lt;br /&gt;The wood is not good quality, and starts breaking down over time if you pre-soak your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of wasting money with this, look for a $8-15 boar brush from Omega, for example.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lost very few bristles.</li>
            <li> Very few bristles fell out and it hold up quite well.  </li>
            <li> Very few hairs have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> Very few bristles have fallen out and there is no odor at all.</li>
            <li> Very few bristles are shedding.</li>
            <li> have had very few bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li> After a month of use, still feels very harsh and prickly against the skin.</li>
            <li> I got very tired of paying big bucks for 4 or 5 blade razor refills.  </li>
            <li> Very few hairs have come out.  </li>
            <li> Very few lost hairs.</li>
            <li> So far this one has shed a little, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t tired other brushes so thats why I give it 4/5.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t last long I will come back and tell everyone they are horrible.</li>
            <li> I have to say, for a first one this ain&#x27;t half bad!</li>
            <li> First, I found the brush very dirty</li>
            <li> Maybe I had a bad experience with this particular brush, but:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> So good bristles, bad base.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase, and do not be alarmed when it sheds a few at the start - perfectly normal.</li>
            <li> The clump of bristles just separated from the wooden base in a big chunk.  </li>
            <li> The handle also has a wider profile on its base, but overall the appearance remains about the same.</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out pretty frequently, not the worst I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a very good one.</li>
            <li> Not a very good brush, after 6 months of use it was still shedding, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since it has still shed.</li>
            <li> I found that the sensitivity in the palm of your hand is not very good, but you could feel differences on your forearm.</li>
            <li> Too small and hard for me.</li>
            <li> First the base of the bristles will tend to collect moisture over time.</li>
            <li> I never used a shaving brush before and am sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a common fault.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush, but perhaps at this price point I was hoping for too much.</li>
            <li> For my first 5-6 uses, I had 10-12 bristles falling out during each use, which was a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is common or not</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see how much bristles came out.</li>
            <li> bristles fell out of base after first use.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very stiff, and scratchy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a high dollar shave set, I almost did until I realized that&#x27;s just stupid.</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product, I have no idea how it has such high reviews.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this brush and anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree has not been shaving as long as I have!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not have a bad smell as I&#x27;ve noticed that some people say a new brush will.</li>
            <li> not very pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant shaving experience or quality of product.</li>
            <li> No significant amount of hairs have been lossed, and very few if any fall out now that it&#x27;s broken</li>
            <li> Poor quality even on the first use itself bristles falling off and also bad odor from the brush</li>
            <li> My brush did come with a slight smell but after rinsing continuously it has since decreased by each use.</li>
            <li> Easily one of the worst brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying to find a long badger hair mixed in the shaving cream on my face while shaving.</li>
            <li> looks pathetic next to my new brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does loose some hairs and has that weird smell out of the box</li>
            <li> The loose bristles interfere with the shaving process and are difficult to remove from the razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i actually wrapped a rubber band around the base and hang it in the shower to dry -  </li>
            <li> A very frustrating experience and my first disappointment from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> but now i hardly go a day without shaving and getting these brush hairs on my face....</li>
            <li> And even then, it&#x27;s hardly a problem, and the brush still applies the lather</li>
            <li> but when I compare brushes at my nearby AOS store, it&#x27;s hard to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s hard to beat this brush.</li>
            <li> when i took it out the smell hit me, and hit me hard.</li>
            <li> I have hardly seem any come off.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m brushing too hard, though.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re shopping for this thing, keep in mind you might need to de-odorize it, which isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li> By comparison I like the way the stiffer brush gets into the hard soaps and also how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the brush itself tends to lose bristles faster than other models I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> For the money its hard to beat along with the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> At this point it hardly lathers at all.</li>
            <li> you are looking to change-up your shaving by introducing a brush and cream to your routine then for the dollar this brush will be hard to beat.</li>
            <li> But for what it is, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Not too hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are to hard</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t overly hard against the skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> (first of all it&#x27;s not God Awful PINK!)  </li>
            <li> Now, #4 may seem like a hard task if you don&#x27;t have a brush holder.</li>
            <li> This was hard to fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving brush was hard to find</li>
            <li> Eventually, the entire &amp;#34;bundle of bristles&amp;#34; came loose from the base and had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Terrible animal smell to this brush and super stiff bristles that fall out.</li>
            <li> However, it sheds 4-5 bristles each time I use it and those end up on my face, a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not only does it shed, but after using it the bristles splayed out so bad it was almost impossible to work up a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> Dries soft and pliable again and doesn&#x27;t shed too badly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this brush, and after some non-amazon related research, found that it is listed on a \\&quot;bad gear\\&quot; list on Reddit&#x27;s Wicked_Edge subreddit, and I believe it belongs there.</li>
            <li> at least) brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I had a shaving brush that lost all of its hair like a maple tree loses its leaves in Autumn.</li>
            <li> The brush loses its hair after each use.</li>
            <li> Which is a common thing from what I read.  </li>
            <li> To say the least, he likes it.</li>
            <li> Ive been shaving with canned shaving cream for at least 30 years now.</li>
            <li> for the money, care and common sense I would recommend this brush as a beginner.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed that it loses hair alot though.</li>
            <li> I would spend at least a minute trying to get the bristles out of my lather.  </li>
            <li> It occasionally loses a hair or two</li>
            <li> He hates shaving, but now at least he can do it in style.  </li>
            <li> It foams really nicely, no issues there.</li>
            <li> Shedding was mentioned as a complaint...</li>
            <li> Loses a bit of the brush hairs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting used to it or if the bristles are softening up, but either way, it&#x27;s no longer a complaint.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost any as of late.</li>
            <li> He has used it without complaint, it&#x27;s not prickly, and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> Negative:</li>
            <li> Constantly loses hairs    </li>
            <li> I have used a synthetic brush for at least two years</li>
            <li> This brush sucks</li>
            <li> but my biggest complaint is the smell of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell of the bristles....</li>
            <li> shipping time, it came in time for a late christmas gift for myself.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is common, but otherwise it does the job like one would expect.</li>
            <li> , it loses a bit of hair with every use but that is to be expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loses some of the hairs every time it is used</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the shedding.  </li>
            <li> I had to give this a 4 in the reviews because the one I received at least, had quite a bit of fur coming out from the handle.</li>
            <li> Disconcerting to say the least.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I has done it on every use at least 4-5 hairs each time.</li>
            <li> Every time I lather up, there are at least 10-15 bristles on my face.  </li>
            <li> At least 10 to 15</li>
            <li> I lose at least a couple hairs every time after that.</li>
            <li> But it still loses bristles even after 6 applications.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Loses some hairs with every use.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews here make me giggle.  </li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what I hoped.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about a smell</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs came out, but this could be common occurrence for badger brushes.</li>
            <li> keep losing bristles which I though would stop after a day or two, but each day there is at least one or two that come out.  </li>
            <li> At $13 it&#x27;s tempting to try, but save your money and spend at least $25 for a well-made brush.</li>
            <li> at least a couple hairs form the brush</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> A month later still dropping bristles like crazy.  </li>
            <li> loses a lot of hairs every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Loses 2-3 hairs</li>
            <li> It loses a hair or two</li>
            <li> so I gave it a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;, after writing a negative review on here, the company called me and offered a replacement.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about this brush.</li>
            <li> At least in mine, I think there are some knots in the core, which is puzzling.</li>
            <li> none of late.</li>
            <li> If I could persuade anyone who is investigating wet shaving to get this brush, I assure you you will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> it seems that at least 5 of the hairs fall out when I&#x27;m applying the shaving cream to my face.</li>
            <li> Unrefined and edgy.  </li>
            <li> Loses a hair once in a while</li>
            <li> In the month I&#x27;ve used it, it loses hair with each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there is anything negative that I&#x27;ve noticed it would have to be the fact that it loses a bristle or two into the mixing bowl almost every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was skeptical but this product has turned out to be an game changer.  </li>
            <li> At least with the razor itself, I can sell it</li>
            <li> Or at least mine did.</li>
            <li> Loses bristles every now and then, but that&#x27;s probably just me breaking it in.</li>
            <li> Periodically loses a hair or so, but frankly, that is the point of shaving, innit?</li>
            <li> I found it a bit disappointing considering Tweezerman model is same price.</li>
            <li> Loses a hair or two here or there</li>
            <li> Had some shedding to start off with but that seems to have abated lately.</li>
            <li> It loses a hair or two every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I travel every week and stay at a hotel at least 3 nights a week.  </li>
            <li> but that is probably common for these types of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I managed to find my brush, and then realized I&#x27;d bought it at least 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush to dust delicate equipment.  </li>
            <li> I paid at least three times the price i paid for this item from another brand , but i could not tell the difference in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Pity</li>
            <li> I have had it for 3 months and every day when I use it, it loses 6-10 bristles.</li>
            <li> Loses hars, which then stick to the cake soap or your face as you apply shaving foam.  </li>
            <li> (at least you know it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> My brush suffers from alopecia and hair is constantly falling off.</li>
            <li> Regardless, be prepared to lose at least 3-5 hairs per shave.</li>
            <li> However the whole base fell off, because the bristles are glued in and came out.  </li>
            <li> Still working on the smell of the brush slowly going away.  </li>
            <li> The idea that I had in mind was to get rid of using my finger to apply the gel which results in unnecessary dripping / wasted gel in the wash basin.</li>
            <li> It has since, slowly disappeared.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never an issue, or annoying, really.</li>
            <li> Handle is sturdy, the bristles are thick.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly breaking in.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems getting a thick lather using the VHD soap.    </li>
            <li> The brush makes all the difference in a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Also, the copper ring seems like a decorative touch, but it should stop corrosion of the wood and bristles of the base by being a sacrificial element, much like the zinc plates on boats.  </li>
            <li> Works well, the hairs fall out slowly over time.</li>
            <li> I really thought i was going to get a crap product based on the price.</li>
            <li> Certainly not that expensive</li>
            <li> so it drys upside down to prevent the bristles from losing shape.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!!!</li>
            <li> I have always stored the brush on a hanger and rinsed it thoroughly after each use so hard to figure the cause of this failure.</li>
            <li> My first of these brushes smelled awful, lost at least 6-9 bristles per shave, and finally the glue that holds the bristles into the wooden base gave way.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The boar bristle brush did not make a very thick lather (little did I realize at the time!)</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s a brush and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or anything.</li>
            <li> It whips up a mean lather</li>
            <li> I mean it spreads shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works up a mean lather.</li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34;, I mean</li>
            <li> No more razor burn or ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to recommend this brush or this small business!</li>
            <li> Would not advise this brush at all; not sure if the problem is with badger hair, but get something softer and synthetic!</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of some of the other brushes on here, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> It works, but smells HORRIBLE for the first few weeks...</li>
            <li> Unlike some badger brushes this one wasn&#x27;t too awful musky on the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> I did to cause this failure.</li>
            <li> No other bad things to report after two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s no good for hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This brush may be the number one rated brush on Amazon, not sure how that happened, however it is an extremely poor performer.</li>
            <li> The knot (amount of hair) is very small  </li>
            <li> my sink was full of brown water - absolutely disgusting!</li>
            <li> Very small brush for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY small compared to my Omega.</li>
            <li> a side note, there is a subtle animal scent to the brush.</li>
            <li> What can I say - less expensive than the others, but works just like</li>
            <li> Now it just keeps the subtle smell of whatever soap I was using.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong for less than $13?</li>
            <li> but it is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Boar brushes are another option and are less expensive than badger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out badgerandblade.com if you&#x27;re serious about shaving or just have questions.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive shaving brush for traveling.</li>
            <li> and i,ll get some serious use out it</li>
            <li> you serious</li>
            <li> This brush is priced similar to boar&#x27;s hair brushes, which are ALL crap, so don&#x27;t torture your skin by trying to save a few nickels by buying one of them.    </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this little guy.  </li>
            <li> Sheds a bit, but not too bad, less and less as I use it.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the uncomfortable shaves with conventional razors so did some research and found a shaving system that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Third, my bathroom smells bad, which also kinda sucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was bad enough to make me dry-heave when lathering my mustache area beneath my nose.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have a bad brush but mine constant has hairs falling out every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a particularly good looking brush</li>
            <li> Not a good brush.</li>
            <li> This is because there are virtually no good badger brushes in the $10-$20 price range.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for at least a couple of months, and there&#x27;s been no indication of poor quality.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make a lather because the bristles just flop like a wet mop.. completely disappointing...</li>
            <li> Around December I decided to switch to wet shaving due to being tired of getting horrible irritation from any other form of shaving.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not good, and I am taking this brush out of my rotation.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> This is not a good brush unless you want to smell like a badger.</li>
            <li> finish on the gold ring near the base of the hairs is discolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used the brush for about two or three weeks, after going back to basics in shaving, was sick of paying 35 bucks for 6-8 blades.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see a really bad review here or anywhere online I often wonder if the product is really that bad or if the reviewer is just someone who is never pleased with ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t shed hair like crazy as other brushes that I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other artificial bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> literally smells like a dirty wet dog, and sheds like one too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard or prickly and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My first shave was not pleasant, the brush SMELLED horrible and a lot of badger hair fell off.</li>
            <li> It did have a very faint wet animal smell.</li>
            <li> At least the one I got!</li>
            <li> Overall, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a horrible odor and bristles coming out.</li>
            <li> I had an insane amount of hairs fall out in the first 2 uses.</li>
            <li> got brushed burned with face lathering :(</li>
            <li> When I did this, the watery concoction of cleaner turned a dirty dark brown, like poo-water.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened, it had a terrible smell!</li>
            <li> Overall disappointed in its quality.</li>
            <li> but hopefully that&#x27;s just the weak ones being lost.</li>
            <li> If you have very hard soaps or creams for shaving; the boar brush is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m living in a very hard water environment where lather creation should be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> like, I am very hard pressed to believe that this vendor is telling the truth when they say 100% badger hair in the product description.</li>
            <li> Stiff sharp bristles/Hair&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t make a lather for crap.</li>
            <li> Never dry it on its base.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed, really wanted a badger bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Tough to beat at this price.</li>
            <li> Who knew badgers were so tough?</li>
            <li> What a waste!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to lose a few badger hairs every time I use it, which gets a little annoying while putting on the shaving cream and picking them off my face.</li>
            <li> I guess it serves it&#x27;s purpose, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with how small it is.</li>
            <li> Well if the brush is not comfortable in your hand, or doesn&#x27;t hold lather well, or the hair the brush is made of is hard and feels like your using a wire brush then it can be a bad time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It smells really bad when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dumb founded as to how it smells so bad when wet!</li>
            <li> After decades of bad and uncomfortable shaves I bit the bullet and went to shaving with a double edge blade.</li>
            <li> Overall this brush isn&#x27;t terrible but everyday</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of pulling hairs off my face and out of the bowl.</li>
            <li> poor badger.</li>
            <li> My husband is tired of the expense of disposable razors and shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $25 - $30 a pop purchasing disposable razors from the store, so I decided to make the switch to a razor &amp; brush.</li>
            <li> Sheds worse than my cat.</li>
            <li> have paid three times this price before and got a worse brush.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a thin lather.</li>
            <li> works up an insane lather with any soap really.  </li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll see if it gets any worse.</li>
            <li> In fact,it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Just poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.  </li>
            <li> So the reason for 3 stars...........easy, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; but not great.  </li>
            <li> the worse your out of is $13 here</li>
            <li> the worse your out of is $13 here</li>
            <li> Poor critter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived in its packaging with the brush completely broken off from the handle - the glue did not hold at all.</li>
            <li> Gave it some time in hopes it was just getting broken in but after a couple of weeks it is still shedding with each shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great brush, but for $12...</li>
            <li> It is the least expensive of shaving brushing brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made with a metal ferrule at the base of the bristles and a wooden (not plastic) handle.</li>
            <li> I got a poor example</li>
            <li> then I would probably rate it closer to 5 stars as it holds up and works well now that it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
            <li> It has broken in swiftly, and works well for face lathering.</li>
            <li> Hairs are not secured well and the lather I get while using this is rather poor.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t looking \\&quot;thin\\&quot; yet, but the never-ending shedding is annoying as the coarse hairs deposited on your face can jam up your razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just poor quality I guess.</li>
            <li> Constantly having hairs fall out of the brush when I&#x27;m trying to work up a lather, which is terribly annoying :-/&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will recommend this brush to some of my friends who also want to leave hand application of shaving cream behind them.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> but I was tired of all the aerosol cans of shaving cream (gel).  </li>
            <li> The thin brass band gives it a premium touch of class.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this brush, the quality was awful.</li>
            <li> Will recommend and re purchase if unnecessary.</li>
            <li> This thing will lather up some shave creme like I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> It lathers rather poorly</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s working like a champ and nicely broken in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great brush</li>
            <li> Poor quality bristles.</li>
            <li> Every review says I am supposed to make mounds of lather with these types of brushes, but I have not experienced this at this writing.  </li>
            <li> but it is not great.</li>
            <li> The secret to using shaving soap is having a quality badger bristle brush to whip up the lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not to say that the Escali is a poor choice for everyone.</li>
            <li> It literally has 1 job, and it does it quite poorly.</li>
            <li> Feels poor quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same brush for over 10 years and knew it was time for a change when the bristles began falling out of the base.</li>
            <li> Poor lather.</li>
            <li> Poor durability.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, smells and doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was an aberration, but I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not a great experience.</li>
            <li> Thus brush leaves hair behind on your soap cake too.</li>
            <li> The brush sheds a lot until you  get it broken in.</li>
            <li> I assumed that it was the poor packaging that Amazon had chosen.</li>
            <li> Brush seperated from the handle after 2nd use worthless product save your money</li>
            <li> Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not perfect for someone else; just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the bad: this thing smells like a wet badger!  </li>
            <li> The quality is decent but in this price range they use the worst hair from the badger and the bristles are outperformed by synthetics.</li>
            <li> Floppy sloppy application.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving brush, I opened packaging everything seemed normal except for a terrible smell!</li>
            <li> too bad there&#x27;s not a provision to rate it with less than one star.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor, not too bad though.  </li>
            <li> The brush actually stinks also, like a wet dirty animal, which leads me to believe with the dye and the stink, that this is a boar&#x27;s tail brush, not badger.  </li>
            <li> Second, even my shave soap smells bad!</li>
            <li> Not too bad, but can&#x27;t compete even a little with silvertip brushes.  </li>
            <li> Should have believed the comments that it smells bad like a dead animal.</li>
            <li> My bf has been using this brush for a few months now and has not said anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> Appearance in my opinion is poor, but that&#x27;s irrelevant.</li>
            <li> But with people that stand behind its products, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really amazing by any standards, it does make lather but sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> Smells awful too, but borax and laundry detergent fixed that.</li>
            <li> The piece I received however has a chalky, carbon tinge to one side of the wooden handle that is very ugly.</li>
            <li> (at least I hope it does!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package;  I was a little bit disappointed:</li>
            <li> I stored the brush upside down so moisture wouldn&#x27;t build at the base and compromise the glue.  </li>
            <li> Items like this are simply hard or impossible to find in my hometown.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint with this brush is that it smells horrible coming out of the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying cleaning these up every time I shave.</li>
            <li> but it does get a little annoying sometimes.</li>
            <li> To get the brush to do what I think it&#x27;s supposed to do - work into my whiskers and exfoliate a little, I have to grab the base of the bristles with my fingers to make them shorter and stiffer.  </li>
            <li> So weird...</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s wrong with low-grade badger hair?</li>
            <li> Quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> ) Uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The handle was uncomfortable for me to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush was not too expensive ...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> He found this brush to be prickly and too uncomfortable to use after a month or two.  </li>
            <li> All badger brushes smell, but this is awful, did they only use the hair from the badger&#x27;s ass?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> Then after about 3 months use the glue failed and the bristles came off the handle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this crap.</li>
            <li> One cant go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> So, when I found this 100% badger brush for merely $13, it piqued my interest.</li>
            <li> If it catastrophically fails, I&#x27;ll update the review, but I don&#x27;t foresee that happening.</li>
            <li> I got tired of cold shave gels and useless canned creams.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare this to really expensive brushes because I&#x27;ve never used one, so</li>
            <li> It splays out and makes it difficult to put the soap where I want it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you cant go wrong for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;ve been using badger brushes for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I would say you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this brush.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need an expensive brush, just something that worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of the expensive Badger Shaving Brush and for the price bough two Escali brush for my son,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> compared the Escali with my expensive brush and found no difference.</li>
            <li> + reviewers can&#x27;t be wrong</li>
            <li> im sorry to say, that i regret buying this brush.</li>
            <li> on my second brush, it still smells absolutely awful and it will not go away.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the brush, but the badger hair irritates my face.</li>
            <li> I think this Escali is around a 21mm but could be wrong on that.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> He thought it was nostalgic.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Razors are so darn expensive these days and he has come to appreciate the way his grandfather shaved.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed however that a few hairs have come out of the base and into my lather.</li>
            <li> I read that you didn&#x27;t need an expensive badger brush.</li>
            <li> Well the people who said none of the hair comes off the brush, were wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry folks, you get what you pay for and this just isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Get this thing, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Van der Hagen brush fell apart about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> When it eventually wears out, as all consumables do, you&#x27;ll not be wrong to buy another at these prices if you&#x27;re not wanting to step up your quality of brush.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while without knowing that it was a mediocre brush.</li>
            <li> it is difficult to rate</li>
            <li> Could it be fake bristles colored to look like badger fur?</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail, it had a weird smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe using wrong soap.</li>
            <li> This brush meets all my expectations except one: that badger hair brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all the bristles will just fall out, but I got bored before finding an end-point to the shedding.</li>
            <li> It seems as though there are dozens at the same price-point that have awful reviews.  </li>
            <li> By the way, if you&#x27;re someone who likes expensive products like me, go with Kent.</li>
            <li> I also found it uncomfortably prickly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say he threw it away.  </li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush, it produces plenty of soap.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong .</li>
            <li> My wife bought me some fancy shaving cream which was incredibly difficult to have lather via hand application.  </li>
            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t a shaving enthusiast, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just weird.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this brush, you will be sorry if you do.  </li>
            <li> Badger brush, a not so expensive badger and this rather inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t opt for an expensive $50 brush.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the odor from the brush was overpowering.</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed, but using the Escali shaving brush has made me a convert.</li>
            <li> For the price of this brush you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> 1300 reviews can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> Basically it was completely useless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately every time I use the brush I get the bristles all in my face and the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> The finish is now peeling off of the wood - it&#x27;s a fake finish.</li>
            <li> So etching wrong - I could have returned but could not bear to repack it so put it in a trash bag, tied it up and threw it away</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the product, that while simplistic in nature, it does it&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pick between an expensive one that didn&#x27;t shed and this Escali, I&#x27;d pick the Escali.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this brush, and you will save some money from buying expensive 4 blade razor refills.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it was not until I purchased my safety razor that I had truly become a man.  </li>
            <li> Disturbingly though the Brush clump has seperated from the handle.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> All of the hairs are falling out and it is totally useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also having a difficult time working a lather up with it, which may be user error but also seems to be a design issue.</li>
            <li> However, the friend assures me that this is what you get with the cheaper brushes, and that even with the expensive ones, there will always be a hair or two that gets dislodged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OR  RECOMMEND THIS USELESS STUFF</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something in expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Avoid at all cost, its useless.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> They are on amazon and not too expensive</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here, so buy it today.  </li>
            <li> If you are making the switch to old-school shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> It definitely had a badgery musk to it, but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I found the brush had a faint odor, but not to the point it was unusable.</li>
            <li> Useless shaving brush after 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The base fell off after a few months</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t wrong here.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> and I see there are some really expensive ones out there..  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, expensive brush.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive).</li>
            <li> Kinda weird know you are stroking your face with badger booty hair j/k.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I think I used it wrong.</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> but this thing is tiny and smells awful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong,</li>
            <li> Laughable to find it on the &amp;#34;Bad Gear List&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with this one</li>
            <li> expensive brush --I</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what the really expensive brushes are doing that I can&#x27;t accomplish with this brush.</li>
            <li> Those that complain about this brush and say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; must be used to spending (wasting) a ton of money on an expensive, top-of-the-line silver tipped badger brush.</li>
            <li> :  Some other reviews say it smells bad - mine isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> it was very irritating.</li>
            <li> The rating is very poor and unusable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a very poor shaving brush...</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> very disappointing the brush spreads outward making it very messy in applying soap-</li>
            <li> I work in a very dusty environment.  </li>
            <li> I used to just dry shave which was awful.</li>
            <li> : The brush consistently loses hairs with every use which is quite annoying on the face while shaving and in the mixing bowl.  </li>
            <li> But it smells terrible, like a wet dog...</li>
            <li> It also smells terrible when wet.</li>
            <li> Besides now being rough to touch it looks absolutely awful and I no longer want to display it with my stand and razor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was part of the minority that had a brush that shed like crazy.  </li>
            <li> so I figured the damage would be minimal if it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> This brush served those needs well, it wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I would have been mad at myself for buying it if I decided DE shaving wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floppy, the hairs in it are nonexistent in the middle, feels bad on my face, and it is terrible at applying lather.</li>
            <li> Seriously, after putting soap on it, shampoo, shaving with it, still smells like crap.</li>
            <li> With that being said, there is a slight odor to the brush which isn&#x27;t too awful</li>
            <li> I have used this brush quite a few times now and am very disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> I was wary about buying this brush because of some of the bad reviews I read about its quality.</li>
            <li> I would make foam, then squeeze the brush and dirty form (brownish)</li>
            <li> Actually it stinks like a decomposing animal.</li>
            <li> It stinks as well</li>
            <li> Well, no, the hait fall out like crazy</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was unhappy with the lather my boar hair brush created, and I didn&#x27;t want to drop 60 bucks on the silvertip badger hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> And yes the hairs fall out and it stinks.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it sheds like crazy...</li>
            <li> This product is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> this brush does - every time I shave, I have to pick a dozen hairs out of the soap or off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush stinks.  </li>
            <li> or so it&#x27;s been loosing the hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> To boot, this thing stinks of animal.  </li>
            <li> Also, it sheds like crazy, ~3-6 hairs every time I shave with it.</li>
            <li> but nothing crazy.  </li>
            <li> The brush stunk, irritated my face, and she&#x27;d like crazy.</li>
            <li> and this thing is shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> some reveiws indicated that it would shed like crazy).</li>
            <li> Shed bristles like crazy after 1 year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the brush was dirty or there was badger poop in the water, but I&#x27;m guessing there is a breaking in period for the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush twice, and it is shedding like crazy.  </li>
            <li> still the hairs clump like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The smell was that of a dirty badger.  </li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy even after the &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush stinks like an animal, i.e. literally smells bad&lt;</li>
            <li> The shaving brush stinks, the badger hair must be from his butt.</li>
            <li> A few hairs have come off during use, but not too terrible.</li>
            <li> I decided to rinse it before use, and couldn&#x27;t believe how dirty the rinse water was.  </li>
            <li> this thing STINKS.</li>
            <li> but hey, for the price, certainly can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I like it cause it was affordable and hasn&#x27;t done me wrong!</li>
            <li> BOY, WAS I WRONG!</li>
            <li> I would heartily recommend this brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price point!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant odors.</li>
            <li> and I find using it unpleasant aside from the shedding.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m guessing there is a reason these aren&#x27;t very expensive compared to the ones at The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> The wood I received was actually a very expensive burl, but I would not expect that.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of VERY expensive badger brushes around, but this inexpensive one does the job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a very expensive shave brush.</li>
            <li> Without buying a holder this is impossible to do, unless you do what I did and drill a hole through the handle and tie a string through it.  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find shaving brushes in retail stores anymore.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get any shaving soap on your face because of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find quality shaving products in the retail marketplace.  </li>
            <li> well the knot fell out maybe just bad luck.</li>
            <li> But before that it looked and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Ignore the bad reviews because some hairs came out.</li>
            <li> Never scrape a spot with no shaving cream, that is bad form.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do this, you will have two bad things happen.</li>
            <li> This is about as bad of a shaving brush as I have ever used.</li>
            <li> downside is the brush will shed, but not as bad as some of the affordible brushes out</li>
            <li> nothing bad but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It still smelled bad.</li>
            <li> It still smelled bad as did my face</li>
            <li> I guess I got one of the bad products.</li>
            <li> Must have gotten a bad one that somehow passed quality control.  </li>
            <li> To bad they don&#x27;t offer an inexpensive holder to go with it-</li>
            <li> im used to bad smells</li>

            <li> biggest issue was that the hairs fell out like CRAZY!</li>

            <li> used this brush a couple times and it stinks very badly.</li>
            <li> The brush was very dirty upon arrival and needed to be thoroughly cleaned before use.</li>
            <li> Well, MY experience with this brush is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Even after shaving with this brush for 3-4 months, it was still shedding plenty of hair which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I even tried holding the base of the brush and not the handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 1 month of use the bristles broke apart from the wood base.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> They are still wrapped together and can be used without the base.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather annoying.</li>
            <li> and squeezing the water out by using my index finger and thumb to form a sphincter around the base of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Rather, the base is like an ellipse.</li>
            <li> I dont hate it.</li>
            <li> Quite annoying</li>
            <li> Do NOT put this on the base or sideways.</li>
            <li> Annoying, but you get what you pay for  </li>
            <li> I used the safety razor with canned shaving cream for about 2 months, and the difference between that and using the Escali brush is like the difference between day and night, shaving burn and smoothe skin, bloody chin and baby bottom smoothness.</li>
            <li> The smell was annoying but it is going away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely annoying.  </li>
            <li> used to hate it, now I look forward to it.</li>
            <li> I used it, causing the tension holding all the bristles into the base to decrease.  </li>
            <li> but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> This brush needs to be secured to the base of the handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> The brush sheds like crazy and has an AWFUL scent to it.</li>
            <li> you going to hate this problem of the brush loosing hair and getting stuck on your face and the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I hate to run against the grain.  </li>
            <li> I like the brush, but it does have a tendency to lose a hair or two each time I use it - which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I got an Omega 10066 boar hair brush after this piece of crap</li>
            <li> This is annoying because the bristles will stick to your face under the soap causing problems when shaving.</li>
            <li> Its annoying to have badger hair clinging to tour face when you try and shave.  </li>
            <li> Beats the crap out of aerosol shaving cream and tyne product showed up on time.</li>
            <li> I switched to a safety razor from using Gillette plastic crap for ages, and this brush makes it a pleasure.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s annoying during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered another budget brush which annoyingly shed badger hairs all over my face when trying to shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought one and stored it rightside up (as the picture shows) for about a year, not realizing this is bad for the brush!  </li>
            <li> Not the case with this Bad Boy!</li>
            <li> One of the things I hated about shaving was using shaving cream from cans.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this item and was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> leaves a brown and nasty looking residue in my soap  - hopefully this will reduce as I use it</li>
            <li> This brush sheds terribly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, the brush smelled horribly of what seemed to be formaldehyde</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> This brush runs for about $12.95 and is a horrible choice for a starter brush.</li>
            <li> brush smells horrible, literally like animal urine</li>
            <li> This brush is awful.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t produce any noticeable impact on the brush or its ability to produce lather, but it is very annoying to have a soap covered in badger bristles, and eventually this would have undoubtedly become a problem.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.  </li>
            <li> I will probably never use it again because it is very annoying to pick all the badger hair out of the soap and off my face.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Brush sheds horribly and never stopped.</li>
            <li> i hate it because hair on the brush kept coming off, even after i&#x27;ve used it a dozen times!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Terrible brush.</li>
            <li> It performed horribly for these four hours and managed to break too!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is just awful.  </li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re just getting started this isn&#x27;t a terrible place to start.</li>
            <li> and I wound up so disgusted after 4 weeks of use</li>
            <li> This could be the worst product that I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible brush!</li>
            <li> It still has an awful smell.</li>
            <li> I had never used one of these before but was told that I should on account that I get horrible ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> brush is so horrible that I would suggest buying one with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> This product is worst thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Mine sheds bristles terribly...</li>
            <li> As others have said, it sheds horribly.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s the worst smelling brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> Badgers are nasty animals and their fur is a reflection of that lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> The brush hair smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part was that the smell sticks to your face.  </li>
            <li> , this one sheds terrible!  </li>
            <li> Horrible, the hairs falling apart!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m new to wet shaving. This is my first brush. It is clearly a quality product. I understand there is a break in period and it will become softer with time. It did have a funky smell at first but that was all most gone after a few uses. I&#x27;ll update in a few months UPDATE well the knot fell out maybe just bad luck. I have an Omega boar brush now I like it better than the badger</li>
            <li> Nice firm brush and he loves it! It&#x27;s well built and a great quality. I would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Brush is good for the price. Delivery was quick. Thanks.</li>
            <li> a lot of the hairs keep coming off the brush. Decent for the price, may upgrade at a later date.</li>
            <li> It will shade a little but for the money it is way better than old brush</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Brush is made right and holds up to the job.</li>
            <li> The wife couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the baby&#x27;s bottom or my face after I used this brush! Seriously, this is a very well made shaving brush. I will recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the brush a short while but it seem of very high quality. Helps lather easily and effectively and it dries out nicely (paired with the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush stand).</li>
            <li> There are better badger brushes out there but this one comes at a great value.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and builds a great lather.  A few bristles drop off at first, but then it becomes great.  And a very nice price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush.  Very full and stands up to the whiskers.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feel. Creates a great lather very quickly. I upgraded to the from a store bought brush and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, perfect price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up pretty well but it does shed hairs every few shaves. It&#x27;s my first shaving brush so maybe that is normal.</li>
            <li> I really dislike writing negative reviews; however, I should prevent others from spending their hard-earned money on a useless product. A waste of money. The bristles fall out every time I use it and are all over the soap and my face. I believe they don&#x27;t try the product before they sell it to the public.</li>
            <li> Not the softest of brushes, but get the job done at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it does its job as a beginner brush! eventually i will upgrade to a nicer one. definitely a great starter&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and I just started with it but I feel like it will last me a long time. Bristles are firm, but not at prickly as my old one, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush ever! It provides an excellent lather and feels fantastic on the face. So much better than boar (on me at least) brushes I have used. The price is almost unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well so far! There is a little bit of an odor at first, but the construction seems good and I have recommended it to others!</li>
            <li> It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have considered purchasing a badger brush because I heard it was better than using my hands to apply shaving cream. What I heard was correct, and this brush has been nothing but a success. Now, I really do not know what makes one badger brush better from another, but I now know that this brush does the job perfectly. I highly recommend this brush to anyone who is looking at getting into the correct was to shave.</li>
            <li> Great little brush and a good price.</li>
            <li> This was my first real badger hair brush. First time using it was a real treat. Only a few hairs fell out but none have since. It holds lather well and is soft. 10/10 will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality, works well. Can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li> Working very well for my maiden voyage into DE safety razor shaving.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Price is good, delivery excellent, very pleased.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Escali 100%pure badger shaving brush is excellent, my husband is very satisfied and we received it sooner than expected. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Makes great lather and does not leave behind bristles, ever, so far anyway. Other brushes seem to shed like my dog for about a month of use before they settle down. Not as soft as this one is. Will get another to replace travel one with.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  So far no hairs have come out (a typical fault of cheaper brushes).  I notice it seems to dry out faster also.</li>
            <li> Great brush, awesome price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush to have.  It is far superior to the cheap ones I have.  I soak the bristles in a cup of hot water while I shower and then lather and shave when I get out.</li>
            <li> Second one I have purchase. First one is still in great shape after 3 years. I left it out at home while on extended business trip and it was easier just to get another. Great brush. Returns to form well after rinsing out.</li>
            <li> Simple and no-fuss brush that will do the job perfectly! Comfortable on the skin, whips up and holds a lather great. Brush was delivered promptly and in great shape. Would buy it again any time, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to for a while...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor and this is my first shaving brush, which is just to say that I am no expert and don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this to, in terms of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of research and settled on this shaving brish because of the reviews and the price (which really couldn&#x27;t be beat). So far I have no complaints. I&#x27;m quite happy with switching over to using a safety razor, and the brush works well. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or low quality at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a shaving set gift for my boyfriend. He has only used it twice so far, but it has lost a lot of bristles both times. It does lather pretty well however.</li>
            <li> Not the quality we had hoped for but not bad.</li>
            <li> The difference between waisting the extra time to use this rather than a bottle of Gillette and your hands is nil. I don&#x27;t see the point, there&#x27;s almost no difference and for the extra amount of time it takes to use, there&#x27;s no use in this for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I have not been able to find a product of this quality anywhere near this price range. Shipping was fast, and the packaging was great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 would buy again.</li>
            <li> works well, although I am new to using shaving soap and a brush was able to develop a nice foam and applied easily.</li>
            <li> A fine brush. Applies shave cream well. If you like an old fashioned shave this is superior tool.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> Really good value, really happy customer, Can.t imagine where the complaints came from.What smell?  What shedding problem? Is my nose just worn out? How can that many people that purchase  THIS brush, be THAT ham fisted? In 3 weeks, I may have dropped 10 bristles. At  this rate, I may have to buy another Escali by 2050 AD or so. (built-in- obsolescence ?) O course, since I really like the brush, I treat it gently. This brush replaced a boar brush that was about 4 months old and was so bald that I thought of it as &amp;#34;the CHEMO brush regardless of how gently I treated it, and I have smelled wet, dead, possums that were a lot more pleasant to have in the bathroom with you. Thank you Escali for a good AND inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Use it everyother day!</li>
            <li> Very good. It was delivered on time and the product is as it is explained on the website.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a year. No issues so far, held up just fine. Much better than the boar brush I replaced it with.</li>
            <li> This brush was shipped fast and in good protective packaging. Great looking and comfortable feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this brush. BUT after I received it I was impressed. Yes its a bit small but it lathers really well and fits well in the hand and is getting softer with every use. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nice first upgrade from a boar brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good beginners brush, but if you are like me and quickly throw yourself into a new hobby like wet shaving you may want to skip a step and go with a nice silvertip badger brush. Seriously though, if you are on a budget this brush is perfectly good.  I am really getting in to buying all these new wonderful soaps and creams so I really want the \\&quot;best\\&quot; experience out there and I&#x27;m tired of pulling hairs off my face and out of the bowl.I will probably upgrade to a silvertip here in the near future!</li>
            <li> A great brush! Soft,lathers well,and a great price! Highly recommend to all traditional wet shavers!</li>
            <li> Has a little bit too much shedding at start, but works great afterwards. Great purchase for 12 bucks</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush. Just the right stiffness without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> Works great! Absolutely great for shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon and it was everything that was advertised. The brush shed a little at first but that is to be expected. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great brush, especially for the price. The bristles are a little stiff at first, but become comfortably soft after a handful of uses. Early on I found a few bristles coming off, but this may have been due to me using too much pressure when lathering and applying the shaving cream. After a few weeks of less pressure I find only an occasional bristle coming loose. Overall I find the brush to hold a good amount of water, lather well, have a comfortable feel. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this product I was skeptical at the price, but when I tried I was very much satisfied. I had the closest shave I had in years.Delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> The Badger Shaving brush, is just what I wanted, and the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, just what the doctor ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Pete R.</li>
            <li> EDIT: After leaving the original review below, I was contacted by an associate from Escali letting me know they&#x27;d like to send me a replacement free of cost. I received the replacement, and it addressed both of the issues that I had below. Bristles are more sturdy and the wooden handle is unblemished. Customer service was AMAZING.  Thanks Escali. The customer service experience definitely made up for whatever defects existed on the original product.  Original: I bought the brush for two reasons. Asthetically, it looked very well designed. The piece I received however has a chalky, carbon tinge to one side of the wooden handle that is very ugly. It won&#x27;t wash off. The second reason is that the badger hair is supposedly superior to boar hair brushes. This brush has VERY soft hairs. They pretty much fail to lather up shaving cream I use.</li>
            <li> I had this for about a week, used it a good bit, and found my soap covered in what looked a hobos beard. I recommend the Omega Synthetic brush. cheap, but works as well as a quality badger brush!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic so far! What a steal at that price. Already got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. High Quality. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Maybe I had a bad experience with this particular brush, but:&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells really bad when wet. And this smell isn&#x27;t simply contained to the brush. First, my face smells bad for a few hours -- not very pleasant to have the scent of a wet dog under your nose all day. Second, even my shave soap smells bad! So weird...Third, my bathroom smells bad, which also kinda sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The bristles fall off. Copiously. Not just in my soap, but they come on my face. Even after the first use. Not very happy about that too in light of other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to try a synthetic brush now.</li>
            <li> My brush arrived just as pictured in perfect condition, a bit before the estimated shipping date. The bristles feel great on my skin, and knowing that shaving brushes can be sold for +$100 I think I got a really great deal!</li>
            <li> Another great value. Yes, I have numerous brushes. I like to switch every few days and let them completely dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I had a shaving brush that lost all of its hair like a maple tree loses its leaves in Autumn. It was part of a starter kit that I bought three years ago when I made the awesome switch to shaving with a straight edge instead of the $25 modern razors. I had some extra Amazon points so I picked this brush up because the picture looked fancy. Now, when it said it was 100% pure badger hair, call me naive, but I thought that was some gimmick name for new brush hair technology. I was not expecting it to smell like my dog. This hair is fresh off the badger. The smell eventually goes away and you&#x27;ll be thankful you went with animal hair instead of plastic. It produces a better lather, and it&#x27;s more gentle on the skin. Now that I had made the accidental upgrade I don&#x27;t think I am going back to the cheaper plastic models.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and I give it a 4 star as I am still breaking it in. It is well priced and well crafted. So far so good but I have been only using it for a week now, At the price combined with a timely delivery it is definitely value for money and gets my recommendation</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  Lifts the hairs for a great shave prep, and all using very little shaving cream.  My wallet is ecstatic.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle cracked open after a week of use - otherwise the shaving soap brush would have been fine - I did not drop the brush as it is kept in a nice holder\stand to dry - my best guess is the wood cannot stand getting wet which of course is the kiss of death since it is supposed to be used with soap and water.    Update: the company sent me a new replacement brush without me asking so upgrading to three stars for great customer service</li>
            <li> This brush is a steal.  Yes bristles do fall out, but over time that lessens.  I will buy one again in the future.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 6 months and it keeps getting better.  It lathers better now than it did when new, so it&#x27;s gonna be around my bathroom for a while longer.  After such a good experience with this brush at around $12-$13, I can&#x27;t imagine paying $50 or more for a &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> Great product use it daily!  Great brush and works like a charm with my shaving soaps.  It does the job, but make sure you use the stand that holds brush upside down to help it dry.</li>
            <li> I do not know how this brush is made, but the hair is not holding up and started to get off after few shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recomend</li>
            <li> I started with a Boar&#x27;s Hair brush and it was nice, but most (if not all) of my research suggested Badger.  So, I jumped in and ordered this Escali Badger brush.  There was a noticable difference between Boar and Badger.  This brush picked up more soap in less time, held it better and lathered up much faster.  It felt softer on my face as well.  Definitely a nice Badger brush to start out with.  I may upgrade to one of the higher end Badger brushes later on, but for now, I am extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product wold recommend it for the price. I would recommend to get a stand to dry it.</li>
            <li> I find the bristles are too soft to lather the shave cream properly. You have to actually squeeze them together to get it to lather. My last brush was silvertip Badger hair, and I think I was spoiled by it. I tried to save a little money buying this one but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I purposely waited a few weeks before writing this review. Why? Because the last two shaving brushes that I have bought (different kinds and from other sellers) have started shedding within a week or so, and then have completely come apart after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, this product has maintained its quality; not even one bristle has come off, and the brush and its base are solidly connected. Plus,this product was reasonably priced compared to similar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this a part of a requested birthday gift for my son&lt;br /&gt;along with a Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C.&lt;br /&gt;So far it has been a big hit as I get detailed critiques of each&lt;br /&gt;day&#x27;s shave by telephone.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as my CVS Pharmacy brush but this one does not shed hairs and the price is the same.</li>
            <li> There are many better options available if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap brush. First, this brush sheds like crazy. It&#x27;ll make your soap resemble the bottom of a urinal after a hairy guy takes a leak. Also, it&#x27;s scratchy. I prefer to face lather and doing so wasn&#x27;t super pleasant with this brush. Don&#x27;t let the fact that it&#x27;s badger sway you. If you&#x27;re starting wet shaving I&#x27;d just go with a cheap synthetic omega brush and then upgrade to a nice badger brush if you feel the need.</li>
            <li> Brush performs very well at a very good price</li>
            <li> Good brush. A few strands fell out at first, which I&#x27;m sure is expected. But otherwise a dense and tight brush.</li>
            <li> Soft and lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is how the bristles seem to dry more flared out than I&#x27;m comfortable with even hanging upside down to dry. We&#x27;ll see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> Very soft and provides a great lather, feels great on the skin when you are using it.</li>
            <li> The brush loses its hair after each use. Not sure if this is only at the beginning of its use and that it will subside but will know after about another week. Will wait for another couple of weeks to make my final decision on this product.</li>
            <li> Great brush, nicely finished wooden handle, performs on a par with more my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this recently. He really likes it. He says it builds a nice lather. It&#x27;s his first brush of it&#x27;s kind and he&#x27;s pleased.</li>
            <li> Having just completely revamped my shaving approach, I was in need of a brush which would be dependable, provide a rich lather, and have an exceptional quality for value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BRUSH YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful lather (like a lemon meringue pie), dries well on side.  A few natural bristles come off the first few uses, but nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop, Collaborate, and Listen:  Buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to accompany me while on small trips away from home. I was expecting this to be a bit smaller, but only the wooden base portion was smaller. The brush head is large and thick. I used it for the first time at home to see what type of lather it would produce and to my surprise, it was a lot thicker than my normal brush. In addition, it took less time to produce a rich and thick lather. I ended up using my original primary brush as my trip brush and now exclusively use this Escali Pure Badger Brush at home. No regrets!!</li>
            <li> Builds a good lather and is not expensive... will buy another when or if I wear this one out. word</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple months now and it is holding up great. Maybe 6-10 hairs have fallen out over that time but I figure that is to be expected. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. Taking care of the brush properly is key.</li>
            <li> Of the shaving brushes I&#x27;ve tried -- boar, horsehair, and badger -- badger is clearly the best, making the brush from Escali the best of the best. Whereas I&#x27;ve found boar bristles somewhat stiff and horsehair unpleasantly fragrant, badger brushes are properly soft, spread the soap evenly, and clean easily. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second Escali badger shaving brush for travel and may buy one or two more as replacements for when I wear these out. I highly recommend this product for choosy and experienced shavers who want to pamper their faces for a proper and perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I previously used a plastic-handled, 100% boar hair brush. I haven&#x27;t used this badger brush for very long so I can&#x27;t attest to its durability, but I can absolutely say that its bristles are softer and more comfortable to use, and its wood handle is also more pleasant to look at than my last brush. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush, with a wet shaving cream is a dream.  Foams nicely, spreads evenly and great to clean.  I love using this thing!</li>
            <li> Glad I finally decided to shave like a man with a brush. Makes a world of difference. Make sure to dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> Great value! This is a great brush for a safety razor beginner.</li>
            <li> The Escali Badger Brush provides a great shaving experience.  The brush holds lather quite well and spreads it smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works as expected.  received as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to all this traditional shavin stuff. I only have a couple months&#x27; worth of wet shaving experience. Also, I dinthva e experience with &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; stuff. I primarily started this on a low budget and did it to save money. I can&#x27;t justify $4 + per shaving cartridge! Since then, I have come to LOVE the whole experience. All I&#x27;ve used so far is a boar hair brush and some cheap soaps. When I found a pure badger hair brush for this price point $12-$13 as if this writing), I figured I would try it out. Not having anything else to compare it to, I WILL say it blew me away!!!!!!!!! There is absolutely no comparison I can make between boat hair and badger hair. Worlds of difference! The lather is ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the brish itself, it smelled a little at first. I hear its super common. It went away after a while. Also, the hairs were a little pokey. But it lifts the beard and produces a lather that is just unreal! Perfect and creamy! Dense and lush. If you are wet shaving on a budget like I am, DO IT! I hope they stay in business for many, many years to come!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a super happy customer!!</li>
            <li> really good brush. does loose some hairs and has that weird smell out of the box but all animal brushes smell. overall for the price this thing is awesome. don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews, it&#x27;s under $15...</li>
            <li> This brush makes the shaving process much easier.  I used this brush daily for over a year along with Proraso Shaving Soap. I found it the best combination for a good shave. It will wear out, but the cost is reasonable and a great value for the price. This shaving combination is more economical and a much better shaving experience than the many shaving creams available.</li>
            <li> This brush is good quality.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it works very well with the cream.</li>
            <li> I really havn&#x27;t used it yet.I&#x27;m saving it  when we travel.</li>
            <li> High quality badger brush for a great price. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I would say you get what you pay for, but there are brushes of better quality for around the same price. Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re serious about wet shaving; it will turn you off quickly. It starts out prickly and doesn&#x27;t really get better; instead of gently working lather into my skin I felt like I was scratching my face every time. It got slightly better with use, but still scratches more than a quality brush should. It sheds like crazy; this is common in many brushes at first, so I gave it a while. But no, it still sheds. I find hairs in my soap and on my face even after a dozen uses. Just save yourself some headache and buy a better brush; I did. Oh, on the plus side, it holds lather pretty well. Only reason for the second star.</li>
            <li> Great Brush have used for a week now and find this Brush works superbly, Can&#x27;t go wrong with this gem, Lather&#x27;s the soap so well I have to use very little soap at all. Easy to clean , Shake to Fluff &amp; Dry . Highly recommend. Definitely 5 Stars....</li>
            <li> As a first time shaving brush user I had no idea what to get, but I knew I wanted something affordable and yet still will good quality. If that sounds like you, look no further than this brush. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first badger brush, so take my comments with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good price&lt;br /&gt;-Makes shaving foam just like it should&lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t lost too many bristles and looks like it will last for a good long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-NOT super soft. When brushing on my face it&#x27;s kinda prickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Was definitely a bit dirty when new. I would make foam, then squeeze the brush and dirty form (brownish) would come out of the middle of the brush. I would then wash and repeat. After about 5-10 cycles it finally looked and smelled super clean. But before that it looked and smelled bad. Is that typical? I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s clean now so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been storing it on a rack, bristles down just as people say you should. I think that helps preserve the integrity of the brush. But then again who knows?</li>
            <li> good solid shaving brush. I use it with c.o. bigelow shave cream and it makes a nice lather and a nice close shave with my DE parker razor</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, effective.  This brush does the job well.  Nice lather, comfortable (no pricking me with stiff whiskers).  It fits nicely in my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor Stand along with my Merkur 180.  I&#x27;ll check back in a few months to review the durability, but so far, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs here and there, but this brush makes me feel like my cool as all get out pop-pop for a great price. I&#x27;ll let you know if it stands up to abuse.</li>
            <li> Way better than my last two boar brushes. Very good at retaining water and making a smooth even foam to shave with.</li>
            <li> I heard that a badger brush would enhance my shaving experience so I decided to give it a try.  I had no idea how good it would actually feel.  Now when I&#x27;m done shaving it feels like my face is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brush is a great value.  The quality is good, not excellent, but it&#x27;s the best brush you can buy at this price point.  It&#x27;s easy to fill the brush with shaving cream, and it&#x27;s also easy to wash it out completely after use.  The brush dries quickly and very few bristles have fallen out or escaped the main group.  I expect this brush to last a while (at least I hope it does!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!! I&#x27;m buying one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is holding up nicely. Doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant odors.</li>
            <li> For this price I expected a nice, fairly stiff shaving brush that would hold it&#x27;s bristles.  Its really soft, and after three shaves its still shedding.  If you like really soft shaving brushes and don&#x27;t mind the shedding, it will do you fine.</li>
            <li> There were quite a few brushes out there to choose from when I chose this one.  The brushed arrived promptly and was packed quite well.  The quality of the materials used is high and I really liked the wood handle.  After using the brush for almost 3 weeks it has worked well with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This brush is essential for the application of any form of shaving cram or soap. Sure there are more expensive brushes, but for the price this one seems well constructed with a smooth wooden handle. I personally prefer the coated wooden handles to any metal or variation of style. Recommended!</li>
            <li> my husband says it works fine</li>
            <li> Great product.  My husband needed a narrower brush and I ordered this for him.  It is perfect and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Great seller. Fast shipping. More than I Expected. Would recommend. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very soft after you soak it a few times just before use. The best way to get apply shave soap for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush and very cheap quality as expected. Does not work for me.</li>
            <li> A very nice little badger hair brush.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t entiry impressed with this brush. He said it didn&#x27;t spread his shave cream around smoothly or well enough. But obviously gets the job done. He&#x27;s a little bummed so we&#x27;re still on the search for a reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft little shorter than I thought.</li>
            <li> No complaints. I mean it&#x27;s a brush and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or anything.</li>
            <li> This being my first shaving brush my experience is very limited. The brush seems solid however, and I enjoy using it. Lathers the shaving cream up well, and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin. Great brush for daily use.</li>
            <li> I am using this brush in my first adventure in wet shaving and I like it a lot.  The brush holds lots of moisture and is very easy to make a nice lather.  It feels nice on the face and after about 4 weeks has only lost a few bristles.  At about 15 bucks I definitely recommend trying out this brush!  I use a 2 dollar medium sized Ramiken from Target as a shave bowl and it stands up on the side perfectly for drying with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could say a shaving brush is a shaving brush is a shaving brush.  But hold on: this brush is well made, is not too expensive, it applies soap exceeding well and the handle nicely fits the nifty brush and razor holder I bought at the same time.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is: it&#x27;s a shaving brush, for Pete&#x27;s sake...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of aerosol cans and steadily increasing prices of replacement blades from the company who gives away the razors (you know who I mean) entering the slightly arcane world of shaving brushes, mugs and safety razors has been entertaining, to say the least.  And the service provided by Amazon and Perella&#x27;s has made the journey that much easier.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a brush and soap, but I can say that I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. After a few uses, basically to get any loose hairs out, the brush works really well. It lathers up soap in a very short time (about 30 seconds), holds moisture within the hairs, feels great when applying the lather and cleans very easily. Overall, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is a mid line shaving brush and preforms as that. It provides an excellent lather and doesn&#x27;t cost to much. The only complaint is at first, some hairs were falling out. After its broken in that rarely happens, and the brush preforms to my expectations. If your looking for a good brush, but don&#x27;t want to pay to much, look no further.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Have used it for 4 weeks and like it better every day.  Makes a nice crema and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  Badger is the way to go and this brush meets the need at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This brush with the safety razor is the way to go. I switched a month a go and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush with natural badger bristles. My husband loves the &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; of shaving again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent. Brush is well made and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> nice brush,really lathers up the cream, AAA+++++++</li>
            <li> Great quality. My son loves it.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality. I have used it 5x a week for 2 months now and it is still as soft as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush worked just as desired.&lt;br /&gt;Great first badger shaving brush! ~ The Boss</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole shave soap, brush, and safety razor shaving. I love it tho and will never go back to the expensive multi-blades again. This brush is well built and helps create a good lather with the soap I use. A few hairs came off on the first couple of uses but I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The escali badger brush is 100% functional and the price is right. The bristles have started to fall out much earlier than I would have liked (1st use I had a few on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than having to deal with the few bristles of badger hair on my face though it&#x27;s basically as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are a little softer than I would prefer, but other than that it is great. I have used it daily for about a month with no issues. It is well put together, and at less than half the cost of most of the other brushes on Amazon, it was a solid buy.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, with soft bristle firmly seated in the brush (so they don&#x27;t come off on your face or in your shaving soap bowl.  It works the soap into a great lather quickly and makes applying the foam smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush~~~</li>
            <li> I say this is only &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; at this point because I&#x27;ve only used the brush 2-3 times.  It has lots a few bristles which is a little surprising compared to other badger brushes I&#x27;ve used, but we&#x27;ll see.  I will come back and update in a month.  Thanks for the fast service and I look forward to continuing to use the brush.  Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> A very nice brush. I&#x27;m enjoying it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent, and just what I expected from a Badger Brush</li>
            <li> We should start off with a little terminology. When you see terms like &amp;#34;100% badger hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Pure badger hair&amp;#34; in shaving brushes, that isn&#x27;t saying that it&#x27;s the only type of hair in the brush, but rather those terms refer to the grade of badger hair being used. In this case, the lowest grade. The misconception is that with an Escali you&#x27;re getting a quality badger brush at a fraction of the price, but you&#x27;re really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s wrong with low-grade badger hair? It&#x27;s prickly, and can irritate your skin. If you already have sensitive skin and struggle with ingrown hairs, this brush will not help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you shave with this brush? Absolutely, and I did for months before I learned of much better options in a comparable price range. You will get by, until you learn of what can be had, and then you won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should you look for instead? Boar hair. While boar hair isn&#x27;t quite the quality of a good silvertip badger brush, it blows the Escali out of the water in performance and is surprisingly cheap. There is a break in period, and once you&#x27;re through that, you will have a fine brush that will be much softer and will build a much better lather than the Escali ever will. There are two main brands that make very good boar hair brushes that can be purchased in the $10-25 range, and those are Omega and Semogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I find a boar hair brush? I don&#x27;t recommend buying a boar hair brush off of Amazon, as there are other vendors that sell them at better prices. A quick google search of &amp;#34;Omega boar brush&amp;#34; will bring you many options. I won&#x27;t name any specific vendors in order to remain free from accusation of marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where can I learn more? One of the best sources for learning about wet shaving is the &amp;#34;wicked_edge&amp;#34; sub on Reddit. Many people share their own experiences with different products, and I myself have learned a great deal there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to comment with anyquestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Even after shaving with this brush for 3-4 months, it was still shedding plenty of hair which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I wanted to start shaving again without using the stuff in the aerosol cans.  This brush has been good to lather up with.  It&#x27;s a great beginner&#x27;s brush.  It arrived ahead of schedule &amp; the price a good deal as well for a brush made with badger hair.  I would highly recommend buying this brush if you want to start shaving the old fashion way again.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. You have to compare with products in same range of price!</li>
            <li> Great brush holds up well.  Shake it out and hang up. (down)</li>
            <li> This shaving brush feels great and performs well.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I also changed to Proraso shaving soap when I started using this brush, so I can&#x27;t directly attribute the awesomeness of the lather to them individually, but as a pair. I have no doubt when I wear this brush out, I&#x27;ll get another one identical to it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT LINE AND RECOMMENDED TO ALL OTHERS</li>
            <li> Very quickly received as a gift for a friend. He really enjoys it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try out wet shaving with a safety razor. I did a research on brushed boar vs badger vs synthetic.  I opted out for the badger since it holds and retains water better.  Which it does.  The brush did not smell until you first dip into water.  Which is a common thing from what I read.  Due to the chemicals to treat the hair bristles.  I just dunked the brush with water and a bit of vinegar and stopped that smell.  Once I used it with the Proraso Shaving Cream I did not notice a smell.  The brush was excellent for lathering the soap and felt smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok for the price. It seems to lose a few badger hairs every time I use it, which gets a little annoying while putting on the shaving cream and picking them off my face. Other than that, it&#x27;s still better than a synthetic brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty sturdy and hasn&#x27;t seemed to lose much hair after about 4 weeks of use. My husband likes the way it feels on his face.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do without losing any of the hair. I would buy again. A good buy.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush builds a great lather.  It is everything I was hoping for in building my shave kit.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a brush and soap recently and after reading the reviews I decided to splurge and get this brush. It does a good job of making a nice lather, but every time I shave 3 or 4 bristles come out and stick to my face. Quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st Escali, but my 2nd brush I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Escali is a great little brush for the price. I had some bristles fall out but after the initial use, I haven&#x27;t had any more come out. I&#x27;ve probably used it 30-40 times with none coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that there are better brushes on the market, but if your just starting out, and want something inexpensive, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father on Father&#x27;s day. To say the least, he likes it. Normally he uses typical shaving gels, but I bought this along with some shaving soap. He doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but I know he uses it whenever he shaves and has no complaints.</li>
            <li> My fatger saiid he needed a new shaving brush and I decided to look for a good one online. Bought this one because of the reviews and he said its okay. Good, like any other brush he had before.</li>
            <li> Product was received as advertised. Works great. I enjoy my shave so much now. Got one for my dad as well for Father&#x27;s Day and he likes it.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon after checking out \\&quot;Fine\\&quot; department stores and specialty shops. This brush is as good as any of the ones I saw  for 3 to 5 times the price. Like anything, you have to take care of it, but if it hadn&#x27;t lived up to my expectations, my wallet wouldn&#x27;t have taken a beating like the more expensive brushes. Fortunately it&#x27;s met my expectations and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before I got this one but to me it seems just fine and dandy. I like using this with shaving soap and a razor that I can change the blade out with. I get just as close a shave or closer that I did before with a can or cream and disposable razors. What a waste!!! I feel that this will last me for a very long time and I won&#x27;t have to throw as much away.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush and as an intro into wet shaving, it leaves much to be desired. Now that I&#x27;ve purchased a boar&#x27;s hair (Semogue 620) I realize what a waste of money it was to be cheap and buy this brush. As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve used this brush almost every day for a full month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2) Creates good lather (badger brushes are generally easier at creating lather than boar. But an average boar brush will scrub better unless you go with high end badger brushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sheds constantly! I&#x27;ve used this brush for about a month now and it constantly sheds a couple of hairs with every single use. It sheds in my soap dish when I gather soap and sheds on my face when I apply the lather. A month later and it&#x27;s still shedding.&lt;br /&gt;2) No backbone. I hadn&#x27;t realized until I got my boar brush recently, but this cheap badger brush has no backbone. It doesn&#x27;t provide any scrubbing action to lift your whiskers because the hairs part too easily once it touches your face. I even tried holding the base of the brush and not the handle and it didn&#x27;t make much difference.&lt;br /&gt;3) Uncomfortable. The handle was uncomfortable for me to hold. That may differ for other people. YMMV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;The only people that would consider purchasing this brush would be someone new to wet shaving. So to these people, I say to stay away! Spend an extra $5-8 and get a good boar brush, that will last you a long time (my Escali is on permanent display).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why cheap boar is better than cheap badger:&lt;br /&gt;1) I believe almost all boar brushes have good scrubbing action to lift your whiskers and exfoliate your skin&lt;br /&gt;2) Improves with each use, the ends naturally split over time. This makes the boar start to feel  softer at the ends like the high end badger brushes, but maintains the stiff spine for good scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;3) My Semogue brush hasn&#x27;t shed any hair since the first day I used it. There was maybe 2-3hairs lost in the first day when I was washing it, but haven&#x27;t shed since.&lt;br /&gt;4) Low cost. It only costs an extra $5-8. Some of the best boar brushes cost $40-50 (vs $100-200 for silvertip badger brushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I read the B&amp;B forums earlier to learn that a cheap boar is substantially better than a cheap badger. Would have saved me $15...</li>
            <li> I am getting into shaving with a blade again and a good shaving brush is just as important as good cream.  This one is great, though I wasn&#x27;t sure why it needed to be from a badger.  Keeps its shape, lathers well.  Generally very cool  part of the mystique, I guess.  Came quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Product as described and high quality for the price point.  If you have very hard soaps or creams for shaving; the boar brush is the way to go. But this is the one to use for most shaving applications; much softer than boar hair.  Can think of any negatives on this; even the longer term reviews have shown this one to hold the hair in the brush for a long life. Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> Most brushes have a period of shedding that subsides after a few uses; this one is still shedding after 2 months of use. Other than that, it does the job well: It holds soap better than my starter brush, has a good weight to it, and washes out easily. Maybe my experience is the exception and not the rule, but I&#x27;m still finding badger hairs all over the sink after a shave.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to endurance, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I was usin a edwin jagger before this. at was 8 times the cost. I just got this to try. was not expecting alot..&lt;br /&gt;it came pretty well put together. feels sturdy. used it about 5 times. glad to report it is giving me about 80% of the feel and satisfaction that my older brush. and it is only 12.5% of the price i paid for the other one. Winner!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used a brush in a while, just got back to using a traditional shave setup and this brush is perfect.  Great quality, bristles have nice feel and do the job of getting your face setup for a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Ive been shaving with canned shaving cream for at least 30 years now. Decided to try the old brush and bar. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked. It&#x27;s superior to shaving cream in every way. First I\\&quot;ll use some hot water on it and wet my face that way. Then I&#x27;ll mix it with the bar of shaving soap. It&#x27;s a great shave, great feel and I know I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving cream again, plus I can fly with it - whereas you can&#x27;t bring canned shaving cream carry-on, you can bring a shaving brush, mug, and soap.</li>
            <li> This brush was not too expensive ... But it is loosing it bristles after only about one month use. The bristles could be a little softer ??</li>
            <li> Ordered this as part of my introductory kit to DE shaving. Lost quite a few bristles in the beginning, but it&#x27;s worn in pretty well, and I tend to get pretty good lather out of it. Well worth it in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as my first shaving brush and I am satisfied with it.  I did notice a very few brush hairs fall out after about 3 uses, but after about 1 month worth of use it is still holding up.  I am using a Frank Shaving Chrome brush and Razor Shaving Stand #35 to hold the brush.  I took it with me during my vacation and it did not take much room in my toiletry bag since it is not bulky.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush Very well priced and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It will shed, but for the price its good.</li>
            <li> Good brush. No issues</li>
            <li> Has been a good experience so far.  I have been using a pig&#x27;s hair brush for the last year.  Before that I had used my Grand Father&#x27;s brush, that would be over 100 years old.  I lost it in my luggage from an airline baggage problem and needed to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pig&#x27;s ear was OK, but the feel wasn&#x27;t the same.  (you would have to have used one)  Your&#x27;s replaced the needs so far very well.  ln a couple of years ask me again.  If it&#x27;s as durable as one that&#x27;s 100 years old, then it was a great  bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped immediately.  With no hassel..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try other brands before I buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my friend but he has made no complaints! ;)</li>
            <li> A little stinky.  Maybe my badger didn&#x27;t have good personal hygiene.  I also don&#x27;t know what region of the badger this came from.  For what you pay, it&#x27;s a good value.  Next time I&#x27;m going to spend a little more and get a little more.  Like a well-groomed badger.</li>
            <li> I used this brush 4 times per week for the past 2 months, and it shed all over the place from Day 1 until the end. I threw it away last night. Unless you like brushes that shed, avoid.</li>
            <li> Brush is still shedding a lot after a dozen shaves.  Not sure if my brush is defective or not.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t shed to nothing.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving I was not looking to invest in an expensive badger brush right from the begining.  After looking around I came across this Escali badger brush. I was really holding me breath wondering what you kind of badger brush you get at this price.  Let me say that this brush is way beyond my expectations.  It works up a nice smooth lather, holds a lot of moisture and with continued use feels delightful on the face.  The shedding I was expecting from a lower end brush was actually minimal. One thing I have learned about shaving brushes is you must dry them  upside down on a stand or at the very least on it&#x27;s side.  Otherwise the brush well prematurely fall apart.  I am pleased with this purchase.  The bang for your buck is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He states he likes it very well. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush at a very good price. Im new to wet shaving with a double edge razor, and this brush makes it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price!</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described, well made product.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving brush! Really exfoliates the skin and feels great every morning. Wonderful badger hair softness .&lt;br /&gt;A great brush at a great price, do get the stand to keep it perfect and ready to go each day.A++</li>
            <li> Soft yet sturdy brush.  Well made!</li>
            <li> Its a pretty stirdy little brush. I have only recently started using it, so I&#x27;m waiting for the loose hairs to fall out but overall It does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and arrived quickly. Would do business with again</li>
            <li> great item, does not shed like some I have used in the past .</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for a while now and the Escali brush is easy to recommend. The bristles are high quality and do not fall out under regular use. Also, the badger bristles do a great job preparing the skin and creating lather, which is just what you want when shaving. For the price, it is very good quality.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as pictured and came on time to surprise my hubby with on Valentine&#x27;s Day (not easy to find these in stores). He&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles starting to come out a little when I first used the brush, but for the price this brush is infinitely better the the standard drug store shave brush and soap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problems others have posted.  It softens noticeably after several uses.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> ... But I docked it one star because it does seem to lose more hairs than my last brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month at this point, and I&#x27;d expected the hair loss to taper off. It has somewhat, but not entirely.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating, because my opinion is positive, but I don&#x27;t have experience with other brushes to use superlatives.    I got a cup from the kitchen and cut a bar of Lever 2000 soap and put in the bottom.  The other pieces I shaved down and crammed in around to fill the spaces between the edge of the cup and the big piece.  Purists will cringe.  However it has many of the same ingredients as expensive shaving soaps.    I get a good lather from the brush.  I made a stand from some heavy #10 wire and hang it to dry with the bristles down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but was surprised by how quickly this brush fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1 month of use the bristles broke apart from the wood base.  I superglued the tuft back in but it only lasted another week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Col Conk&#x27;s which requires a bit more vigorous whipping but I also use Proraso tube soap as well which doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be looking for a better product and different brand!</li>
            <li> A good brush at a great price. Lathers up my shaving soap better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my boyfriend, hes very happy with it</li>
            <li> My first brush. It works well, and does not have any problem with excessive bristle loss as customers have reported for other products. For the price, I can&#x27;t imagine a better deal.</li>
            <li> The product was a gift for my husband. It is exactly what I expected and he loves it! The price is great and so is the quality.</li>
            <li> Great choice for the best shaving decision I&#x27;ve ever made.  the bristles are stiff but soften nicely in water and work great to lift every whisker.  solid feel and quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison to a pure badger shaving brush. It really spreads the lather well for a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for a family member. The report I got back was it was great.</li>
            <li> My husband used it one time and it fell apart! Trying to see if I can return but can not find anywhere to do that!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice badger brush. Its not very expensive so if you are new to the badger brush game I would highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Super fast delivery. Very happy with purhase</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s probably better brushes out there, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good beginner brush, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t keep losing it, but I absolutely love this brush. Soft, and effective.</li>
            <li> My wife requested a specific and relatively expensive shaving brush for christmas and I thought I would get my self one too so I bought one of these.  I really like my Escali brush.  I detect no unpleasant odors, it does a great job of making lather and it is definitely soft enough for me.  After looking at my wifes brush, while it is very nice, I dont think I see  a $60 difference and with some good shaving soap I am really shaving better than ever.</li>
            <li> I have waited a few weeks to review to insure that the brush stood up well and it has.  This is my first experience using a brush to shave and it has been a good one.  Brush is holding up very well. easy and quick to clean up. no shedding. good price</li>
            <li> my last brush worked for many years. then it started to molt. a big tuft of hair decided to leave in the middle of a lather,so, it was time to retire it. my new brush is all that a person could ask for. it is reasonably priced with a good feel.</li>
            <li> great value for great product</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t lose to many bristles - been using it for almost a month and it has only lost a couple here and there.  I have been happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Product works great but is a little stinky when used with warm water.  Smell must be badger musk.  Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it sheds as much as some reviews indicate, at least in my experience.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and yes it sheds a little but overall it seems to be a pretty good brush and does the job.  Someday I&#x27;ll upgrade to a silver tip brush but for now this one works.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and  gives me a full lather on my face and it&#x27;s so easy to clean after!wards !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and bought this as my first shave brush.  I purchased for the value but I wish I just went ahead and bought a nicer one from the start.  After maybe 10 uses it is already loosing hairs all over the place.  It works but having to pick hairs out of the lather is less than ideal.  I&#x27;ll be buying a nicer brush now.</li>
            <li> Works great, I look forward to using each time I shave</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since his last one had lost too many bristles.  He has been using it for about a month and has really liked it.  It has lathered well and shedding hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  Highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you need - a quality badger brush.  Holds enough lather for 3 passes, bristles are nice and soft (though they take a few weeks to get fully softened up).  You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> good quality for a hard to find item</li>
            <li> Feels good, works well. The hairs hold on it, though a couple fall out which is to be expected. In all I feel this product will last a while.</li>
            <li> This is my first endeavor into DE shaving. As such, this is my first shaving brush so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. The brush does exactly what I expect it to do and cost a good bit less than the \\&quot;next level\\&quot; up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soft to the touch&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the counter in the stand I got&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be fairly sturdy now that it has shed out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shed a lot for the first few uses&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like the soft/light wood look but again, cost a lot less than the nicer brushes out there&lt;br /&gt;- the indenture is a bit too high up for me and can be somewhat awkward to hold when I am creating a lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you shampoo it several times when you first get it to get rid of any lingering scents.</li>
            <li> This brush does loose a lot of hair initially, but a great brush overall. I would recommend this brush to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! First use had a bunch of hairs come out but it stopped after that. I&#x27;ve had two high end brushes also do the same to me. Ignore the bad reviews because some hairs came out. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Supurb product and value, excellent service.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little stiffer than I expected, but there are no loose ones and there hasn&#x27;t been any shedding. It dries well and applies an even layer. A good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve admired straight blade shaving for years and have always heard about the better shave a shaving brush offers. It&#x27;s all true! However, if you are looking for a shave brush (for a straight razor or a regular, safety blade) be sure to get BADGER hair. It stays soft through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Has significantly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Great value given its economical price.</li>
            <li> You usually get what you pay for, but aside from a few loose bristles that fall out after the first few uses, you get a stellar deal when purchasing this item. The shaving brush works a lather very easily and will save your shave time for actually enjoying your shave. Aside from a few stray bristles, I have no real complaints other than it floats in water, so it&#x27;s kind of tough to soak.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is nicely made, but the bristles themselves have a foul animal smell, even after using it 4-5 times. I&#x27;ve never had a badger bristle brush that smelled like this one. It may speak for the imported source, possible China.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it first time water turned brown and it has lost a lot of bristles. It is quite soft which is nice but I preferred my Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have (2) of these brushes, one at work/office and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with traditional shaving soaps or just your standard&lt;br /&gt;canned shaving gels or foam products. Enhances shaving experience.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this brush works well. It&#x27;s lost a hair when I used it the last couple of times, but that&#x27;s the only thing that has annoyed me.</li>
            <li> Part of the bottom chipped off almost immediately after using.  Water got in and the bottom&#x27;s turned a dark grey with moisture damage.  I would look elsewhere were I to purchase another shaving brush.</li>
            <li> ok for the money.  hair comes out of the handle</li>
            <li> When I switched back to shaving soap, I purchased the Escali.  I am very pleased with it and can recommend it.</li>
            <li> best brush i have, will be getting more</li>
            <li> hair comes off it easily so it&#x27;s not the best quality</li>
            <li> Excellent! Exactly as specified and works perfectly. I feel so classy!</li>
            <li> Great bush! I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and it&#x27;s lost very few bristles.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and nice people to work with.Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great Brush!  Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... Still leaving five stars and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this brush three seperate times so I always have one on hand when needed. My first one has lasted OVER A YEAR and is still used in my travel kit!! Love these brushes!  My third one that I recently purchased had flaws in the handle that was causing water to soak in... not a big deal these things rock!  Contacted the company and they refunded my money immediately. Still a five star brush in my eyes. Customer service is just a solidifying factor in why I&#x27;m updating my review but leaving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Came in good time. Not loosing any bristles after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Usually when I purchase something I go right to the bad reviews and see if there is a consensus. There were a few. Most of which complained about quality and hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the brush pretty fast so I have no complaints about the company I bought it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing, for what I paid for this it is actually great. As a first brush it is a great starter. I have used it about a dozen times and with time it has been getting softer. Which is what you will read on any review about a badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no warping. Honestly l think who that happenhappens to are the people that don&#x27;t store it properly. When buying something that could be of less quality, not saying this is, extra care needs to taking. I try to dry it out as good as possible and hang it bristles down. It is wood and if wood soaks it will warp. I guess common sense.and can leat to most of the issues I read on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the money, care and common sense I would recommend this brush as a beginner. Which is what I am.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought so I don&#x27;t have any good comps.  Good value for your average guy.</li>
            <li> A great brush for the price. A few bristles came out, but if you buy a stand then this brush will hold up fine. A really good value!!</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Works well.  Don&#x27;t see why anyone would pay over $100 for a brush when this is just as good.</li>
            <li> New to the DE shaving scene - I have used my brush for about 2 weeks now and a couple hairs have fallen out. No biggie. No hairs would have been a 5 star blessing. It is like a paint brush for me and with the shave cream, i paint it on the spots ready for the razor. I really like setting it down on the flat base, hairs up/still with later, in case i need to touch up a spot i missed. Never scrape a spot with no shaving cream, that is bad form. One thing i do like about the brush, is doing a circular scrubbing motion that ensures i have worked the shaving cream into my whiskers - in doing that, there is a slight prickly feeling i really like. No pain of course, it is just that signal you are doing things right. Plus, let&#x27;s face it, it looks kinda cool as opposed to slapping that stuff from a can on your mug. I wash mine out, dab it on the towel to take out the excess water, smooth the hairs out to keep the original shape and hang it back in the rack, not rack - that was unjust, the &#x27;double edged razor and brush cradle&#x27; (it is shiny and chrome and i am a guy, so i dig it) to let it dry naturally. It is very well built and with care, yes, it is a tool gentleman and they should never be abused, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Good cheapie to use, if you are a beginner and want to see if you like DE safety razor shaving. After that, look to upgrade to a higher quality brush. Hairs fall out every time I use it and that can get in the way of a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I previously had the cheap boar bush that came as a package deal with soap and a bowl. This Escali bush is in a different league. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved my money for the Escali from the beginning. It is fantastic.   If you are purchasing this brush most people recommend a stand that allows for it to be stored inverted.  NOTE: I haven&#x27;t compared this to other pure badger brushes only the cheap boar one.</li>
            <li> Too small and hard for me.</li>
            <li> Its good, not as good as a Best Badger or silver tip, but it works. i&#x27;ve noticed that it loses hair alot though. i use it with CO Bigelow (Basically Proraso in a tube that you can buy at any bath and bodyworks)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but this is a great brush and at a great price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Quality plus, great shaving brush wish I had bought the holder for it.  My grandfather was a barber and he had several brushes but not as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> Unless my brush is a defect, I find it very soft and &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34;. It tends to feel like a mop and when using it the bristles tend to flatten. Holds the lather quite nicely. Or it is I am testing using Col Conk soap. But feel I can only give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The item was as described. A tad bit prickly at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It breaks in nicely, for a great lather and shave. I don&#x27;t think that you can find a better pure badger brush at this price point, very satisfied here.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush was purchased at The Art of Shaving, and it cost me four or five times as much as this brush.  That first brush started losing hair right away, and then it started losing LOTS of hair.  This brush from Escali is holding up much better.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a decent shaving brush for a while and I&#x27;m impressed by this one.  It gives me a nice lather and since I&#x27;ve started using it my skin seems clearer and my shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> Nice brush at a great price point. Pleasure to use, once a small number of bristles fell off (normal). Quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> first brush and only brush i ever used, i cant compare to anything else but this seems to work just well, only used twice dont know how it will hold up but for 12 dollars ill be glad to get a year or less out of it. plus i would probably want to get a new one anyways it is my face and all. also i wouldnt spend more on a fancy handle for me anyways considering i would much rather save the cash and purchase a nice new brush then having a used old one with a fancy handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as his first shaving brush.  While the brush makes great foam, the stiffer bristles irritated my husbands skin and further contributed to razor rash.  He found this brush to be prickly and too uncomfortable to use after a month or two.  The brush is of good quality, especially for the price, he just prefers a softer brush.</li>
            <li> For the price this brush is fantastic. It&#x27;s soft, feels nice and does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Initially there were a few loose hair that fell out during lathering but it seems now, after a bit of use, that the brush has settled and I no longer get the occasional stray I got at the start.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product and doubt I&#x27;ll need another brush for a while, if I do I&#x27;ll be back to look at what these guys have in stock</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the brush. For the cost and quality of this product,  it performs very well. It fits the Escali stand perfectly. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great brush, especially for the price. Wooden handle is light and so far everything has worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Good brush I have a few!</li>
            <li> It works well....was not &amp;#34;pinchy&amp;#34; on the first use.  I use this with Taylor Sandlewood Shaving Creme.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used several &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; shaving brushes recently.  This brush, the Escali, is the best of them and perhaps the only one worthy of the name.  It is now my only shaving brush.  I&#x27;ll use the others for applying shoe polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for father&#x27;s day, and was not disappointed.  It looks great on the Colonel Conk razor stand I also purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great seller.</li>
            <li> Having shaved with a brush for over 20 years I recently found myself in need of a new one and ordered several from Amazon to try.   This brush was the best value by far.  It is soft, made of quality bristles, and was very reasonable in price.  My only gripe is that I would have liked it to be a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush!  My brush came as expected and I have used it a handful of times already.  It shares my face with my boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely did not have any smell to it when I took it right out of the package.  I soaked it in warm water for a couple minutes and still no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair stays very together when using a proper lather which is great!  You can really paint very well with it which is a bonus.  I didn&#x27;t see any hairs fall out at all and no hairs sticking out to the sides like with some other brushes I have used (and thrown away) in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best badger hair I have used so far.  I only have a few brushes to compare to that I use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is soft on your face if you have sensitivity to the rougher brushes this would definitely be the way to go.  Personally I like stiffer brushes but that is just me.  I usually use this for my second paint/pass when DE shaving.  Softer brushes seem to alleviate any irritation on those passes versus using the stiffer boar hair brush so that is just how I have been doing things lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it deserves 5 stars for sure.  The wood handle is nice and the hair is definitely of higher quality.  Can&#x27;t really ask for much more in a shaving brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the true Art of Shaving to be honest and way better than anything they sell at the local stores!  Saved a ton of money on a badger brush thanks to this Escali!</li>
            <li> The Brush came in pretty humble packaging.  When wet the Brush had a bit of that wet dog smell which can be expect of most new brushes.  Ya know... fresh off the Badger.  I used a boar hair brush before this one which was a much more bristly and coarse shaving brush.  The difference between the lather of this brush and the boar hair one was night and day.  The lather was much finer and if you did things right you could get a lather that was closer to those hot shave machines they use at barber shops.  Shaving has been better since I used this brush, It&#x27;s unexpectedly tingly/prickly when lathering your face but this is more an observation than an annoyance and for the price this is a must have for anyone looking to try out using a shaving brush with either a soap puck or the old fashion tubes of shaving lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retains water well be sure to drain some before starting a lather</li>
            <li> Good company and a good product</li>
            <li> The brush works well and mixes with my soap easily, may lose a few hairs but for the most part a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t shed any hairs after a few months of use, but the handle is tiny and does not have a good ergonomic or secure feel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as part of his Father&#x27;s Day present.  He uses it every day now and loves it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money build good.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with the Escali badger brush.  Although bargain-priced, it delivers excellent performance.  It also seems to be sturdy, dries quickly and has not lost bristles despite vigorous use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a badger hair brush, lathers well and clean easy. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> High quality brush that produces an excellent lather.  Very few bristles fell out and it hold up quite well.  I would recommend soaking it it warm water for a few minutes to take away the natural smell it has.  In all a very good brush, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks with no problems other than a few hairs falling out (nothing excessive).  It builds a great lather quickly, and holds a good deal of water.  It is a  great starter brush and a great value . I will upgrade eventually.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush! he says it feels amazing on his skin. Great product and great service. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll ever need another brush.</li>
            <li> Great price, but I&#x27;ve had cats that shed less. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is everything it was promised to be! A few of the hairs came out the first couple of times using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this little guy.  You get a full head of foam with it, and it doesn&#x27;t separate.  USA Vitamins did a good job with delivery.  I plan to buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Brush hairs consistently fall out. All badger brushes smell, but this is awful, did they only use the hair from the badger&#x27;s ass?</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for someone who is curious about making the jump to shaving with a brush. If you are curious about making the jump from can-o-gel to brush and mug, this is a good place to start.  It is not the best in the world but is better than several boar brushes that cost more.  I have been using mine since I made the jump 9 months ago and it is hanging in there.  Occasionally sheds a bristle, but it performs well overall.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good value, but there are better quality knots out there for slightly more cash.  &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; is the lowest grade of badger hair, &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; is higher, and &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; is higher still.  A decent &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; brush feels soooo much better on the face.  My advice to anyone who enjoys a good lather is to skip the value brush and just buy a &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;silver-tip&amp;#34; out of the gate.  The extra investment is a bit scary, but you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Exactly  Wat I expected</li>
            <li> IT was cheap, but not cheaply made, I am impressed. It smells kinda funky at first but after a month of use the aroma is mostly gone from it. The bottom line for the money it cant be beat.</li>
            <li> Like the Feather brush I owned this works well. It is almost perfect, but at the first couple of uses you will lose some bristles and that is annoying, after that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good brush and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Should have believed the comments that it smells bad like a dead animal. Actually it stinks like a decomposing animal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving brush to replace my older shaving brush. The price is great, the shaving brush leaves one or two brush hairs on my face when I apply the shaving cream via the brush.</li>
            <li> I just got into using safety razors and I chose this brush based on the price and the reviews.  I am very pleased with it, I definitely like using this brush.  I feel like a bad-ass every now i shave.  They emailed me asking to post a review so thats why I am doing this but in no way did i get paid to do this.  It really is an awesome brush, although its my first shave brush so i really don&#x27;t know.  What i DO know is i like it better than spraying something on my hand and wiping my face with it.  Its a good brush.</li>
            <li> I am giving this as a Christmas gift so I cannot rate the product.  I am sure it will be fine.  Appreciated the fast service.</li>
            <li> Still smells like wet dog. Seriously, after putting soap on it, shampoo, shaving with it, still smells like crap. I understand a straight edge razor gives you a closer shave, but I see closer shave by using a brush- at least this one.</li>
            <li> The brush gets the soap&#x27;s lather going and it feels smooth and soft across my face.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well - it loses hairs each time I use it which is a little concerning but it does make great foam. Holds water really well. It is not a huge brush about a 1in-1.5in when fully dried.</li>
            <li> Brush is exactly what I ordered. Arrived in a couple of days. I use it to lather my beard with shaving soap. Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was much cheaper than most shaving brushes, and it works as well as other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had. Shaving brushes are a product that I think are frequently overpriced b/c they&#x27;re considered a luxury item, its nice to have one at a price that makes sense!</li>
            <li> No problems with this shaving brush. Apply a little pressure after dunking in water and shaving cream and works like a charm. Ehhh...smells a little bit like a wet badger, but that&#x27;s granted being that it&#x27;s made from a badger...poor badger. Just glad it&#x27;s not made from other types of hair I guess. Otherwise it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great product and great company - fast!</li>
            <li> My husband is tired of the expense of disposable razors and shaving equipment. He ordered these  and is very happy with his razors and shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> Combined with a good shaving soap, I am getting the best shave ever by using this brush. Every morning, I not only shave me face, but also my head, and since using this product before to apply the soap I have not cut myself.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! Produces a good lather and dries fast</li>
            <li> service was great, delivery on time and products exceeded expectations.  thank you.</li>
            <li> My father always used one of these growing up.  He was in WWII so he was old school about most things.  I bought him a $60 boars hair shaving brush for xmas several years ago and when he died I took it home as a momento. One day I ran out of shaving creme and decided to give it a try on my legs.  I was so surprised!  I liked it very much and haven&#x27;t used shaving cream since.  It saves alot of money.  I ordered this brush for my boyfriend at his place bc he liked mine.  I actually like this one better than the $60 bc its stiffer and raises the hair better.  I also bought a double edge razor which is way better than those triple or quatro blades that rip the crap out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Here is the story, this is my first shaving brush and I will never go back to not using a shaving brush.  It makes for a closer shave.  I give 4 stars b/c I have nothing else to compare it to.  The brush does shed for the first 5-10 uses and after that maybe a bristle comes out every so often.  In the beginning it is annoying.  Also in the beginning the brush smells like badger.  After a short while this smell goes away.  The major downfall with this item is the ask you to dry it with bristles facing down.  Without buying a holder this is impossible to do, unless you do what I did and drill a hole through the handle and tie a string through it.  Now it hangs on a hook in my shower and dries quickly.  I do like this item and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush a few weeks ago and have been very happy with the quality. Feels great against my skin and works up plenty of lather. Highly recommended, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about using this brush. I had a cake of shaving soap to review on my blog, and for the longest time I was using it without a good brush. What a bummer way to use a great soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with this brush, I can properly lather and foam up my parts to shave! I was going to give it to the man of the house for his fuzzy face, but he is growing a beard, and refuses to shave the neck beard other than a trim.. so guess who gets to have super smooth legs? That is right- me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a whole new way to go green and have smooth legs every day. It is a bath time event, and it is always relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about 2 weeks now and it is very good.  I have only had a couple of hairs come out and otherwise no issues.  It is a little small and won&#x27;t sit easily on my bowl sideways, but that is just because of the bowl I have.    I recommend getting a stand for it, but otherwise a good product and good value.</li>
            <li> Upfront I want to say this is a nice starter brush and the price-point is very fair. Don&#x27;t expect this to be perfect and broken in after two shaves. Mine shed like the dickens for about a week then leveled off. The critter odor does dissipate after a couple weeks of steady use. Also, don&#x27;t expect it to perform perfectly with all soaps/creams or be perfect for different lathering techniques. Use this to learn with and if you stick to wet shaving then later on purchase an upgrade if needed.</li>
            <li> Like double-edge razors, badger brushes have a finite life.  Still, you expect the finer - and more expensive - brushes to last longer.  The higher the quality, the longer you should expect them to last, in addition to being made of generally finer stuff.  Still, over thirty bucks is a lot to pay for something you put soap on and expect to wear out eventually.  But do you want to risk spending less than half that and wonder whether it will only last half as long and be of inferior quality?  In this case, I would recommend that you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Escali badger shaving brush.  First of all, I can attest that this brush shows quality where it counts, eliminating the question of whether a less expensive brush would fall apart at the first sight of water.  This brush has held up well after many months of use, refusing to lose bristles, lose shape, or otherwise fail.  The quality of bristles appears to be the same as brushes that go for more than twice the price.  (Are there different grades of badger fur, I wonder?)  This brush has held its shape and firmness, stimulating to the skin without being harsh or prickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is made of wood and, while finished with lacquer (or varnish), care must be taken to properly dry the brush so the handle does not get soaked, dried out, and cracked; stone or plastic handles are generally preferable in this regard, but the Escali brush has held up well.  Indeed, by the time this one wears out, I would feel that the full value of the product - and beyond - had been realized.  I&#x27;m not sure if I could say the same for a brush I paid over twice as much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it work?  It works great.  The bristles are stiff enough to create a luxurious lather on your face (Proraso and Taylor of Old Bond Street in this case) while being soft enough to stimulate your skin and raise your beard without being harsh.  In a word, every bit as good as the more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve bought and tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that this brush has quality where it counts, and which speaks to value.  While this is true, the finish of the brush - namely in the imprinted name, the wood handle, and the lacquer finish - expose the budget side of this brush.  If appearance is what matters here, then this one gets lower marks.  Close inspection of the handle and its finish reveal that this is not where the attention was paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, is this brush for you?  If you care that your brush looks as good as it acts and have the dough to pay for it, then you may want to go with a higher end brush.  If you are like me and appreciate a great value for a badger bristle shaving brush that feels as good, works as well, and lasts as long as its more expensive cousins, then this may be the brush for you.  I can afford the pricier models, but I get this one and bank the savings in my little girl&#x27;s college fund and feel good about the fact that I&#x27;ve gotten a much bigger bang for my buck.

            <li> Great Brush, just a few bristles falling of from time to time during lather process. All in all great performer.</li>
            <li> Great quality and would recommend to anyone purchasing a shaving brush</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband. he had been wanting to switch to shave soap and brush for some time. I ordered this brush based on the reviews I read about it, and I like that it is affordable. The brush works wonderfully at lathering up the soap and also getting his face and beard ready for shaving. His skin is sooo smooth after shaving that I can&#x27;t stop touching it (my tender bits love touching his face, too!!) My husband says he really loves the brush. It doesn&#x27;t poke his skin, isn&#x27;t rough at all, and does a great job of exfoliating and lathering. I recommend this brush to anyone who likes to shave this way. I must also add that the soap is important, too. Don&#x27;t go cheap, but do go with quality. It matters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to go get a kiss now.... :-)</li>
            <li> The brush is great. It only cost me like $2.25 to fix it and its as good as new. I&#x27;ve lost very few bristles and it makes great larger. To be fair to the seller, I think the handle came off since my goofy cat kept knocking it of the stand and playing with it. That being said I would recommend this brush, just keep it from animals.</li>
            <li> I picked this brush up as a gift for my husband. He Loves it! he did mention a distinct &amp;#34;badger smell&amp;#34; the first few times he used it, but it has since faded. He hasn&#x27;t mentioned any fall out, and does have the smoothest shave now. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds more hair than a husky in summer. Horrible lather, brush is easily deformed when wet and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;starfish&amp;#34; well when applying shaving soap, and first 10 uses produced an odd brown lather, which I will assume is from a dye they use.  I have 2 other brushes (about $50 each) and those work like a badger hair shaving brush should. (Bought this one to keep at work). I guess you get what you pay for in this situation.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a straight and so needed a brush for shaving cream. This was cheap and suggested by a website online. It works perfectly fine. As a beginner I can&#x27;t compare it to other badger brushes. It smells a little at first and the first time you use it some hairs fall out of it but after that they stop falling out and it starts to smell like your shaving cream. Dries pretty quickly and I&#x27;ve had a great experience using it.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned that creates the perfect amount of lather and brings enough moisture to my face. I&#x27;d highly recommend using a pure badger shaving brush, specifically this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is amazing with excellent and fast shipping. Great product and great seller!</li>
            <li> By no means am I an expert on badger brushes, but this one does what it&#x27;s supposed to and at an unbeatable price. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product that makes applying shaving cream easy and comfortable.  Received it in no time.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well and soaks well also, when I lather up the shaving cream and brush it on my face. Only issue I had with the brush is when I used it the first couple of times, the badger hair would come off into my shaving bowl. Had this for a month now and still working great.</li>
            <li> I find this a very decent brush.  Does a very good job for me.  Thing is- I also have a Tweezerman Brush- and I know they are exactly the same brushes.  Save yourself about 4 bucks and get the Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> On time shipping, lovely product high quality, husband loves it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son. He was thrilled and said he was told the Badger shaving brush is the finest quality and will last for many years. He is very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Cost less than most boar hair shaving brushes I&#x27;ve seen in stores.  Works up a good lather and only had a few hairs come out the first few uses.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Brush creates a lot of lather, but is softer than I would like since I have very dense hair.  Overall a good brush to start with.</li>
            <li> This is my first dive into the world of safety razor shaving and I have to say I am very happy with this brush. It&#x27;s soft on the skin, lathers well and dries relatively quickly. If you want a great starter brush that&#x27;s not to pricey, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Escali brush for about a month now. It has taken shaving from a mindless, daily to-do item and turned it into something I really look forward to!&lt;br /&gt;I use a large coffee cup and fill it with hot water and soak the brush while I&#x27;m in the shower. It absorbs a ton of water. When I&#x27;m done in the shower I work up a lather with the brush. It only takes a very short time to create enough to do a three-pass shave with a DE razor. The lather is great! This brush really aerates the cream and makes a full and rich lather that lubricates and protects my sensitive face and neck. An added benefit is that the shaving cream has a warmth to it when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the feeling of brushing the cream on my face with the Escali. It&#x27;s not just a paintbrush. I love the way it swirls around my whiskers and exfoliates my skin. It sets up the shave really well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read online that some brushes have a foul odor due to the badger hair. I didn&#x27;t experience that. \\&quot;Badgers? We don&#x27;t need no stinking badgers.\\&quot; It had a slightly musky scent, but after two shaves its gone. I did notice that it lost a couple of hairs in the first week. I&#x27;m not sure but assume that&#x27;s normal for any brush. I haven&#x27;t lost any in the last few weeks, however. I&#x27;m not exactly gentle with this thing, but I know how to take care of tools.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of brushes on the market and I&#x27;ll probably get more of them. But I&#x27;ll never regret buying this Escali pure badger shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This was a trial for me to switch back to brush and cream (wet shaving) instead of continuing to use the foams/gels which have all kinds of unpronounceable chemicals and don&#x27;t last very long.  Pricing-wise this brush is perfect.  I purchased this with Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol Shaving Cream.  Both products are excellent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, feels soft though</li>
            <li> Hi, first time owner of a badger brush here.  I was expecting to be able to lather up for a shave as soon as I got it, but as soon as the brush touched hot water an over powering odor was released.    I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, it was a little bit like wet dog, but more caustic.  To be honest, it smelled a little bit of skunk.  I&#x27;m giving the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt, this is probably just what dead badger smells like (they are related to skunks after all).    Unfortunately, the smell overpowers the sandelwood scent of my shaving cream and was unusable for me (maybe it&#x27;d be fine for a man&#x27;s man like Wolverine or Bear Grylls).    I looked online and found that an initial odor was to be expected from new brushes and that with use and washing (w/ borax, vinegar, baking soda, shampoo, etc), the smell would go away.  I&#x27;ve washed mine with shampoo and baking soda 3 times now and the smell has not abated.    I will update this review in a week or two.  If the smell persists then, I will downgrade my rating to 1 star.  If the smell goes away, I will upgrade the rating to 4.    *EDIT*  The smell still persists, but it nolonger carries into the cream or outside the restroom.  It&#x27;s usable, but I bought from Escali expecting a little better from the brand.  I suggest buying a cheaper product that is rated decently, because that&#x27;s what this brush is: decent.    I&#x27;m sticking to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> To be fair, the brush is actually very good.  Badger is better than Boar and these bristles don&#x27;t \\&quot;shed\\&quot; as other brushes I&#x27;ve had.  However the whole base fell off, because the bristles are glued in and came out.  They are still wrapped together and can be used without the base.  But the base is lightweight and flimsy, and obviously has cheap glue.  So good bristles, bad base.  Three stars.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling brush, it did lose a few hairs at first.  I think it has about finished that stage.  Nice handle.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied, but not amazed by this brush. It worked well enough, although I thought the bristles were too stiff.     Then after about 3 months use the glue failed and the bristles came off the handle.</li>
            <li> Feels great, no wonder its an amazon #1 seller. Bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Best brush and service, with all products.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and safely, and works great!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Smooth, even coverage on the face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taking forever to break in. the brush constantly sheds. it&#x27;s rather annoying. will look at other brushes as I&#x27;m still learning the ropes.</li>
            <li> Well I had been using a boar bristle brush and mug rater sucessfully untill the wife decided that she liked my brush and mug for her lather.  So I had some credit on amazon and started looking for a replacement brush for my bathroom.  I had another shaving mug and another cake of the same type of soap and side by side.  This badger brush and the boar bristle brush i was able to get a fluffier lather with this brush then the boar.  It felt softer on my face and I havent told my wife that it is nicer because she would then take the escali and give me back the boar brush.  A vigrous shaking gets a majority of my rinse water off the brush and leaves it almost dry to the touch when I set it on its side to finish drying out.      The only cons I had was a odd smell when the brush was wet the first couple weeks.  I talked to a friend and he said that all badger brushes have that odor at first but it goes away.  Shedding of loose bristles were probally 2 or 3 the first couple uses.    All in all a badger for the price of a boar, top nothch fellas and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Price makes it even better.  No problems at all.  Just make sure to shake dry and leave on side.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and so figured i would get an inexpensive brush to get started.  I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes since i haven&#x27;t used any others, but i can build great lathers and it will hold plenty of water.  There was minimal shedding.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> This badger shaving brush is a lucky find for me after searching for many moons for a genuine badger brush.  I like to use a brush and shaving mug for the real shaves they make possible.  This brush lives up to all my hopes.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after deciding to switch from Gillette Mach3&#x27;s to plain, old style double-edge shaving. I have had to for over 3 weeks now and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristle shedding. It does an adequate job with the cream (see my other review), is quite light and has a good grip. Only other point I can add is that if you have big hands, go for a brush with longer stem since this one may prove too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> When I bought this brush I was on the fence about using a shaving brush since I have never used one before. I tell ya, I will never shave without one again. Feels great on the skin and really helps lather up my face. Don&#x27;t waste the money on all the super expensive brushes, this Escali 100% Badger hair brush is all you need. Everything you want at a cheaper price. BUY ONE</li>
            <li> The best badger hair brush ever and I have had several that cost ovet $40 dollars.I&#x27;m going to order about 3 more just to have on reserve!</li>
            <li> Very shaving brush, thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brushed based on numerous reviews and it works great and feels very comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li> Sheds quite a bit. It works for starters but I will try a better brand next time.</li>
            <li> Good stiff brush for the money. A lot better than the flimsy cheap box store ones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable badger-haired brush, look no further.    I&#x27;ve used it for the last 10 or so shaves and it still feels good to the skin when I lather up.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, great lather!  Husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll need to buy a new one eventually, the badger hair does fall out, but it&#x27;s a strand or two per shave.</li>
            <li> Wish the brush was a bit more stiff. Other than that, great!</li>
            <li> Absorbs water really well and creates a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This brush started out well with very little shedding. after a week of daily shaving the brush became very floppy and lost most all of it&#x27;s backbone. it still lathers creams and croaps fairly well, but does not have enough backbone to load enough soap from a hard puck.  for about the same money a nice Omega brush would be a better first choice.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Really soft and has become my go to shaving brush. I love it</li>
            <li> This brush was just what I was looking for. Soft, very durable, cleans up easily, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and a little harsh on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Also leaves a brown and nasty looking residue in my soap  - hopefully this will reduce as I use it more&lt;br /&gt;Looks high quality.</li>
            <li> A nice quality brush. It will last you a long time, if rinsing with cold water and whisk it dry.</li>
            <li> Top quality!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the price. I Personally thought it was fuller than the tweezerman brand! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels great, fits in the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand I also purchased. Made a great gift. Fast shipping, very happy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the issue I have is that it continues to lose bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 20 uses, a minimum of three bristles still come out during each use. My understanding was that some bristles would come out the first few uses until the brush is &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;, but that is not the case as I keep having to pick them out of my lather. Maybe they will stop coming out soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving four stars because it&#x27;s still working well despite losing the bristles. It&#x27;s a minor annoyance and for the price it&#x27;s not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first purchase of a brush like this, and I do not yet know the difference in quality between an inexpensive brush, and a high priced brush. If this one keeps working well, I may not try a high priced brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and works well. No problems.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice shaving brush.  Good amount of bristles, not thin.  Holding up very well so far.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and quick delivery.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Just got back into shaving with a manual razor again.  I used just shaving cream from a can a used my hands and it didn&#x27;t seem to do that good of a job.  Did a little research into brushed and found that badger brushes did well.  So I found this on Amazon and bought it.  Really works the lather of the cream into the wiskers and prevents pulling.  Highly recommend this brush.  Haven&#x27;t lost any bristles yet.</li>
            <li> Quality brush thus far. Have gifted the same. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> There is a real difference in applying shaving cream with badger hair over other types of natural and synthetics.  This feels good on my face, keeps the right amount of water in place and seems to last.  I have had this one for several months now with no noticeable loss of its hairs.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush!!! Great bang for the buck!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, but I believe it&#x27;s a good choice. The badger brush seems well glued to the wood holder. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll buy a synthetic brush though, &#x27;cose this one takes its time to dry.</li>
            <li> This brush is 100% Badger hair. With advertising the way it is, that can mean it is not the best hair, but it is all hair. It is an excellent brush and the quality is evident in the way the brush feels. I will buy again if I need a replacement. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some other models.  Even after daily use for 2 weeks, it still does shed though.  This would&#x27;ve been a 5 star product if didn&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift. However,  the recipient loves it! He has thanked me several times.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t know why there are all these five star reviews for this brush. After using this brush for a week I gave up and spent the money on a better quality brush.  This brush sheds terribly.  I would spend at least a minute trying to get the bristles out of my lather.  Not only does it shed, but after using it the bristles splayed out so bad it was almost impossible to work up a decent lather.  Take my advice and put another twenty to thirty bucks with this and get yourself a good brush.. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> very nice shaving brush.</li>
            <li> A quality product.  Performs as described.  A classic, &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; type shave.  Every guy should treat himself to one of these.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars for now because it was a birthday gift for my oldest son, part of a kit I put together that included this brush, an assortment of shaving soaps, a nice razor, and 200 blades.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the brush holds up as well as the majority of the reviews say it will and that it&#x27;s something he can use for several years.</li>
            <li> Very few hairs have fallen out.  Holds water extremely well.  Dries well too.  They are making me type more words.</li>
            <li> This is a good, moderately-priced brush. There are better brushes which will cost more, and in some cases, a great deal more, but in this range, this is as good as it gets. Expect to lose some bristles, but you should expect that with any brush. Not excessive.</li>
            <li> Provides good lather.  Easy to clean.  Decent product.</li>
            <li> Good Badger brush, much better than the synthetics.  However, bristles are still shedding after about a month of use.  They need a better glue!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, curly hair, so shaving has always been a pain. Using the Escali shaving brush (and a safety razor with shaving soap) has really, really helped! This is actually the second Escali brush, safety razor, and shaving soap I&#x27;ve bought recently so I can have it while traveling as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loosing a half-dozen or so bristles every time I use it. Even so, I like it ok, and it will probably last a couple years (at most).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up one year later:&lt;br /&gt;The brush hasn&#x27;t lost that much of its bristles...BUT, there is another issue: The brush has gone &#x27;limp&#x27;. The brush bristles aren&#x27;t springy like when it was new and it doesn&#x27;t apply the lotion as well as it did. The best way I can describe it is it feels &#x27;sloppy&#x27; and limp, like using a wet cotton ball.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush that I&#x27;ve bought, thus my frame of reference is limited but I consider this to be an excellent brush.  It occasionally loses a hair or two but that&#x27;s nothing beyond what I would deem acceptable.  The handle is a nice size for my hands.  Overall, it&#x27;s well constructed and worth the price.</li>
            <li> The brush looks good, but since the very first shave I have been getting bristles coming off all over the place!! It is just not possible to shave like that. This one is being returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $25 - $30 a pop purchasing disposable razors from the store, so I decided to make the switch to a razor &amp; brush. This brush is awesome, and VERY reasonably priced. The seller shipped the item VERY fast! Very easy to do business with!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for converting from a disposable razor setup to a safety setup.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good beginner brush, but as the title says, it loses a hair or two with every use. Hence, the four out of five stars.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft but still firm enough to create a good lather and massage facial hair. When first used it had a chemical smell and left the lather a grey color. After washing it is now a great brush.</li>
            <li> Remembering my grandfather&#x27;s shaving practices, I wanted to abandon modern commercial foaming shaving creams/gels and use a brush like a \\&quot;real man!\\&quot;  At first I purchased the local drugstore&#x27;s only shaving brush.  Brush hairs would sometimes come off on my face, and then it started coming apart in chunks after only a few months of use.  After looking online and deciding against high-dollar brushes (since I didn&#x27;t know if I would stick to this method or not), I found this Escali Pure Badger shaving brush at a great price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the brush smelled horribly of what seemed to be formaldehyde (really guys - can you lay off the toxic formaldehyde?!)  So I washed it thoroughly and left it to air out for probably two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was smaller than I expected.  I anticipated a big, bushy brush.  But as I found out, you don&#x27;t NEED a big bushy brush!  It takes me all of about 45 seconds to lather up using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly a year (11 months) of constant use, I have probably lost 5 hairs (which is nothing).  It works  consistently and shows no signs of wear at all.  You have to care for it, of course, by rinsing it off when you&#x27;re done and NEVER leave it standing brush-side up to dry (always leave it on its side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product was a \\&quot;gamble\\&quot; when I purchased it -- I didn&#x27;t know what to expect or how long it would last.  I would purchase another one as a backup, but my first one shows no signs of giving up any time soon.  I would definitely buy this product again and I would buy it for friends.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and it came very quickly...in time for a Christmas shaving kit we put together for my son.Thank you!</li>
            <li> My first brush. Great results so far. No problems.</li>
            <li> Real badger makes it better.</li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy and the bristles fall out very easily. After using it, my shave soap dish was full of loose hairs from the brush. Sheds worse than my cat.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little prickly when you first start to use it. But like any natural hair brush, it takes a little while to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;. The best way to get that process started is to use a little hand soap on the brush before you even use it the first time. Build up a good lather. It will clean off the bristles. This helps minimize any &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell and starts to soften / condition the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you do that, the brush will become softer fairly quickly. And let&#x27;s face it stuffing our face into a brush takes some adjusting (if you&#x27;ve never done it before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember also that you should dry your brush with the bristles hanging down. If you don&#x27;t do this, you will have two bad things happen. First the base of the bristles will tend to collect moisture over time. This slowly, but steadily undoes the glue that holds the brush together. Second, it promotes mold and mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of a well made brush and it should last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s face it, at this price it&#x27;s a very pleasant surprise to find such good quality. I expected that I would have to replace this brush. Having used it a few days, I am pretty certain it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Quality brush. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to single blade safety razor shaving. It&#x27;s the only way to shave in my opinion.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Merkur (German made) safety razor, Escali brush and Edwin Jagger soap bowl. Escali is a small American company that makes a high quality product. The reviews are excellent for a reason. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. The brush has a nice wood finish and feels good in your hand. The bristles are perfect, soft but not too soft, just stiff enough for a good lather and they don&#x27;t come out. If you&#x27;re serious about shaving and searching for a shaving brush look no further. P*!#ies use shaving cream and 5 blade razors that are a total garbage pit, give a crap shave and get clogged easily. Don&#x27;t be a p*!#y and shave like a man. Don&#x27;t be a p*!#y and buy this brush.  :)</li>
            <li> Good buy, brush works good at a great price.</li>
            <li> So far so good! My husband has used this multiple times since we received it. He likes it and it is very soft.  I was hesitant to buy this because some reviewers talked about an odor and bristles falling out. This was not our experience. Very few bristles have fallen out and there is no odor at all.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping. First time using a brush like this and so far so good. Light shedding but I imagine that being the case with all brushes.</li>
            <li> Husband is very happy with brush quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats a good shave, this brush was just right to replace my worn out item. This order arrived within a couple of days of being ordered and arrived new in the box.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shaver, stand, shave cream and brush!  The closest shave I&#x27;ve seen on him in 38 years.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand shaving brush my son uses.  He says they hold up the best and make a nice lather.  He was thrilled to get this one from me for Christmas!</li>
            <li> As others have reviewed a descent brush at a descent price.Good placeto start with de shaving</li>
            <li> Great product and good Seller.</li>
            <li> BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*mushroom mushroom*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.  I researched these brushes before purchasing and learned that badger hair was the only acceptable type.  I am very pleased with this product and am delighted to recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush. If you want to save some money get this one it will last a great deal of time.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush, although it sheds a little. Does the job well though, and soft enough for sensitive skin if used correctly.</li>
            <li> Very natural and pure badger hair.  This was a gift for my cousin who has sensitive skin and needs special treatment for his beard.  He really appreciate this gift and uses on a regular basis due his skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to treat well your face skin, go for this, you&#x27;ll not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> There is no way the 5 star reviews are legitimate--all of us with bad experiences are saying the exact same thing. This is about as bad of a shaving brush as I have ever used. The bristles are very prickly, and it NEVER. STOPS. SHEDDING. (been using for months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided I&#x27;m going to use a brush indefinitely, so went and got a nice brush--worlds apart. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this crap.</li>
            <li> soft enough for my sensitive skin and provides a rich lather bristles have held up well and have had no issues with the construction of the brush have paid three times this price before and got a worse brush. great addition to any wet shaver&#x27;s medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this shaving brush. I got it for my dad last Father&#x27;s Day and he LOVED it. However, after 3 months of use, the handle fell off. Would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Brush works exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Your badger shaving brush is excellent.  I would highly recommend it. It is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t compare it against others. Breaking in nicely. Good price. I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This brush seems suitable to get anyone started.  Lathers alright.  Much better then no brush for sure.  Mine lost a few hairs per shave, but it&#x27;s a cheapo and expected.  not very pleasant smelling.  mop like.  If your on a budget this will get you going, otherwise spend 40 - 100 on something in best badger, as you will want to anyways</li>
            <li> I wonderful brush which we released back into the wild. :)</li>
            <li> Been using shave brushes for years and this one is top of the line. It is gentle on the face and lathers the soap very well.</li>
            <li> Still holding up after a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very nice. Great value. This brush is as good as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I am at least the fourth generation in my family to use a \\&quot;mug and brush\\&quot; for shaving. This process affords hot water, hot lather and a great shave. This brush only goes to make the process that much better! I am particularly grateful with the fact the brush is natural material. My decision to buy this was a good one.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves his new shaving brush!</li>
            <li> The badger shaving brush is an excellent value.  It lathers and holds soap very well.  The price was great as well too.</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving brush that I have used. Previously, I used my fingers to work in a lather from gel onto my face prior to shaving.     I&#x27;ve used this for the past 3 months, and I must say -- it works really well! The badger brush massages my face as I apply lather (the hairs are fairly soft), which makes shaving no longer a chore for me. I&#x27;ve noticed that I can apply a much smoother and thicker lather onto my face prior to shaving than before when I was using my hands. I&#x27;m also able to be more precise with where I apply lather without making a mess.    Here are few things that I&#x27;ve noticed:  1) The first time I used this, there were a few stray hairs from the brush that fell off onto my face. After using it about 3-4 times, no more hairs fell out from the brush.  2) The way I clean it consists of rinsing it with warm water (it holds quite a lot of water and lather!) and squeezing the water out by using my index finger and thumb to form a sphincter around the base of the hairs. I do this a few times, and after squeezing it dry, I hang it by the handle upside down so the hairs are facing down. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it getting any funny smells, though I have read that some people have used a mild borax solution to wash it safely.  3) I hang this brush (hair end down) using this: [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]. It&#x27;s important to note that the wood is not perfectly circular. Rather, the base is like an ellipse. Because it&#x27;s a tight fit into the razor stand, I find that I have to rotate the brush so the skinnier diameter of the wood handle slides in.    My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner! I love this thing!     Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into shaving with soap, that a friend makes,&lt;br /&gt;over shaving with shaving cream, and had a decent brush from a big dept store chain.&lt;br /&gt;This brush was my first try at a real badger shaving brush, and well worth the extra pop.&lt;br /&gt;I found it lathered well, and a much softer application.</li>
            <li> Works well, it is everything it was advertised to be!</li>
            <li> Brush works perfectly as described. I don&#x27;t shave every day, but use 3-4 times per week. Lathers well and holds it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Great product with quick shipping</li>
            <li> Great brush, makes a good lather and is soft on my skin. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for. I was unable to find one like this in my local stores so was happy to find it on Amazon. It is well constructed and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> While this is not the softest, fanciest or best brush on the market it does work. Of course it does not even come close to high end products but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. It is a little scratchy and it will probably shed but you will get a quality shave with it. So if you are on a budget new to wet shaving or just want to try the brush I encourage not to delay and give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Bristles keep falling out. At the rate this is happening, won&#x27;t be much brush left in short order.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the Escali, I had no idea what brush to get; as I am a complete novice to wet shaving.  So, I mainly went off the reviews from others.  I am very pleased with the quality, and am still learning how best to use the brush: up - n- down strokes, or in a circle pattern.  Nevertheless, with the Proraso soap I use it applies extremely well.  One cant go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good stiff brush.  I&#x27;ve been using badger hair brushes (or whatever hair the brush was actually made out of) for the last 35 years.  Most are just too soft to get up a good lather.  This one started out stiff and has remained stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that it tends to lose hairs more than most.  Maybe this will decrease with age.  The hairs are also only a minor annoyance as they don&#x27;t get in the razor at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush to supplement another I have.  I began using boar bristle brushes and really like this over them.  It lost a couple of hairs and smelled like a wet animal but with a couple of uses those are not issues.  The brush is soft, holds water well and smells like my soap now.  I would buy another if needed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Functions just as it should. Just be sure to completely void the brush of shaving cream after each use to maintain the integrity of the brush for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Good brush. As expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush I like it, but not long after the third time using it the bristles have been coming off  a lot</li>
            <li> Got this to replace an older bristle brush.  Amazed at the quality and performance.  The brush head is densely packed quite soft and pleasant to the touch.  I am really enjoying the close comfortable shave that only a badger brush will allow.  Very happy with this purchase especially considering that a comparable badger brush cost 40 to 50 dollars.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaving brush to anyone who would like to have a comforanle clean shave. smooth shaqve</li>
            <li> Nice brush, works well.  It&#x27;s my first, so I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.  Out of the box it had some &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell, but that didn&#x27;t transfer to my face and after a few uses it&#x27;s either gone or just covered by the small of the shaving soap.  I don&#x27;t notice it.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for approximately 60 years now and I have tried every conceivable method I have ever heard of during this period of time. About a year ago I decided to go back to the old way of shaving that my Dad and Grandfathers did it...with a mug and a brush. I tried the boar bristle and it was OK and then I ordered the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and believe me there is no comparison in the softness and shape of this brush. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a better or should I say the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; shaving brush ever. Glenn Christie</li>
            <li> I have now used my Escali 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush for two weeks and have enjoyed two benefits from it. First, the shaves are much smoother because I can apply a thicker lather to my beard and, second, my razor blades last longer because I can get my beard softer with the lather applied by this brush.  If you want a smoother shave, try lathering with this brush.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much, very well designed and finish was of high class!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a brush since I heard it helps raise hairs if you use it while shaving. Thus you get a closer shave. While that might be true I didn&#x27;t like this one. The hairs come off easily and it didn&#x27;t feel good. I tossed it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This thing looks great. My dad loves it. Says he has never had a nice brush, but that this one is great. Now I want one for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush but a little smaller than what I was used to .</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, lathers up the face really well. Doesn&#x27;t bother the skin while doing that. I like it.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> This one gets the job done and will impress 90% of the people who look at it.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money and certainly good for those on a budget.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I thought it would be. Great shave! Much better that my old plastic razors I used to save with. Nothing like a good razon.</li>
            <li> Found something better and not made in China!</li>
            <li> affordable and high-quality product</li>
            <li> I recommend dipping this in hot water for a minute or longer to soften it up. It can feel quite rough if you don&#x27;t do so. Quite more affordable than the more quality, softer badger brushes so it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> A great brush for shaving beginners and old shaving pros. Loads very well and keeps wet for an entire shave. Highly recommended for all ages.</li>
            <li> Feels so good when applying the shaving cream.  Use a good shaving cream however</li>
            <li> The brush feels nice and soft on my face. It lathers up the soap really quickly. It&#x27;s simple and elegant looking. Great product and service from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought (and own :-( a stylish brush from the art of shaving company. It&#x27;s a flimsy piece of junk, and their soaps barely lather, and their safety blade handle is lame. That poser company is a total rip off. My (x) girlfriend talked me into going there. I should have trusted my gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast this brush is soft, full, appropriately stiff and works up a great lather. What a difference $60 (less) gets you. Sometimes you get less than you pay for....in this case it was more.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I really like the Escali brush.  Works great.  Creates a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend buying a brush stand to hang the brush to dry.  It will last longer and dry completely.</li>
            <li> My husband is really pleased with this! says it does a great job and was just what he wanted!</li>
            <li> This brush does a perfect job for half the price.  I have been using it for several months now and it still works like the first time.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up pretty over the past month or so. It loses quite a few Bristles at the beginning, but they slow down after a while. It is definitely the best value that I found on Amazon, but I did find a better one on ebay for a similar cost. 4 stars and I would buy again when I need one shipped today with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush, but I have watched several maintenance care videos on youtube so I don&#x27;t think I am abusing it in anyway so with that said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for it is a cheap brush does its job, but loses a lot of the quills/hairs (it sheds like a dog). Other than that its a fine brush for its price.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my son, it arrived promptly &amp; he loved it!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush especially for the money I paid for it. I&#x27;ve had more expensive brushes in the past but this one lived up to being at least as good. I would have no qualms about getting another one when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush for creating that foamy lather for a perfect shave with a straight razor.  Whenever I replace my brush or gift one to a friend, I order the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  Anything else and you may as well just use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Nice and affordable! It was like running a  plume of heaven over my face. I think I may have heard a chorus of angels singing with each stroke of the brush. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is very good quality but a little pokey. I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush but I think I&#x27;m going to like it. It seems to get softer with use.</li>
            <li> Much like another reviewer, I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and using a brush to apply cream/soap.  Even after I made the DE switch, I stood by, and do so at least twice/week, my Barbasol (yellow) canned cream.  I love that stuff, but I&#x27;ve found that applying soap/cream with a brush makes a world of difference.  I have nothing to compare this brush to, but it works exactly as advertised.  Upon first use, I dipped a dampened brush into my [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Soap]] (excess water shaken from it, of course), swirled it around a few times and commenced lathering up my face.  Within seconds, a nice foamy lather ensued and I was able to shave more comfortably, and closely than I have ever shaved... and there was still enough lather/foam on the brush to shave 2 more passes.  It creates a full lather and sheds minimally (I think I&#x27;ve only seen 3 bristles fall off so far).  The handle has a decent heft to it and holds nicely in my hand, but again, I have nothing to compare it to.  I&#x27;m sure there are other brushes on the market with better handling, better bristles, better lathering, etc, but for $14, I&#x27;m not sure you can find such a quality, real-hair, wood-handle brush to break in to DE shaving.  Of course, very fast shipping as fulfillment is by Amazon.    If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, good quality badger-hair brush, this is an excellent pick, especially if this is your first trek into brush application.</li>
            <li> lathers well-holds sufficient water-soft to the face-nice handle.</li>
            <li> Used this brush for about 4 months before the bristles just fell out.   Definitely not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m new to the world of wet shaving, and just about everywhere I went, I was recommended a badger brush around $50 or so. While I do want absolutely the best for my precious face, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d be able to tell the difference just yet. So, when I found this 100% badger brush for merely $13, it piqued my interest. I&#x27;ve been practicing, and it seems like this brush delivers in all the ways the pros say it should. It helps whip up a nice thick lather, and it feels great while lathering my face, very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience, so I don&#x27;t know how this holds up against some of the more expensive badger brushes. But, if you&#x27;re a beginner like me, or are looking for a lot of bang for your buck, I recommend this brush. I&#x27;ve been really happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Better then expected product wise. Very fast shipping as well. The brush is very soft and holds in the soap very well when I shave. Best shaving experiance I have had yet.</li>
            <li> I have never tried shaving soap before I bought this brush and this brush is perfect. The first&lt;br /&gt;couple of times I used it it was a bit too rough but around the 3-4th time it was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen other brushes at a much higher price and I would recommend this one more than those. Best buy for the dollar value!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Distributes the cream evenly.  Makes for a nice shave</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews here and ordered one. The first use was a contest as to whether or not I&#x27;ve have more lather on my face than shedding brush bristles! So I thought, maybe this is just a \\&quot;first use\\&quot; issue. Second shave was a bit better, but not much. Because I don&#x27;t want to clog my drain with a collection of these bristles, I had to peel them off of my face and out of my razor to throw away.  I&#x27;ll pay more for a better brush than this one. My previous ones were from The Art of Shaving shops which lasted longer than a year before losing bristles.</li>
            <li> I prefer boar hair over badger, but this little brush is pretty good.  A good brush to start of with.  Compact &amp; easy to use.  After soaking the brush in hot water for a couple of minutes, latheting soaps and creams are easy.  The price makes it very affordible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is the brush will shed, but not as bad as some of the affordible brushes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great badger brush for someone looking to get into this style of shaving, or the expert that is on a bugdet.</li>
            <li> A tad smelly before break in but the brush performs excellent</li>
            <li> It works very well. It&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had since switching to my double edge razor. I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out here and there since I got it a few weeks ago. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected. I&#x27;d buy it again if I ever find myself needing another brush.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I bought and have since bought three more.  Semogue 1520 Superior Boar Bristle for 17.00 now 15.50, Vie-Long 12705 Horse Hair Shaving Brush (my favorite) for 19.85 and Captain Fawcett&#x27;s &#x27;Best&#x27; Badger Shaving Brush for 40.13. I find this brush to be just O.K. it sheds a lot and is very scratchy.  The Semogue and Vie-Long are far superior for only a couple of dollars more, so I would recommend spending a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li> Truly a work of art from the handle to the tapering of the bristles...</li>
            <li> Great product. Awesome Price.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be of good quality.  Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, works great and fits the Escali razor holder just right.  I am vey happy with the product and the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot and leaves hair in my lather. I still got a nice, close shave, despite.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for introducing a friend to \\&quot;wet-shaving\\&quot;.  After reading several blogs and watching youtube videos on the subject, there is one key attribute for quality brushes:  100% BADGER hair, not boar hair.  The price goes up depending on the color of the badger hair (silver-tip is expensive), however, badger hair will ensure you have a long-lasting smooth brush that feels pleasant on your face.  This Escali brush gets bonus points for having an Italian name and a classic wooden handle!  This was top-notch quality for a bargain price.  I paired this with some sandalwood shaving cream and made a little basket for my brother.  Nifty little gift idea that didn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> Just bought this brush, not a bad deal.... Had just a few hair&#x27;s fall off while using it, for the first time.</li>
            <li> Ordered one for our son and then ordered one for myself.  Great quality and very pleased with the product.  Ordered a third one for my brother-in-law!</li>
            <li> Great value. Not sure if it&#x27;s normal, but every time I use, it loses several badger hairs. As for performance and expectations, it works great.</li>
            <li> Great brush. retains water and combined with Taylor of Bond Street shaving cream makes a great lather. i love this brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the job!! Stirs and holds lather well and just the right stiffness to spread it around on your face!!</li>
            <li> Works really well and have only lost a few bristles the first few times. Do yourself a favor and buy a stand or make one with wire or something so it can dry properly. It must be dried bristles hanging down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to solid shaving cream--versus foam from a can-- and use the Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  The two combined give me a much closer shave and much more comfortable skin afterwords.  The cost is significantly less than canned shaving cream and the comfort level can&#x27;t be matched.  I recommend the combination.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a brush so some of my complaints might just be part of the whole dynamic of a pure badger hair brush. With that being said, there is a slight odor to the brush which isn&#x27;t too awful but it definitely smells a little rough until you mix in the shaving cream. Also probably another part of owning a brush but I notice that every time I use it, 4 or 5 hairs will fall out of the brush. Again neither of these issues are a huge deal and in all honestly are probably just part of the brush. Overall when you compare this brush to others I&#x27;m okay with these small issues since it&#x27;s less than half the price of others.</li>
            <li> After some hairs that slipped out its been holding pretty well. Not smelling weird as it did at first anymore either. I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brush with very soft bristles. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that you have to prep this before first use.  It shed when I first tired making lather with it, but I didn&#x27;t know you were supposed to &amp;#34;pre-shed&amp;#34; it before really using it.  It&#x27;s is great at doing the job, I just wish it didn&#x27;t shed the first use.</li>
            <li> The brush is one-third of my new shaving experience. Coupled with my new double-edge razor and shaving cream, I now get a close, smooth shave. A great product from a company who ships very quickly.</li>
            <li> I just started with this after having replaced a brush that I have used over the years. This has a good feel to it, and is a badger brush, which is the reason I bought it. Very reasonable price. I may review this again in six months or so if the bristles are falling out, although I doubt it.   Went back to a double edge razor,shaving brush and soap about three years ago.  If you&#x27;re thinking of trying a double edge, check out Amazon. I bought a Merkur to replace my old Gillete, that guess what. I tossed years ago. They also have the blades, but worth shopping around for both. I did, but came back to Amazon. Maybe I caught everything at the right time.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old brush that was missing 1/2 of its bristles. Great value.</li>
            <li> Looks good, but the first few uses it was very irritating. Not sure if this is related to the quality of the brush or my inexperience with badger brushes, however.</li>
            <li> Had it for a year now and still holding up great! Had a few, and I mean literally a few bristles come out the first week. Best deal you&#x27;ll find on a badger brush.</li>
            <li> My second brush. The first one was crap (the $12 starter set) and this one was great for about a month. I was squeezing out the water and the bristles actually separated from the handle. Ordered some epoxy from amazon I plan on just sticking it back together. Lol. Brush gets softer with use. I would give 5 stars but the fact it fell apart and because I can just glue it back together I give it a 3. But for the price u can&#x27;t beat it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to begin wetshaving this summer with my Merkur 38C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things: Get into DE/straight shaving, and buy this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you want to stick with cartridge marketing gimmicks I still say this could be a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works up a fine lather. Bristles aren&#x27;t too hard. Appearance in my opinion is poor, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. I have a Van Der Hagen \\&quot;badger\\&quot; brush to compare to and this one blows it away.</li>
            <li> Was delivered as advertised</li>
            <li> As this is my first shaving brush I don&#x27;t have the cache of ethos that many pro shavers do.  However, I find that after beginning to use this brush my face breaks out much less, is left softer, and many cuts are prevented.  I really enjoy my escali brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and for the money I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I have very sensitive skin so I got this along with some prosaro shave soap to see if it would be any easier on my face.  The brush lathers up really well and I&#x27;m amazed at how fast it dries out after use.  When my skin is being extra sensitive it can be somewhat irritating, but that may be with all shaving brushes.  I&#x27;ve used it about ten times and have only lost a couple brush hairs so far.  It looks like this thing is going to last for a while.  If your like me and just wanted to try one out before dropping off 100 bucks on a nicer one, this is a good buy.  That being said I dont see myself needing an upgrade any time soon.</li>
            <li> The price was so good on this brush I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform as well as it does. It holds water and lathers beautifully. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush a few times now.  It works really good.  Feels great on my skin and generates an awesome lather.  Great product.</li>
            <li> For the price tag, this is a very good deal. It does not come up to the feel of one of my other Italian pure badger brushes (costing around 40-50 dollars). However, it is close and I was very satisfied. Perhaps as I use it, it might get better.</li>
            <li> Used it for two weeks now. After shaving for over 25 years I can definitely feel a difference when you use this tool instead of your hand to apply shaving cream. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This brush is great that being said this is my first experience with using a shave brush so I dont have alot to compare it with. I can say aside from some initial shedding wich seems normal with anything using natual hair I have no complaints. I have a really good sense of smell and detected no strange oder from the brush wet or dry. I would recomend this to anyone thinking of starting out shaving \\&quot;old school\\&quot; or for anyone who just doesnt want to shell out big bucks for a luxury brush!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now, and it&#x27;s working great. The only reason why I took one star off is because some of the individual fur will come off on my shaving bowl and/or my face. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal though.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Comfortable and the bristles stay intact. Works great to create a good lather for a closer shave - and that&#x27;s the reason I bought it. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the price was right. You can&#x27;t beat that. They&#x27;re an American company - I like that too -  although the packaging does not acknowledge that this brush was made in America.</li>
            <li> An excellent buy. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Feels very nice and makes for a perfect lather. No weird smells like some people have noted. Used this with Proraso Menthol and it was sublime.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Uncle by marriage who was using a cheap boars hair brush.  He absolutely loves his new badger hair brush and says it lathers twice as well as his old brush and is 10 times better overall.  He hates shaving, but now at least he can do it in style.  Also thanks for the easy open package as he is older and has arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush.  He says it is reminiscent of the high quality ones his father and grandfather used.</li>
            <li> This product is a 4-star all day long. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or two now, and it&#x27;s going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the brush, it was shedding hairs like crazy, but after the first few shaves it slowed. That being said, it is still shedding a hair or two here and there, so it will probably go bald eventually. I&#x27;m not gentle on the brush, but I take reasonably good care of it. For 15 dollars this is honestly a great buy if you want to get an idea of what a badger brush feels/lathers like, but if you are buying this solely because you want a cheap brush, then just go get a cheap boar/synthetic brush in one of those drug store shave kits. It will perform about as well at the end of the day. If you just want to know if this is worth the 15 bucks you are going to pay for it: Yes. Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good brush for beginners, but will leave you wanting more if you&#x27;re hoping for actual quality. Beyond that, your best bet will be to look around for a low end Simpson brush. It will set you back about 60-70 dollars, but you will be paying 5 times the price for 20 times the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a 100% badger brush and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.  It is a little small, but gets the job done.  I found that it applies the cream best when doing swirls rather than paint swipes.  You can paint after you swirl to even the layer of cream on your face.  It&#x27;s straight for 14 bucks and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little prickly but lathers up great!  Would definitely recommend.  Need a stand to let it drip dry.</li>
            <li> Recieved this item on time and at a very good price. It&#x27;s been awhile since I used a brush and shave soap.This thing feels amazing wondering where I&#x27;ve been all this time. You guys keep up the good work I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Item does what it is supposed to do however, this brush does shed its bristles a lot.  Will likely try a boar brush next time around or spend a little extra money.</li>
            <li> Very great product. Learned of it through my brother in law, am impressed with the quality. Will definetely come back in the future and will recommend the product to others</li>
            <li> Good brush.  First couple of uses will leave some stray brush hair, but over all a really good brush.</li>
            <li> Just like many who purchased this one, I was just getting into the Wet-shave thing. I wanted a badger-hair brush that would last, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on one right out the shoot. This one seemed to fit the bill. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, it holds water very well and works great to build up a rich, luxurious lather (I use Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s soap).     The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as some of the more expensive brushes, but not such that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. If you&#x27;re just starting and don&#x27;t want to drop 50 bucks on a brush, try this one. It&#x27;s a perfect entry-level brush, or just to have a back-up/travel brush that&#x27;s good quality but you&#x27;d be OK with losing.    ADDED: 6 months of use, I have to take a star away from this. The brush part fell apart from the handle. I was able to glue it back together, but even considering that the brush doesn&#x27;t have the same quality it did after first purchasing it. I would still absolutely recommend this brush as an entry-level brush to those who are getting into DE shaving and just want to get their feet wet. This brush served those needs well, it wasn&#x27;t so expensive that I would have been mad at myself for buying it if I decided DE shaving wasn&#x27;t for me. Just know that if you buy this, and you really fall in love with DE shaving, you will almost certainly be purchasing a brush of higher quality construction and material within a year.</li>
            <li> As a shaving newbie, I honestly can&#x27;t say how this brush matches up to others in the same price range. But I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and it picks up lather well, hasn&#x27;t started to completely fall apart, and seems to have fairly good fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some issues. 1) It still hasn&#x27;t stopped shedding hairs. I suppose this is a minor nuisance, but every time I lather, I get at least 3-4 hairs in the soap, and at least one of those picks up and gets on my face. This hasn&#x27;t really caused major issues, but I really hope it stops shedding soon.&lt;br /&gt;2) The other issue is that the brush is still quite coarse. I wasn&#x27;t expecting super soft bristles, but I was thinking the hairs would soften after use and conditioning. It has yet to happen. But who knows, this may come about with further use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, there is a subtle animal scent to the brush. It&#x27;s musky, about what you&#x27;d expect a badger to smell like. It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant, but for those sensitive to scent it may be bothersome. As far as I can tell the smell doesn&#x27;t transfer onto anything, it&#x27;s locked into the bristles themselves, but it is something to note. But for this matter, someone that sensitive to scents may be better off finding a synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this brush has done a fairly good job and for the price it seems like it will last for quite a while. If it catastrophically fails, I&#x27;ll update the review, but I don&#x27;t foresee that happening.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and it feels very good on the skin. Five stars for that.</li>
            <li> This is my second shaving brush so I am by no means an expert. I&#x27;ll compare this to my other brush which is a van der Hagen (the one in the kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;This brush holds water very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The finish is sub par.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed some sort of brown residue out when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;The overall size it kind of small.&lt;br /&gt;There is an odd smell. ( could be the wood finish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very nice nice brush. Fast shipping. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smaller than most but a nice firmness for brushing and produces a better lather than others</li>
            <li> One first of the Art of Shaving, purchased a few things realized I made a huge mistake Amazon rocks it is the place to find great quality items at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the cheap Tweezerman one I had previously purchased off of amazon, despite the latter being boar bristle and this one being badger.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st experience with traditional wet shaving, so, while I don&#x27;t have the benefit of having used other brushes, this one works great for me. I&#x27;ve used it now for 2 weeks. It holds lather well holds it&#x27;s shape during use. Have used disposables with regular foam shaving cream in the past and have just recently decided to give traditional wet shaving a try. Like it, so far.</li>
            <li> This brush makes a real difference for applying warm water and shaving cream. I always get a more comfortable shave using it. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband for his birthday. Loves it so far. Gets a great lather. He was able to make his own stand but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the next item on his list!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any other shaving brush to compare this to since this in my first foray into wet shaving.  I truly enjoy shaving and using this brush.  It really allows me to get the shaving cream worked into my beard.  The only complaint, and really it may just be the nature of the beast, is I have used it now maybe 8 times and it loses several hairs everytime I shave.  I figured it would &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; a little being new just not sure if this is normal or not.  Otherwise I like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased. I love it, first ever shaving brush and it seems to do the job very well. Very good quality and extremely soft, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to buy my brushed from the Art of Shaving.  This brush was much cheaper and I feel the it is of the same quality.  I will be purchasing my brushes from here now on.</li>
            <li> Great Quality Brush!! I purchased this as part of a shaving gift package for my brother (he loves straight blade shaving!) He really loves this brush. It definitely lives up to the reviews. This brush will last a long time! Great quality!</li>
            <li> I was debating buying another brush after one I had used (different brand) literally fell apart and came across this one.  I noticed at first that the bristles were a little longer than my previous one and that helped me to get the lather made faster.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold as much water in the bristles as my previous brush, which is actually a good thing because I can better control how watered the later gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there is a slight &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away, but it works great.  The slight smell is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Great brush for price a little stiff at first but after a couple uses works like a champ..no need to spend the big bucks$$$$....</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft. Have not had any hairs fall off yet, but I have only used it once. Seems to help reduce irritation, which is my main purpose for buying the brush.</li>
            <li> Finally fed up with the mounting expense of buying the latest and not-necessarily “greatest” innovations in the disposable razor market, I discovered there are a few essential items I needed to buy before I could completely transform to using a safety razor.  A decent quality shaving brush was one such item.  The ESCALI 100% PURE BADGER SHAVING BRUSH proved to be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IT IS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Affordably priced, badger-hair shaving brush with a wood handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY PURCHASE A SHAVING BRUSH?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After decades of spraying gel into my hand to apply shaving cream, I never really gave shaving brushes a thought.  Using a shaving brush always seemed as nothing more than adding an expensive degree of sophistication to a rather mundane task (like using silk instead of toilet paper).  Once I started using a shaving brush, I immediately saw the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First of all, applying shaving cream with a brush simply feels better than using your hand as it messages the cream into your skin and helps generate a decent lather with little effort.  Brushing a warm layer of shaving soap on your skin adds a level of enjoyment to the shaving ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A decent shaving brush can retain enough soap and liquid to allow several applications without having to “reload”.  Using a brush, you can get more use from a smaller amount of soap/cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY BADGER AND WHY ESCALI?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I’ve read several articles and reviews regarding the positives/negatives of badger hair/boar hair and synthetic haired brushes.  The consensus indicates badger hair is best mainly because of its absorption quality, it retains water which is essential to the lubrication process.  While boar hair is a worthy substitute, it doesn’t retain water as well and has a reputation of retaining a noticeable odor.  Synthetic hair brushes don’t retain moisture as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I’ve been using the ESCALI BADGER BRUSH for over 5 months and I am quite pleased with its performance.  It is has a soft texture and retains enough moisture to generate a decent lather.  Yes, the brush does shed (all animal hair brushes will), but we’re talking a hair here-and-there, not in clumps.  Badger hair brushes are not cheap, but the price of the ESCALI takes the financial pain out of owning a good quality shaving brush.ite pleased with its performance.

            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it sheds between 5-10 hairs every time I use it. This leaves hairs from the brush in my shaving soap container, and when I try to wash it out, it also washes away some of the soap. Meaning the soap doesn&#x27;t last as long either. If I had to buy again, I wouldn&#x27;t. I bought a synthetic shaving brush after this one, and that fared much better. It only shed 1 hair but that&#x27;s a much better count than this one has going for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for nearly a year and only a few bristles have come off.  Still in the original shape.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for quite a few months now, about two times a week and it has held up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each shave I am sure to shake as much water out as possible, reshape the bristles then set out on counter to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and very few if any ever fall out.</li>
            <li> When I use this, I feel like what I would imagine Gaston from Beauty and The Beast feels like when he shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality shaving brush at a great price, buy it and start feeling like a man today.</li>
            <li> Cant be beat for the money.  Soft on my face and really lathers the shave cream up.</li>
            <li> Nice inexpensive Badger hair shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice wooden handle and fairly stiff hair. It comes in a plastic hanging display box keeping the brush safe during shipping. Like all brushes, it sheds a little. Having only read reviews and not tried other brushes from Amazon, I would say that this brush sheds less then others.     My only real complaint with this brush is that it smells horrible coming out of the plastic packaging. The smell is like that of cleaning solution for the hair mixed with glue (knot) and lacquer (handle). I have given it two good washings and used with shaving soap and the smell is still there. I think after another couple washings and continued use, the smell will be gone.     Otherwise, this brush does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is very good value. I have a best badger brush that is more than twice the price, and this one is softer.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Bristles keep falling out. Very annoying. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll stop.</li>
            <li> I am just starting out in double edge razor shaving and was looking for a well rated and inexpensive Badger brush. I chose the Escali because it had good reviews, was well priced,and I liked the wooden handle. Admittedly, the first time that I used it, about a dozen or so loose bristles came off - no big deal. There are probably some softer Badger bristle brushes out there, but the idea of spending $60 for a shaving brush seems a bit much to me. This one works well and is well made. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted at a third of the the price of other shaving bushes</li>
            <li> Loving Amazon Prime, I am trending back to the days of warm lather and a smooth shave. I got tired of cold shave gels and useless canned creams. If I am going to shave I am going to be doing it with style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this brush. Good brush for the price... it&#x27;s soft and helps make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Hairs are a bit hard when you brush it against your face, but after wetting it down and mixing the soap it becomes smooth.  There is a smell associated with the hairs (smells like the fur of an animal pelt); which might effect someone out there.  Other than those few things I can complain, it is a good brush.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I would buy again! #AuthorKarenJeanMatskoHood</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for a first time shaving soap user. Some of the hairs come out after use, seems like normal wear and tear to me.    Very soft and it really makes the whole experience fun and enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Very nice feel, gives a nice spread.</li>
            <li> I could not believe what a difference a shaving brush made in my shaving experience. I had bought an inexpensive brush from a local store and it fell apart quickly. Other brushes available at retails stores were quite expensive. I found this at a reasonable price and decided to give it a try. I was not disapointed. I have already purchased a second one as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> The hair section separated from the wooden handle.  The hairs are still together and I guess I could use glue and stick them back together, but that would defeat the purpose of having bought a product and expecting it to last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality, old school Shaving brush.  I like mine and recommend it! It works and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and I am glad to have found it. It is almost impossible to find shaving brushes in retail stores anymore. Walmart had 10 pkgs. of shaving soap and no brushes.Most other market and drug stores had nothing but shave cream. Sally&#x27;s Beauty had brushes but they were skimpy little things. Thanks for having a great product. I like to use your brush to apply shave cream to my face so it is nice and even. I ordered more brushes the second time so I could give 2 of them to my son.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the price.  A nice upgrade from the boar hair brush I was using.  Soft and builds lather like crazy.  The only problem I had with the brush is that it shed quite a bit during the first few uses and continues to lose a couple of hairs with each use.  It also seemed to bleed off some kind of dye from the bristles during the first couple of uses; nothing bad but noticeable.  I still use it daily and would recommend for a starter brush.</li>
            <li> Scratchy brush. Not soft at all. There are far better brushes out there at a similar price point.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, and the quality is excellent for the price!</li>
            <li> This brush sheds hair like no tomorrow, I thought it would break in eventually and after a 3 months it was was still shedding 2-3 hairs per lather.  I went over the brush with my hands and was pulling 20 loose hairs and more kept coming off.  I would recommend paying a little more and getting L&#x27;Occitane Cade shaving brush for $30, you can get down to $24 if you join their rewards program they will send a 20% coupon.  According to Shave Busta and The Traditional Shaving Evangelist that is a $200 calibre brush.  I love it myself the feeling of luxury is amazing on it.  If you&#x27;re looking in this price range I bought an Omega 10049 for $8.50 and I&#x27;m much more happy with that, it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the Cade but has much more capacity I would go with that way before this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I recommend for first time safety blade shavers.  does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brush, very soft and helps to lather the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fair price. Does the job well. I&#x27;m sure there are better brushes, but I can&#x27;t complain because of the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving and ordered the brush due to its high ratings.  I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands; however, it seems to be made from quality materials and its appearance is satisfactory.  Once in a while, it looses a hair, but nothing drastic or excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in no time, so the merchant, Perella&#x27;s - Amazon Marketplace, has done a great job!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic. I was looking for an inexpensive but high quality badger brush to start getting into wetshaving, and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips for new guys to wetshaving:&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure to hang it bristles down or lay it on its side, not handle down with bristles up.&lt;br /&gt;-You will lose hairs the first couple days/weeks from the brush, that&#x27;s ok. Don&#x27;t freak out, just keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;-When cleaning the brush after shaving (taking the cream out of the brush) be careful when squeezing, because you can lose some hairs from the brush that way if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When starting out, I recommend getting a cream, not a soap and here&#x27;s why. Creams are easier to lather, they moisturize better, and just overall create a better shaving experience. After wetshaving for a while, i&#x27;ve moved onto Colonel Conk&#x27;s shave soaps and they are excellent products that I love, but the creams of Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, and Cella are 5x better than Col Conk. I recommend starting out with a Taylor of Old Bond Street (I have Lavender which i really like, but i&#x27;d say go for Avocado or another scent that you find pleasurable) because it really just is a piece of cake to lather up and make an amazing shave. The con is that one jar of TOBS is around 15 bucks and I got my Col Conk variety pack (4 different soaps) for 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> A good solid shaving brush. Hairs occasionally fall out, but that&#x27;s usually my fault. It does a good job building lather and is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Excellent lathering, with a comfortable shave. A great combination of performance and price. Good enough for everyday shaving, and priced so that you can toss it into your shave bag for travel. A great value that compares well against the premium badger brushes.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;badger smell\\&quot; that some other reviewers have mentioned, but I sure did lose a lot of bristles with my first shave. I lost around 5-6 the first time. I&#x27;m hoping that it settles in, but I&#x27;m not too hopeful. The biggest plus is that it is super soft, and gave me a great lather! It&#x27;s definitely a good beginner&#x27;s brush (so it works well in that case for me...) but I&#x27;m more likely than not going to upgrade in a little while.</li>
            <li> It does the trick as a cheap brush. It&#x27;s a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product!  So nice to use.</li>
            <li> too bad there&#x27;s not a provision to rate it with less than one star. I washed it before using it for the first time.  It still smelled bad. I tried soaking it in a solution of dishwashing liquid and warm water for a few hours and after rinsing it i tried it out.It still smelled bad as did my face The logical explanation is that when the badger&#x27;s family discovered he was selling his hair they urinated on him in disgust.I have since placed the brush in an air tight bag and set it out with the trash.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, soft brush, holds lather well and is very easy to clean.  Only downside is that my cat keeps trying to eat it so I have to keep it in the cabinet!</li>
            <li> Great brush, word of advice wash the brush first with hot water and mild dish soap.</li>
            <li> To reduce my carbon footprint on planet Earth I have decided to switch to using a puck of shaving soap in a mug and use this shaving brush to work up a lather.  This shaving brush creates a thick lather directly on my face with a few flicks of the wrist.  Now I don&#x27;t have to dispense those steel cans of aerosol shaving cream anymore.</li>
            <li> Edit: After my initial review, someone from Epica contacted me and replaced the having brush. The new one seems to be working fine. I will update my review after using it for a while. If not for the product, you can buy counting on the help from the customer service for any of the issues you might have with the product  I started using this a couple of weeks ago and have used it only two times so far. The bristles have started falling off already. It&#x27;s a crappy product for the price paid. It foams really nicely, no issues there. But, one would expect the brush to last at least a few 100 times of use. But as it is, I feel like all the bristles will fall off before even I finish my 10th shave. I guess I got one of the bad products. See my edit above.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my uncle and he loved it! Great quality, good price. Arrived on time too!</li>
            <li> After a year I have noticed that it sheds a bit - but it still provide a really good base with your favourite lotion/soap.</li>
            <li> Have used this brush for 7+ months. Works great every time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as part to my travel kit. I was not impressed. It feels coarse like a boar brush. Even though I washed several times prior to use and after use it retains a slight unpleasant odor. At first &amp; second wash the rinse water visably dirty. Several bristles have fallen out but this is to be expected with a new brush. I&#x27;m going to purchase another Parker Silvertip as my travel brush.....</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for several months now and it has held up very well. I would recommend this shave brush highly.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with shaving with a brush and I absolutely love it. Although I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for a week, it has made my shaving experience a pleasure, so much so that I can&#x27;t help but lather and shave at least 3 times in one sitting. Gone are the days of using the local department store shaving creams, using my hand to apply it.. This brush does a great job of creating lather, exfoliating the skin, and eliminating those pesky razor rash cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can see, and it&#x27;s a minor thing, is that after a week&#x27;s use, it still sheds a few bristles in my cream, which I was hoping would have gone away by now ... maybe after some more use, it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: this is not my original idea, I give credit to someone else on here for this, but it works amazingly well. Drill a small flat head screw into the center of the end of the brush and use a small magnet to hang it upside down to dry under your medicine cabinet door. Like I said, it works amazingly well allowing your brush to dry, is cost effective, and saves on counter space.</li>
            <li> Great brush, softens up nice and gives a great lather, feels good on my face.  Nice looking and well made, does not shed bristles.</li>
            <li> I purchased an escali pure badger shaving brush from USA Vitamins and I am very happy with the quality of the brush. It holds water great and creates a thick lather, and shipping was also fast and easy. It was a smart buy.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Just switched from a synthetic brush. Big difference. Produces a nice fine lather.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best badger I&#x27;ve ever rubbed my face with. It creates a nice lather. The bristles are firm, yet supple.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of safety razors/DE razors/wet shaving.  Been using this brush for a few weeks, and I have no complaints so far.  I don&#x27;t expect it to hold up for a decade.  If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mentioned smell...maybe a bit, but not bad.  Shedding was mentioned as a complaint...I have had a few loose bristles, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this + Merkur 34C razor + Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades + Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave Soap &#x3D; a great shave!</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about six months ago. I began with one of the shaving soap kits that came with the soap bowl and boar hair brush. The brush fell apart after several months. I had decided to stick with wet shaving, so I began looking on Amazon for a better replacement brush. The Escali brush was by far the least expensive badger hair brush I found. I ordered it figuring if I didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d toss it and just upgrade. Well, I love it. It holds water much better than the boar hair brush did. It is very soft and comfortable. It whips up a mean lather and I&#x27;ve had almost no hair loss from the brush. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good shaving brush and not trying to spend money just to spend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 09/28/2013&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, and I&#x27;m still using it. Minimal bristle loss. Make sure you get a brush holder so that it hang drys with the bristles facing downward. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a mug and brush for several years. A year ago I returned to the old double-edge razor, and my old, cheap brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. It took off as much lather as it put on. The Escali brush isn&#x27;t very expensive, yet it lathers beautifully and, oddly enough, the lather stays on my face. This could revolutionize shaving.</li>
            <li> Lost my shaving brush of 14 years a few months age. Order the Escali brush as a replacement. The hair is not as thick around as my old brush. This makes it softer then my old brush. Would recommend the brush stand so the bristles stay straight. I got the wire stand at the same time as the brush. No problems with the order. Use of a shaving cup and brush makes a thinner lather that doesn&#x27;t clog up the razor like shaving foam does.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Exactly as advertised! Fast delivery and well packaged.</li>
            <li> We got this product super quickly, and it was perfect - a product of a small company, not a big faceless corporation.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat for the price. It&#x27;s not going to hold a cup of water but you generally won&#x27;t want it to. Has held up well for 3~ months and properly flaired.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaving brush! I am very satisfied by the quality and the overall construction of the brush. Some reviews stated that this brush had an odd odor after opening it from its packaging, but mine luckily did not. The brush spreads shaving soap very well on my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch or itch. Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent and quality brush for the money!</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price, but, I find the bristles not quite firm enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few weeks now.  The price is amazing compared to other brushes out there.  However don&#x27;t expect a lot for that price point.  The brush loses multiple hairs with each use.  If you are just experimenting with shaving with a straight razor and don&#x27;t know if it is for you, this is the perfect brush because of the low price point.  Just don&#x27;t be surprised when it loses hairs.  I figure I can upgrade to a nicer one later.</li>
            <li> I like it but the bristles keep falling out. I am currently looking for a replacement. I&#x27;m tired of having bristles left on my face.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive start to wet shaving, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  When I first opened the box, I was prepared for that NEW badger smell but to my surprise NO ODOR.  I use TABAC Soap or LA TOJA Cream and I get a THICK, SLICK and Protective  lather in five minutes, enough for three passes and some left over, The brush is not a water hog and produces plenty of lather. If you want good value this is it  I definitely would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not suggesting spending $80+ on some silver-tip badger brush, but this brush sheds every time I use it.  Not much volume, and the lather isn&#x27;t that great.  However, if you are looking for something to carry around while traveling, or want a spare brush, it does the job.</li>
            <li> great quality never leaves loose bristles on your face. have used other products in past, this is vastly superior. love it</li>
            <li> For the first couple of uses it smells like cat farts and hair falls off. But after the initial period of suffering, it is a great brush. I am using it with the body shops maca root cream and it works wonderfully. It provides a smooth and rich lather that gets under my bristles. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush a while and used it nearly daily.  I have not lost any bristles and it has maintained its softness.  Easy to handle, lathers well.</li>
            <li> Very, VERY pleased with this inexpensive brush.  Feels great and makes a ton of lather with Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  Nicely constructed; didn&#x27;t notice any shredding or &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; scent to the brush.  I&#x27;m now hooked on using a brush for lathering up.  It makes the facial hairs stand-up and much easier to remove.  Then it leaves your skin feeling soft.  Probably from exfoliating the skin as well.  This is a great &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> According to my husband: Perfect size, perfect texture, perfect price. Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but it broke after a short fall from the counter to the floor. Wouldn&#x27;t expect it to break that easy, but such is life. Decided to try a different brand when I reordered. It did the job while I used it and even while I was waiting for the new one to arrive, just didn&#x27;t have the handle to hold on too which made it a little bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> I have now ordered two of the Escali Shaving Brushes, not because the product was defective, but because my first fell out of my bag while traveling. I would recommend them for the wet shave beginner because they are low in price and get the job done easily. Of course there was some brush hair loss initially, but I assume this is normal. Also, I would recommend making lather once before you use it on your face, as the first lather was a bit...gamey. After all, it is made with animal hair. Nevertheless, this is a good brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It accepted the shaving lotion well and distributed it evenly. The brush feels good against the face. It rinsed easily and it looks nice. The quality is high. Overall, it matches the appearance of the photo and works well. Time will tell, so I will amend as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. It holds water well, gives a good lather, and feels good.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft which I was looking for and works great for lathering shaving cream on</li>
            <li> I upgraded to the badger hair model when my boars hair bit the dust. I had not expected it to make such a dramatic difference. Well worth the extra few dollars for badger. I would also suggest an exfoliating pad from Wal-mart (99 cents). My fiance has commented on the difference, which pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> I picked this brush up when I recently made the conversion from electric to a safety razor. I agree with the other posts that it did feel a bit prickly at first, but now is butter smooth. I soak the brush in hot water in my bowl for about 2 minutes while I brush my hair, etc. I&#x27;ve noticed that this will hold a LOT of water, so I have to be careful to get enough water out so I don&#x27;t have a thin lather. Initially there were several hairs that came out, which I expected. Now that I have used it 5 or 6 times, I think only one hair came out today. I can&#x27;t speak to the life of it yet, but I will amend my post if it seems like it is deteriorating prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not notice any smell, but I started with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream. Smells like grandpa when I was a kid, and I dig that smell. The brush took on the smell immediately, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> The only problem i had with this brush is that when i first began using it, it shed a lot of bristles, but htis turned out to be temporary because it stopped. It works fine now and gives an even application of the soap.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the leap into wet shaving, but was concerned with price and quality starting from absolutely no gear.  I did some research and decided to go with a badger hair shaving brush as part of my start up kit, and this brush has not disappointed.  Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have a huge base to use for comparison, but I&#x27;ve been absolutely pleased.  As expected, the first use or two resulted in a couple loose hairs, but since then I&#x27;ve had no issues.  I&#x27;ve got a couple months use so far and I&#x27;ve made sure to always dry upside down on a brush stand, and have no doubt I&#x27;ll get years of use from this brush.</li>
            <li> Works just fine and as advertised.  I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars since it had some finish imperfections and hairs pressed outside the collar, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it functionally.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment!  Great for whipping up a perfect lather in seconds and the badger hair does a perfect job of lifting all of those bothersome little facial hairs. Great product,  great price! A++++++!</li>
            <li> Fair price, good product,fast shipping.  This is the way it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li> The bristles bleed color and are limp, and hence whip a watery lather, rather than a thick and smooth lather. I have returned mine and have picked up a cheaper and better one from Target.</li>
            <li> I originally gave it three stars... That&#x27;s before I received a replacement , it does create and hold a good lather. Feels good on contact with your skin and good exfoliation. The draw back was there was hair everywhere....  Update Edit: Pleasently and unrealized by me the Escali  Brush has a great replacement policy. I was contacted by the fine folks that sell this fine product and sent a replacement. I unboxed the replacement and gave it a try. As with the first brush I used, excellent lather and great feel. The biggest surprise,  little to no hair release. 😉  Now this product lives up to all the great reviews I read. Moral is, sometimes you get a defect. But with people that stand behind its products, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Wholeheartedly recommend the Escali 100% pure badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Its decent for the price. The badger hair is alright. Very scratchy though. If it wasn&#x27;t it be 4 stars. Hopefully it wears in and stops poking. If it does I&#x27;ll change the stars to 4.  The size is a little on the smaller size. I would have preferred something slightly larger.  The wood handle seems to be very good quality doe the price. Very solid.  I dont hate it. I just don&#x27;t love it. (As far as boar goes this smells much better than boar but you can get more boar for the same price)  Its def an adequate brush.</li>
            <li> After about a year the bristles are starting to widen up.  I&#x27;ll push on a bit longer... probably 4-5 more months.  For 13 bucks that&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Had it for 5 months now. Has held up beautifully. Feels full and rich when lathered up. High quality.</li>
            <li> It works, but smells HORRIBLE for the first few weeks... Must be badger butt fur...</li>
            <li> Very nice and very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Seems good..not as full as The Perfecto, but the Perfecto is beginning to shed bristles heavily and I might throw it away rather than clog my sink..we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It drops a few hairs, but loads well and lathers even better. Highly recommend. Get some Sandalwood shaving cream too, ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into wet shaving. This is my first badger brush, so I&#x27;m not by any means an authority. I&#x27;ve had a few stray hairs come out while loading my brush, but overall it seems to be a solid build for the price. I&#x27;m using it with Proraso shaving soap and it works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> Seems to me there are brushes out there that will flatten out and become devoid of substance once you start lathering them up and swirling them on your face. This brush does NOT do that! This brush stays full during its use. No fuss no muss. Oh, and go ahead and try to beat the price, because if your at all practical and just a but frugal this is your brush! If you&#x27;ve got the money to spend 50.00 to a 100.00 on a shaving brush you wont be reading this review. Break it in and give it what you&#x27;ve got, then enjoy a great classic shave. I am so done with cartridge and can shaving! I am currently using EJ &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; DE razor with Taylor of Old sandalwood cream. Just the basics for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this for a couple of months so far and I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  It&#x27;s a high quality and handsome brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Soft and good brush though 1-2 hairs fall out during each shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Beats those hard boar hair brushes!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my boyfriend.  Though he loved it at first, he mentioned after using it a couple of times that the bristles were falling out and the quality wasn&#x27;t great.  It is pretty inexpensive though, so I guess that could be expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as a second badger brush to use while traveling and to have in another bathroom in the house. So far I cannot say I have any issues with the brush. The brush came on-time and as described, so time will tell how it holds up. I will update my review should things change.</li>
            <li> Great little shave brush.  I have been using this in combination with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this brush based on the top reviews from Amazon. The brush feels really soft and applies the cream pretty evenly and I do feel the difference between using foam/gel over soap + brush as it helps the soap reach the skin helping the razor endure lesser resistance during the shave. the 4 stars are because a few bristles would come off (Not sure if this is a normal process) and would get mixed with the soap. I&#x27;ll check for the same and update after at least 10 uses for some consistent data.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. It feels great and seems be holding up pretty well. Only thing is that I loose a hair or two when I use it, then again I am pretty rough on it. All in all it builds a nice lather so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> A real quality product. Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> excellent product and came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I decided to give wet shaving a try. I LOVE old school shaving but this brush left much to be desired. There is an old saying that goes &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;, well I purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t sure if wet shaving would be for me. While I love wet shaving I have met cats with medical problems that don&#x27;t lose their hair like this brush. It reached the point that I would pull twenty or more bristles off this brush before each shave and I still had so many come out in the lather on my face that is clogging up my razor. I have since switched to a higher end brush from Slate and I love it. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a high quality brush. Your face is worth it.</li>
            <li> Given as gift to son who reports it is a exactly the type of brush he was looking for.  Delivered in timely fashion as well.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed bought from all the positive reviews but the brush came in pretty bent up shape, the case it came in was all beat up and the brush was deformed many of the hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The brush stays in a mated down shape in the center. Despite washing it several times, it favors the mated state and dries in this fashion. Not recommended. Updated Review:  The Company responded to my 1 star review and sent another brush.  GREAT customer service.  This one is not matted in the center.  Still working on the smell of the brush slowly going away.  So far, so good.  I am pleased with the brush at its bargain price.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s not the best of the bunch. I dry mine upside down on a stand after each use and shave about every other day. It&#x27;s been about a month or so of use and it still sheds a hair or two on occasion, but it works up a fine lather and feels fine on the face. I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wooden handle instead of the usual resin one that you&#x27;d get at this price, and the loft is at a nice height.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I picked up when I got into traditional shaving with a DE Safety razor setup and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;At first it lost a few hairs but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;Now almost a year later this brush keeps chugging along strong. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great first brush to get.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush !  I have another from a &amp;#34;very expensive art of shaving place&amp;#34; and I think that the Escali brush is a bit better. Review by Charles, Elizabeth doesn&#x27;t shave with a brush.  :)</li>
            <li> Great, durable brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and soap foams up very well.  I think it is a great buy.  So far no issues</li>
            <li> I have suffered greatly using cheap brushes. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  works up an insane lather with any soap really.  one thing does need to be said: it is a tad bit on the small side.  i&#x27;m a small guy so it&#x27;s perfect for me, but i can see how this may be an issue for someone with really big hands.  i can&#x27;t imagine using another brush to be honest.  no need to drop 80 on those \\&quot;art of shaving\\&quot; stores.</li>
            <li> A very good entry level brush. As a new wet shaver it was nice to be able to get a goos brush at a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush. Very soft. Feels good on my skin. This is real badger hair. Tough to beat at this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased an older shaving brush at an estate sale, which got me started using a shaving brush. It always had bristles coming out and the plastic handle began to disintegrate. I started researching for a new, inexpensive brush and selected The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush. I have been very pleased. Amazingly, I have had only one bristle come out. The brush holds its shape, has a crisp feel on the face, and rinses clean while maintaining its shape. I cannot imagine this brush ever wearing out. It is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in using a shaving brush. Everyday I smile because I am not throwing another empty shaving cream can in the dump.</li>
            <li> I personally have never liked shaving. I find it a pain in the backside and I often have shaving rash. After trying many different products I have settled on the Escali badger hair shave brush and Colonel Conks Bay rum soap. What a revelation both these products are superb and I am getting the closest shave I have ever had in 20 years.I even look forward to shaving as it is know more of a ritual indulgence than a chore.Would absolutely reccomend to everyone.</li>
            <li> You wake up in the morning, still in your suit from the night before and a cocktail in your hand. You take your other hand across your chiseled face to be met with a rough 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. You look over at the beautiful woman in your bed and decide you must remove it before she wakes up. You head to your pearl bathroom, open the mirror and grab your Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush. You gulp down the drink still in your hand and begin to lather a thick foam with your brush. The soothing warm water and soft brush makes you completely forget you&#x27;re getting to old to party like that. After a relaxing shave you return to the beautiful woman in your bed. She can&#x27;t resist you. She caresses your face like it&#x27;s her first time all over again. You Sir, now have lady hands all over your face. And that my friend, is something you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this has completely changed the way I shave. No longer are the days of razor burn. For a budget brush, this product performs very well. Nice and soft with no smell that you sometimes read about with cheap brushes. I will be upgrading to a silver tip brush soon as I bought this one to test shaving in this manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a boar brush man because I prefer hard soaps, but I thought I&#x27;d give this little pure badger a try since the price was so low. What a pleasant surprise. It has none of the floppiness of the higher grade badger brushes (best, super, and silver tip), but it is still soft and thick enough to hold water better than the average boar. Being clipped to shape there is a slight prickly character to the brush at first, but it fades quickly with use. Likewise the shedding hairs and badger butt aroma go away after a few shaves. So, if you want a brush that will have a softer overall character than a boar but still has enough backbone for hard soaps, you really can&#x27;t go wrong paying $15 or so for one of these little Escalis. Try one and you&#x27;ll be lathered like a rabid dog in no time.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, shipped quickly.  Quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> A little sandpaper to remove the varnish eliminates the slipperiness in soapy water – making it a much better product.</li>
            <li> I know there are lots of wonderful reviews of this brush, but I guess I got a lemon. Unfortunately it has been a while since I bought this brush, and finally when I opened it to use it since my previous one had started to shed, I notice a big clump almost in the middle of the brush - it almost seems like there was a big ole&#x27; wart on the badger&#x27;s back and it got transferred to the brush past a lax quality control person (see picture). Not sure that I can do anything about it other than throw it away and go for a different brand.  Edited 8/16/2015 to reflect changed opinion: After I wrote the above review, folks from Epica products reached out to me. This in itself was nice, knowing that there is a manufacturer/distributor that cares enough. I was immediately sent a replacement brush, even though my review was for a purchase from several months ago.  I have since started using the new brush. It took a couple of weeks of &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; it seems. There was a smell to it initially, and the brush would not generate or hold enough lather. However, that all seems to have gone away now - the brush has started to work well and holds a good bit of lather. In fact, it is now upon me to educate myself further now that I have a functioning brush. I feel that I am washing away a lot of the lather that is still in the brush that would have worked better on my face. In any case, that does not seem to be the fault of the brush itself, and it is working as I expect it to.  I am changing my review to 5 stars from 4 (if there was an option for a 4.5, I would have said 4.5 to account for the initial &#x27;breaking in&amp;#34; period).</li>
            <li> good brush for the price... have used it more than a dozen times and no complaints so far... no smell and very minimal loss of bristles</li>
            <li> My dog likes it a lot, the badger hair drives him crazy! This is a good, quality brush!</li>
            <li> Good price for product.  Some minor lost of hair bristles initially but has kept its shape well.</li>
            <li> It may not be the best shaving brush out there but it works perfectly fine for me. I did have a few hairs fall out the first few times I used it but haven&#x27;t had any fall out for a while now. It isn&#x27;t the softest brush but it isn&#x27;t all that rough either and it gets softer the more I use it. Getting a good lather with it is easy enough. While there are certainly much nicer brushes out there I can&#x27;t see needing more than what this brush offers.</li>
            <li> I received this quicker than I thought I would have. I am very happy with it.  Overall this purchase was a good experience.</li>
            <li> i would not purchase this again. the hairs in the brush fall out all over te place. wgen i first used it i nded up with more hair off the rush than the hair on my face</li>
            <li> A great brush for a beginner or long time shaver; soft, lathers well, and rinses easily. It will lose a few bristles at first (like any brush), but after a few shaves it will hold together strong, even against intense lathering, and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Great affordable product !</li>
            <li> Great brush! Much cheaper than name brands but seems very good quality. Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very dirty and when I swished the brush in hot water it turned light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the bristles had never been washed, the wild smell of badger was very strong and you could smell it on your face after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several vigorous soap applications and washes the grime was gone and the smell was not as offensive.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad little brush. It&#x27;s just not a very good one. The hairs started falling out immediately. The handle is kind of cheesy. The knot really has no body to it so it&#x27;s no good for hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;For about the same price, I would go with a Parker. But if you really want something nice, look at the Simpsons.&lt;br /&gt;All together, kind of a waste.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a natural boars brush to start with....what a mistake! With a little guidance I decided on this relatively cheaper offering of a badger brush and it literally is night and day in producing a quality lather. Yes, you could purchase a higher quality badger brush for much more but as a beginner you could do far worse then this one.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden handle, badger brush that does its job.</li>
            <li> High quality brush at a great price.  Much better at lathering than the two brushes I have gone through in the past year.  I really like the firmness of the bristles and the way my skin feels afterward....even though I&#x27;m not exactly religious about shaving!</li>
            <li> It is a 5-STAR brush for the price......I understand why it&#x27;s the #1 best seller.  I had a cheap one that lost bristles and felt like a pot scrubber.....this makes shaving a pleasure!</li>
            <li> I am only a month in to shaving with a double edge razor.  I bought this brush with the razor itself and have used it about a dozen times.  For my first few shaves, the scent of animal hair was extremely strong.  It overpowered the scent of the shaving cream itself.  It took about six runs before the scent was gone.</li>
            <li> I was quite amazed with the price of this brush for the quality.  Definitely buy this one!  It&#x27;s so luxurious</li>
            <li> gift to my son and he loves it..</li>
            <li> Definitely feels like a cheap product (~$15) but gets the job done, and holds plenty of water.  Only complaint is the fraying/shedding that never quite goes away, though it&#x27;s easy enough to just trim it.  Not sure if this is true of all shaving brushes, but be sure to rinse it well afterward and dry it on it&#x27;s side or upside down, otherwise it develops a smell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.  If I did not know I was using a brush I would have had to look.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again, if I could do over. Sheds a lot, is quite rough on skin. A cheap brush, though for the same price you can get much better value elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to look for a high quality badger brush with challenging price, these are the best you can get!! They really worth more than you can imagine. I had like 4 brushes before this brush and after I&#x27;ve tried this I felt satisfied with the feel and the back bone so I throw the other brushes I had. I highly recommend it because of it&#x27;s premium feel for this low price. Love them.</li>
            <li> Very Soft and good shape. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Works good. Good and soft lil problem with the hairs falling out</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that reminds of the quality and craftsmanship that are so satisfying, and the shave, using one of the tube-based (not aerosol can) creams gives an amazingly great, painless shave.  I know it&#x27;s manufactured, but the quality is apparent nonetheless.  This method is so much better it makes me want to shave every day, which I otherwise do not want to do.  Very satisfied and won&#x27;t be going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li> I recently ditched my Gillett and started shaving like a man. This is my first shaving brush, and I am very happy with it. Some of the bristles come off during the first 3-4 shaves, but then its all good. Great buy overall.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because it was worth every penny and more this is my second brush but first Badger hair I love it and will get another if I ever need another one</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price. Would purchase again from supplier. The brush rinses out well and holds a good shape when soaped.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this particular offering -- incredibly quality for a much lower price than I expected, and with great reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot (as a gift, no less).  Was shipped incredibly fast, packaging was efficient, the price was basically unbeatable.  I&#x27;d be happy to use this seller again.    Notably, the handle fits into most holders at the concave part (as opposed to balancing it where bristles meet brush), and the bristles are of an excellent quality.  Very, very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> The brush spreads evenly and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have used a badger shaving brush military officers used to get for free - don&#x27;t remember the brand. That was by far the best than any others including escali.  The escali is great fit and finish. My only challenge so far is it leaving few hairs once in a while. I would say overall good for the price.</li>
            <li> Using a shaving brush may seem old fashioned, but once you try it you&#x27;ll never to back to shaving cream in a can.  Not only is it more comfortable but you&#x27;ll save money in the long run - one jar of shaving cream lasts a looong time.  Just don&#x27;t stint on the shaving brush.  I have two badger shaving brushes, one in my travel kit and one at home.  I use the Escali Brush every day at home and I&#x27;m very happy with it, it&#x27;s sturdy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shaving brush for the money. You could spend more but why?  The quality seems very high and so far it is holding up very well. If you have never used a shaving brush and safety razor for shaving you should. It turns a chore into a pleasure.</li>
            <li> This brush is just the product for giving oneself a shave that is a pleasure to took forward to.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes on an entirely different perspective with a lather made with this brush that makes your face feel good.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first shaving brush a couple months ago. Overall I am fairly satisfied with it. Here is what I like about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a lot of shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;- Retains enough water to mix the shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;- Applies the shave cream well to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave the brush four stars, and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has lost a decent amount of bristles. It has lost more than I was anticipating it would lose, and more than what others have said they lost.&lt;br /&gt;- This brush is not as soft on my face as I would have liked. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not perfect for someone else; just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is decent, but I think for my next brush I&#x27;ll spend a little more money and get a higher quality brush. However, I will say that this brush is a good starter brush for those new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I had been using an inexpensive boar brush, but the bristles started falling out. I got this Escali because of its good rating and low price. First time I used it, it foamed up much much better than my boar ever did. Definitely a win, and didn&#x27;t cost any more than my old boar-ing brush.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an OK shaving brush. It is neither good nor bad. The biggest issue I have with it is hairs are coming out of it in clumps and at this rate it will only last me a month or two at most. (And yes; I am treating it properly, hang drying it and not tugging on or twisting the bristles)</li>
            <li> I love mine! Disclaimer: It&#x27;s my first shaving brush. That being stated I did hours and hours of &#x27;research&#x27; before my purchase and chose this brush for value. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on something then say oops. In ten shaves it was soft yet obviously doing a great job with exfoliating. I hacked the softening process by soaking the brush MANY, MANY times in hot water with hair conditioner in it. Bottom line is I love the brush. I feel like it proved high price doesn&#x27;t always mean anything except high price ESPECIALLY in a specialty genre such as this where folks have taken a mundane, often hated, hygienic practice and turned it into an enjoyable hobby. You could easily take the brush we have here, stick the bristles in an ivory handle &#x27;made by virgin monastery stewards&#x27; or whatever and find someone who&#x27;d pay $599.99. Stay smooth!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush for shaving. It works so well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He was using a boar hair brush before.  He loves this brush! I find that he is willing to shave more often now that he has a nicer shaving set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a brush and cream, but I have to say so far I really enjoy it.  It is more effort then just using a can of shaving cream, but I find the extra effort is well worth the close comfortable shave I&#x27;m now getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the other reviews about the brush hairs falling out.  I did see some hairs fall out initially which I would expect from any brush with real hair (this happens with artists brushes using real hair).  After the initial hair loss, which wasn&#x27;t much, the brush seems to be holding up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this to really expensive brushes because I&#x27;ve never used one, so I&#x27;ll just say this one is great, and I feel a really good value.  I would definitely recommend this especially to someone new to this method of shaving.  If you like it, you can always purchase a nicer brush down the road, although I&#x27;m not sure if there is a difference.  If you don&#x27;t like it, you didn&#x27;t waste a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before dI picked  this one for husband as a gift  He really likes it  it feels soft and no smell like some others the price is great too</li>
            <li> It looks ok and works ok but the hairs just keep falling out. Worked perfectly in the beginning but now i hardly go a day without shaving and getting these brush hairs on my face.... a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;This is coming from a dude that absolutely has to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for the price. I decided to upgrade my shaving routine by picking up a Merkur Safety Razor and a pure badger shaving brush. I was looking around for a brush and through my research found that badger hair is supposed to be the highest quality. After my research I began looking for a price point, and was shocked to see that I couldn&#x27;t find one for under 40 dollars. After coming to Amazon.com I decided to take a chance on this much cheaper version, and like many of the other ratings before me, found it to be an amazing deal for the money. The brush is of great quality and makes me wonder how they sell the other ones for so much money. I am really happy I decided to go with this product as it makes lathering up my shaving soap much easier. I encourage you to go with this brush if you are in the market for one. It is the best deal on Amazon for this type of product.</li>
            <li> After my first brush (which came with the Van Der Hagen starter kit) stared falling apart I bought this one to replace it. This brush lathers up much better than my last brush, and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wear. It does have a slight animal smell, but only if you wet it and stick your nose right in it ( which I did for the sake of this review). It has a very modest look and price, which I like. Great value!</li>
            <li> Excellent shave brush, no foul smell, breaks in well, and creates a smooth lather.  I really enjoy this brush</li>
            <li> Actually, this is the third shaving brush that I have ordered. The others were gifts to my relatives. The brushes are well made and work well with either shaving creme or soap. A very good product with a fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and it&#x27;s solid. The bristles stay attached and it dries clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much fun brushing on old school sandlewood shaving lather.</li>
            <li> Well, there is not much to say . . . it&#x27;s a shaving brush . . . but, in today&#x27;s world I can say that I received what I ordered, it was exactly what I ordered, and attention to detail was demonstrated. If you are thinking about buying a shaving brush, buy this one, why, because you get what you wanted and the company seems customer orientated.</li>
            <li> My husband brought this brush and has been using it ever since. He feels that he brush is made well. Good product and costumer service from this company that makes the brush was excellent. It is a great present to give to someone who really enjoys the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> Three main problems&lt;br /&gt;1. Hair started falling off in a very first shave!!&lt;br /&gt;2. It stinks as well, didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s made out of real animal hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it. Anyways, it&#x27;s not good overall.&lt;br /&gt;3. This brush requires much more shaving cream than a brush I have. They claim high foam, but it totally wrong. [I&#x27;ve a brush made of nylon kind of material (some kind of synthetic material) which is much more better.]</li>
            <li> The first Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush I bought in 2012 and is still in perfect condition today after using it regularly and it never lost any hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now I needed a new shaving brush for my second home and ordered Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush from  Perella and I shall be very happy again.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent brush!!</li>
            <li> Hair keeps falling out and does not keep a shape that allows you to work up a good lather.  Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and lathers easily.</li>
            <li> This thing sheds about 5 hairs every time I use it, even after 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> Just purchased and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, Great price &amp; quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up quick and is soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. Gets the job done. Loses a bit of the brush hairs but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of time so far.</li>
            <li> Great real hair shaving brush at a good price- my face thanks you!</li>
            <li> What a difference this brush has made in my shaving pleasure.  I have always used the old school shaving soap and a brush.  This time I stepped up to a premier brush and the results are stunning.  I am not easily stunned.  I should have had a brush of this quality long ago.  I&#x27;m living in a very hard water environment where lather creation should be a challenge.  This brush makes all the difference.  Good money spent!</li>
            <li> The badger hair gives extra holding power of your favorite lather with smooth application and moisture content.  Well constructed and attractively priced too.</li>
            <li> Even though I have been using this brush for less than one month and stored it on a stand so that it would dry out thoroughly, the brush fell out of the wooden handle.  I&#x27;m going to invest in a more expensive, higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Brush works very well, it was cheap but of a decent quality. Once you use it a few times it fans out more and really works well, I highly recommend this if looking for a good inexpensive brush.</li>
            <li> I got this Brush recently, eventhough I am new to the DE shaving, (approx 1.5 years), I had a Prker Brush as a 1st one, that one fell apart as well, Yes I soak it in warm/hot water for 10 min + everytime. Cream lather was better on the Parker, this Escali is not that great of quality, it did ok as far as spreading the cream and getting the shave done overall, but not great quality. I got it cause its cheap just to see if it would be good. Well, no, the hait fall out like crazy, it looks and feels like about 5% of the hair fall out during every Shave, i have shave with it like 10 times to see the difference, and nothing same issue with the hair falling out. I&#x27;am Returning it and getting a Baxter of California Best Badger Brush, its made in Germany and will likely be a better product for me. If not will go to a edwin Jagger and try that. Amazon was extremely helpful with all the returns and assisting me. Im not sure where it is made but Im sure not US or Europe, likely China, doesent say in descriptions as to where its made, but the cost self-explains that anyway. If someone had a good expirience with this brush then Awesome! For that price you cant beat it, maybe I got a crappy one. I just know based on life experience(s), you get what you pay for!!! I have seen this in Cars, watches, Clothes, etc...etc...Same here. Look ate the $18 Parket Safety Razor, it works and will be just ok and good as a starter rezor, not take Merkur at $50 range, you can see the better quality metals and the better craftsmanship. You can hold a $500 Movado and feel it and look at the assembly, crafsmanship, etc... Then Hold a Rolex Or a Breitling, etc... I have done both with my own, nothing compares, nothing, same here.. It will always be this way... Hopefully this helps people in making a decision here, this Brush will still work for you, hopefully you get one that doesent fall apart, I would probably keep it for now if it didnt and leave a 4 start review, but thats no the case here.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Appears to be of good quality. Receiver loved it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is my first shaving brush so I&#x27;m not sure what to compare it to. Seems great to me. And if there are better out there this is still a great brush to get started learning how to wet shave.</li>
            <li> The fibers didn&#x27;t hold up</li>
            <li> Does a great job but I get a hair or two from the brush on my face EVERY TIME i shave. Kind of gets irritating, but this is my first brush so can&#x27;t really compare to anything. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the quality is much better than i expected for the price. Makes an excelllent lather. Used it around fifty times and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> I knew that this budget Escali shaving brush wasn&#x27;t going to compete with the more expensive models out there; however, it fit  well with my Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand and what it&#x27;s made to do it does it just fine for my liking. The wood handle is classic looking, which I like, and the badger bristles are soft. Yes it&#x27;s true that there are a few loose badger bristles left on your face initially and there&#x27;s an ever so slightly musky odor after you wet the brush but from what I&#x27;ve read both should subside dramatically with use. But even if they don&#x27;t I&#x27;m ok with that because it cost me less than $15 and it&#x27;s a good performer for the price.</li>
            <li> Wanted some shaving gear here for when my boys come to visit. This Escali Badger brush and some wonderful Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shaving cream did the trick. This brush has a nice wooden handle, holds plenty if water, and produces a beautiful lather. They loved it so much they bought their own brush and TOBS shave cream :))</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he just loves it! It makes applying the soap much easier (especially when you skip the bowl and go from puck to face). He is just starting with shaving with a safety razor and this is perfect for him. He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as I changed my shaving strategy from canned shaving cream and disposable blades to real blades and saving soap. This brush is made well, the wood handle is solid and feels right in the hand. During the first use it shed a few of the bristles which worried me, but I guess that must have been normal for the first time, because it hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle since. It creates a nice think lather and spreads it smoothly on my face. I rinse the brush thoroughly and let it dry, following proper care instructions and after a couple of months of moderate use, it conserves its original shape perfectly. I can say that I&#x27;m very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my father.  Since he uses a shaving brush everyday, I was looking affordability and good quality.  The quality of this shaving brush is very good and the price was just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Best part of an old fashion shave</li>
            <li> It applies my shaving lotion nicely on my face.</li>
            <li> This brush is really good, however after using it a few times the hair are kind of coming off of the brush.  I guess thats just normal wear and tear.  I would still buy this product again after this one goes.</li>
            <li> I love my shaving brush. Creates a fantastic lather. I would definately buy again. Will lose some hair at first until it gets broken in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush 4 times since I got it, but it seems to be a pretty high quality brush. 4-5 Hairs did fall off in the initial use (and maybe 1 or 2 since then) but I think I&#x27;ll attribute that to breaking it in.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs themselves are really nice and soft, and can really hold a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an upgrade from drug store quality and it was well worth it. Haven&#x27;t had this brush forever yet but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The product is good and I hoping that the hair loss for the brush will be minimal from on out. I lost about 20 hairs from the initial use.</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price. It dries quickly and does not shed much. It has a good feel on the beard.</li>
            <li> My husband took a step back a few years ago by switching to safety razors and shave soap - cheaper, less waste, all the good reasons.  The first badger brush I bought him lasted a good number of years but finally fell prey to a new puppy.  He&#x27;d been without for a while when I came upon this product.  Based on others&#x27; reviews of quality and value, I purchased this for him.  I have not been disappointed.  Quality construct, great lather, great value.  The puppy is over her \\&quot;eat everything\\&quot; stage, so I expect this brush to stay with us for several years.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I started with a boars head brush from the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]].  I highly recommend the kit for starters into the realm, but I&#x27;ll leave it at that, it&#x27;s for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unhappy with the lather my boar hair brush created, and I didn&#x27;t want to drop 60 bucks on the silvertip badger hair brushes.  When I found this I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is much finer than the boar brush, and does a much better job holding water.  It also creates and amazing lather.  The end is a little prickely compared to the boar brush, but if you apply with a brushing stroke instead of a dab -which you should do anyway- it works out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons.  As other reviewers have said, you should expect some hair to fall out, especially during the first few uses.  But if you accept that and keep using it eventually the hair will stop falling out, think of it as a break in period.  After that expect one or 2 to fall out every once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes you need to store it handle up, so I recommend some sort of stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give it 4 stars because off all the hair that came out at first, and because it is a little prickely.  Is it better than a $60 Parker?  Definitely not, but it is worlds better than a boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> I am loving my new method of shaving I \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; recently.  I am not sure why it ever fell out of fashion in the first place.  If I had one very minor thing I didn&#x27;t like, it would be the smell of the brush.  I realize it is Badger hair, but the first time I used it, WOW!  lol  The smell has since gone away.  I actually used some dog shampoo to wash it out.  On my next Badger hair brush, I&#x27;ll do that first!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush and I&#x27;d definately say it is softer right out of the box than ANY boar hair bursh i&#x27;ve used. I was a little suprised though at how prickly the tips were when I first used it despite its overall softness but it is getting sofer each time i use it and breaking it in helps alot! As soon as you get it wash it in soap and hot water then let it soak for an hour or so in sudsy water then shake it out, lather it up and leave it like that overnight - in the moning wash it out, lather up and WOW Softer by at least 50%! As to hair loss I think its lost like 5 hairs and Im not gentle in the lather process (I don&#x27;t use gels or creams - just soap cakes like my grandpap used). Hang the brush upside down to dry - it cuts down shedding and extends the life of the brush. This brush holds at least an ounce of water but a hard shake will remove that and a good squeeze will remoe even more. Unless the tips of more expensive brushes are WAY softer and last for years and years then I see no reason to spend $30 - $100 (or more) unless this brush falls apart in a short period of time. Other posters have mentioned an odd smell with this brush when new but I didnt notice anything too offensive when its wet - boar brushes on the other hand - oh yeah!</li>
            <li> First time using a shaving brush was this Escali. Does the trick but it does leave a couple bristles stuck to my face every shave and stings a bit when you have to dab with it. It&#x27;s not a particularly good looking brush but I suspect it is adequate for what you pay for. Good for a first time shave kit.  2015 Update: After about 8 months of use the coating/veneer on the wood began to delaminate which leave a flakey/sort of sharp material on the bottom of the brush. Also, since first use the brush was releasing hairs as a spread the shaving cream on my face. I thought that would stop but even a couple years later it still does it occasionally. I will admit this could be user error because I do not have a brush stand which may help moisture dissipate. I just run the bristles against a dry cloth and leave in on it side on the counter.</li>
            <li> The Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the real deal. Nice and soft while holding lather for a real close shave. Was shipped as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I am new to safety razor shaving, I got fed up with paying the high cost of the Gillette blades, so I got a razor and this brush and some shaving soap, first couple of shaves were a bit of a learning curve, but after three or so I am now proficient, I should have switched years ago I would have saved so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a quality product, a pleasure to use, and very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month or two ago and use it 1 to 2 times a week. Had some shedding at the beginning (expected) and smelled a bit when wet (also expected). The smell has mostly dissipated, I haven&#x27;t noticed it shedding lately, and the bristles are nice and fluffed out so I guess it is in good condition. It lathers my shave soap and applies it as well as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintain it by rinsing thoroughly after use, holding the bristles right below the wood when I shake it out, and storing it bristle-side down from a hanger that I bent for the purpose. I liked my shave soap before, but this little brush is helping me to love my soap.</li>
            <li> This brush works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and it does the job.  It lathers up nice and works the facial hair into place.  The first couple of uses caused some of the bristles to come out but this stopped after about five uses.  This would be more of a problem except that this brush was significantly less expensive that others that I found.  For that reason I give it 3 stars, its good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience other experience with badger shaving brushes, having just gotten into double-edged shaving. But it works very well for its purpose and seems of very high quality. Bristles are soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> very nice brush for the price. I had previously searched for other brushes, but was turned off by the price due to trying a double edged razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Exceeds my expectations. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical before ordering this brush, but after using it once I was convinced I made a good choice.  It produces a good, thick lather and makes shaving a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Man, that badger fur sure feels silky smooth on my face. Makes for a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The badger shaving brush is an elegant implement.  I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  Bought the shaving cream and brush, to bring me back to times when this was the the only way that you had to put soap on your face for shaving.  But, no way did that old stuff come up to this product of today.  Love it. Keep up the good  work. It is nice to buy from a small company.  Owned one myself.</li>
            <li> I have recently entered the double edge safety razor community. I purchased the Pure Badger Shaving Brush &amp; love it. It whips the soap up sudsie &amp; applies soap to the face just right. I stand it on end to dry.</li>
            <li> Works great! I was hoping it would be a little stiffer but non the less it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s worked pretty well. Holds water and lathers very well, and barely any loose hairs on it. It does seem to be losing its shape on the outside edge a little bit now after a couple of weeks but we&#x27;ll see if it gets any worse. For the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Even though the price was low, the brush seems to be well made and does a fantastic job building and holding a lather.  I would buy another and definitely will when this one wears out.  I also appreciate that no badgers were harmed in making the brush.  Ahem</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it! This is a great quality brush!</li>
            <li> This brush almost deserves a solid 5 stars; I&#x27;d give it 4.5 if I could.  It works VERY well at lathering up shaving cream (my choice is [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]]), holds a good amount of water, and is easy to rinse.  The only reason I&#x27;d deduct a half a star is that it was a little prickly against my skin during the first few uses.  This has gotten better with use; now I only notice this once in a while.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting used to it or if the bristles are softening up, but either way, it&#x27;s no longer a complaint.  Just wanted to let you know it&#x27;s not whispery-soft right out of the box.    A few things in response to previous reviews:  Some other reviews say it smells bad - mine isn&#x27;t bad at all.  If I shove my nose right against it immediately after wetting it, I can smell a hint of animal scent, but I&#x27;ve never smelled anything unusual during normal use.    My brush lost a total of about 3 bristles over the first few weeks of use.    And finally, a hint if you don&#x27;t want to take up counterspace with a special brush drying rack.  There&#x27;s hardly any space around my sink, so I didn&#x27;t want a dedicated brush rack, but I also wanted to prolong this brush&#x27;s life by drying it properly (bristles-down).  To solve these problems, I sunk a small screw into the handle of the brush (opposite the bristles), and stuck a small rare-earth magnet onto the bottom of my mirror/med cabinet.  Now my brush \\&quot;floats\\&quot; just under the cabinet - easy access, proper drying, and no lost counterspace. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for my husband.  He used it a half-dozen times and it completely fell apart.  The entire brush portion fell out, and hairs were everywhere.  I had also bought a stand for him to hang it on, so that the wood and bristles wouldn&#x27;t rot.  So much for that.</li>
            <li> Right size and weight.Absorbs the right amount of shave soap.Is gentle and dries well.</li>
            <li> My very first shaving brush. I don&#x27;t have any to compare it too, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Very first brush, decided to try this after using regular shaving cream, then shaving gels (Aveeno), then higher end shaving gels (Proraso), and now shaving soap (Proraso).    So far so good.  Not sure how long these brushes are supposed to last, but it is meeting my expectations.  Not sure how much of the shaving soap experience is affected by a decent brush, but so far I really like it with the soap.  Spreads over the face quicker (and head, I shave my head) than squirting gels/foams into hands and spreading.  Just paint on with the brush, then good to go.  Have seen some bristles come out into the soap, but this was really just when I started using the brush.  After breaking it in, it seems to not shed bristles anymore.</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price. Works just like the more expensive models. So happy I am ordering 2 more. One for my motorhome and one for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for the money. Have used it for a few weeks now with minimal loss of hair. I can get my shaving cream to lather quite nicely. One tip - soak the brush in warm water for a minute to get it nicely soft and ready for the shave cream. Then when done, wash it by running under hot water and gently squeezing the later out. Repeat a few times. Dry on its side or upside-down. Your brush will last longer.</li>
            <li> Honestly have no other brush to compare this to. However I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s stiff at first obviously, but after a while the badger hair gets soft and they have also stayed in the brush. So that&#x27;s a plus. Oh and it has thus held its form, it doesn&#x27;t look like an old tooth brush yet.</li>
            <li> The Escali 100% Badger Brush: you get what you pay for. This brush runs for about $12.95 and is a horrible choice for a starter brush. It works ok for bowl lathering but not for face lathering. It continues to lose hair, it will probably return it. Also, I find this brush to be scratchy, that is for a badger brush. Now, I understand that for a Badger Brush you would need to spend around $35 and above to get a decent one (everything I have found below that price point is just \\&quot;entry level\\&quot;)     If you really want an excellent Badger Brush, then, get ready to spend way more . For the same amount of money ($12.95) you can get a great boar brush (like the Omega Professional made in Italy or the Semogue Boar Bristle Shaving Brush made in Portugal. The Semogue is a better brush than the Omega) Either one of these brushes is superior than the Escali.    I just purchased the Semogue Owners Club- Boar shaving brush for $37 and it is better than most $70 dollar Badger brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a container of sandalwood shaving cream, a silver shaving bowl, an Edwin Jagger safety razor, and a stand to hold the razor and brush (just to give you an idea of how I&#x27;m using this item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the brush was delivered on time, looks as pictured, and is perfectly capable of doing its job.  It also fits in the stand I ordered, so that&#x27;s a plus.  The bristles are very soft and apply the shaving cream in a smooth, delicate manner, while also raising the facial hair slightly to make for a closer shave.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s as soft as those $60 silver-tipped brushes, but I can&#x27;t imagine the difference in quality is worth the price.  For 13 bucks plus free two-day shipping (with Amazon Prime), this was a great deal.  At first I was concerned that the bristles would not return to their original quality after getting wet and left to dry, but this fear was undue.  Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it two times, but the brush is still as soft as the day I got it.  Just make sure to rinse it thoroughly after every shave and give it some air to breathe when it&#x27;s not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is that the bristles have a slight tendency to come out of the brush and stick to the sides of the shaving bowl if I mix the cream too vigorously.  However, this may have just been a matter of breaking in the item, as this was only particularly noticeable the first time I used the brush.  While I&#x27;ve only shaved with this setup twice, the number of loose badger hairs I noticed on the second time was significantly fewer.  So it could have just been that I was getting rid of the loose hairs, and that now I will no longer experience that issue.  And even then, it&#x27;s hardly a problem, and the brush still applies the lather very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good item at a reasonable price.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Five stars!!!  It is an excellent product and I got it in a hurry.  I expect to use it for any number of years.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Brush bristles began shedding the moment I started using it.  At this rate, I&#x27;ll have to look for a replacement soon, as all that pure badger hair is going straight down my drain.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush. It&#x27;s not as bulky as some other more expensive brushes but it works really well. Whips up lather quick and thick (enough). Since the brush is not as full as some others, the lather tends to cool a little quicker than bigger brushes. Can&#x27;t beat the brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought a hgher grade brush but continue to reccomend this one as a starter for guys who are not sure about the traditional shaving route. It does the job and is noticeably better than the cheap boar bristle one I started with from CVS.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It works very well, I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and so far it&#x27;s holding up very well, it loses a couple of bristles every time you use it but not much to be a problem and is less every time.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and does the job. A few bristles fall out once in awhile, but the brush is still intact and works as it should. However, it&#x27;s very prickly and should be much softer. I&#x27;ve used other brushes and they were much softer then this, and around the same cost. And of course, the more expensive brushes are incredibly soft, and feel great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, awesome brush that exfoliates and gets the cream &amp;#34;underneath&amp;#34; the stubble...Great!</li>
            <li> Great brush well made, well balanced and shaped. Really love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and fastest delivery I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> This brush works very well. Not one hair has fallen out. No bad odors. highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself, then liked it so much I bought another as a gift. Excellent price, great quality, attractive design. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great texture--not too soft, not too rough.  Really works in the lather well.</li>
            <li> Occasional user for the last 5 or so years (same brush), the whole brush came off from the handle just a few weeks ago, but even then it still works.&lt;br /&gt;I had a boar bear brush before that sucked (the hairs would fall off constantly. This badger one is awesome, i even got one as a gift for a friend. Great price too.</li>
            <li> This may seem like a starter brush, but I don&#x27;t see myself parting ways for a long time. super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush/safety razor Ive ever used so I cannot compare it to any others but I definitely recommend this item. It feels great lathering up my face, I dont think ill ever go back to using canned shaving cream again. Also a stand would probably be useful, but I just loosely wrap mine in two pieces of toilet paper and keep it in the little cup I use to lather up the cream. Overall great value.</li>
            <li> So after forty years of using shaving cartridges, I decided to go old-school. Lathering up with a Badger brush and then shaving with a quality safety razor is pure joy. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase and the fulfillment service.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 80+ father ... he&#x27;s told me stories about badger-hair brushes all my life (his father had one over 50 years ago).  Dad was very happy with this gift, he loves it alot.  I should have done this long ago.  Thanks for this dang fine badger-hair brush!  My son will inherit this from his grandpa, which will mean more than gold to all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> Ordered the shaving brush to replace a brush that I had been using for fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;Had become very comfortable and attached to this old friend of a brush.  When I received the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Escali\\&quot; brush I was pleased with its quality and performance from day one.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was very well priced and shipping was prompt. Five star transaction!</li>
            <li> This Brush works just like you would expect it to. Craftsmanship is great. The brush creates a nice lather from a bar of soap. Thank you for this brush</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush. I have used it several times and it has worked great for the price. Would recommend this brush for any beginner.</li>
            <li> Good entry level brush for me as a novice wet shaver.  Gave up a few hairs the first couple of uses, but holding steady now. I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks - so far so good.</li>
            <li> The product works just as it should, arrived on time, and exceeds all of my expectations. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shave brush for my husband.  He hasn&#x27;t used it too many times as he was finishing up some shaving cream.  But he has tried it once or twice and is happy with the quality.  It lost a hair or two upon his initial use which he said is to be expected; he&#x27;s a barber so I assume he knows what he&#x27;s talking about. It would have gotten 5 stars if my husband had used it more than once or twice. It arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li> Does the job great. Bought it because it was recommended by a youtube video and honestly I couldnt be happier. I can get a nice lather going right in a mug and massage my face before taking a blade to it. 5 out of 5</li>
            <li> I love for shaving! Just like old Granddad! Smooth easy shave. I highly recommend it for others. I would buy it for a gift such as a stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> The handle has already cracked within 1 week. The brush itself works great. But I&#x27;m guessing the handle will not last for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 other brushes and hair came out in less than a week . no problems here, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It looks good and will work fine. I originally purchased this as my travel brush and it has a more notable smell of badger than my Parkers. It lost more hair than my Parkers. I prefer to loose the smell and not loose the hairs and therefore lean towards my other brushes. I have since given this one away to a friend and he doesnt mind it but, hasnt had others to compare. Many people buy this as a first brush as well as the tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad stepping stone but, just know that the Parker is a large step up for only about $10 more. Beyond that there are some in the $100 range if you get really into the wet shaving lifestyle and even vintage restored brushes that can be had for collectors.</li>
            <li> My husband had wanted to change his shaving brush, went to the mall and was asked to pay $150 for a shaving kit - that has a brush in it but also other things that he would not need. Shaving brush $150? He then asked me to help get him one. I logged onto Amazon and found the Pure Badger Shaving Brush with the best and most reviews. I proceeded to buy one. When it came and he tried it, he was full of thanks to me and promptly asked me to get him another one, which I did.</li>
            <li> Must have gotten a bad one that somehow passed quality control.  I was favorably impressed by reviews but the product I received rapidly lost bristles and &amp;#34;flattened out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got this brush two weeks ago. My first shave was not pleasant, the brush SMELLED horrible and a lot of badger hair fell off. To get rid of the smell I left the brush in fresh squeezed lemon juice for an hour. On my second shave only 2 hairs came off and the brush barely smelled. On my third shave NO hairs fell of and it did NOT SMELL at all. This brush holds the lather well, keeps its form, its affordable, and its easy to clean.  This is a great starter brush, it&#x27;s definitely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> So far this does a great job. No shedding, no weird smells. Solid build feels good in your hand. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really liked this shaving brush. The bristles hold moisture well creating a rich lather that has made my whole shaving experience such a joy! The seller also did an awesome job with the delivery.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit smaller than I anticpated, but that would be an advantage when packing it for travel. However, it works great. Forms a good lather. Bristles are softer than the boar hair brush I was previously using. It shed a couple of bristles but not as many as the boar hair one did. Have to slightly adjust the amount of cream used vs the boar hair brush. Only used it 2 or 3 times so far, but the quality seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush does exactly what it is suppose to do. I think that is enough said about that. A very good shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush serves its purpose.  When you first use it, you&#x27;ll end up with lots of badger hairs on your face!  But over time the loose hairs will work themselves out.  Can&#x27;t complain, it works well for the price.</li>
            <li> Product is of high quality and the shipping service was on time. A few hairs came out the first time I used it, but after that it creates a nice, rich lather and helps to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> Just bought the brush. Quick delivery. What a comfortable shave. Superb product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day along with a new razor and shaving cream. He loves the brush</li>
            <li> Great product. Good value for the money.  And, an opportunity for you to support a small American business.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs in the beginning, works great now.</li>
            <li> This item I purchased was received into my possession in excellent condition. Packaged well. The brush is in perfect order and extremely well made. The instructions on the pack are clear and concise.Thank  you for a fine product, and please congratulate your staff on producing a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;Regards from New Zealand. Peter B</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, however this is my first and only brush that I&#x27;ve used so I have nothing to compare it with.  I use it with a cup and Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream.  I&#x27;ve use now for less than a week so time will tell, but for now it works great.  It does loose hair occasionally, 1-3 each time I use it.  This may be normal for a new brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping and delivery were as expected. Brush quality is excellent and good value for money. The brush is small is size to takes some time to get used to. Might be difficult for someone with large hands.</li>
            <li> Very new to wet shaving so I thought I would try this item. Reasonably priced and works real well. The first few times I used it it lost some bristles, just a few. I haven&#x27;t lost any as of late. I would recommend this product as it just works fine unless you want to spend the money for something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as an upgrade from an older boar hair brush I own. I had wanted to not go out right away and buy a $70+ brush right away and so I found this one which was great! In fact this one was priced below some other boar hairs I had seen. Figured for this price I could give it a try. Brush feels great and has no smell that I&#x27;ve heard of some people having with brushes. Only thing I noticed is that I lost quite a few hairs the first 2-3 shaves with it. After that it has been shed free. I suppose that may be the trade off from the higher end brushes but I&#x27;m very happy with it. Gives a great lather! Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving, and boy did I change the entire experience with this product. I literally love shaving now, I can use the crappiest razor and cream, yet this brush layers it on so smoothly that the shave is perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving brushes but thought I&#x27;d try. Brush arrived on time and is exactly as advertised. It feels good in my hand and is made well. Iv looked on amazon and this is the best price for a genuine badger brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I came across this brush.  I had a cheap synthetic brush that came as part of a set that I was using.  I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  This Escali brush does a great job.  I get a much better shave and best of all it doesn&#x27;t shed like the old one.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few weeks back and have no issues as of yet. Yes, there are a few hairs that fall out in the beginning but that goes away. As mentioned by other users this must be stored brush side down. Any water draining into the handle over time (if stored upright) will aid in it falling apart. I drilled a hole and epoxied a rare earth magnet for &#x27;sticking&#x27; it upside down underneath my sink. :) Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for my husband&#x27;s shaving kit. Lathers well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into the more ritualized aspects of shaving, and I am loving it! This is a nice brush so far! I can&#x27;t really speak to the long-term durability of the brush, since I&#x27;ve had it for only a couple of weeks, but in my regular shaves, I am loving it; the badger hair is tough enough to give you some tingle and agitate the hairs to stand on end while remaining soft enough that it does not irritate sensitive skin like a boar&#x27;s hair or synthetic brush would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Only complaints are that it looses hairs easily and smells a bit like a taxidermy shop (made from badger). I guess I appreciate that the fibers are authentic and that they didn&#x27;t use a bunch of chemicals or fragrance to cover the sent. Does as it says and works.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet shaving brush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I didn&#x27;t want to go \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; until I was sure that it was something I would use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the brush every day since I bought it about 2 weeks ago.  A few bristles have been lost, but certainly not many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush to new wet shavers or anyone looking for a bargain brush.  My only wish would be that it came with a stand to hang/dry.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because on the average day about 3-4 hairs fall out of it. Nothing major, but it worries me slightly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now though so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush, so I have no comparison, but it seems a bit scratchy and perhaps poorly made.  As I said, I have no real comparisons for it, and it does  do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles on a smooth finished handle perfectly suited to shaving soap bowls.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. Its leaps and bounds better than the synthetic brush I have been using for years. I have only used it once and it is a bit prickly but I didn&#x27;t shed any tears using it. I was in a store in Dallas, Tx a few weeks ago called The Art of Shaving, and picked up a brush they had on display there and ran it across my face. It was super soft and much fuller but also $180, so I will keep this brush. Their was some shedding, two maybe three bristles, but I assume that&#x27;s normal. I read some other review about it smelling but I didn&#x27;t notice when I used it, so I just went and checked it. It was still wet from this mornings use, 13 hrs ago, I guess I need to take more care drying it because I hung it upside down. It did have a very faint wet animal smell. I have never owned a badger brush so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not, it is badger hair. I think any shaving soap/cream will mask the smell. All and all I am happy with this brush and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I confess that this was a late-night impulse purchase, added because Amazon suggested it would be a good companion to some double-edged blades I purchased (100 box of Blue Personnas -- love them, too!). When the badger brush arrived I wondered how often I would really use it, and the answer is: every day.  The first two or three uses it had a bit of an odor, and shed a few hairs, but now it keeps all its hairs and smells great. Foaming up the Escali with some good-smelling shaving soap or shaving cream is one of those small luxuries that make time stand still in a busy day. Technique: I fill a coffee cup with hot water and place the badger hair brush in it while I shower.  After, I shake out some, but not all, of the water and put a dab of cream in the bottom of another cup.  It takes 30 seconds to foam up enough for a two-pass shave.  It took a little bit of practice to learn exactly how much water to leave in the brush, and it turns out I like a little more water than most men.  If you have read this far you deserve a small award.</li>
            <li> Being new to the safety razor, and  first time using shaving cream, it should be noted that I&#x27;m still learning the art of application.  So the shaving brush works as promised and by most accounts, reviews do say that the brush will shed initially.  So, with that in consideration, I have been using this brush for only a short time and it does most certainly shed, to the extent that I had to fish out the hairs out of the shaving cream bowl as it was looking rather uncouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I refine my shaving technique, along with the breaking in period of the brush will result in less hair loss from the brush.  I may be inclined to score this brush higher once I know it will maintain the remainder of its hair.</li>
            <li> Nice to use to apply shaving soap. Good little brush. Seems to be holding up well. Haven&#x27;t used it for too long so time will tell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a present for a friend, and he loves it! It is a great budget buy for the price, quality is acceptable for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal for the money, it looses one or two bristles here and there when using it but for the price I can&#x27;t argue. It&#x27;s a nice brush, I&#x27;ll probably buy another once this one is shot.</li>
            <li> Love this Badger shaving brush. There were a few hairs that fell out with first few uses but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is vastly superior to the boars hair brush it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is great too!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. It is easy to apply the shaving cream with it. The contour of the handle and the softness of the bristles , is very comfortable. This is a very good product for the price. I actually enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> This brush works well. It is still shedding after about 6 uses, but I&#x27;m hoping that is about finished. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into the whole safety razor and shave soap thing and i must say it works fine for what its made for.  I am no expert or anything, so i can&#x27;t say too much but it has worked as well as it says.  It did shed a little for the first couple uses, but the boar bristle one i had initially did also.....i guess that isnt uncommon?</li>
            <li> The Escali shave brush was a great deal, 100% Badger hair. The Escali shave brush holds a great deal of shave soap and enables you to get a good lather, with very little effort. Thanks, for a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of boar in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> Liked it. Purchased much more expensive brushes in the past and honestly the more expensive brushes were better. BUT, for the price this is a great deal. It sheds much more quickly than costlier brushes. STILL - I like it, if not for the shedding of bristles I&#x27;d give it a four-star rating.</li>
            <li> good product at a good price.  shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This is the third shaving brush I&#x27;ve bought in the last year or so, and it is by far the best of the three.  Very soft and yet is loses very few bristles.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product is not the best out there, but for the price tag it sure has one of the highest quality/price ratio. If you can&#x27;t afford to spend 40 dollars on a Shaving Brush, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Works great and is high quality.</li>
            <li> I think I made a good choice with this brush. It works well, dries quickly, and I very rarely lose any hairs out of it even with some heavy lathering. So far it&#x27;s held up well and hopefully it will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> Seems well made but a little too soft.  It splays out and makes it difficult to put the soap where I want it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great gift!</li>
            <li> The brush applies saving cream to my face. It hold its shape after rinsing if hung or laid on its side, I&#x27;ld buy the brush again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Escali Badger Shaving Brush as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  He has used it without complaint, it&#x27;s not prickly, and is holding up well. I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> Got this brush and immediately it started loosing the bristles.. I would have a sink full of hairs. Will probably have to replace it! The one I had before this lasted 20 years ...bought from the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Brush works just as hoped.  The bristles are a bit coarse but apparently need to be for lathering up well.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face - and definitely help to lather the shaving cream 300% better than using just your hands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to help get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving, and was recommended this brush, I&#x27;m no expert, but this brush does what it&#x27;s designed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds just enough water, I feel like it dries pretty fast. when I first got it a few hairs of course fell out, this is normal. it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stab&amp;#34; my face when I lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great brush, and especially for the price. If you are on the fence, go for it!</li>
            <li> As a guy who just started shaving using safety razors and shaving soap,I found the Badger brush to live up to my expectations by making the process alot easier.</li>
            <li> I switched to using double edge razors from the expensive cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I had bought one those boar brushes from Walmart. I did like that brush, it was stiff, itchy, and plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is great. (:</li>
            <li> I have been a blade shaver all my life and used different brands of mug soap.  But, the soap is only half the key to a good shave .. the other half is a good shaving brush and the badger brushe from Escali definitely fills the bill.  Builds a good thick lather and will stand up to years and years of daily use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is a great value - its price is the best I could find, and after more than a month of use, it is still in terrific shape.  I&#x27;m very please with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The Escali badger shaving brush is a good product at a very good price. I have two boar brushes and wanted to try a badger brush after reading multiple reviews and understanding badger bristles are better than boar. The Escali badger brush lathers well and holds lather well. I have used it with three different shaving soaps/creams and it performs well with all of the. I wood recommend this brush ad a good entry level badger brush.</li>
            <li> Like the wood handle, the badger hair tends to shed initially. In the end this brush makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, high quality badger hair shaving brush.  The brush is well constructed and is very easy to load with shaving soap (I use Tabac) and creates a great lather.  Looking to move up from a boar hair brush?  This is the next step. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend on his birthday and it was definitely one of his favorite gifts. He uses it every day with a Merkur razor and just bought himself a stand so it can dry upside down and stay in great condition. It&#x27;s a high-quality product for the more refined gentleman&#x27;s shaving experience!</li>
            <li> I like everything about this brush except for one thing... the size. Much smaller than I anticipated. The bristles feel incredibly soft and offer a good amount of lather but I do have to go to the bowl about 4 times for the amount of lather I need to shave my entire beard, compared to only 2 lathers from my other brush (which is regular sized).</li>
            <li> great brush. none of the hairs have started falling out yet .lol&lt;br /&gt;you cant go wrong for the price.&lt;br /&gt;10-8-17 time for a new one. Hairs started falling out</li>
            <li> Love it so far! Had no idea what a difference it would make. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  The metal ring around the rim is a nice decorative touch.&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems high quality and I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to get a great lather by using this brush and it feels smooth and comfortable while applying an even coat to my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that it is expected that some hairs will fall out on the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;Also, expect a pretty potent smell on the first few uses.  Wet badger hair isn&#x27;t a good smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a stand to go with this brush so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush and what a difference a real brush makes! Great entry level brush, and even though it loses a few hairs each time I use it, for the price it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s just a shaving cream brush, but I have to admit, it&#x27;s quite a shaving cream brush. It lays down the most uniform lather on my face in comparison to any of the non-Badger hair shaving cream brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;m really impressed. I think the \\&quot;physics\\&quot; of Badger hair makes all the difference in the world. Bottomline...this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love it. When I&#x27;m using it to apply my Proraso shaving soap, I feel just like in the barbershop. This is a MUST if you want to enjoy shaving. The brush is just the right size and it feels very comfortable in your hand when applying shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for me, one for my dad and another for my brother. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good.  You have to make sure you soak it in hot water for about 5 minutes otherwise it feels prickly on your face.  Quality is very good for the money and shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It only requires you to use a small amount of shaving cream to cover your face.  It is a better quality than most of the cheaper, store bought brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> Loses hairs on a regular basis, has no rigidity, doesn&#x27;t build lather well, pokes into the skin even more than bear hair brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the past couple of years and they&#x27;ve been great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Forget the shaving cream cans.  The good old fashioned way of lathering using a brush and a good shaving soap gives you a much more comfortable shave than the foam from the cans and is more affordable over time as well.  This is an excellent brush.  Badger is the best for this application.  You can pay more for fancier handles, but they won&#x27;t work any better for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product for the price. The handle is a nice wood and the badger hair is of pretty good quality. The only complaint I have is that the hair falls out more than I would like. However, this is not really an issue for me. My brother and father have purchased $100+ brushes and they are better, but not so much so given the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my other in a hotel room so I had to purchase another and the second product is of equally high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of use, the bristles have started to fall out. Still pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good brush, the hairs are gentle, they apply the lather well. I am currently expecting a base that I forgot to purchase, you must have somewhere to hang this brush upside down for it to dry properly! The price was ok, everything came as expected. I would recommend this brush and am planning on purchasing it along with some more shaving supplies to give as a gift to my dad.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here.  This is a solid badger hair shaving brush.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, the bristles are nice ands soft (especially if you soak them in hot water), and it is very inexpensive.  The build quality is very good, especially for the price.  If you are looking for a no nonsense brush that is inexpensive while still having the luxury of badger hair, this is the brush you want.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. High quality. Extremely soft. Price may be low but the quality us high.</li>
            <li> excellent brush especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  The handle fits your hand easily and the brush holds water and shave-cream/soap well.</li>
            <li> Decent brush for the money but my was still losing hair after a few months of use. Gave it to new wet shaver who seems to enjoy it more than I did.</li>
            <li> So far works perfectly</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Top quality</li>
            <li> The shaving brush was delivered on time, but within a day of using the brush for the first time the wooden handle suddenly developed a significant crack down the length of it. I thought I was getting a top quality brush, so was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Holding up very well for its price, great value!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an excellent badger brush. It shed a 5-10 hairs per shave for the first 3-5 times I used it. Now, it only sheds a hair or two every once in a while. It&#x27;s not very thick in diameter, meaning it&#x27;ll only hold enough lather for two, maybe three passes. I usually have to re-load the brush after two passes. This is nowhere near as soft as a silvertip badger brush, but you probably already knew that. It&#x27;s a great, cheap brush for beginners, though.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong if good care is taken. Good care meaning drying upside down. Excellent brush that will last long</li>
            <li> Great. Brush, Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Brush was delivered on time.  Very pleased with the brush performance relative to my previous synthetic brush.  I waited a few weeks before writing a review in order to give an accurate account.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can not believe this item is rated above a single star. This is the worst brush I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I&#x27;ve been using badger brushes for the last 15 years. I returned it after 1 use, thank you Amazon for having a good return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush smells horrible, literally like animal urine (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s from a badger, but really who knows?) I washed it repeatedly but nothing was going to get rid of that smell. The brush itself is not soft and I had trouble distributing the cream.</li>
            <li> I Bought this brush because I wanted something inexpensive when I traveled. I was very surprised with the quality and would have bought this as my first everyday brush had I&#x27;d known,</li>
            <li> little stiffer than i expected, good for the price.</li>
            <li> This distributes shaving cream evenly. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this badger brush; it lathers up soap well, with nice stiff bristles for application. I use it with Proraso eucalyptus and menthol shaving soap, and it works great. It did lose a few hairs with the first half dozen uses, but seems to have settled out thereafter.</li>
            <li> Just changed to safety razor and ordered this brush to go with it. Product was as advertised and I have been very happy with it. I enjoy the process of lathering my face and using the safety razor. This brush works well with the soap I am using.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made, the bristles are soft and dense. My son loves it!</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving brush for many years.  Most of my Brushes and shaving soap came from the local drug store.  I have started buying my supplies on \\&quot;the net\\&quot; and the quality has increased over the Drug stores.  This brush along with a good shave soap (I use a Sandalwood Soap) gives me the shave I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> The brush is smooth and still has perfect edges to lather.  I would highly recommend this brush because of the great price and look.  I am sure there are more expensive and technically better badger brushes our there but this one is ideal for all shavers.</li>
            <li> I first noticed that the finish on the handle was poor.  The varnish did not dry evenly.  I almost returned it for that reason alone but it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to go to the post office.  The brush also has a lot of loose hairs even after a month of use and drying it upside down as recommended.  It&#x27;s annoying to find a long badger hair mixed in the shaving cream on my face while shaving.</li>
            <li> very nice product. Quick delivery. The brush is good quality and it is just the right size. I would buy another one if I needed it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush. It works well and is very soft. Definitely does a great job at providing that old timey shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my travel kit and it has turned out to be the perfect addition.  I needed an inexpensive brush for carry-on and travel that was sized accordingly.  This brush does all of that!  As other reviewers have noted it has the smell of a new brush on first use, not uncommon for hair brushes, and may be reduced by washing with shampoo before first use.  It has not shed but a few bristles and continues to serve me well in my travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the price and performance of this brush for a travel or primary brush, or if you are new to the wet shave experience.  Hands off to Parella&#x27;s for finding this gem!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed a very satisfactory experience using Perella&#x27;s - Amazon market place to purchase a new shaving brush and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> was given as a gift and it is far better than what they had. Would definitely recommend this product and company</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when buying this, because the price is so much cheaper than other badger hair shaving brushes out there. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and used it maybe 15 times (I don&#x27;t shave all that often as I like to have stubble or a little bit of a beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked great. I think it lost a hair or two initially but nothing since then and it does a great job working up a lather. Time will tell how it holds up long term, but so far it seems great. For the money, I don&#x27;t know that it could be beat.</li>
            <li> Great brush with vintage allure! My dad loves it.</li>
            <li> Buying this brush and using it has made a chore a little less of one...I recommend you try this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 2 weeks now, and it seems to be breaking in.  It felt scratchy at first, but now, when I apply my shaving cream, it creates a nice lather and seems to be doing the job, and is at a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;m now trying the Schick Hydro Sensitive razors, as the Gillette Fusion Power razors have become way expensive, to the point of being ridiculous, almost $4.00 per cartridge at Costco, and almost $5 at other retailers.  So I have a new brush, new shaving cream, Dreadnaught, and a new razor, and I&#x27;m achieving an excellent shave, comfortable, smooth, and economical.  Try your own razor, this brush, and your own shaving cream to see your own results.</li>
            <li> A decent shaving brush for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have ordered; you might be asking why in the great land of shaved faces is this guy giving it five stars if this is the second one he is ordering.  Well i can tell you its not because of the day my doberman got a hold of it and uses it as a toy, barely lost any bristles that day being this brush is built so damn well, nope I ended up leaving the damn thing at my sisters while visiting her and now her damn husband has claimed it as his property.  So here I am getting a second one and planning sweet sweet revenge.</li>
            <li> Works well, smelled like a wet dog or i guess a wet badger for the first use, and a few hairs fell out but thats alright.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and it works well. No smell. Very soft. Purchased from Perella&#x27;s and I experienced a fast and well-packaged delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the only shaving brush I&#x27;ve used, but I have no complaints. Been using it about 2-5 times a week for 5 months, and it&#x27;s still in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, there were a lot of loose hairs, but once they came off the brush was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use I wash it out to remove all soap, shake the water out, then swirl on a towel to dry and restore the shape. Then I store it laying on its side. This has kept the brush in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have used this almost daily for several weeks and it seems to get the job done. I would rate it higher, however, it continues to lose several hairs with every use.</li>
            <li> Not a good brush. Leaves brush hair after every use and does not lather up well. Brush clumps up in the middle and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly. Spend a little more and get an Omega and/or synthetic hair. Decent for wet shave starters because it is cheap but that is about it.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  The handle feels good in the hand as you apply the shave cream.  The brush bristles feel great as they apply the cream.  Cleans easily and has so far maintained its shape while drying with the stand.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I can not compare it to any other one, but I like it a lot, I like the smell, the size is ok, good quality , I have used it so far like 10 times and only the first 5 times aprox it would loose around 3 to 5 hairs each time, after that I only see 1 loose hair each time I use it. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a basis for comparison, but the brush seems well made and does a great job of working up a lather.  It seems to be holding up well- I rinse it thoroughly after each use and hang it bristles down to dry.  It did \\&quot;shed\\&quot; a little at first- to be expected- but it is doing well.  To bad they don&#x27;t offer an inexpensive holder to go with it- I made a temporary one out of a coat hanger- about three weeks ago- which I hope to replace soon with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li> About 2-4 bristles fall out each time I use it. Quite annoying but I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much since it was only $13. Holds water very well and makes a very nice lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice brush at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m able to nicely foam up my face and shaving goes well.</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you&#x27;re looking at getting this brush you are not ready to spend the money for a top end brush. Having said that for what you pay the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Negative: A few hairs fell out the first time the brush was used. Maybe two or three hairs will fall out every time after the first use.  I have used this product for only a month or so, no telling what the longevity of this brush will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Positive: the brush is firm and builds up a good lather. Bradger bristles, I guess they&#x27;re not hairs, are soft on the skin.  The wood handle gives it a classic look and feels natural when held.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Would I recommend this product to someone else?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if they were just starting to shave with soap and a brush.  But if you have the money and you know you&#x27;re going to use a brush for years to come, don&#x27;t be cheap and buy yourself something you can brag about, even if its to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  About the seller:&lt;br /&gt;The brush was delivered quickly, within three or four days.  Good marks for them.  No problems with the seller.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor and saw this shaving brush as being highly recommended -- they were right.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush. Trying to get away from aerosol gels. Brush is fantastic. I don&#x27;t own a silvertip brush but when I compare brushes at my nearby AOS store, it&#x27;s hard to feel the difference. For the price this is a great brush. Holds water and cream well.</li>
            <li> Was excited at first, but the hairs all started falling out. Eventually stopped using completely. I would suggest finding a nicer model so you can enjoy the shaving experience better.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this brush,I use shaving soap myself make a nice creamy head lather,feels good on my face,keeps its shape a few hairs may come off,but that&#x27;s to be excepted.I would say you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a month now. Was told that most brushes lose a hairs the first few times you use it so it did not bother me at first. But even now after a month I&#x27;m still finding hairs on my face after I lather up.</li>
            <li> Why anyone would really forego shaving cream and smoothest 4-blade shave in 2013 by using a shaving brush and primiitive safety razor when there are other, better options available?  Leverage technology. Embrace it. I grew up on straight razors and shaving brushes, and you know what? It was good in its time, but since we can&#x27;t turn the clock back to when men were men, just go with the technology edge and let the past repose.</li>
            <li> This little fellow might miss his coat, but it sure feels good on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is comparable to more expensive shaving brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Always use proper cleaning and drying technique to insure longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to dry without brush hair flaring out.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others using cup shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good little travel brush.  I use it at home as well, but I think some would find it to be too small for them.  It shed a little the first week or so, but shedding is now a rarity.  It makes a good lather and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s hard to beat this brush. When first used, mine last a couple of hairs but it wasn&#x27;t anything major and stopped after the first week of use.</li>
            <li> The hairs of the bristle have to be combed out because they get matted with use. Other brushes I have used have longer hair and don&#x27;t have such problems.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I bought it switching from multiblade to safety razor. My father used his shaving brush for years, so I had some time to study the process and the tool. So far my own Badger Shaving Brush surpasses greatly my father&#x27;s unknown product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product, shipped quickly and well packaged. Good quality product at a really great price. I will order again from this business.</li>
            <li> The brush is a good brush for the starter and I believe does its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a bit lacking in keeping the bristles in a good formation, but that issue is very minimal.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipment.  Glad I purchased this one for my husband.  He is picky shopper and he loved this shaving brush.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great affordable brush. It hold lots of water as it should. I was wary about buying this brush because of some of the bad reviews I read about its quality. I read that the bristles fall out or the handle cracks etc. I think these things happen because the brush isn&#x27;t properly stored. The brush, like all shaving brushes, must be hung bristle side down so it can dry properly. If left on its side or stood up on its handle, the water just sits on the knot inside the handle and causes the brush to fall apart slowly fall apart. My brush has performed wonderfully with no problems. Im glad I ignored the negative reviews and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> flimsy product- better off spending more money on higher quality- the brush completely fell off within a week of using it</li>
            <li> It took me about a 5 shaves for the brush to break in. You might ask what is there in a brush to break in, well good for you that you have those weird questions. But after the first few shaves, it has been lathering up perfectly. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a value brush.</li>
            <li> This product works just as described.  It&#x27;s a solid product with a good feel and works well.  It&#x27;s a quality product at a good price and it arrived quickly.  I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Have now been using this brush for a month and it is wonderful. Bought an additional one for my son and he feels the same.  The cost is excellent. The delivery was right on time and I am hoping it lasts as long as my prior brush which actually cost more 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who discovered late in life that a glycerin-based shave cream in a jar is infinitely better than anything found in an aerosol can.  What a shame it took me even longer to discover that shaving brush is the key to getting the most out of the expensive shaving creams, like those from The Art of Shaving.  A brush is essential because it allows you to build up a better lather with less product resulting in a closer shave and more efficient use of expensive shaving cream.  I used to go through a 5oz tub in a month and a half using just my fingers to apply the cream to my face.  Now, the same tub last two and a half to three months using a brush and an empty tub to whisk up the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, the Escali badger brush brush does the trick and then some!  The bristles are pliable and smell-free right from the start and I&#x27;m now several months into the use of the brush and it looks like it will last for years.  Sure, you can pay five or ten times more for a fancy handle, but in the end, this brush does the job and makes me smile knowing how much money I&#x27;m saving!</li>
            <li> Bought one of these as a gift for a friend of mine. It was so well received that I ordered another for my Dad&#x27;s birthday. A man has to shave and this brush certainly makes it less of a chore. If you haven&#x27;t tried a badger brush and shave soap you are missing out.</li>
            <li> This is a wooden handled, badger-hair shaving brush, pretty much exactly as expected. There&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say about this.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brush. i use it for creating a lather when i shave with my safety razor. it creates a fantastic lather, the bristles are thickly packed, and it feels amazing against my skin. i also absolutely love that when I use it, there&#x27;s this faint animal (I can only assume badger - think woodsy smell) smell that is just incredible. A++ product.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to get a real badger brush, since I&#x27;ve been using a boar brush for years.  The performance is very good, and a nice quality of brush for the money.  The handle is comfortable, and the bristles holding their shape well so far.  Good brush for a good price.</li>
            <li> The brush seems well made, has a decent heft to it, and does the job fine. Nothing outstanding or negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations, these fellows are the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; what they advertise is what you get!  Bruch creates rich foamy lather; soap goes on thick and creates a superb shave!</li>
            <li> This is only my second brush.  I noticed a smell for the first few days, but probably wouldn&#x27;t have, had I not read previous reviews of this and other shaving brushes.   The bristles are compact and \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; even in length.  For the first month, the brush was stiffer than the previous brush.  No loss of bristles so far.  Overall, for an economically priced brush you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert but it seems to be an excellent brush.  No issues. My face has no irritation now and I&#x27;m sure some of that can be attributed to the brush doing its thing.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush, very soft and it&#x27;s been working well for me since last 1 month. Initially couple of hairs fell off but after that it is all good</li>
            <li> I received the package quickly.  No problems.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality brush that is super soft and lathers very good. Shipping from the store owner was fast and the package arrived in a w3ell packaged box....thanks!!</li>
            <li> Pretty rough for the first few shaves, but after a while it softens up. If I could go back in time I would of invested more money into a higher quality brush. It shed pretty bad for the first month.</li>
            <li> A nice brush, holds soap well, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> This brush may be the number one rated brush on Amazon, not sure how that happened, however it is an extremely poor performer. I bought this brush when I was first getting into double edge razors and wet shaving, and did not know any better, and hope this review saves someone else money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is clipped, meaning instead of selecting badger hairs of various lengths, and forming the brush, they are randomly placed and then cut, what this means for the end user experience is a prickly and harsh &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; brush. The entire purpose of badger brushes is to have a softer brush, with a little bit of backbone to make lather well.&lt;br /&gt; The glue or epoxy used to hold the knot into the handle is also sub par, and the brush sheds hairs continuously, and in copious amounts. After reading other reviews, it looks like my experience was not an outlier.&lt;br /&gt; Save your money, and if you are looking to buy a brush that is on Amazon, get a similarly priced Omega, Semogue, or Vie Long. It won&#x27;t matter if its badger, boar, horse, synthetic, anything you buy at this price point, from those manufacturers, will be leaps and bounds better than this Escali shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at lathering up this way, so I wasn&#x27;t going to spend too much on a shaving brush. Luckily the #1 Bestselling brush in the store is inexpensive. I have yet to find anything I don&#x27;t like about this brush</li>
            <li> Yeah this works relatively well if you need something simple. Mine has a slight issue where the there&#x27;s a hole in the topmost layer right down into the knot, but honestly this doesn&#x27;t really affect anything and I&#x27;ve gotten many a good lather out of it.</li>
            <li> While this is Badger, it is very rough.  I found a lot of whiskers (from the actual animal) that were very rough and coarse.  This thing also looses a LOT of hairs, typically 5 or more every shave.  I went back to my first Burma Shave brush, I like that much more.  Also it has a tendency to knot up in the middle which then you have to pull out the knot and lose more hairs!  Gave 2 stars because it is technically badger and advertised as such.  Honestly I don&#x27;t like it and should have given it one star.</li>
            <li> Good starter brush.  Started falling apart after about a year.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving brush.  Builds up quite the lather with a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> correlation between price and quality</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  I&#x27;d suggest paying for a better one,  the hairs continue to fall out 4th use.</li>
            <li> Works well.  More like the Tweezerman of old.</li>
            <li> Writing review heeding to call for review...sound genuine :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good brush...I cannot really afford lot of money to buy expensive brush but really wanted to get some decent brush...and found it here...&lt;br /&gt;Perfect to all my needs. Give it 2/3 shaves to get smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for more than a month of daily shaving and can report that it is sturdy, soft and just as good as the more expensive products I have previously used.</li>
            <li> Good brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the feel of this shaving brush.  He says it is the very best he has every had.</li>
            <li> excellent fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday. It is great for applying a nice thick layer of suds. The bristles are soft against his sensitive skin, but firm enough to kick up a thick lather that glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product!  I think all badger brushes are prickly to the skin, but it helps if you sweep it side to side rather than dabbing at your face.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our grandson to use to clean and lubricate his small game rifle.  A good friend who served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War told me he used such a brush to care for his M16, and I&#x27;ve used these brushes ever since.  They do a great job spreading lube oil on firearms.</li>
            <li> This brush met my expectations. It was a bit stiff at the beginning, but as i continue to use it it is becoming softer. The best thing is the great lather that it works up and then works into my beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Escali pure badger brush for about a month now and it has been working great. I&#x27;ll probably end up repurchasing the brush after I use up my current one.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shaving brush.  I bought one for my husband and it&#x27;s been great.  Then I bought one for my dad, with the stand.  The stand means the bathroom gets less dust and the brush dries properly.</li>
            <li> This was only the second shaving brush that I have ever owned. I purchased the first one at a neighborhood drug store. It had a cheap plastic handle/base, and the bristles were too long, too soft, too uneven, and fell out with every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Escali brush based on the reviews that I read, and I am exceedingly happy with the product. The bristles are the perfect length and stiffness. The wood handle gives it a look of simple elegance. It holds the shaving soap better and creates a better lather. A few bristles fell out over the first couple of shaves, but none after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need an expensive brush, just something that worked well. This brush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Quality product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent budget brush, and super fast service. I had lost one for a few months and really missed it. One day I think I&#x27;ll ask for a $50+ brush, but until then I&#x27;m quite content with this one.</li>
            <li> I tried camel hair. The bristles began falling out after a few months. So far, the badger produces a better lather than camel without the bristles adding new hair to my beard. It was a bit pokey until I realized that I should spread the lather by using a side-stroke with the brush instead of coming straight on. Once I figure this out, it has been smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget that you should hang the brush upside down from a stand (not included) or lay it on its side to prolong the life of your new furry friend.</li>
            <li> This is my first pure badger hair shaving brush. So far it has performed like expected. It retains enough hot water that I can get a nice warm lather at least two times and a decent lather the third time (in case I missed any spots). I&#x27;ve been soaking this brush in steaming hot water (a few seconds after boiling) and it sits for about 5-10 minutes as I shower, and it has held up so far. I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes, but so far this product has been as advertised and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> A few of the bristles have come off, but that is to be expected; similar to paint brushes. Other than that, a great product that feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush gets a 5 star rating from me! I&#x27;m relatively New to wet shaving with a brush and soap, so I was quite unsure what to look for in a quality brush. I MUST say, after about 2 months of shaving, this brush has become well worth the price. (Which is really good for a Badger brush). A quality brush, from great people! The delivery was quick and easy. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Good product. Best price-to-value ratio I&#x27;ve found for a shaving brush. My brother and I both have one.</li>
            <li> All of the items I purchased were what I expected.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great value and is a quality product</li>
            <li> This a nice brush that will more than likely get better and feel softer as it gets broken in.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last Shaving Brush, which didn&#x27;t shed at all, until it got very old. This new Brush is shedding quite a bit, I&#x27;m left with Hair in the Soap, and on my face. When you rinse it out, and examine it, you can see the Hair sticking up from the top, which have come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone to buy this, and I&#x27;m sure glad I didn&#x27;t give it as a gift! I&#x27;ll probably use it while it last, but I don&#x27;t have much hope for it.</li>
            <li> So far after about 2 weeks of using it, the brush seems to be holding up well. Its not auper soft but the softer the hairs the more expensive the brush. It seems to be a good brush so far, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> same exact one that we bought before but the hairs are not as soft and effective at whipping the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Easily the worst brush I own. The reason I got this brush was because I didn&#x27;t know any better when I first started. There are a ton of other better brushes out there at the same price and you shouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this one.    Issues with this brush:  The knot (amount of hair) is very small  The hairs are very floppy and can&#x27;t stand up well to soaps or face lathering  The hairs seemed clipped and thus are very scratchy at the ends  Constantly loses hairs    I would recommend getting something else like:  Omega Shaving Brush #10048 (chrome) or #10049 (black)  This is a very large boar brush with a huge knot, 28mm knot. Unclipped and will get softer with time.    Omega Shaving Brush #10065 (many colors to choose from) or #10066(faux ivory)  Medium size boar brush, 24mm knot. Unclipped hairs that get softer with time.    Omega S-Brush S10065 (many colors to choose from)  Medium size synthetic brush, 24mm knot. Not made from animal hair and thus very low maintenance. No break in required. Good firm feel but still very soft tips.    Vie-Long 12705  Medium size horse hair brush, 23mm knot. Horse hair is fairly soft. No break in required.    Semogue 1470 (wood handle) or 1460 (painted wood handle)  Small size boar brush, 21mm knot. Nice feel of the wood handle. The hairs are also unclipped and will get softer with time.    Notice I didn&#x27;t recommend any badger brushes? This is because there are virtually no good badger brushes in the $10-$20 price range. Good badger brushes start at around $30. Most good cheap brushes will be bore hair, horse hair, or synthetic.</li>
            <li> Quality is good. I gave as a present.</li>
            <li> This is my first real shaving brush and it has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> The brush adds a bit of elegance to an otherwise grueling daily ritual. It is well made and makes application of your shaving product easier.</li>
            <li> A few months into using this it still scratches my face more than the cheap boar brush I used before.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and far more comfortable then the cheap brush it replaced. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is one of the worst products that I have ever purchased from Amazon; and like most of you, I love Amazon.  The stink of this brush was  was evident not only in my bathroom, but my entire apartment.  I tried washing the brush using hair shampoo; no luck in reducing the smell.  In fact,it made it worse.  So, Mr. Escali was sent to the trash can after four days of use, and I have ordered a synthetic brush which I expect to be better (at least in the smell department), especially when used with the Jack Black Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> Well crafted. Very happy with my purchase. Looking into getting one for my father.</li>
            <li> Bristles break off and stick on your face while shaving. This is a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> i just received my brush and while not totally symmetric since it is an animal, I did notice a slight odor to the brush...not a big issue. The soap lathers well and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> my Razor came with a synthetic brush, but this is far better, it gives me a good even lather all around. and is really soft, granted it looses bristles from every use, the majority that do fall are in the first use, after that it&#x27;s maybe one or two here and there.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Works up a good lather. Dries well and you can feel it prepping your skin for the shave.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my son to use as he started with a straight razor - it high quality and quite stiff.</li>
            <li> Well-made and holds up well. If and when this one wears out, it will be replaced with another just like it.</li>
            <li> -Prompt Shipping&lt;br /&gt;-Attractive Brush&lt;br /&gt;-Very Soft, Lathers Well&lt;br /&gt;-I have had some hairs coming out with use, but its my first brush.  I assume this to be normal.</li>
            <li> The brush has a fine feel, representing a good value.  I believe it will provide service for a long time.</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase, I&#x27;ve been using a boar brush everyday. I was getting tired of the poor lather and wanted something better. I chose this brush because of the low price and high reviews; I was not disappointed. The brush is soft and holds a lather well. If you are on a budget, look no further: You have found a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great value/price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells kind of funny at first. Google &amp;#34;How to Break a Badger Brush&amp;#34; and follow some simple steps to stop the odor.</li>
            <li> An OK starting brush. Works well if you want to try wet shaving. Not intended to be your permanent brush as it is not the greatest quality.</li>
            <li> A couple of shed hairs at the start but none after the first shave or two. Lathers well. No issues.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It&#x27;s very soft, performs well, and is at a great price. It&#x27;s definitely won me as a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I have heard that shaving brush can improve the saving experience by distributing the foam evenly on the surface, so I wanted to try and bought this brush. It works very well just as advertised. I little grandpa like but who cares? :)</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush to start your shaving experience.  It is adequate in every way.  Mine continues to shed hair after three months, but that has not affected the shaving experience in any major way.  There are better badger brushes out there, but you will have to spend a lot more to acquire them.  I use this brush while on travel and occasionally otherwise as part of the shave rotation.</li>
            <li> I have used a synthetic brush for at least two years and I recently switched over to using this guy. First thing is it is actually animal hair, so it smells like a wet animal when it gets wet. The brush will tangle like a knot if you press the brush against your face like the how to videos on Youtube. I find I have to use a comb on the brush after use to make sure it does not get too tangled. With a light touch, just pressing slightly and loading the brush with foam from the soap dish often you get a decent lather that is not as valuminous as a synthetic brush but has a much denser foam so you do not nicked quite so much with the straight razor.</li>
            <li> New to this type of shaving gear so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to but this brush seems to be a good value. I read some negative reviews but decided to try it since it was 1/2-1/3 or even more of the price of some other shave brushes. I really can&#x27;t complain. Yes it sheds a hair every now and then but that not really a big deal. I just pull it out of the bowl. Its plenty soft after a few uses and I enjoy using it. I can&#x27;t see spending 20-100 for a shave brush that basically does the same thing. I mean it spreads shaving cream. How luxurious does it need to be? I&#x27;d rather put the money towards a better quality razor.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 weeks and I lose a hair every other shave maybe. The finish on the handle is holding up fine with no peeling or anything. All in all I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of the expensive Badger Shaving Brush and for the price bough two Escali brush for my son,&lt;br /&gt;I compared the Escali with my expensive brush and found no difference. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Seems like this will work well. I bought this after reading other reviews, so we&#x27;ll see if this brush holds up. Only used it a few times so far, but seems like a good brush.</li>
            <li> AS fine a shaving brush as I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I get a smooth even lather that makes shaving a breeze.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good starter brush to learn all ropes of wet shaving</li>
            <li> Great brush, bought it as a gift and my Dad likes it</li>
            <li> Good brush,  got another for my son.</li>
            <li> This is so natural and good quality! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> First shaving brush. No complaints. Seems to lather up the shaving cream well and help my facial stand up for my shave. Now I just need to master the rest of the wet shaving process!</li>
            <li> Great product and cool vendor. Recommends to anyone interested in their products.</li>
            <li> This Brush works great. I am very happy with it and should last a Long time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas.  He uses it daily saying he loves it.  Its packaging was good, having arrived in a box with other items.  Would purchase again if another is ever needed for someone else.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son, who is going to switch to a safety razor rather than a commercial triple-blade razor.  I made him homemade shave cream (with items I ordered from Amazon!)  He loves this brush and has made the transition quite nicely (hasn&#x27;t even nicked his face yet).  Order was fulfilled quickly and the brush is very high quality.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent brush top of the line can not be beat for the price</li>
            <li> very &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; when applying lather to the face.</li>
            <li> Love it! The brush arrived on time, in great condition, and it works great!</li>
            <li> Seems to be of good qualitity - my husband hasn&#x27;t used this yet.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, badger brushes are the way to go!  I used this brush and it was great.  The quality of the brush is good and the feeling on the beard was just as advertised.  I am now ordering the shaving soap to go with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband as his &amp;#34;learner&amp;#34; brush. He says it is a great quality brush and works very well. There may be a bit better quality brushes out there, but for his starter brush and the price you really can&#x27;t beat it! I especially Love that the company took time to email me to ensure our satisfaction after purchasing! Would definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I read reviews about hairs falling out of this brush...not mine. This is one the the most comfortable brushes I have used. I considered spending over twice as much for another brush..I am glad I didn&#x27;t. The handle is comfortable in your hand and the hairs feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Fair quality brush and the price is great. I have used it twice and notice that a few of the hairs become dislodged when using. It&#x27;s a decent quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on reviews and glad I did. Using it with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream. Following the holding and drying recommendations presented here and it works great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i can only give this brush three stars. The badger hair dries wonderfully and creates a nice lather. It also feels good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t stink like a boars hair brush, but it tends to lose hair with each shave. After two weeks of use i&#x27;m finding less and less hair each time so eventually it may stop shedding all together, but i would definitely prefer one that was shed free from day 1.</li>
            <li> I lathered up my brush with the proraso soap, is there a technique I don&#x27;t know about?  The hairs fall out every time I use it.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived promptly and packaged appropriately.  Soft bristles, sheds a little each use.  Bristles spread more than expected after first use, though I am drying it upside down as instructed.  I do foresee it lasting, as the construction seems solid for the price. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Smells like it was plucked off the rear end of the badger and dipped in smelly glue.&lt;br /&gt;The thing sheds, used it 4 times and still leaves strands on my face.&lt;br /&gt;A bid coarse, not as smooth as some of the higher end ones.&lt;br /&gt;The finish on the gold ring near the base of the hairs is discolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, I am new to this type of shaving (safety razor) and I will eventually get a pricey set once I am convinced this is the way I want to shave.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are pretty soft, but I have an older brush from Tweezerman that is, I think, a little bit softer and holds it shape just as well as this one. I found the varnish on this brush to be way too slick, and had trouble hanging onto it with soapy hands, and so I went through all the trouble to remove the finish right down to the wood, and then, while I was at it, I used a high-speed rotary tool and appropriate burrs to create a random pattern of shallow holes with sharp edges at the surface of the wood (so as to provide a good gripping surface when the handle was slippery with soap). This worked out well, and now there&#x27;s no problem at all with grip. Also, I installed a powerful disc magnet in the bottom of the handle and now hang it tip-down from a little cubby that&#x27;s set into the wall beside my bathroom sink. The&#x27;s no problem after a month or so of use with loss of hairs from the brush––a few came out over the days, but that has ceased. All-in-all, it&#x27;s a good brush, IMO, but not really as good as the Tweezerman brush. After all the work I&#x27;ve put into making be &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because it seemed brittle.  After a few shaves it softened up and feels great.  I&#x27;m a happy shaver.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I purchased this that it would fall apart right away, but after using it for a few months it still works great and is holding up well!</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent ... very little hair falling out, and a great feel. I am using a sandalwood soap with this brush. It is pretty easy to rinse and is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for delivery and packaging ... as excellent as you would hope them to be. I will shop from Parella&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> its a great brush. have never used one before and now i see what all the fuss was about. It really comfortable and it saves me a ton of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This brush smells like a boar&#x27;s ass, but I think that&#x27;s normal.  It works, and was what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a brush, I wanted one that held water and lather well without breaking the bank. My first brush was a typical drugstore brush and it was not soft at all, it did not hold water well or lather up very good. The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I ordered held water and lather very well for the price I paid for it. I use Proraso shaving soap and I only dip the tip of the brush in the soap and swirl it in a cup to make lather and I have enough for 3 to 4 shaving passes. Highly recommended brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Nothing to complain about. I recommend this to anyone looking for a brush. I haven&#x27;t used any others, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I love this one.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality of this brush. I found others for over $80 and I can&#x27;t justify giving that when this one is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> First time shaving with a straight razor and applying shave soap with a barber brush. The brush is awesome, gets a great lather and applies evenly and incredibly smooth. Definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Nice brush.  Good feel.  It holds it&#x27;s shape well.  I think that they set the right price.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Pretty good quality brush. Definitely better than the typical drugstore brands I&#x27;ve been using. Received it in a timely manner.  Will most likely buy another one for travel.</li>
            <li> It does what you would expect from a high quality shaving brush. I&#x27;ve never used a better one in my life</li>
            <li> This is my second Escali brush. Apart from the loose bristles that fall off initially, I am happy with it. Works up to a nice lather and very satisfactory for an entry level shaving brush. Received order promptly.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his shaving brush, and I loved the fast shipping!  I dont know much about shaving brushes, but my husband thinks this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done at a reasonable price. The wood is very beautiful and there were ~30 loose hairs I got out of my brush initially. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My brother loved it. I gave it to him for a Christmas gift as his other one was on its last leg.</li>
            <li> Overall this brush isn&#x27;t terrible but everyday when i use it i&#x27;m left wondering if this thing is real badger hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any of the properties that you hear about badger brushes. Honestly i can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this thing and spreading shaving cream across my face with my hand. And yes the hairs fall out and it stinks.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. A few hairs will fall out at first but those are just the loose ones. Mine stopped shedding completely after 3 uses. I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now and use it daily. May take a couple of uses to break in but after that it is a very comfortable brush with excellent value.</li>
            <li> Everything you&#x27;d want in a shave brush. Feels and performs like a much more expensive gift</li>
            <li> The Badger brush is great. I have also sent several as gifts. Perellis is great to do business with. I will never hesitate. PS, The brush is also good for female friends. Jim</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping and the product arrived just like advertised. I am more than satisfied with it and will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> I got this after my first badger-hair brush fell apart after a few months.  I&#x27;m happy to say that almost 2 1/2 years later, this one is still going strong!  It sheds a lot of hairs at first but that goes away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get this if you&#x27;re looking to get into wet shaving and want a nice brush for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Just switched to using safety razor and old fashion shaving cream. This brush spreads the shaving cream evenly and smoothly. I can also feel the brush extending my whiskers for a better cut thus a closer shave. It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great brush for anyone who is price sensitive. Works well.</li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft. It definitely has a little bit of an animal scent but I am fine with that. I AM ONE WITH THE ANIMALS!!! No but this really does a good job lathering and raising the facial hair.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EXCELLENT. DOESN&#x27;T SHED, IT&#x27;S SOFT AND SILKY TO THE TOUCH AND DOESN&#x27;T DRY HARD. AMAZING VALUE FOR THE QUALITY. NO WONDER IT&#x27;S A BEST SELLER. ALL OTHER IMMITATORS PLEASE FIND A DIFFERENT PROFESSION.</li>
            <li> Soft, creates a great lather, cleans easy,, top quality product, 1/2 of a perfect shave ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> Legit product, never leave reviews. Good product for price. Happy with this one.</li>
            <li> A decent product for the price. Like many others my brush sheds bristles but only 1-3 per shave--this is subpar but tolerable. It also smells like a badger, but I don&#x27;t really mind that so much.  Edit: Aug 20 2015. Had the brush now for two months. It&#x27;s holding up. It still sheds about 1 hair per shave, but it completely tolerable. The badger smell has dissipated. I&#x27;ve added an additional star (3 -&amp;#62; 4) since this product seems to be in for the long haul, and for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money. Makes a great lather and feels good. My only complaint is that it seems to shed bristles to easily. One or two end up in my shaving mug every time I use it. For the beginner it is a good value.</li>
            <li> The brief research I did recommended to use only badger brushes and that advice was true as far as I can tell. My wife and female co-workers notice and compliment the close shave I get using this badger brush, Taylor of Old Bond Street avocado shaving cream, and a double edge razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is super affordable and works excellent.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Perfect for my foray into wet shaving</li>
            <li> Along with the Arlington shaving bowl and soap, this made a lovely gift for my son.  He was very pleased.  Also fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the packaging was good. So far it seems like a great brush. It feels good and holds lather well, and it doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s hair. I like it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> 500+ reviewers can&#x27;t be wrong, right? Looking at the reviews I figured this brush was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. This brush is awful. First off, as soon as it gets wet it smells like manure. It loses bristles more prodigiously than any brush I&#x27;ve used in the past. The bristles are rougher on my face than most boar brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With soap, the lather was mediocre at best and did not transfer to my face well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After repeated uses, the smell has not diminished and the bristles keep escaping. Since I am not comfortable about applying something to my face that smells like manure, I have thrown this brush away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m very pleased.  This works really well with the Shae Moisture Shave Butter I use.  Without the brush it&#x27;s a completely different shave experience.  thanks Perella&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, feels and smells great.  Yeah, some hairs come out sometimes, but good luck finding one that doesn&#x27;t shed every once in a while</li>
            <li> Allows even distribution of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoyance I have is that with 700+ good reviews and me not really having an opinion, I was being spammed by either Amazon or Peralla&#x27;s for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really are a small company and want to reach a large market, make a gimmick brush (100% Vaginal Hair) instead of spamming.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days of ordering, which made me happy. Tried it out the next morning. Looses a few hairs for about the first week, but nothing drastic. I feel like it does a much better job of foaming the face than I used to get by putting on the shaving cream by hand. Also, the cream stays wetter and doesn&#x27;t dry out while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried on the first use when a few hairs fell out, I thought the thing was going to fall apart. But after using it for a few weeks it&#x27;s stayed together and is super easy to clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Brush is easy to use, nice quality. My first shaving brush.  With this brush you really don&#x27;t need a shaving mug. Lathers up just fine on your face. Nice price too.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. Great entry-level brush for those looking to get nostalgic and shave the old-fashioned way. Very durable and great quality. High recommendations.</li>
            <li> im sorry to say, that i regret buying this brush. when comparing it to other high priced brushes, this was said to be on par with the best quality ones, and, while i don&#x27;t have extensive experience with them, can say that this was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the brush, when wet, didnt hold form very well. it did not exfoliate as i expected to, (what i expected was akin to a soft, yet flexible tooothbrush texture. maybe thats just my problem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. SEVERAL hairs fell out in the first use. upwards of 10-15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. before using it, i set the brush in a cup of near-boiling water to soak for a few minutes.  when i took it out the smell hit me, and hit me hard. im used to bad smells (i am a man, of course) but this was pretty bad. the smell went away for the MOST part when i squeezed the water out, but as i did that, a the water was a dark reddish/brownish color. talk about gross. I&#x27;m to put this to my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m told there are some cheap ones at walmart i can try until i can shell out some more money for a higher priced brush, and i think ill try that.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles pull out when I use it.  All in all I am satisfied.  I have not used it a lot so far as this is not a system you can use fast.  I enjoy the slow leisurely manner it takes to use it.</li>
            <li> The hair smelled like wild game as though the fur was not cured properly.  The rating is very poor and unusable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it. When my son saw it he said he wants one for his birthday.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Amazing brush.</li>
            <li> After using one of the cheap kit brushes, this is a fantastic upgrade. Lathers extremely well. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works up a mean lather. Love it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what you would expect. It has a nice weight and finish so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, delivered on time. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> great quality.  Delivered  quickly</li>
            <li> Christmas gift - recepient loves - giver happy</li>
            <li> Great brush works as expected. Few hairs fell of the first few times I used it but still works great.</li>
            <li> The best shaving brush on the market.  Does not shed.  Soap washes out easily.  Fits well on any rack.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the shedding brushes and do it right the first time.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it; the bristles caused some irritation.  I tried it again after conditioning the brush and giving it a breaking in period. Now it works fine for me. It lathers up my face very well and I get a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> it works ok but the bristles are not the softest . I am sure that&#x27;s why some are much more expensive</li>
            <li> Did not like the quality at all.  After using it couple of times it left black color all over my face.  It didn&#x27;t foam at all.  Just poor quality.</li>
            <li> I previously was using a brush made with porcupine hair.  Switching to this was a noticeable difference.  It creates a different lather (more velvety) and feels like rubbing up against a freshly clubbed baby seal.  HEAVENLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is smaller than expected, however, would recommend.</li>
            <li> very nice.  very little shedding so far</li>
            <li> Great product.  Getting ready to order 2nd one to keep in my RV.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything suggested from the guys over at Badger and Blade to get the animal smell out: Shampoo, Borax, dishwashing soap, you name it.  This thing stinks. Compared to my FS Silver-tip, it feels like sandpaper. I would suggest you spend a little more money and get something better. I use if for traveling, but don&#x27;t use it at home.</li>
            <li> It sheds, and some of the brush bristles or whatever its called ends up on my face or the shaving cream bowl when I&#x27;m applying it. My recommendation is to buy pure badger but find another brand not escali.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, nice handle. Lathers very well, and applies to the face sufficiently. A few hairs come out in the first use but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic shaving brush - it&#x27;s a little stiff, and will shed bristles if you abuse it, but overall its a great product. The seller shipped quickly and securely.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. It&#x27;s a bit scratchy but works well. Good if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Got this brush and was happy with the way it lathers up the soap..&lt;br /&gt;Dealer shipped fast and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;Only a few hairs have come loose, overall an excellent starter brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first Badger brush, I only recently moved from an electric shaver. After three weeks the brush is holding up well, no discoloration and with a minimal amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> For the price I doubt a better brush could be found. I believe this is a great introduction to wet shaving. There are certainly better brushes out there for an increased cost, but a badger hair brush for $13 is too good of a deal.</li>
            <li> This was a great value for the brush. It arrived in a timely fashion and was as advertised. I use it daily, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> First brush.  Saw the price and reviews and thought this looks really good.  Clearly better than the boar hair brushes you see in drug stores but that is as far as it gets.  Continues to loose bristles w/ almost every use and while not very stiff is also not soft - poor combination.  The price is great but in my opinion you would be better off spending 25-30 dollars for a good brush.  Wet shaving products is a fairly new company who makes really good brushes that in my opinion are cheaper in price from comparable brushes from companies like Simpson,Rooney &amp;Omega.</li>
            <li> My son gave me a single edge razer to try l was tired of all the razor handles I have collected over time do to the expense of replacement blades and I really liked the shave I got so I went completely old school and bought everything I needed to shave the brush is very nice no I make shaving a event. It&#x27;s perfect I bought him one also</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely recommended</li>
            <li> Best value for the money. Excellent quality product.</li>
            <li> This brush gives me a nice even lather all over my face and the bristles don&#x27;t get ruined by water.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, as soon as this one goes bad,  this product is awesome .It is, as claimed 100% pure badger shaving brush. I use it with my Merkur 180 long handle. Thanks Parella&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Compare this brush with those that cost twice the price. Have used now for about a week and I don&#x27;t have any bristle coming out of it. Lathers the soap up well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of its great reviews and low price. It is a $10 brush, and at first examination is of quality build but maybe i got a bad batch?? So many 4 and 5 star reviews, but mine sucks. It sheds like crazy and is NOT soft, even after proper cleaning and drying. I cleaned it when I opened it and checked for loose hairs. It has been used twice to shave and cleaned each time after. I hope that it softens up after more uses. Stray hairs all over the soap and my face, and the bristles irritated my skin more than a blade ever has. Easy to whip in a cup, but difficult to get a good lather on my face because of how uncomfortable the bristles were. Its been 13 hours since I shaved, and the thought of putting this against my face right now is making me cringe. I give this 2 stars simply because of its low price, and with genuine hope that it softens up and stops shedding after further use/cleaning. If not, I would safely say one star.</li>
            <li> What can I say - less expensive than the others, but works just like it should. A few of the hairs came out with the first use, but since then, it&#x27;s been great. The best thing I can say: I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> I use this brush with the &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&amp;#34;.  I dab a finger&#x27;s worth of cream into a wood shave bowl and lather up with the Escali.  This brush looses some whiskers the first couple of times you use it but after that is is a solid brush that works great.  I shave with multi-blade disposables and straight razors.  I use the Escali for both.  Great brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this brush, based on the low price. I am sad to say that those low expectations were met. The brush is very stiff, and scratchy. Because of the stiffness, I was never really able to get my soap to froth up into a lather. Also, when I was finished shaving, I noticed that the brush had lost about 10-15 bristles. They were on my face, neck and chest. When you add that all up, you get 2 stars. My search for a budget friendly wet shave brush continues.</li>
            <li> My first of these brushes smelled awful, lost at least 6-9 bristles per shave, and finally the glue that holds the bristles into the wooden base gave way. I contact the seller and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. Would give the seller an A+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on my second brush, it still smells absolutely awful and it will not go away.  This brush loses fewer bristles, but the smell is enough for me to not use it at all.  Huge turn off to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I used this 3-4 times and every time I shaved I would lose at least 5-10 hairs in my shave mug and another 5 or more on my face while lathering.  PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, spend a few extra dollars and get a better quality brush, even the art of shaving brush that comes with the $20 kit is better than the Escali.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I like to have extra shaving brushes on hand.  I haven&#x27;t opened the package but the brush inside looks like it is going to do a great job of lathering up my face.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Works great. Arrived on time. Great product for the price listed. Use it nearly every day and it is still on great condition</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Some of the hairs came out the first several times I used it, but besides that I have nothing negative to say. No idea what benefit I could possibly get by spending 4x more on other brushes</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the brush, but the badger hair irritates my face. Keep that in mind if you are going to order this.</li>
            <li> This Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush is everything one would want in a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;The feel is just wonderful. Certainly I would suggest this brush to a friend(s).</li>
            <li> A very good brush. I find it better than the synthetic ones. Very fast delivery. A faint odor when wet but left after a weeks worth of shaving.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> After moving to a double-edged razor and Proraso pre-shave oil and shaving cream I figured I&#x27;d go full old-school and get a shaving brush.  Honestly I thought it was probably a gimmick and obviously more trouble than it would be worth.  But I wanted to complete the whole traditional shaving experience so I ordered this Escali brush based on the feedback I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is no gimmick.  It is an essential shaving tool if you are using a more traditional cream like the Proraso since the brush is much more effective at lathering up the cream, and preparing your beard than using your hands alone.  I&#x27;ve been able to substantially reduce the amount of cream that I use per shave - maybe a third or quarter of what I used to apply by hand.  Also, if you are using a double-edged razor (and I don&#x27;t used it exclusively) you must make two, sometimes three &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; in one session to get a completely smooth shave.  By using the brush, it always seems to have enough left on it after my first shave for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously our grandfathers knew a thing or two about shaving...</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of bits of real badger, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Great brush suggest people to buy it!</li>
            <li> My first real shaving brush, but its pretty awesome. My only complaint is that the bristles come out of it pretty frequently but I think that&#x27;s gonna happen with any new brush you get.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds all over.  I have hairs in my shaving cream, I have hairs on my counter, I have hairs on my face, its everywhere.  Not happy at all.  I ordered a much more expensive brush, hopefully its better then this.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I paid much more for this shaving bursh.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> I was long due for a shaving brush and this filled the need just right. I even got one for my dad also. Good quality product</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my husband. He had been wanting to go back to razor shaving so I researched brushes and razors. Escali 100% Badger brush is awesome. He loves the lather and coverage it gives.  Definitely found a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but seems to work very well.  Lathers nice, applies nice, and rinses out easy.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great Badger brush at this price point. You will not be disappointed with this purchase, and do not be alarmed when it sheds a few at the start - perfectly normal. The wood handle has a very nice finish that should require minimum upkeep through he years.  Seller is top notch and this was a flawless transaction.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as a gift to introduce a friend to wet shaving. I was initially concerned about the low cost of the brush and what the quality would be like. When it arrived I was impressed with the build. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Never had a badger hair brush before, always had the boar bristle ones.  This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to lose a lot of hair, and so far is holding up well.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I have made in a shave brush.At first I thought I was in trouble when I first used it the three or four bristles  fell out and brush started to fade after the initial suprise the buy has been perfect,thanks.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush. I have no other badger brush to compare it to, but I certainly prefer it to the plastic thing I was using before. I do lose at least one bristle every time I use it, which is maybe normal, but whatever. Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> This brush is of good quality and I have been using it for about a month. It works well both with the tube type shaving cream and with shaving soap. Not counting the first week, only one or two hairs are lost with each shave.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for xmas as part of an old-school shaving kit I put together. It really is a better way to shave--much better for the skin and smoother, closer shave overall. The brush is ok as a starter brush I think; he says he&#x27;s happy with it, but that it sheds a little bit. It&#x27;s not bad for the price, though, and supposedly better than boar bristles. Also came in a timely fashion, so that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;d say the brush itself deserves 3 stars, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because the service was good. Came in time for Xmas!</li>
            <li> A great and quality gift for my dad! He reports a good quality that leads a great start on the day.</li>
            <li> Received the brush and washed it. Excellent brush and prompt delivery. Brush is very soft and much better than the boar brush that I had. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased.  Anyone who is not using one of these brushes should really get it a try.  It has helped me get a lot closer shave.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> First purchase that lead me to leave a review. Great product, shipped quickly, one for myself and one as a gift. Quality product and  I am not an expert shaver, makes a good lather. There is an initial smell, but that is OK as it is a natural fiber brush, it goes away with a few shaves. I don&#x27;t think you can get a better brush for less than $60 in the mall or antique shop as I have tried both.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the shaving brush I got from a shaving kit at CVS. Produces a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t soak up so much water that it washes the soap off as you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving brush for about a month now, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  This is a great compliment to a straight edge shaver.  A minor detail: the first couple shaves I noticed some stray bristles came off, but nothing since then.  Overall a great brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush since I only recently got into safety razor shaving, but seems fine to me, but as others have mentioned it is shedding already after only about a month. Maybe that just happens with any brush. LOL,   It lathers fine, it drys fine by shaking it off vigorously, and seems to do the trick. If it lasts than 3 months, I will downgrade it, but the price was good, so.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush arrived just as advertised. When lathering my face for a shave, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great, affordable price.  Highly recommended!  I use mine all the time and it really makes a difference for my shave and my skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.  Very good quality, 100% pure badger hair shaving brush at a very low price and top notch customer service.  I had a slight issue with the first one that was sent out to me and without any questions they sent me out a replacement and I didn&#x27;t have to bother with sending the other one back.  I will buy from this company again and I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a shaving brush to trust this company to deliver quality and great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had several brushes in my lifetime.  This is my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; badger brush.  Although slightly softer than previous brushes, I was originally taken aback by the amount of bristles it lost, specially during the first week of shaving.  The synthetics never lost a bristle, even after several years of using one specific brand.  The loss of bristles on this item has subsided, and it&#x27;s apparently a trait of all real badger brushes, so I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving brushes for some time now - 50 years  -&lt;br /&gt;using this brush for the past 3 months and am completely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;For the money it is well worth the cost - it has held up fine and is of a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for being able to provide a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a month now and I am VERY pleased with it.  I think I had a camel&#x27;s hair brush last time but this Badger Hair brush outstanding.  Very soft and I have noted almost no loss of bristles (of course I have seen scant loss over the last few weeks).  Very soft and lathers well.  I am really glad I found this and the price is quite reasonable for the quality item</li>
            <li> Great brush, but the bristles keep falling out.  Wish there was a way to fix that.  I use a plastic Brush Guard to keep it dry and ensure the water doesn&#x27;t soak into the handle.</li>
            <li> Little itchy. Still a little itchy after a lot of use. Will always probably be a little itchy. Will never regret switching from cans and gels though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-made for how inexpensive it is. The shaving brush makes shaving less of a chore and more of a ritual to start your day or night.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality product.  The instructions on how to maintain it are clearly defined and I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but I have to say that I am quite happy with the purchase.  The quality seems top notch - some folks have complained about losing a lot of bristles...I have hardly seem any come off.  If you are looking for a decent, no frills shaving brush...buy this one.</li>
            <li> Works just fine, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.  I will however, be moving on to a better brush eventually.</li>
            <li> Got the brush in a timely manner.  Yes it does smell a little funky, but that is to be expected.  Washed it and now it&#x27;s fantastic.  Thanks for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, especially for the cost.  A few bristles fall out now and then, which I would expect.  This product doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> i have used the brush twice. not that many bristles have fallen out and the smell is almost completely gone. creates a great lather and is better than i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> My experience after using this brush for two months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Yes it does lose bristles, especially on the first use. My soap bar looked like it grew hair. easily 20 hairs of various thickness shed from the brush. However, once the initial batch were lost, I only get the occasional single hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Scent: Yup it smells, it&#x27;s hair. it does not smell great on first use if you don&#x27;t do something to somewhat condition it. There are various methods out there like hot water soaks in soapy water over night, then lathering some shave soap, and leaving that sit, etc. I did not do that, but I have noticed that after the first few uses the scent has faded considerably, and doesn&#x27;t overpower some of my subtle soaps. Initially, I&#x27;d recommend using a strong scented soap as the natural smell of wet hair isn&#x27;t great, and easily overpowers light scented soaps.&lt;br /&gt;-Softness: It isn&#x27;t the softest brush, but I don&#x27;t find it harsh and I have fairly sensitive skin. It&#x27;s also capable of whipping up a nice lather with hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - it&#x27;s a good price for a decent brush, especially for a beginner. No point in shelling out huge money on something you may or may not enjoy. If you do enjoy wet shaving, then you&#x27;ll have a nice first brush to continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I haven&#x27;t rated it after the first use. For the first few times the fur was coming out of the brush. But it seems like it&#x27;s not any more.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4 stars because I usually keep 5th for something extra-ordinary.</li>
            <li> very good brush  I was concerned at first, as it seemed to be losing more hairs every shave for the first week, but has performed excellently after that.</li>
            <li> Great high quality brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It is an OK shaving brush, but it is already starting to fall apart.  This isn&#x27;t going to last a long time, so be prepared to buy a new one every couple months.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a %100 badger hair shaving brush that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune and I found it. This brush is exactly what i was looking for. Holds lather well, nice and soft, holds water nicely, and dries without too much fraying or misshaping. Al in all I am quite satisfied with this brush and I hope it lasts as long as I hope it will.</li>
            <li> Brush fits good in the hand.  Lathers up my shaving soap perfectly.  Dries well and holds shape perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this to, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> Great product. I don&#x27;t have the issue other people are talking about with hair falling out, works great. I did have to break it in, I just let it sit - loaded - overnight. Then I washed it with Dawn and it was great.</li>
            <li> Brush is not too large and the shape makes it easy to pick up shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Well made Shaving Brush.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush. I think that it could have a bit more bristle stiffness, but for the price, it is perfectly serviceable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son... Plus bowl, soap, and straight razor.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is a very great quality item. The hair strands do not fall out that often, occasionally one will detach after 2-3 uses/cycles (I shave twice a week). The hair does not tickle or have any foul scent to it. Feels awesome against the face and it applies shaving cream/pre shave cream very well and evenly. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush, gives a great shave!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  Important to soak it in hot water (in a cup) for several minutes before using.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the brush and it makes his shaving so much easier &amp; better</li>
            <li> A quality item that I use everyday. There was an odor to the brush to begin with but it went away with use.</li>
            <li> I get a much better lather with my new Escali Badger Brush than my old brush.  Very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone..</li>
            <li> It meets the need but is a bit soft and a little too pliable for my taste. It also sheds liberally. But, for the price, it is not a bad brush, especially if returning to the more traditional form of shaving.</li>
            <li> This brush, while a tiny bit smaller, is so much softer than the brush I got from the Van der Hagen shaving set (I know it&#x27;s cheap). I would definitely recommend this product over other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The brush is not as soft as I thought it would be. but, it&#x27;s gotten a little better since it&#x27;s been broken in. It&#x27;s pretty good for the price and its intended use.</li>
            <li> The badger hair brush fully met all my expectations.  The brush has bristles, but it is not bristly.  It helps the shaving cream go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, except the hairs seem to fall out too easily. They end up scattered everywhere. Maybe I&#x27;m brushing too hard, though.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush. Put&#x27;s the lather on well. Although, the bristles fall off if I swirl the soap in the mug to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, smooth touch. I did notice a hair came loose hopefully that will be the last one for a while..</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;ve tried to embrace synthetic bristles, I appreciate the feel of badger. This helps me get a good shave each morning. The quality was good though expect it to shed a little when beginning use.</li>
            <li> Never really used a brush before to shave but wow such a difference. I love it and this product works great and is easy to clean and can easily travel with for work In my toiletry case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price. It smells like a bager ;) an wear off just a little bit. But its a fine shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is inexpensive and well worth the price. It lathers well and only a few bristles were lost. Contrary to other reviewers the animal scent was minimal. All in all I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this brush. good quality, fair price, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds like crazy when I&#x27;m trying to lather my face for a shave! I don&#x27;t like having to pick the hair off of my face! This brush sucks</li>
            <li> the brush was ok...not real thrilled but everything else is great..even got my dad to order a shaving set..hes gonna start using it</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  When wet the brush smells exactly like a Badger.  Badgers do not smell good.  The brush is usable after a good vinegar and baking soda bath and some essential oils added.  I would give this item a higher rating if the smell could be removed before delivery.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations.  I thought the bristles, when lathered, would remain upright like in the picture.  They don&#x27;t - they just flatten out.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush to make my own shaving cream lather,and it works great!  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush. My first Badger shaving brush. It is affordable, holds more moisture than boar bristle brush, and makes a rich lather. I use a stand to dry this brush and have had no issue with it.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I bough this for my husband to replace the one he had used for 35 years. He says the brush is great. We had looked at brushes priced above $120.00 and he feels this one is just as good or better quality than those.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, packaged perfectly.  The brush is inexpensive, but works great.  The brush smells a little at first, but this goes away over time and is common with Badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Guess some of the people reviewing this item got lucky and got a good one mine is still shedding after almost a month of use I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cheap way to get a brush but spending just a little more can get you a brush that won&#x27;t shed. It is softer than my boar brushes but still prickly. If you order one...best of luck hope you get one that you can be happy with Like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Smaller than others.  I bought it for my teenager so it actually worked out well that it was a little smaller.  If I had bought this for my husband (large hands), I would have had to send it back.  Quality was great though, no real issue (yet) with losing hairs and it&#x27;s soft but durable.</li>
            <li> Best Brush you can buy for the money! Ive been using this brush for 3 months now, it did shed a few hairs in the beginning but nothing excessive. It feels great on the face and whips up lather quickly! What more do you want? Ive read some reviews mentioning smell? your nose is better than mine! Great brush at a great price! After reading many reviews and using this brush for two and a half years it is apparent that either the quality control in the making of these brushes varies greatly or they&#x27;re made by different makers. It&#x27;s hard to believe that such differing reviews are about the same brush! Mine is still working well and I still believe it&#x27;s a great value! At least the one I got! It looses a hair or two now and again, never had any bad odor, it&#x27;s still full and soft. Apparently if you get a good one, you get a good one. I did!</li>
            <li> An inexpensive brush that gets the job done.  Expect some shedding for the first half-dozen times you use it.  Made with real hair of some sort.  I&#x27;m not going to do any genetic testing to find out what specific mammal it was.</li>
            <li> Very good value brush. Soft bristles that need a little broke in. Little rough at first but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable. Everyone complained about bristles falling out, but I have experienced the same problem with many other brushes. It only lasts for the first few uses and then it is fine.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  No issues whatsoever. Right before first use and after wetting the brush, the wet brush scent was a little off-putting, but after lathering-up and using the brush a couple of times (x3) the original scent is no longer perceptible.</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a decent beginner brush and will do.  But be prepared that you know the grades of badger hair used in making brushes.  This is the lowest of the grade and on a dry face if you put the plume directly to your face you will feel prickly sticks.  This is indicative of low grade badger.  If you do a paint brush stroke like you do when painting a wall then the low grade hair is not as evident to your face until you increase the angle of the brush upon lifting off your face.  You know that old addage.....&amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34;  Well in the world of shaving brushes this is no different.  That said if you have done research you know &amp;#34;silvertip badger&amp;#34; is the softest of the badger from under it&#x27;s neck.  There is even in some circles I have researched a special designation beyond that to a incredible special badger or something.  Well, I am not sure about that one but universally the silvertip is regarded as the best and usually what you desire for most faces unless you have just such a tough face that a plain badger will do.  You ask the cost difference between a brush like this to a silvertip.............well that varies of course by the manufacturer.  I have seen some decent ones around $50 to as high as $300 + for a single silvertip badger brush!!!  Here is a tip though...........if you dislike the badger on this brush you can replace the knot with a silvertip for most times cheaper than buying the entire brush with handle.  You just have to get the same size knot of silvertip which usually from what I have seen varies from as low as 19mm to as much as 26mm from my experience.  I think this Escali is around a 21mm but could be wrong on that.  So the reason for 3 stars...........easy, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; but not great.  You must decide what you may need.  I have found everyone usually trys to find the cheapest they can live with while the select few will drop a butt load on the best without experimenting.  I like to experiment to see what is best for me and how cheap I can get out for.  Good luck and the worse your out of is $13 here and you can even replace the knot with a comparable sized knot silvertip!for me and how cheap I can get out for.  Good luck and the worse your out of is $13 here and you can even replace the knot with a comparable sized knot silvertip!</li>
            <li> Most brushes tend to lose their game after a few months, but this Escali brings the quality to the fore, and imagine this is the same brush that my father has been using for years. It applies smoothly and after a thorough rinsing, it is ready to go again. This is really the symbol of quality in shaving brushes! I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son with a special shaving cream for sensitive skin and they recommend using a brush to get up a lather</li>
            <li> My first brush works just fine and feels pretty well made,  it is a bargain at this price,  would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t shed some badger hairs.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  The first time I washed it, a couple of hairs came off, but I haven&#x27;t seen any more fallout for weeks.  It works up a real nice lather.</li>
            <li> This was a great product for the price. It has worked wonderfully so far. I only had 1 bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> A shaving brush should be a help without a hindrance at shaving, It should hold water, it should spread shaving cream evenly, it should not be harsh on the face and, if possible, it should be a visual asset to your bathroom shelf. The Escali is all this. Thank you for making this item available.</li>
            <li> Incredible softness and it feels great when using hot water. Run hot water on it for a few seconds and enjoy the hot lather. Get this guys as it is so soft. Just remember to rinse well before hanging to dry.</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for.  Very little shedding at first and none after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and I would recommend to a friend. the soap leathers up nicely and works great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these brushes and found the Escali badger brush to hold up longer than others at a similar price range. I have bought him these two years in a row (they make great stocking stuffers). Thanks to the seller for a quality product and smooth transactions.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Xmas.  My prior badger brush was a tweezerman.  Luckily for me it isn&#x27;t worn out yet.  As my gift of the Escali has fallen short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters I use Old Bond Street shaving cream.  I&#x27;m not one to mess around when it comes to my shaving.  The Escali wet seemed to develope a lack of hairs in the middle. It seemed to separate and lose all it&#x27;s thickness when wet.  I was very surprised and disappointed.  As it seems I&#x27;m one of the few that experienced a poor lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but my biggest complaint is the smell of the brush.  It has an odor.  So much that I can&#x27;t even smell my Old Bond Almond Shaving Cream.  I feel bad as it was an Xmas gift.  But luckily my year old previous badger brush out performs this poor excuse for a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add I am A veteran shaver and have my safety razor stand.  So yes I properly dry the the brush handle up.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter as the brush separates leaving no head to brisssle your face or wrestle up a good lather.  What a joke Escali.  Maybe mine was a defect.  I&#x27;m dumb founded as to how it smells so bad when wet!</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMEND THE ESCALI BRUSH TO ANY PERSON WHO USES THE SOAP&lt;br /&gt;CUP TO SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;THE HANDLE COULD A LITTLE BIT LONGER.  THE OVER ALL DESIGN IS OK.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. It&#x27;s very well made, isn&#x27;t prickly, and only lost a few hairs when I first used it. I use it nearly every day and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews; However, what I missed is that it doesn&#x27;t work with Gillette shave gel. I think I need to buy the good old shaving soap. If this message was there in the reviews, I missed it. The idea that I had in mind was to get rid of using my finger to apply the gel which results in unnecessary dripping / wasted gel in the wash basin. However, if I use the brush with gel, it doesn&#x27;t give any lather.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a steal of a price. I want to get another one even though I don&#x27;t need it yet. When the time comes, I will get another.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It whips a beautiful smooth lather, cleans and dries well.  Lost a few hairs the first few times I used it, but its gotten even softer with use.  Makes shaving fun.</li>
            <li> Got the brush in, was hoping for the best due to high ratings, however I have used it two days so far and bristles constantly come out, I&#x27;ve probably lose 20 bristles so far.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this brush the first time I used it was the smell.  It smells like it has been soaked in raw petroleum for a while, and it hasn&#x27;t improved over the few times I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;m actually a little concerned what chemicals I&#x27;m smearing on my face when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was how many hairs were falling out as I tried to whip up a lather with my proraso soap.  A good 10-20 hairs fell out the first use and each subsequent use.  I have to pick the hairs out of the soap with a tweezer every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it just doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles, and the bristles it does have are far too soft to get a decent lather going.  The bristles should be stiff even when wet, but these hang like a horsetail once wet, and I can&#x27;t build a lather with it that will cover my face.  Also, since the bristles are so soft, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting the soap under my beard hairs, which results in far more nicking when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very poor shaving brush...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because I remember my dad using a badger brush for shaving.  My husband loves it, using a badger brush and a good razor has allowed my husband to shave more frequently and not break out.</li>
            <li> I can testify that this is a great brush. Although it was bought for someone else it gets stolen on a regular basis and due to that I can say it holds up very well. Exfoliates, doesn&#x27;t lose a ton of bristles, makes it really easy to lather up and distribute shaving soap and rinses clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no really distinctive animal odor from this brush. I suppose if I really crammed my nose into it I could detect something, but that would assume I know what I should be smelling in the first place. Nothing offensive that I can detect, so that&#x27;s another good thing. It is easy to keep in shape and clean - just run water through it, take the bristles from right under the handle in the web between index finger and thumb, and squeeze downward once or twice, and the brush is in shape and free of all water and soap. Hang on a holder, and it&#x27;s ready to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So nice when something I buy is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and rivals the more expensive brushes.  Once this little jewel is broken you will begin to see why this brush is so popular.  Join the club and buy this brush and use the savings to get some more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> This brush works great. I&#x27;ve only lost 3 hairs (out of the brush) for daily use in the past 3 months. The brush feels great on my face, and warms up great in hot water. I was worried I would need a more expensive brush, but I feel confident now that this will last me at least a year. I&#x27;m sure it may even beat that.</li>
            <li> The brush has a nice feel and is economically priced in the badger line.  I have not had it long and seems to shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks - no issues.  Some reviews commented on shedding bristles and odor.  There was slight odor out of packaging - with regular use the odor has subsided.  No issue there.  With respect to shedding bristles - lost maybe 10 bristles in two weeks of usage.  I rarely see a bristle come out on a daily basis now.  I see no issue on shedding.  I do dry the brush thoroughly and leave it on its side between use.  This brush does the job it was design to do and I see no negative attributes.  Great value for the price.  I would not buy a more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this brush!  Soft enough for face but hard enough to stand up to soap and face!  Glad I went with this brush!</li>
            <li> I had a Malamute once. He didn&#x27;t shed. He had puppies. If this thing tried slightly harder, it could be a Malamute, too. I like the design just fine. Shape of handle, etc. But I really don&#x27;t like picking hairs off my shave soap, nor my face. It looses quite a few bristles with every shave. Not talking a stray bristle here or there. It&#x27;s 8 - 10 or so. It&#x27;s going to be bald before long. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So far so good. More than a month in, and fine. Hard to compare yet because my first brush lasted me 7 years. It had a plastic handle and I probably mistreated it when banging it against a surface to expel the soap when rinsing.   Edit:  Many months in. A few bristles lost, but this item is performing great. If it gets to 7 years, like my first badger brush, It&#x27;ll be as good.   I now tend to take care of my shaving gear and so far all has lasted well beyond any cost/value expectation I&#x27;ve had.   this item is great.</li>
            <li> Used it for several months and it has held up,perfectly. They shipped promptly. I like it so much I am buying another to replace the one I just left in Australia.</li>
            <li> Great price and seems to do the trick so far.  I can&#x27;t speak to the durability but it is very light and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> My last brush which finally fell apart after 30 years, so I bought this as a replacement. It is a little smaller than I like and I would prefer the bristles to be slightly stiffer. The first time I used it, the lather turned an ugly brown. I suppose the bristles must be dyed. The problem went away after I washed the brush thoroughly several time. Seems they could have done this before shipping the product. If you get one, wash it a few times before using. Unless, of course, you like brown lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it functions OK.</li>
            <li> I have several brushes ranging from inexpensive boar hair to pricey and fancy silvertip badger. They all do what is necessary: create lather from soaps and creams, either directly on the face, in a bowl, or in your hand. The boar hair brushes need a little time to break in (literally, as the hair tips split and become finer, and therefore begin to cut through the soap bubbles) and could get a bit floppy (think brushing-like).  The higher end badger brushes are very expensive and too wispy soft so they don’t pick up enough hard soap, for example. But, they all work and do what is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Escali brush (and its identical cousin, the Tweezerman) is the brush I use most often sometimes every day. I’ve tried other “pure badger” grade knots and they are exactly the same in performance... just cost more! This brush whips up lather without effort, straight out of the box (please see below to prepare your brush for first use, however). It needs very little care/maintenance. And, it costs very little in the event you must replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using the same Escali brush for over 2 years. For a period of about 4 months, I used this same brush every day. It’s a pleasure to use, and I actually like the small amount of prickly hairs as they exfoliate during a face lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you begin using:&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Prepare a hot water soap with a few drops of dish soap. Soak in the soapy water for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rinse under warm running tap water for 2-3 minutes, taking care to remove all soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;4. Gently squeeze excess water and give a few good shakes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Rub tip against a dry clean towel. Shave a bit more and repeat to rub against a dry clean towel. Do this for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;6. Place in a well ventilated area and allow to dry. Brush hanger is not necessary, but if you must, place in a dry shallow bowl on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, follow steps #4-6 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3-4 months of use, or as soon as too much soap buildup is visible, follow above steps #1-6, but between #2-3 add this step:&lt;br /&gt;2a. With a toothbrush, gently brush with the grain of the bristles to help remove soap build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs will fall out during the first 1 month of use, then one hair will fall out every 3-4 uses. This is OK. With this type of bristle loss, you will enjoy the brush for a minimum of 5 years, if not more.</li>
            <li> I love this Shaving Brush. It keeps its shape. It&#x27;s soft. The handle is perfect. When I first received the brush it smelled like a badger!  After just a few days, the smell totally disappeared. But the brush remains my favorite of three brands that I own.</li>
            <li> I just recently got into wet shaving with a DE razor and I did not want to spend a lot on a brush. This fit the bill with really good reviews. I have only used it a few times thus far and it does the job. I will update this later as I break it in more.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a gift. He is a newbie on old school shaving and he is loving it.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this brush, have been using this for a couple of months and it sheds very little and dry&#x27;s pretty fast!! A good brush at a great price point!</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, The only problem a i have is that it sheds a little, i hope its because its new, but other than that keeps a good lather .</li>
            <li> I am giving this as a Father&#x27;s Day present.  I hope he likes it based upon other&#x27;s reviews.  I am getting so many email to rate this I am filling this out just to stop getting them.</li>
            <li> It has a bad odor when you take it out of the box and for the first few shaves. It also sheds a lot and leaves the hairs on the face and those get in the way. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. I had never used one before, but using this brush with some sandalwood soap let my&lt;br /&gt;olfactory senses take a trip back to barber shops fifty years ago. Time travel with a nose?</li>
            <li> prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.</li>
            <li> Are you looking to switch away from the shaving cream in a can, and go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;?  The first thing you will need is a good brush...and this is it.  The Escali brush is both a good product and a reasonably-priced one.  It does a great job of getting your beard lathered up and prepared for a close shave.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> From the moment I placed it in my shaving mug, the bristles splayed out to form a disk shape. Pretty much useless as a shaving brush, though I supposed it could be re-purposed into some kind of paperweight.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to hold water well and do the job its supposed to. Looks nice. Loses a bit of hair at first but that stops after some usage.</li>
            <li> Have only used the brush about 3 or 4 times.  It works well and looks nice.  First time I used it I pressed down too hard in the shaving cup and got a few bristles going the wrong direction.  I used a very small screwdriver and gently lifted the bristles back to where they should be.  Now it looks fine again and works well.</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these; the 2nd and 3rd were for my adult sons.  You reach a point where you beard is thick enough that it really wants the shaving cream spread on by a brush, not by hand, and they are there.  I&#x27;ve owned other brushes, and they wore out too quickly.  This one lasts.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works like it is supposed to do and gets the job done, I also really like the design for the brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaving brush for my husband. It arrived quickly and the product description was accurate. My husband likes the brush just fine.</li>
            <li> first time brush, price is fair for quality. other brushes in brick and mortar stores beat quality and price.</li>
            <li> This is my second shave brush and I have to admit that going with badger over boar is amazing.  Its a fairly standard brush, may opt for the black badger brush next time.</li>
            <li> We looked everywhere and could not find a shaving brush, so I went to Amazon.  My husband is very happy with it.  It&#x27;s a great product.  The old brush looks like Donald Trump.  Wish I could show you a picture!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a family member and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes. However, I like how this brush feels on my face, and it does a good job</li>
            <li> The first impression was this was a good brush.  For the money it isn&#x27;t bad.  After about a month of use the bristles are falling out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush but some shedding.  I may have to replace it in a year.  Worth  it for the foam!</li>
            <li> I got this brush because it is relatively inexpensive and is a badger hair brush. I was new to DE shaving when I got this so I was not very clear to the benefits of getting a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that this brush is awesome and completely worth the money. It holds water AMAZINGLY well and creates great lathers time and time again. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; but, for the money, this is an excellent shaving brush.  I have been using it for a couple of months now and have had none of the usual hairs falling out, it stays fluffy and just th right stiffness and I have noticed no discolering of the wood handle from water.  I do, however, take care of my brush, I rinse it well after each use, shake it out, and hang it from a wall mounted holder to dry.  It is a \\&quot;supple stiffness\\&quot; brush.  Stiff enough to get the job done but soft enough not to be gougeing your face.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My last brush was nowhere near this good and cost me considerably more money.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend.  Especially if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with a double edged safety razor and I must say, I no longer look at shaving as a chore. Just throw some shave soap in an old coffee mug and lather it up with the brush. Old school style is irreplaceable and unmatchable. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, feels high quality, but for cheap. Finally got me to retire the brush I bought in Prague, 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush - especially for the price! May or may not be honey badger.</li>
            <li> Makes so much more soap lather then the one that came with the kit I bought. The brush is much more softer then the original one</li>
            <li> Not a quality as I expected Hairs fall our each time</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush it shed bristles.  Not a lot but a few each shave.  Very annoying.  But I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shedding has stopped and the brush aids a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This Shaving Brush Lathers Proraso Nicely, overall a good product and fair price. Feels good in hand. After use, dry the brush by keeping it upside down or sideways, not upright.</li>
            <li> Although this brush is smaller than I thought it would be, it still does a great job of getting my face ready for a blade. I only knocked off a singe star because mine has &#x27;shed&#x27; a few dozen bristles in each my first few shaves. It has since stopped but it is not as full as the day it arrived</li>
            <li> So, I was looking forward to my first badger brush, after having to use a boar brush that got ratty and rough on my face. It is definitely an improvement. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because while it is really soft and an improvement over my old boar brush, it still had some flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s a badger brush, and I knew it was a real badger brush because it smelled of badger. I had to lather my shave soap and leave the suds in the brush before it got better. Now my brush smells like my nice almond shave soap, but it took some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that this badger brush has hair falling out of it. Comparatively though, the badger brush doesn&#x27;t have hair falling out nearly as much as the boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re shopping for this thing, keep in mind you might need to de-odorize it, which isn&#x27;t hard. Just build up a lather, and leave the soap suds in the brush for a while. It should be better, but it might take a few hours or a day. Also you might get a few hairs falling out of the brush every now and then.</li>
            <li> I ignored the comments I read about the this brush shading it&#x27;s bristles, BIG MISTAKE!!&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous!  is the best description, dozens of bristles everyware between my face, the soap and the sink on the very first use , further more , this thing is not soft at all, it so prickly it feels more like a $1 paint brush, except the paint brush might not shed its bristles at the rate this thing did, I&#x27;m surprised this item in for sale in amazon at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and it feels very nice on the face. It hold water pretty well and gives a great lather with my stainless bowl. It does shed a bit, and is still losing a few hairs after 2 weeks of use. Not enough to bother me into buying a new one though.</li>
            <li> My first brush and I must say it is really a nice instrument to have.  My beard is really soften prior to shaving.  Cleans nice and looks good.</li>
            <li> Great product affordable price . not the highest quality but for what i paid I didn&#x27;t expect much and it exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I just started using a DE safety razor and shaving old fashioned, but I have to say the experience has been night and day. I actually enjoy shaving now, every day, and I decided to spend the extra money on this badger brush instead of the cheaper ones. I could not be happier with this product and your company has locked me in as a customer for life. I will continue to support your  efficient and appreciated customer service &amp; shipping standards.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it sheds like crazy...I let it go for a few weeks thinking that maybe it would stop, but nope...every shave at least 3 or 4 buried in the Proraso and more on my face and neck...Spend money and get a decent one instead of buying this and then buying a good one...waste. of. money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a badger brush for shaving for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;My adult son and his family were here on vacation a few weeks ago. He asked me how long had I used the soap, brush and razor to shave with. He thought it was nostalgic. Said he might try it. So I bought him a set for his birthday last week. He received it a few days later. He called and was so excited. Talked to him last night, he&#x27;s lovin the brush, soap and mug. Thanks for helping me pass on a truly great tradition and a well built brush.&lt;br /&gt;May your business flourish.&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price; good value.</li>
            <li> I bought it because Amazon suggested to buy together when i was shopping my razor..with the shaving gel which i am used to applying by hand..i dont find a good reason to switch to a brush..</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are soft and feel good on my face. This is a great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> I have used Tweezermans brush before this one and that had no smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Escalis is definitely softer then Tweezermans brush but it does lose more hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked it and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I using this as a prop in the Musical Play, SWEENEY TODD.  I have received  NO bad feedback from the actors about it being too rough on their face.</li>
            <li> A little rougher and pointier feeling than a $200 badger hair brush but hey, for the price, certainly can&#x27;t go wrong! My roommate and I both bought one so I guess it would be nice if there were color options for the base.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a while. It&#x27;s well-made and lathers well. You might want to shampoo it when you first get it to remove the funky smell; I didn&#x27;t, though, and the smell went away after a few shaves. It&#x27;s very light, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preference. I can definitely recommend this brush for anyone thinking about getting into wet shaving without wanting to invest a significant amount.</li>
            <li> This is as cheap as they come. I was looking for a quality brush and decided to skimp and get this one for the price - I couldn&#x27;t have been more sorry. Each shave - four of them - hair just kept coming out of the brush and onto my face. Not a good experience. I sacked this one and got a Parker - happy times. Better brush for just a little more $$.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into the old school way of shaving, this brush really lathers and creates the right texture for you to have an incredible shave.  I ordered the brush and it arrived quicker than expected.  Great product!</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush.  As other reviewers have noted you will see hakrs in your shave cream rather often, but for the price it&#x27;s acceptable.  Also, can&#x27;t beat having a nice badger massage first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> i only used this brush once and other than shedding the brush&#x27;s hair in the middle section got deformed making it uncomfortable to use.  It appears that most reviews in 2013 are negative so i&#x27;m thinking the product was great at some point but its quality changed recently.  I do not recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Received shipment quickly, and the brush is a well crafted piece, which feels solid and heavy in hand. Thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and wanted a cheap brush to learn how to maintain and use them. This exceeded my expectations. I have barely lost any hairs in it, and it keeps the shape well. The lather it makes is beautiful and it applies it well. I give it a full rinse, then a good squeezing, shaping it into a christmas lightbulb before putting it on my holder. UPSIDE DOWN. Do NOT put this on the base or sideways. You either need to jury-rig a string or cord to hang it from or drop 20 dollars on something to hold it properly. Don&#x27;t buy this alone without a stand or method of it being inverted, it&#x27;ll deteriorate really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and this is my very first shaving brush.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on it only to find out that I didn&#x27;t like wet shaving.  I thought I would try face lathering right from the start since a) I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on a scuttle / shaving mug and b) I didn&#x27;t want to spend extra clean up time cleaning the scuttle / mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this brush works great!  it&#x27;s inexpensive, but it can work up a great lather right on my face.  The bristles are soft and feel great on my skin.  I am able to load the brush up with soap (TOBS Sandalwood shaving cream) and whip up a great lather in just a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I would mention is that it did lose a couple bristles the very first time that I used it.  I washed it with some dishwashing liquid when I first opened the package (not because it was dirty or smelled bad, but because I didn&#x27;t want to rub something all over my face without making sure it was clean first!).  Then, the first time I swirled it around the tub of shaving cream, there were a few bristles left behind.  I have not seen any more bristles fall out since then so this is not a  big deal for me at all.  Overall, for the price and quality, I give it 5 stars.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine mentioned that badger brushes were considered the best so I bought him this brush.  He said it is soft, feels good to use, and that the lather goes on nicely.  When I asked how come he didn&#x27;t give it five stars he replied, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a brush.  I can&#x27;t see me loving a brush.&amp;#34;  But he really does like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this with a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  I am very happy with all three.</li>
            <li> So far so good . . . I have really enjoyed going old school shaving. I saw more expensive brushes both on Amazon and other sites; however, I bought the Escali and have liked the shave.  As far as durability and longevity, I don&#x27;t know how long a shaving brush should last.  I bought a stand so it dries vertically . . . as such I hope this will lengthen the product&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> This a good brush if you are just starting out with DE or Straight razor shaving. expect some hairs to come out in the beggining as it adjusts. Keep it clean and dry when not using it and you will be fine. The stiffness wears away after about your 10th use or so.</li>
            <li> Great brush, use it all the time. Was a gift and I really love it. Would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and does the job. But the quills have a tendency to fall out -- not sure that this will last very long.</li>
            <li> I would prefer for it to be cheaper, in the $7-$8 range, but I am very satisfied with the quality of the product. I have bought two so far, one for me and one for  my dad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush twice.  Each time, it has deposited many bristles upon my face, which I don&#x27;t notice until I&#x27;m picking them out of my razor.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Not the best brush on the market. I defiantly wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again Id like to try others.​</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush was not up to par with the top ratings it has received. Out of the box the hairs started falling out. Also, the hairs aren&#x27;t as soft as I would have hoped for. It was a scratchy lather and I had to pick the badger hair off of my face before I shaved. Not fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, this brush smelled really bad. Like a dead badger. Not sure if that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> 👍excellent product and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush so I haven&#x27;t really got a basis for comparison, but I like it and it seems to be fairly well made.  My only complaint is the clearcoat on the handle itself is already bubbling and cracked, but it doesn&#x27;t effect how well the brush works and I only care about how it works, not how it looks.  It also shed a few bristles during the first couple uses but seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li> I was getting back into blade shaving after a twenty year hiatus and decided to go with a badger brush, which is the standard for shaving brushes.  Brush works and I have no complaints except it took a little longer than desired for it to stop dropping some of the loose hairs that hadn&#x27;t been affixed during the manufacturing process.  That said, for the price ... I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving. My first brush didn&#x27;t last long (it came in a kit), and I wasn&#x27;t ready to drop major money on a super fancy new brush, but I wanted the badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The brush is as advertised. Styling, hair length, etc. is all like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Minimal hair loss at first use. Both of the brushes I&#x27;ve broke in lost some hair up front. I presume this is part of the deal. This one didn&#x27;t loose much, only on the first use. Now it&#x27;s holding up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Works well! I&#x27;ve encountered zero problems getting my soap to foam up with this brush. The same can be said for applying the foamy soap to my face for the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The badger had to die. Poor critter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- No other bad things to report after two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Important Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially if I&#x27;m being budget conscious. A nicer and more expensive brush would be nice, but I&#x27;m stepping into these waters slowly and this brush was perfect for where I currently am with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I got back to wet shaving recently and purchased this brush as it shows as the top result on Amazon. Overall, it is a decent quality brush and a very good value for a starter. I observed very very few hair loss from the brush in the first 2 months of use which is really phenomenal. One has to know the concepts of wet shaving before rating this brush. you can find several online guides on how to make good lather, select right soap, and take proper care of the brush for its long life. The key factor is to dry it upside down. I use [[ASIN:B00CJ0AN4W Ebony Shaving Brush Drip Stand]] and [[ASIN:B000WNCD32 Williams mug shaving soap - 1.7 oz]] and the combination seeem to work very well while not breaking my wallet.</li>
            <li> Worked 100% better then the Hogs Hair I was using.&lt;br /&gt;Fromn now on its Escali 100% Badger Brush for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Shows considerable wear after sitting in my shower for a couple months.  Still works great though, and feels fantastic with a good lather.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I purchased when I started wetshaving. As such, I had no intention of buying one of the expensive brushes on here, or elsewhere, and so chose between the Escali, and the Tweezerman. Both are in the same price range, and both are highly reviewed here on amazon, but I ended up choosing this one by pure chance. The good things about this brush are its price, it feels comfortable in the hand, and it holds and whips up lather really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the negatives far outweight those. Starting with the first time I used the brush, and continuing up to the present, stray hairs began coming out. Some days it would be just a couple, others easily a half dozen or more. This didn&#x27;t produce any noticeable impact on the brush or its ability to produce lather, but it is very annoying to have a soap covered in badger bristles, and eventually this would have undoubtedly become a problem. But I was saved from having to deal with that potential issue by another one. The handle fell off the brush. I had only been using it for a month, and had been careful not to use it roughly, but it still happened. I uploaded two photos, and of them is a closeup of the glue used to hold the bristles and handle together. Instead of filling the entire area between the two, which would have produced a strong bond, the glue had a large hole in it. This allowed water to seep in and erode it away until the brush fell apart. Considering how these are mass produced somewhere, I highly doubt this is an isolated incident. Perhaps others are more fortunate and it takes them longer than a month for the brush to fall apart, but I have no doubt that eventually it will happen. So do yourself a favor, and buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] is actually cheaper than the Escali, and I&#x27;ve heard very good things about it both on amazon and sites devoted to wetshaving, so that is a very good alternative. Or splurge a little extra money and buy a best badger quality brush. Which brings me to my final point, badger brushes are divided into 3 grades.

            <li> This shaving brush was a gift for my husband and he loves it!  It lathers up nicely, doesn&#x27;t shed, and feels nice.  Plus, the price is extremely reasonable.  A perfect addition to any double edged shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller goes, they shipped a terrific product, shipped quickly, and the item was exactly as described.  HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li> the Escali shaving brush is perfect!  it&#x27;s thick, natural, pure Badger bristles whip up a lather quickly and apply it thickly.  great product.</li>
            <li> This was my first and only brush purchase since I started wet shaving with a DE razor a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a really rich and thick lather with my Prorasso shave cream.  Considering the price of this brush as compared to some of the others, you really can&#x27;t ask for much more.  I&#x27;ve lost some hair from the brush here and there when shaving but nothing significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve never used any of the more expensive, high-end brushes, I&#x27;m sure there are nicer ones out there but I gave 5 stars because of the value.  I have no complaints.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, definitely give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My first shaving cream brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to go off of.  It seems to work fine, holds a lot of water that needs to be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs seems a bit stiff to me and maybe a bit course or rough.  That might be because it&#x27;s new. I&#x27;ve only used it a dozen times or so. It might be because it&#x27;s so cheap.  Or it might just be how shaving brushes are.  I don&#x27;t know.  But it works... and it was cheap.  So I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best buys ever. Not as soft as my thirty-year-old fine English badger, which would probably cost in the hundreds now, but it makes foam easier and seems to be a little better at raising the stubble. It&#x27;s on the medium to small side-- good for travel but OK at home. Classic cream-colored wood handle. I&#x27;d buy a couple more if I thought I could wear it out in five years or so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this baby to, but it does the job at a severe discount vs. other options. My bro said it was soft and that he had a hard time finding one and was impressed. That&#x27;s good. It does have some pokey bristles but it&#x27;s worthy of four stars.</li>
            <li> This brush wears in nicely. I&#x27;ve heard of some people complain of an animal smell from this one, and I have to concur. It stunk a bit the first couple of uses. Now it just keeps the subtle smell of whatever soap I was using. Also some bristle fell out for the first five shaves or so, but that has subsided. I hear there are softer, but if you stick with this one, it too becomes softer.</li>
            <li> This item has improved my shave experience greatly! I used to get a lot razor burn and not a very close shave but now that I use a double edge razor, real british shave cream, and a badger brush I get a much closer shave and little to no razor burn every shave. This brush is perfect for creating and applying a rich later and exfoliating your skin while doing so. However the hair does fall out a lot but it has not degraded my experience.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works just as advertised and feels great when used.  Perfect for making good lather in bowl, holds moisture well and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought the Escali on a chance after much success with the Tweezerman brush. Huge disappointment. The Escali seemed to be missing a large patch of bristles in the center, preventing proper frothing with the tips.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little funky the first few times I used it, but I suppose that badgers smell funky in the wild, too. I like very much the lather this brush produces on my face and am quite pleased with its non-funky smell now that it has been used a few times.</li>
            <li> As with all of the brushes I&#x27;ve used there was a break in period, but once over that this brush has been great. I&#x27;ve been able to work up a pretty solid lather with it, and it&#x27;s finer and softer than the brush I previously had, which cost about the same. This brush is a very good value.</li>
            <li> Using this brush for the first time and I end up with a dozen bristles on my face clogging my razer.  Not impressed.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product, was just as described, well made and seems like it will last for a while, this is my first shaving brush but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, soft bristles.Just what my husband was looking for.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. Great price. Works up fantastic lather.  I will buy again when I am in need of a new brush</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles yet like all the others.For the price you can&#x27;t beat it and also  when it dries out it doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> My bf previously used a different brush he found at Target which comes in a set with the bowl and brush hanger. He complained that it lost too much hair- leaving hair all over his face. This brush loses hair as well, but I think after the first few times, it gradually stops losing as much. My bf has been using this brush for a few months now and has not said anything bad about it. It is not as soft as the other badger brushes I&#x27;ve touched before. However it&#x27;s functional. For the decently low price, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> This brush is very nice and feels great on the skin. Too bad it bends a little too much, could be too much pressure from me.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush at a fantastic price.  The vendor, Perella&#x27;s, shipped the item quickly and efficiently.  If, like me, you haven&#x27;t enjoyed 100% badger against your skin, then this product will enhance your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star because I&#x27;m still breaking it in. It helps give a good lather &amp; is constructed well.</li>
            <li> This brush is high quality and works well! Great so far in my first two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great pure badger brush. It seems well built and the bristles are very soft. It lathers very well and there isn&#x27;t a floppy characteristic to it when it&#x27;s used. Very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> My husband loves it so far. we received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is EXCELLENT! I expected a cheap imitation of &amp;#34;badger hair&amp;#34; but this is the real thing and very much a bargain when compared to Shaving Supply Stores.  I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  Works great and dries quickly.  Its the first time I&#x27;ve shaved with a brush and shave soap and I like it.</li>
            <li> Great brush and a great price with prime shipping, can&#x27;t be beat if you&#x27;re getting into shaving soaps and safety razors. I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave now because of this brush and my new sandalwood shave soap, which this brush lathers incredibly well. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this brush. Works exactly as I would want it to. It lathers great and seems to be made of good quality. It doesn&#x27;t loose hairs very easily, and is ergonomically well made.</li>
            <li> The Brush appeared to be well made, but upon use the bristles are falling out and the soap in the cup is turning dark. Like the dye from the bristles or something. All in all it&#x27;s a POS! Not worth the money!  After posting this review, I was contacted by Epica Products. Naomi was the lady that had contacted me she was very nice and willing to replace the brush, which they did! I have not had opportunity to use the New brush. Most companies these days would have not gone to that level of satisfaction!  Thank You Wayne</li>
            <li> great for first brush and arrived fast</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as soft as my last brush</li>
            <li> I think it works very well. A few hairs seem to fall out each time when I use it. This is my first badger brush so I don&#x27;t know if it normal or not but regardless it does the job. But I&#x27;m guessing there is a reason these aren&#x27;t very expensive compared to the ones at The Art of Shaving. Seemed like the guy there was able to work up a much better lather than I can with less shaving cream. It may be a lot less expensive but seems to use up more shaving cream. Note sure how long you&#x27;d have to keep the same brush to make up the cost in shaving cream savings.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Does the job of applying the lather. Only downfall for me is that right out of the box, pieces of badger hair fall out on each use.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys this brush.  It feels nice on his skin and not scratchy.  There is less hairs coming loose than the previous brush he had.  Also, the wooden handle is very easy to hold onto with wet and soapy hands.</li>
            <li> I am not a connoisseur of different types of bristle, but this brush is comfortable to hold, lathers well, looks great and holds more foam than my old (boar bristle) shaving brush. I do not understand how a brush this size can have more bristles than the Escali without some pointing straight sideways and being totally useless. I suppose the more expensive brands have some secret way of doing this. Not worth paying $30 to $99 to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the brush lasts longer than my old one, I will come back and upgrade to five stars. And I do dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> Using a pure badger brush makes a big difference when applying your shave cream.  It applies easily and makes for a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The order was filled in a timely manner. I was excited about using the brush. I soak it during my shower in hit water. The brush feels great on my face and gets the soap lathered up nicely. Great product.</li>
            <li> This brush is smaller than pictured. The bristles are ok, just not enough of them. Of course looking at a photo of the Escali brush on the Escali stand it all looks fine. no frame of reference. I would NOT recommend the Brush OR the Stand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t anticipating a great brush, just because of the price, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for at least a couple of months, and there&#x27;s been no indication of poor quality. Over all of this time, I may have lost five or so bristles, a totally negligible amount. After a shave, it&#x27;s easy to rinse and dry. I would definitely recommend this as a good shaving brush for someone who wants to step up their game with a badger brush, but don&#x27;t want to buy that $80 lifetime brush just yet. Perfect first brush.</li>
            <li> The Brush is exactly what I expected it to be. It&#x27;s soft, works well, and while not a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; item, seems like it will stand up to daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, there were loose hairs that came out and got into the shaving cream. Nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend letting it soak, rubbing it on your palm under water, and getting rid of any loose hairs before using for the first time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he said he liked it.</li>
            <li> Great product with great feel. Works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly, and does the job just right. Much better than the really cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. Excellent and at the right price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving brush, if you make it well, its both comfortable and will last--not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;They made it well.</li>
            <li> Smelled like horse hair when I first got it.  If it&#x27;s badger hair, then they don&#x27;t to anything to soften it or remove the farm smell.</li>
            <li> High value in this brush.  Bristles are a little stiff vs. ideal for me, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It seems to lose a hair or two about every shave - I expected this to stop, after the first couple uses but it continues.  Not enough to worry about, but a bit surprising. I&#x27;m using this as my travel brush and am pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of badger brushes over the years.  This is one of the better I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for three months now and it does not shed loose hairs like many brushes.  Some brushes need to be replaced after a year they had shed so much. This brush looks like it will last for years.  Use it, rinse it, hang it up.  That&#x27;s all it takes.  With the right soap, produces a thick rich lather.</li>
            <li> Brush has held up well under use so far. Had the expected loose hairs come out initially, but the proper prep (a thorough washing with some soap) minimized it under normal use. Feels nice on my face and works well with my shave soap.</li>
            <li> My fiance recently started using a straight razor to shave, and he had a cheap boards shaving brush to start out.  I wanted to get him something nice as a surprise, so I did a lot of research and ended up getting him this brush and the proraso shaving soap.  He loves this brush and the bristles have stayed in awesome shape!  Some people complained about the smell of the bristles....I told him about that and he said he didn&#x27;t really notice anything but a mild smell that didn&#x27;t bother him at all (and it went away with several uses).  Great product, great price and he&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> Well made.  Works perfectly.  I would buy this shaving brush again.  That&#x27;s all I have to say and Amazon shouldn&#x27;t make me put down more words than I need to review a product.</li>
            <li> This brush works great. A nice rich lather that really lasts. Ever since I started using this along with the safety razor that I purchased with it, I have noticed a change for the better in the way that my skin feels after I shave. Not to mention it has that kick ass old school feel that I really like. It has lost a couple of hairs here and there but it&#x27;s not a significant amount at all. Pick this thing up you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This brush works well, it&#x27;s my first shaving brush. It&#x27;s stiff enough so that I can build a good lather. Make sure you wash it to get all the loose strands out first, I&#x27;m sure this is pretty normal for most brushes though. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and at a good price too.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE: Escali sent me a new brush, and so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing many bristles after a few uses. Excellent customer service **  The brush is attractive and does the job, but I&#x27;ve only owned this for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m constantly losing bristles with each shave. Sometimes just a few, sometimes a lot, and they get stuck to my face, which makes the process messy. Annoying, but you get what you pay for  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair entry-level brush, but don&#x27;t expect longevity here</li>
            <li> Bought this brush to get into the badger hair scene and I do not regret it. It shed for the first few months, but that has slowed down, and it only occasionally drops a hair now and then these days. Two years of (ongoing) faithful service, and badger hair, all for just a couple bucks over a store-bought VDH boar brush. It&#x27;s good and reliable, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience yet with safety razor shaving, but this brush is doing the trick.  I&#x27;m a gal so I use it over a larger area than most and can say that it works just fine for these legs.  I hang it upside down to dry using a little innovation: I tie a ponytail holder around it and safety pin the hair band to a headband. That hangs from any hook on the wall and it&#x27;s easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brush I was very unhappy - a few loose hairs, and the brush hair was very prickly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s incredible. The hairs have become soft and slightly fuzzy, it holds a ton of lather, and provides a great shave prep experience.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving properly but this brush has been excellent. It is made from top quality materials and has helped make shaving a pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to wetshaving, i.e. less than two weeks in. This was my first brush because the price was right, and I know that badger is higher quality than boar hair. This brush certainly gets the job done quickly. I can lather up within a minute to get ready for my shave. The box also came with ideas that I had never considered such as don&#x27;t store this brush upright. My only complaint is that some of the hairs fall out while brushing. It&#x27;s not a big deal because I can pull them off my face, but I want this to last me a long time. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was having razor burn with Gillete fusion razors and decided to this route. The product totally works and I don&#x27;t get razor burn and I get a closer and smoother shave. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of other reviews on here about how many hairs they where finding while using this brush, so I was nervous about buying this, but I&#x27;m cheap first and foremost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I had some hairs come out in the first use, but as to be expected. I was in too much of a hurry and didn&#x27;t do the proper break in technique I read online, so had some issues, but once I used it and broke it in, I may find a hair every once in a great while. For anyone interested in breaking in a brush, you first clean the brush with dish soap thoroughly, trying to get as many of the hairs out as possible, then rinse, then put into a solution of dish soap for about 4 hours, then rinse again trying to get out many of the hairs. Finally whip up a good lather and stand the brush on end to let the lather dry on the bristles. This really helps get rid of the smell, and the lose bristles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it&#x27;s not overly soft, but not bad. That&#x27;s why it gets 4 and not 5 starts; however, for its cost range it should be a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good little brush. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This brush is holding up well for me after a year of shaving. No major shedding, the hair is good quality, and the price was the best I found.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying my new Escali brush. It works well, looks good, is fairly priced and quite pleasant to use. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge into traditional wetshaving, and read that badger hair shaving brushes are the best for generating and applying shaving lather.  I chose this brush for its price point, since I was new to the process.  I have been using it for about a month now, and I am very pleased with the results.  I don&#x27;t know how it compares to more expensive badger hair brushes. But I have no complaints.  I can quickly prepare a great shaving lather and it feels great going onto my face.  The first time I used it, several bristles came off of the brush but I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I don&#x27;t know how this brush compares with higher-end badger hair brushes.  But I am very pleased with the results and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  If you are new to traditional wetshaving and want an affordable entry-level badger hair brush, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> For the price it works wonders, and that&#x27;s all that really matters if you don&#x27;t feel like spending a fortune in a higher end brush. The bristles are soft enough and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my shaves since I got this.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, no hairs falling out, lathers well, fits in hand good. Perfect shaving brush, thanks</li>
            <li> This item is not marked where it was manufactured - should not be sold in the USA...!!! Definitely a nice looking counterfeit</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> This brush works great to get a face massage while applying shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried one of these before - not sure how I had ever shaved without one.</li>
            <li> works great - super affordable. better than the one i got from whatever that overpriced shaving chain in the mall is, which was like 3 times the price</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, Brissels are extremely soft and lather up the soap well</li>
            <li> Was a good starter brush but the low price for badger should be a warning. The brush arrived with knotted hair, which I had to comb for a hr to straighten. I&#x27;ll use this as my travel brush. The bristles fall out often developed an odor rapidly even with proper care.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  It gives me a good lather.  I&#x27;ve had it for about six months and am starting to lose some of the hairs though.  Still, it works great and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Feels great when brushing on the lather.</li>
            <li> It shed a bit for the few uses but works well now and doesn&#x27;t shed any. I havent tried it with a shaving soap yet though</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, don&#x27;t care too much for the hairs tend to come off the brush during initial couple of uses but as I use it more it seems to have subsided. I recommend this brush and this seller, both are top rated.</li>
            <li> Great job by seller getting product to me on time. Was exactly what I expected, a lower middle of the road brush that performed well enough for ~10 bucks. I have since upgraded by do not regret this purchase at all, it allowed me to experiment with building lathers and gave me a good point of reference as to what a pure badger brush is like.</li>
            <li> I can now see why this is so highly rated on Amazon. It is quite the bargain and does a great job of lifting that hair on my face!</li>
            <li> Smells like roadkill. I returned it.  If you enjoy that...........buy this brush.  I prefer the shaving cream as one just uses fingertips to apply.</li>
            <li> Had a smell the first time i used it like wet dog. Once it was washed out it was incredible.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this brush. Makes me actually look forward to shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be going back to aerosol shave cream anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This is good quality brush at a very reasonable price. Some initial hair shedding which ended after a couple wet-dry cycles. Good quality bristles and cut. Good wetting and lathering.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush with little shedding. It certainly makes the shaving process a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaving brush for about 2 months now and could not be happier.  It creates a good lather and seems very well-made--I haven&#x27;t had problems with bristles falling out or anything else that would make me question its quality.  The lower price point compared to some other badger brushes makes it even better!</li>
            <li> my order arrived in an unopened undamaged envelope on the date scheduled. There was no need to contact customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I needed to upgrade my old shaving brush &amp; this is a good choice. easy to use &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend both the seller &amp; the brush to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Brush head broke off from the body after less than 10 uses.  Also sheds hairs, which then get caught in the shaving cream lather on your face.  Spend a few bucks more and get something more reliable.</li>
            <li> I really like my Escali badger brush. It feels great on my face, creates a good lather, and cleans up easily. The only complain I have is that it sheds quite a bit of hair, but being new to using a shaving brush, perhaps this is normal.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this brush for shaving and really likes it.  He uses it to lather&lt;br /&gt;a soap puck in a shaving mug, and the soap spreads really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaving brush to anyone considering&lt;br /&gt;buying one.</li>
            <li> New user of safety razor so I got this brush as part of my kit bag. It is not bad but couple of hairs do tend to come off so watch out for that.</li>
            <li> The brush started knotting in the middle after about two weeks of use. Makes it a little more difficult to use, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li> While this is a very soft shaving brush, it is difficult to create the level of suds I would like to have on my face.  I also found it has a tendency to spread wide, leaving a gap in the middle. This made it harder to apply the suds to my face.  I would NOT purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas present to my son who has decided to go old school. Razors are so darn expensive these days and he has come to appreciate the way his grandfather shaved.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about EscaliI decided to try one and find out for myself. A lot of shaving brushes lose hair after  each shave.&lt;br /&gt;Escali brush don&#x27;t. It lathers up fast and spreads smoothly on my face. The badger hair lifts the wiskers enough for the razor to&lt;br /&gt;cut them close. I have no regrets about buying the Escali brush and will buy another when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RWH</li>
            <li> This has been a great shaving brush.  Works up a great lather and helps prepare your face for an amazing shave.  I would definitely recommend this product for any classic gentlemen looking to take their shave up a notch.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have never used a shaving brush in my life.  That being said, this brush worked great, held water like a champ and cleaned up easily.  The bristles were a little &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; but I figure that can be expected.  It lost quite a few bristles upon initial wetting and use, but I anticipated this prior to actual use and gave it a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; prior to using for my shave cream.  Did not seem to lose more bristles than I would expect from a new brush of any sort.</li>
            <li> Able to whip up a thick / rich lather with little effort. The Badger bristles are not overly stiff. Feels good on the face. Holds its shape. With proper care the brush should last for years. Will buy another when needed. The Escali badger brush is worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using badger brushes for some years. This one is &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; and produces great lather. In addition it give a good face scrub. I would recommend hang it upside down after use. It will last years.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic shipping time, it came in time for a late christmas gift for myself.</li>
            <li> The concern people to have about buying inexpensive shaving brushes seems to be that they will shed hair, so let me address that first. This brush lost maybe 3 hairs in the first two shaves, and zero after that. In my mind, that&#x27;s a non-issue; the brush&#x27;s construction is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works well. I can&#x27;t say how well relatively speaking because I&#x27;ve never used a different shaving brush. Its look and feel is not at all that of a budget product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2014-02-20: After initially not shedding much, this brush is now shedding a few hairs every time it is used. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it does get a little messy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Mercur 180 razor. Perfect accessory. Smooth application of the soap.Helps the soap lather up properly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try my new brush along with Razor and all the bells and whistle&#x27;s.The brush was shedding like My dog.I will try a more expensive next.</li>
            <li> does exactly what is supposed to do, very soft, saves a lot of shaving cream..my only regret..I didn&#x27;t buy it  a long time ago</li>
            <li> It arrived in its packaging with the brush completely broken off from the handle - the glue did not hold at all.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.  It makes a great lather and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> for the price you get what you pay for ... the first thing i noticed when i opened the box was the hairs sticking to the plastic that it was in than the hairs where falling out when i ran my hand threw it ....but i expected that from a $12 brush so its fine for a beginner not looking to spend a lot of money</li>
            <li> creates a great lather and is very durable. I would recommend it to anyone even if you use the crappy new-age razors.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this brush compares to others, since this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought, but seems to be very good and would buy this one again.  Definitely would recommend to anyone interested</li>
            <li> Works like it should, great price. Am glad that I bought it. Will be getting a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I received the product as advertised and on time.  However, I like the brush but hair strands continue to come loose and the strands are not as soft as I had hoped.  but take my comments with a grain of salt because this is my first experience with this type of shaving.  I really like using a DE razor and shaving soap.  I may need to try several brands to get the right brush for me.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice brush. The quality of this brush vs the ones sold in retail stores is fantastic. It is well made, has a good weight to it and the bristles are just fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think the price is good.  The delivery was real fast and it sure did help me out.  I truly recommend this shaving brush</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a durable shaving brush. Cleans very easily and dries very quickly. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving brush. Great lather!&lt;br /&gt;Nice handle with great finish.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up easily. I really like the way it looks in the stand!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using brushes for 50 years and this is one of the best. The bargain price is a bonus! I would have paid much more. You cannot go wrong with this brush and anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree has not been shaving as long as I have! The bristles are stiff enough to get a great lather yet soft enough to not irritate, They have not fallen out, despite daily vigorous use for over a month now.I was so pleased, I bought a second and third for my travel kit and vacation home. I would also recommend the Escali brush and shaver stand. Classic good looks and functionality!&lt;br /&gt;Looks great with my Harry&#x27;s Winston shaver!</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush while serving in the middle east, got there quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Also the brush itself is great, helped provide a perfectly smooth, close shave DAILY, even with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be ordering from Perella’s Products again soon. Take it from a guy with sensitive skin who HAS TO SHAVE DAILY!</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a starter brush for my son. I guess it serves it&#x27;s purpose, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with how small it is.</li>
            <li> The brush works as a brush should - lathers, spreads soap, etc., - but after less 9 months the bristles started to fall out. I would guess the brush will last through another 2 or 3 months before a new one will be needed. The upside is that it only cost $13 as opposed to $50 plus so I suppose it makes monetary sense to resign oneself to replacing it once a year.</li>
            <li> Best bang for your buck here. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Was highly recommended by others, and I can see why. Very soft and lathers up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 3 months now.  A few bristle have fallen out through use, which is to be expected.  I&#x27;d say nothing out of the ordinary -- great brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> works geat--lathers the beard perfectly. Rinses clean easily under running water.</li>
            <li> Minor shedding, but makes a good lather. The handle is a bit smaller than my VDH</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about a week ago and have used it every day since.  I have absolutely no complaints.  The brush is soft on my face but stiff enough to raise the hair for shaving.  The build is good quality.  The appearance is not as fancy as some on the market but it is an amazing buy for what you get.  I would definitely recommend it.  Plus it&#x27;s made in the good ol&#x27; U S of A.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD BRUSH AND A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Old school. Love my item.</li>
            <li> The brush holds a lot of soap, and the bristles are nice and soft.  Although the handle is a bit short for me, the wood is good quality.  I&#x27;d get this brush again -- but hopefully, I won&#x27;t have to for a long time.</li>
            <li> Stiffer bristles than another brush I have. I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first badger brush I ever had, so I do not have anything to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very beginning it had a strong smell (badger, I suppose), but that quickly vanished, just by using it. The brush is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> After used this brush daily for about a week, it not was a quarter sized bare patch.  Each shave, a few dozen bristles would fall out.  There are good boar brushes, like an Omega, for the same price.  I will not buy another badger brush until I am willing to spend the $$$ for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush-smooth to the face, great lather, and my husband loved receiving it for his Hayworth!</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles ( around the outer rim) are short...and jab the skin as you apply the shave cream. Makes shaving somewhat painful. By the way I grew up using straight razors and brushes...which gave me no problem.</li>
            <li> I tried to post something about a honey badger, but the Amazon review police didn&#x27;t like it, so I won&#x27;t mention the honey badger.  This is a great brush that feels very soft when applying the shaving soap.  The quality is great and after a few of the hairs coming out initially it has been holding up great.  Much better than the plastic one that I have.  Spend the money and get a great brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I have bought 3 of these now.  1 at home, 1 at work and now one for my son.  I Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft on the face and it holds soap really we&#x27;ll. However, I&#x27;m waiting to see when the brush will stop losing hair each time I use it. At this rate, it will be replaced in a few months.</li>
            <li> As described. great price, packed well &amp; shipped on time</li>
            <li> My spouse uses this daily and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about 2 weeks now. Find it perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft .&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t to much you can say about a  brush however you can&#x27;t beat this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve lost more hair from the brush than I&#x27;ve shaved from my face. It&#x27;s my first one so I have nothing to compare it to yet, but if that&#x27;s how good brushes are I will just not use them any more. There&#x27;s badger hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> I never used one of these before or eve know how to, but I wet the thing in water first, then rubbed it around the shaving soap, and the badger hairs start falling out consistently. Working as intended or not?</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush. I got an expensive one for Christmas from an Artistic Shaving place that was falling apart. I like this one better and it&#x27;s far more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and shipping was so fast that the delivery guy was knocking on the door right after I click on finish my order. Seriously, it was here so fast I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Love the brush and it will be my new go to one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Buy a Omega instead. This is a very rough brush. It doesn&#x27;t feel very good if you have sensitive skin. It also tends to shed its bristles a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on a combination of all the positive reviews and the price. It was a gift for my boyfriend who wanted to get started in double-edge (DE) shaving. He says that it lathers well and feels soft and smooth against his skin. So far, after a week&#x27;s worth of shaves it has held up nicely and no bristles have fallen out. It sits perfectly in the mission style wood shave stand that I got him as well. This seems to be a great brush for those just starting in safety razor shaving. Of course you can get a better quality brush by spending more money. In my opinion though, when you are on a budget and aren&#x27;t certain if you will want to stick with this style of shaving, this brush is a great value. No need to spend a crazy amount of money if you are new to this method. Save your money on a fancy brush and instead get a quality razor and blades. I feel like those are more important. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Advertising another brush is bad taste so i won&#x27;t but talking trash about trash is just that trash and this brush is a rip off. No stiffness to it sheds bad and cost to much for the quality.</li>
            <li> A tad rough at first,however,  this brush has tremendous value in regards to quality and price.i will purchase another when this ine expires! ....screw paying big bucks....this one &amp;#34;learns&amp;#34; to love your face!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, not as a shaving brush, but as a dusting tool.  It works very well for dusting LEGO models.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical considering this is a pure badger  brush at a cheap price.  I must say this brush has been good.  It was easy to break in and is not rough on you face and has held up well.  It works up a lather quickly either off your face with a cream or in a bowl.  A good product at a great price. I take good care of it washing it out in lukewarm water and patting it down with a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say.. I like this brush and still use it from time to time. As a beginner it was awesome but once you start using other quality brushes you can tell the difference. Now I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy it but if you have the money I&#x27;d find a better brush.</li>
            <li> Its good but its rough for my skin. It somehow gave me some itch after using. Overall it is a great brush as it traps water easily.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Fine quality. PS, the package says to dry it hanging upside down or flat on the counter. Never dry it on its base.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Escali shaving brush for my husband when his other brush that he&#x27;d had for only a few months started losing bristles. He loves it! It lathers the soap better and we both think he&#x27;s getting a cleaner shave. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This product is disappointing.  Bristles do not standup to constant use.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Use it everyday and it is so much better than using a regular brush. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a very good brush, after 6 months of use it was still shedding, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since it has still shed. There are much better brushes for the same price. In this price range, a synthetic is probably the best choice.</li>
            <li> 2 Week Review.&lt;br /&gt;The brush fell apart during first use. I had Badger hairs spread through out my soap and left all over my face. I didn&#x27;t want to give up and hoped it would stop but every time I use it the same amount of hairs fall out. If it ever stops its because it runs out of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews stating that after awhile the brush tops shedding so I will post an update if it stops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to creating shaving cream foam with a brush so wasn&#x27;t excited about spending a large chunk of money for a high end silver tip brush.  After reading many reviews on this one, I decided to give it a shot.  It does feel nice to brush on the fresh lather rather than squirting some out of a can and then coating my face.  I have only used it a handful of times so can&#x27;t really speak on it&#x27;s durability over time, however it does shed a strand or two of hair per use which i find to be acceptable and normal from what I&#x27;ve read of natural brushes in this price range.  Overall, I have no complaints and would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> A little soft but it works well.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Good brush.  Does the job, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality.  I do notice that some of the fur looks like it gets balled up in the center as I&#x27;m cleaning it after use.  Not a huge deal, but not something I&#x27;ve had happen with other brushes.  Overall, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It does the job, and does it well.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, even for twice the price.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never previously used a badger brush because of its exorbitant cost &amp; this is a world of difference. At this price, it&#x27;s a definite introduction &amp; investment to the world of wet shaving. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> A huge improvement over any boar / synthetic hair brush out there. Cannot see why spend more when you try this smooth brush.</li>
            <li> A great starter brush. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is looking for an affordable way to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; shaving brush so my experience is obviously limited.  Nonetheless, I am impressed at how well the brush works, smooth and even.  Just as important, the brush has kept its shape well and, resting upside down inbetween game times, it has held up very well and does not seem to make a mess at all (which I thought would be a problem while drying...).  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Very nice.This is my second brush.  I must admit that I did not know how to care for these brushes when I bought my first brush.  That truly is not an issue.  If you treat this brush, as i now do, with the mininmum of care for a brush, it will last. Ahh, the minimun   of care, don&#x27;t squeeze it dry.  Don&#x27;t use the brush like a paint brush.  Swirl it.  Rinse it if you like but not with the handle down (meaning the water rinsing over the brush with the handle with the handle facing the sink) .  Any soap, cream (I use cream) that is left on the brush will not be detriment when used for the next shave.  I am not a &#x27;life long&#x27; straight razor user, but will be considered one as of last year.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but the cheapness shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brush for 6 months -- I shaved once every two to three days.  This brush shed every time I used it.  The brush also didn&#x27;t lather well, but it worked just enough for me to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded to a $30 Beauty Strokes H.I.S. synthetic brush and now I am much happier.  The synthetic brush does not shed, is softer, and builds lather much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this $10 brush works, but you definitely get what you pay for at this low price point.</li>
            <li> nice shaving brush, only negative I will say is sometimes the brush hairs come out more then i would like</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended for works perfect :)</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for value-better than other brushes I have bought at the same price point.  Almost as good as others I have bought that are 3-4 times the price.</li>
            <li> Pros: Works as expected. Solid construction, hair is quite soft, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons It does shed a few hairs every few times I shave. But I think this brush will still easily last a few years, if not more.</li>
            <li> Hi quality. Works great. Came fast.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW: After leaving the below review, I was contacted by the company that produces the brush, and was asked if they could send me out a replacement at no charge.  Wasn&#x27;t going to turn that down, so I agreed.  The new brush arrived in a couple days.  Wanted to get a few shaves in using the new one before re-reviewing it.  This one seems to be holding together much better.  Still will have the occasional bristle fall out, but not nearly as many as before.  3 stars for the brush, extra star for the good customer service.  Thanks!   OLD REVIEW: Very poor quality.  It works as a brush but is moderately prickly when applying lather to softer parts of your face (upper cheeks, etc), but I knew that was probably going to be the case.  That doesn&#x27;t bother me so much, but it is constantly losing bristles.  Had it about a month and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last a 6-12 months.  I figured getting a brush at this price point might be a bad idea and I was right.</li>
            <li> Feels good, does the job</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving brush I have ever used. It&#x27;s soft, no smell to it and very little bristle loss</li>
            <li> Love my badger brush, produces a great lather when shaving. Good quality product for a great price. Would order it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush as a gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves it.  Great quality and it was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> It seems to work good and feels nice on the skin.  I am not an expert as this is my first shaving brush but it does lather well.  My only issue is it seems to lose a lot of hairs that get stuck on my face.  I have used it for about 2 months now and it is still losing 2-3 hairs each shave.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush, entry level for sure, not much back bone to it kind of moppy once you load it up.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner when it comes to wet shaving. After the first use I noticed a horrible odor and bristles coming out. At first I was angry, then I read up on how to actually use a brush. Now I have no problems at all, no bad smell, and rarely do I have a loose bristle. So, just know how to use your equipment. I like it.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and my dad seems to like it.  He hasn&#x27;t killed it yet and so far its in good shape (only a few bristles dangling) in combo with the Escali brush stand.</li>
            <li> Thin in the center, causing tangling of the brush hairs even with very low pressure. Others reported better performance may be due to quality consistency.</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush I have owned. Very well made and keeps its shape through many shaves...will always buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft brush from a nice, friendly, helpful company.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price.  Soft on the face, lathers good.  Very good quality.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Constantly sheds hairs/bristles since day 1.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap no-name brush, so decided to upgrade and enjoy the luxury. While this brush isn&#x27;t terribly expensive, it&#x27;s twice what I paid for my cheapo and definitely not twice as good. I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Note : since I bought  two more ..I just put these two on reserve..I did not use them yet &amp;#62;&amp;#62;so I cannot judge at this time but I think at least they are OK</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money.  Wanna prevent shedding?  Do normal soap wash and rinse prior to using the first time.  You do that with any new brush to &amp;#34;clean it up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got this brush after reading a piece on shaving using a badger brush. The brush was packed in a simple packaging and was easy to get out. At first, it smells strongly of badger hair and the smell decreases after repeated use. Its only after shaving with it for a few times, I realized the correct way to use it. What I do is use a small disposable plastic cup to form my lather. If you have a shaving bowl, that&#x27;s better. Get a small amount of shaving cream in the cup and use the badger brush to lather it. Before that make sure that the badger brush is soaked in warm water for a minute or two to moisten its bristles. The trick is to use a little more water than you would do with a normal nylon brush. The badger hair are good at retaining water and you can get a real good lather. So, start whipping the shaving cream in the cup with circular hand motions and add some water if you feel there is not enough lather. The brush is real smooth on the face and covers your face with thick foam in no time.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating is due to the initial loss of few hair bristles from the brush during lathering which I had to remove from my face in order to shave properly.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to wet shaving I was looking for an affordable brush that would give me a good lather and hold up well.  This brush has not disappointed and I would definitely recommend for the beginner or experienced wet shaver!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, very easy on te face. The size is just right. Also purchased the chrome stand for both brush &amp; razor Escali makes, All good!</li>
            <li> sheds every time I use it.  every time.  would not buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> This brush has performed well. The bristles absorb water quickly making for a soft application of shaving cream.You can&#x27;t beat this brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for wet shaving. It has plenty of badger hair, the wood handle is comfortable, and it will allow you to lather like pro. At first, the brush will smell like a wet dog, but if you soak it in dish washing detergent (look online to find out how to break in a new brush and remove the smell) and use it often the smell will disappear. Be sure to soak the brush in warm water to soften the bristles because it can feel a bit hard and prickly to sensitive skin. The badger hair retains water well, and with adequate water+soap, a great foamy lather can be achieved. Be sure to clean the brush thoroughly and hang it with the bristles down to dry. I have had several knots form in this brush and I still have yet to take them out. This brush is priced very well, and will do everything a shaving brush is supposed to do. Take good care of it and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it sheds every time I use it. Maybe this is common, but otherwise it does the job like one would expect.</li>
            <li> Well this is my first brush ever and I will say its been a positive experience. It does its job very well but I have noticed however that a few hairs have come out of the base and into my lather. If not for that this product would have received the full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great quality in a shaving brush. Everytime I use it, it feels like it&#x27;s brand new. It handles well in water and is very absorbent with shaving lotion. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This was my second order of this item.  I found the quality to be rxcellent.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold shape very well but when you expect for cheap. Recommend spending additional money in getting a better brush</li>
            <li> it arrived clean with no weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it very frequently and it is holding it&#x27;s own, it loses a bit of hair with every use but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;regardless of that, i quite like it.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and comfortable to hold. I didn&#x27;t have trouble getting it to spread a lather without falling apart or having it uneven. I recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving so I was looking for items that were good but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank, and so far this one does the job well.</li>
            <li> This is only the second shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, and it&#x27;s not bad. When I first opened it, the product had a repugnant chemical smell that seemed like it was trying to cover up the stench of badger/animal. Also, the brush lost a lot of bristles on the first shave. However, the smell has gone away, and the loss of bristles has slowed. Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I had been using the stiffer brush that comes with Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush). This one seems almost flimsy like a makeup brush. By comparison I like the way the stiffer brush gets into the hard soaps and also how it feels on my face. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using for many more shaves, I now find that I prefer this to the cheaper brush... but still looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now and it works great! I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The brush needed a good rinse after I soaked it the first time... Smelled very animal like..  And after the second shave the shedding is much less noticeable.  So far very happy for a great price</li>
            <li> Tough to find a pure badger brush for cheaper than this. Given the price, I was expecting a lower quality brush but this one is great.  I would recommend this brush, I would also recommend soaking the brush in hot water while you shower or wash your face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the second badger brush that I have owned. It works just fine. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a huge amount for a brush and you get what you pay for. The brush sheds a bit and the handle reminds me a bit of the international trinkets you find abroad. The price was right and the functionality is there.</li>
            <li> An absolute perfect product!  Wouldn&#x27;t want a bigger brush.  Makes shaving fun and the customer service is superb!  Got here in 2 days.</li>
            <li> it is pretty small actually and easy to use and holds good amount of water and shaving cream... soft on the face...&lt;br /&gt;I am not too impressed with this brush on my first shave...</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft, and holds the shaving cream very nicely.  Really feels great on the face as it spreads the cream/lather around.</li>
            <li> On the first use the brush lost nearly 50 hairs. Each time it is used I can expect another 5-10 to fall off even after using it for the past few weeks. It is stored properly bristle side down on a stand and rinsed thoroughly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it did have a wild scent, but that did fade after about 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush doesn&#x27;t feel a whole lot better than rubbing a paint brush on my face. It&#x27;s quite course. I would firmly discourage anyone from purchasing the brush.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the brush for the price. It does a good job.</li>
            <li> I read that you didn&#x27;t need an expensive badger brush. Some of the expense is with a fancy handle. I took that advice and bought this. I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market and that experts could point you to them. For a beginner, I find this brush is great. It builds a good lather and does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> I recently made the switch to wet shaving and a good brush is a very important part of your equipment , Badger brushes are just perfect to create the lather and massage your face ( I skip the mug and rub the brush loaded with soap directly on my face) and this one is very nicely done , the bristles are soft on your face and the wooden handle has a nice grip , remember to get a stand since brushes must be stored vertically with the bristles down to keep them dry .</li>
            <li> For the price, this has been a good way to ease into old school brush shaving. While not wanting to spend a great amount on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with, the Escali has been reliable and easy to use. It&#x27;s helped greatly by using a brush stand to allow it to dry after use; before then I&#x27;d wedge it in my shower caddy to prevent it from laying on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking over the reviews, I was worried that the brush would smell, but aside from the initial wetting, this hasn&#x27;t been an issue. I&#x27;ve been using the Proraso Sandlewood soap, so if that has something to do with it, so be it. I have been losing at least one to two bristles with a near daily shave lately, so I may have to replace this before too long. I&#x27;ll probably need a new brush before new soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fits in the Colonel Conk shave stand perfectly, and lathers great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is certainly the brushiest brush that ever brushed.</li>
            <li> Well the people who said none of the hair comes off the brush, were wrong. If I took a pic of my soap tub you would see 3-4 hair strands in it. I paid a little extra because of the reviewers who mentioned this. So IMO its just a regular brush and not worth the extra few dollars if the hair comes off anyways.</li>
            <li> It holds the soap wonderfully, and it hasn&#x27;t dropped but one, or two bristles in several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I don&#x27;t have to replace it any time soon, but if I do (accident, loss), I&#x27;d most likely buy the same brush, from here!</li>
            <li> Great little badger brush, really improved my shave! Make sure to let it dry on it&#x27;s side or upside down in a brush holder or it will not keep it&#x27;s shape. That being said, it&#x27;s low maintenance and has become part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out when using brush , you get hairs on you&#x27;re face . I hope it&#x27;s because this brush is new and just needs to wear in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this brush for a few years and when I recently left it at a hotel, I re-ordered another.  If you like using a brush for shaving this is a must have</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush but quality seems great and it has definitely improved the closeness of my shave</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!</li>
            <li> I really like this item, but I wish it did not shed as much of the hair as it does. I&#x27;m sort of new to this, so I can&#x27;t say if this is suppose to happen or not, or it it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong. But the hair falls off of this thing like a chemo patient, and I just wish it didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Loses some of the hairs every time it is used but it&#x27;s not a terrible quality brush, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just went back to using a double edged razor. This was part of the initial &amp;#34;equipment&amp;#34; that I got with the group of things I needed to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so I cannot compare it to others, however I purchased it based on the price and that it&#x27;s 100% badger hair. It works great and was a great value and I have 0 complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it sheds a little.  Still a very good brush, but its a little irritating when a hair gets on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving (6 mo).  I received my initial set up including my Merkur razor, blades, soap, brush, and bowl as a gift.  My initial brush was from the Van Der Hagen shave kit that is currently an add on item.  For $8 it was a good buy, but I knew I would need a new brush after reading reviews and losing so many bristles after only a few shaves.  I did a lot of research and knew the badger brush was the way to go, but I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank.  I finally found this brush, and it came with a low price tag and good reviews.  I decided to give it a try and am happy I did.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it has held up great and much softer on the skin than my other one.  I&#x27;ve lost only a few bristles which I would imagine you will with any brush.  Again, for the price I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying it again.  Good beginner brush that looks good, and works well.  This same company makes a good razor/brush stand at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush being on a budget and having read positive things about it on forums. It does the job, but I am looking to upgrade once i have the money.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the softest brush.&lt;br /&gt;On the first use, it let out a pungent brown water, which thankfully stopped after multiple rinses and washing with my shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;After a dozen or so shaves, it is still losing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it for now, and is definitely good for the price, but I do not feel it deserves more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Never used a Badger brush before.  This is perfect.  It only gives me a smooth shave everyday, my razors lasts longer!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this well made brush. I never used a shaving brush before and am sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Wrote a great review.</li>
            <li> The Escali 100% Pure Badger shaving brush is all it claims to be.  It feels great on the skin and lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also holding it&#x27;s shape quite well.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for two weeks now and love it. The brush holds water and lathers up nicely on my face. like it much better than using a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Started losing hairs from the brush the first time I used it. Gave it some time in hopes it was just getting broken in but after a couple of weeks it is still shedding with each shave. It does the job well. Gets the lather going and is soft when applied to your face. But at this rate I see myself having to purchase a new brush sooner than later. Next time I will spend more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t go to the better safety razor, Geo F. Trumper shaving cream and this Escali shaving brush sooner. A pea size amount of the shaivng cream in the palm of my hand, a quick run of the Escali brush through the faucet water and then working the brush into the palm of my hand to pick up the cream provides a great coat of shaving cream on my face. So much better than some cream out of a can and lathered on top of the whiskers. The brush really picks the whiskers off my face and makes the shave so much smoother. I used the safety razor with canned shaving cream for about 2 months, and the difference between that and using the Escali brush is like the difference between day and night, shaving burn and smoothe skin, bloody chin and baby bottom smoothness.</li>
            <li> This brush is very, very good for the price. I&#x27;ve owned cheapie boar-hair brushes before and this is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll just say that this brush is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few faults, but all are forgivable at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly... yes, the bristles do have an animal odor about them at first. It&#x27;s not terrible, but noticeable. The smell goes away the more you use the brush. To reduce the smell almost immediately, follow the instructions at this link: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, I did notice that the bristles were a bit prickly during the first few uses. Again, this abates with time and use... use the break-in procedure linked above to reduce the prickly feeling right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there is some shedding. I&#x27;ve used the brush for about 15 shaves now and I seem to lose an average of 3 bristles each use. I gently squeeze out excess water before storing the brush hanging handle-up for a drip dry. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m abusing the brush in any way and hopefully it will stop losing bristles once all the loose ones have fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those three faults are (in my opinion) very minor when you consider the price and how well this brush makes a lather. Whether on my face or in my mug, this brush does a fantastic job of building a lather with either soap or cream (or in my case, a dab of Taylor&#x27;s cream with soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the early bristle loss, I think this brush is wonderful for the price. I will most likely give it 5 stars in the future if it stops losing a couple bristles with every shave. For the wet-shave beginner, this brush is quite good.</li>
            <li> My first brush in 40 years glad I am shaving with a blade again</li>
            <li> Have had it for a while and it is still going strong. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this brush. The quality of the product seems to be exceptional. This is the first brush that I have purchased since leaving my cartridge razor, and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations. The bristles are soft, yet firm enough to work lather into my beard after a couple days of growth. I dry the brush hanging from the handle, keeping the bristles always expanded and ready. Update: After having used this brush for a couple months, the bristle adhesive let go while I was rinsing it.</li>
            <li> It sheds some hair but gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Not an expert on these things, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy. After a few shaves, the bristles soften and the brush stops shedding. All in all I&#x27;m happy with this experience.</li>
            <li> Over all, I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it all that much, but the times that I have it&#x27;s worked pretty well.  A few bristles have fallen off in the brushing process, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen every time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty good price for a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! 100% pure badger shaving brush at less than half the cost of competitors.  Not only was the price right but I own expensive brushes &amp; inexpensive brushes and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> As many before me have said, is is a smelly, stiff brush right out of the package.  Take the time to condition it and you&#x27;ll have it in your brush rotation in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Add a bit of water and dish soap and lather a bit, and let the brush soak for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Rinse it off, and lather up one of your soaps or creams.  Then let it sit in your mug or bowl overnight, with the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Clean it off, and give it the smell test.  If it&#x27;s still \\&quot;badgery,\\&quot; repeat step 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is now nice and soft, and smells like shave soap.  It&#x27;s not a great brush, but for $12... It&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is extremely soft, durable, looks great. Fortunately I already had a brush holder, but would be nice if one was included!</li>
            <li> When I started shaving with a DE razor a couple months back I was using what remained of my canned shaving gels (Aveeno, Edge) that I used with my cartridge razors.  I decided to go for the full wet-shave experience and purchased this Escali Badger Brush and some TOBS shaving cream.  I read a lot of the reviews of the Escali brush here on Amazon and decided it was worth the small investment to try it out.  I have been using the brush for about two weeks now, and here&#x27;s what I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is a nice badger brush for very cheap money.  It&#x27;s not a large brush but certainly more than adequate for my shaving needs, I actually like the size.  It holds water well, and works up a great lather with my TOBS cream.  The bristles were a little stiff on my face for the first few days, but they have softened nicely and no longer feel like they are pricking my skin.  The brush did shed about 12-15 bristles over the course of the first three shaves, but none since.  Not sure if this is normal or not, but shedding has not a problem with the brush at all, after those initial uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users commented that there was a strong animal smell to the brush, but aside from a very mild, musky smell during the first couple of uses I have noticed no odor problem at all.  That faint smell faded to nothing after the first few days and all I can smell on the brush now is the residual fragrance of my shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, it&#x27;s pure badger, it works well, and it&#x27;s twelve bucks.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it, as the bristles are nice and soft, but the handle came off after 1 use. There appears to be a crack (or piece missing) where brush connects to wood.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the brush on my skin. The smell was annoying but it is going away. The brush holds water well enough for me and shedding is minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry folks, you get what you pay for and this just isn&#x27;t it. Yes you&#x27;ll save some money, and yes it&#x27;s supposed to be real badger, but I&#x27;m not convinced. Do yourself a favor and order the Parker brush - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RJC1HC/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 - Somehow I lost my Parker brush of multiple years, and had to order a replacement. I ordered the Escali, but it couldn&#x27;t even touch the Parker. The Escali wasn&#x27;t stiff, however the bristles weren&#x27;t remotely soft compared to Parker&#x27;s. The lather was lacking. Furthermore, there was a brownish residue in the water when rinsing out the brush (which in Escali&#x27;s defense I&#x27;m sure goes away after multiple uses.) For me it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. I sent this one back and ordered a replacement parker. Save yourself the time and use a brush that&#x27;s worthy of your face.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived on time with zero defects and works just like I thought it would. I have never tried a boar hair brush or other badger hair so I don&#x27;t know how the stiffness of this brush compares, but it feels just fine to me.</li>
            <li> This is the first shave brush that I have bought.  I previously used the spray foam stuff that came from the can and now that I have this brush and some real shave soap I am experiencing a much closer shave.  This brush makes a rich and frothy lather and really gets under my stubble in order to bring the hairs out.  The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 star review is because it sheds a bit.  The first few times I used it, 4-5 badger hairs would dislodge every time I tried to make a nice lather.  Now, after a month or so of shaving every 2-3 days, a hair or two will dislodge. It&#x27;s nothing to be concerned about but I thought it should be mentioned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush I think.  I&#x27;ve never owned any other brush and I&#x27;ve had this for about a month.  Shipping took the average amount of time.  Packaging was nice.  When you start using, you&#x27;ll notice that many hairs will come out, but will this will stop after you break it in.</li>
            <li> New DE Shaver is loving the experience. This brush works just great. You might think it is cheap but does the job. Be careful just with the name, 100% PURE is the lower end of badger brushes; they go all the way up to silvertip which I learned is much more soft and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are starting DE shaving or just want to try a brush instead of your hands it is a great start. I make very easy lather with PRORASO sensitive skin soap (also a great product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I think I only had bristles (and just a few) fall out with the first shave.  Great quality--buy it!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Quality construction and comfortable.  Good price.</li>
            <li> First ever shaving brush purchased for husband at Christmas. Still works great, no problems.</li>
            <li> The brush separated from the body after several uses. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a common fault. Regardless, deserves a 1 star from me.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush that I have used so do not have much to compare it to. It works well in creating a lather and is good on application as well.</li>
            <li> Old enough to remember the good old days used a number of the shaving brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li> Faint animal smell, not as soft as expected on initial use however over time the brush gradually became softer. Great brush for a great price.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again.  Very lightweight and questionable construction, does not produce much lather at all, and is strangely sized.  Maybe I just prefer a larger brush, but this seemed poorly made and can&#x27;t compare with any of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent quality. It handles a lather well, and spreads evenly. It&#x27;s a little bit smaller than I expected. While that&#x27;s a bad thing for a regular brush, I will continue using this for travel where a smaller size brush is preferred.</li>
            <li> First time DE shaver. I ordered the Escali badger brush along with a Parker razor and Taylor of Old Bond St. shaving cream. The brush has been used daily for about a month now. It shed a lot during the first few uses. The bristles are soft and generate a great lather. Hopefully, it will not go bald in in a year. Good value at half the price of other brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for shaving at the sink. It does a fantastic job in a short time. It is the least expensive of shaving brushing brushes.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this brush.  Not very expensive is matched by the quality.  The brush started losing hair the firs time I used it and continues to showing wear in only a few months.  The handle is small which you cant tell by looking at it.  With the low price just be ready to replace it in a year or so.</li>
            <li> Good beginer brush. It does lose a lot of hairs during the first few uses, but I can see that being normal. It is a little more coarse than I thought it would be, but it does the job well and is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> this is the first brush i have ever bought,so far nice product,holds soap very well and clean up is not a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice big plume. It&#x27;s actually really soft. Yes, it has a badger smell, but it&#x27;s fading away after only 2 shaves. It works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> This thing is soft.  Bristles fall out each use so I am not sure if that is normal or not.  But I&#x27;ve used it every&lt;br /&gt;day since I bought it in January 2014 and it still lathers like day 1.  Feels great to use.</li>
            <li> This brush has lasted one year and is still going strong with regular use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will lose quite a few hairs initially, and a couple every time you use it. However, it still creates a good lather one year later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to let this dry upside down, so either buy a fancy stand or make one out of a wire hanger (they both work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice, lather up your cream in the palm of your non dominant hand instead of a glass or mug. When you lather up your non dominant hand you can easily apply the cream to your face without wasting any cream in the mug/glass. Also, the brush is bristly and they do not feel too good on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will enjoy this product for the price!</li>
            <li> Sheds a lot for the first few uses but then settles down. Dries quickly, but the main problem with this brush is it&#x27;s too floppy to be of much good. You actually end up applying lather with the side of the brush more than the actual tip. I&#x27;ve gone back to my synthetic brush until I find a good badger brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first shaving brush, and it did the job well enough.  It makes a nice lather once you get the hang of it.  The bristles are somewhat prickly on the ends, and like other reviewers, mine loses bristles.  At first it was just now and then, but after a year of shaving every other day, it now loses 2-4 bristles per use.  They stick in the soap and to your face.  I&#x27;ve been religious about washing it out, shaking it dry, and laying it on its side to dry.  (I don&#x27;t have a stand.)  I&#x27;ve now got a synthetic brush for $25 that I really like.  I&#x27;d recommend the Escali if you want to try out shaving with a brush &amp; soap, but aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll like it.  Otherwise, spend a little more for a better quality brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and appears to be very durable. Does its simple task of whipping up a lather well!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  The brush is not top notch, but works ok. The bristles get tangled while you are applying shave soap. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sheds everytime used.  Thought it might&#x27;ve stopped after breaking in but now it&#x27;s just a decoration in the master bath. Prickly as well.</li>
            <li> have not used it as of today but you can see the quality .</li>
            <li> I am New to shving with what I call &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; shaving equiptment, such as this Escali Badger Brush. This is my first shaving brush and am very happy with its Quality, Feel and ease of use. I know, how hard can it be to use a brush right? Well if the brush is not comfortable in your hand, or doesn&#x27;t hold lather well, or the hair the brush is made of is hard and feels like your using a wire brush then it can be a bad time.&lt;br /&gt;  This Escali Badger Hair Brush works perfect for me. Shipping was fast, price was perfect and appears to be made quite well. I know there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but if you are new to wet shaving ( meaning safety Razor, Straight Razor, which I use both of) this brush is perfect and should last for many years. I cant wait until I get it nice and broken in and it softens up just a hair more.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You Escali for a fine Shaving Brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually get the drug store variety of brushes and they don&#x27;t hold up. This brush is well made with a metal ferrule at the base of the bristles and a wooden (not plastic) handle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it looks as though it will hold up under everyday use.</li>
            <li> So this brush has been relegated to my travel shave kit, because I don&#x27;t travel all that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles aren&#x27;t anchored deep enough into the handle, so as soon as the brush meets my face, the bristles flatten out into a squashed mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a less expensive, no-name boar brush I picked up as an add-on from the company that makes my shaving soap, and it  keeps it&#x27;s shape when wet and gives me a much better lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This likely would be improved, were the bristles anchored deeper into the handle so they keep their shape during use. As it stands I can&#x27;t recommend this brush as anyone&#x27;s first foray into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Great value, and badger hairs hold water well and absorbs the shave soap to produce an excellent lather for a close shave. There are other more expensive models and brands, but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft but stiff enough to stand up to a heavy beard.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Does a fine job. Why would anyone went to pay more?</li>
            <li> You can not beat it for the price. Its real badger hair and its feels great. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that it sheds.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite a while now and it is still performing great for me. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into DE shaving, but not wanting to break the bank either. Get this thing, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Smells like a wet badger at first, but washing with shampoo and warm water fixed that. This brush does exactly what it was made for and does it very well. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great feel.  Dries well. Nice price.</li>
            <li> after 3 usess the hair coming out of that and stick on the face but any hv its very smooth....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving soap for a little over a year only recently have I switched to the Escali shaving brush. I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the others I&#x27;ve used. I recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Bought with razor and soap to go old school on the shaving routine.  Sick of shelling out the money for canned shave cream and disposable razors.  Brush is good.  Dries soft and pliable again and doesn&#x27;t shed too badly.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRUSH FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS NOW AND IS VERY GOOD, I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.</li>
            <li> nice feel, great shape, lathers well.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks with two different soaps. It works well with either.</li>
            <li> Still picking out loose hairs after my 5th shave now. I have no complaints besides this. Brings up a really good lather.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and the lather but it keeps losing bristles and I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last very long at this rate. Also I wish they had the body in a darker brown wood to match my shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush for the price.  I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50 or more on a brush and the Escali packs a big bang for your buck. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for about six weeks and although I have very little to compsre it, I find that it performs the trick of getting shaving cream to my face. It did not shed bristles like other reviewers have found, and with better technique and practice I am able to get to the economies that justify this style of personal care. It sometimes retains too much water, but this means an adjustment on my part. I lather twice from the same application of shaving cream for both with the grain and a second pass against the grain without resupply. For the price it looks good and with practice provides proper service.</li>
            <li> My first foray into shaving with a safety razor and this brush came up very highly recommended on various shaving sites. I am very happy with the product and the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving brush.  It is very nice looking.  He also bought a shaving brush stand for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the brush for a few weeks, but it appears to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment. I also use it for a slightly different purpose than it may have been intended. I use this brush to sweep dirt off my weapon in Afghanistan, and it does it&#x27;s job well. Whatever your purpose, I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Not bad for being the first shaving brush I own. It does lose some hairs after using it. Overall is decent for the price I paid</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about a month with a variety of creams and soaps. I have had a good experience creating a thick lather without tons of lathering experience. Initially I had several bristles wash out but after breaking it in I haven&#x27;t noticed any more and have no odor that people have experienced with other brushes. If something happened to mine I would definitely invest in another one.</li>
            <li> Poor quality even on the first use itself bristles falling off and also bad odor from the brush&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the shedding.  It lost at least 20 hairs the first use, and routinely loses approx 5-10 each use since over the four weeks I&#x27;ve had it.  Otherwise, it does hold water well, and creates a nice lather and has a slightly &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; feel which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Compared to my &amp;#34; The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush the Badger hair is not as dense and the hair is shaped in a way in which most of the hairs on the periphery do not touch your skin. It is a good beginner shaving brush and it does the job. &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; brush is way to expensive to be worth upgrading to, but if you have the money to throw away go ahead...</li>
            <li> Great brush, I bought extras to give as gifts. You would be surprised how many men still ise a cup and brush.</li>
            <li> I had to give this a 4 in the reviews because the one I received at least, had quite a bit of fur coming out from the handle. Especially after I used it. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that its comfortable and saves me a lot on shaving cream. The brush spreads it way more effectively than just my hand and therefore I use less.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible. It is quite small for a brush and it does not produce a good lather. The brush sheds like no other and it is still releasing a brown tint when rinsed. The hairs clump together when getting a lather going and it&#x27;s impossible to get any shaving soap on your face because of this. This is by far the worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Spend 30 bucks and get a Parker shaving brush. The difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> after about 3-4 uses, i was flicking the water off teh bristles , and the bunch of bristles completely came off of the wooden body..disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now, and the bristles are quite rigid.  I know other commenters have said it gets soft over time, but when I bought the Van der Hagen kit previously, it was soft right away.  Unfortunately, the Van der Hagen brush fell apart about two weeks ago.  The middle of it literally fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this to replace it.  The bristles fall out as I use it, and they all get caught all over my face and in my razor as I shave.  Very annoying.  It&#x27;s also very prickly, like I mentioned before, so it&#x27;s not comfortable at all to apply the soap to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Proraso soap and the Van der Hagen brush - I might just go ahead and buy another Van der Hagen kit JUST for the brush, since it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> Just perfection. Great quality brush. I know my grandfather had one of these brushes. Reminds me of when quality ruled the world.</li>
            <li> For the money this brush cost, it&#x27;s a very easy 5 star badger brush. I&#x27;m surprised at how well it&#x27;s holding up and has bloomed so nice. While I know it&#x27;s not a top end brush I don&#x27;t pretend it is either. The price point on this brush easily makes it a 5 star buy for what you&#x27;re buying. If you&#x27;re expecting an $80 silver tip for less than $15 bucks, keep on dreaming. But I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised at how nice this brush performs and lasts for what you paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of starting to do some real shaving and dumping the pressure can chemicals and need a nice, low cost brush that performs well, you&#x27;ve found it with the Escali. When it eventually wears out, as all consumables do, you&#x27;ll not be wrong to buy another at these prices if you&#x27;re not wanting to step up your quality of brush.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving, so I was looking for a nice brush for a good price. I found both with this one. I was immediately impressed by how soft the brush was, and how it easily whipped my shaving soap into a nice foamy \\&quot;just right\\&quot; lather to my liking. I am on the road a lot for work, and opted for a cheaper brush as a back up and could tell the difference right away. Compared to other badger brushes, I think this is a great bargain, considering the ease of use, and modest price. I would buy this brush and brand again.</li>
            <li> I have a tweezerman brush that looks very much like this that I love.  I wanted another brush for travel and thought I would try this alternative out.  It might just be the knot I ended up with, but it is soft to the point of being floppy.  From swirling it in soap the hair has knotted up in the center.  Again, it may just be I got a poor example but I have found this to be vastly inferior to the equivelant tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle on my very sensitive face and does an excellent job lathering up the shaving cream. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> The brush is real nice I did have a problem with it. The store jumped right on the problem and fixed it. I wish there was more store like this that care about their product and their customer!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any experience with shaving brushes prior to this Escali Badger Brush.  This was my first journey into safety razor shaving.  I think it does the job very well.  I chose this because I read that badger hair was the best to use.  The lather I get from my shaving soap looks great, and it&#x27;s very comfortable brushing the soap onto my face.  I&#x27;d recommend soaking the brush in hot/warm water for 5 minutes or so prior to shaving.  I forgot to once, and it was a little rough.  A few hairs came out early on, but I&#x27;d think that&#x27;s common for any brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine for under $15, and I think it was well worth it, seeing as how you can waste a ton of money on fancy brushes.  A perfect brush (in a beginner&#x27;s perspective).</li>
            <li> I have never used a brush and shaving soap. Enjoyed the process and got a great shave. Nice product. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brush at such a low price.  The bristles are very soft, but the form a great lather.  This brush performs as well, if not better, than my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; badger brush, which was more than 2x the price.  I want to offer the warning, however, that the brush has an odor, the first few times you get it wet (think wet badger smell).  This can be surprising, the first time you encounter it, as it is very strong.  But, after a few uses and rinses, the odor fades away.  You may want to lather it up and rinse it out a few times, before you plan to start using it.  Also, I recommend buying a stand to hold the brush with bristles down, to let it air dry.  This will improve the performance and lifetime of the brush.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I got an unpleasant smell from it for the first couple of weeks. Also, got a strange brown color coming from it when rinsing it which also lasted a week or two. Not having any prior experience with a badger brush, I&#x27;m guessing it might be normal not being a synthetic brush but then again ... who knows!  It did lose hairs as well during the first couple of weeks too so maybe these are all things you have to contend with using a new badger brush. After having used it for several months, it no longer has the unpleasant smell, holds what bristles it has pretty well and doesn&#x27;t give off the strange brown color when rinsing it. I give it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t know if all these issues are normal. If they are .. then I would probably rate it closer to 5 stars as it holds up and works well now that it&#x27;s broken in. ** UPDATE after a year use: The brush consistently loses hairs with every use which is quite annoying on the face while shaving and in the mixing bowl.  The finish has held up good. I&#x27;d rather pay more for a brush that doesn&#x27;t keep losing hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush to replace the one my son confiscated.  This brush is well made, shaped well and great quality, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very nice. This is my first brush, not sure if it is normal but there is a bit of a shedding, nothing too bad though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE world and, besides enjoying great shaves, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality of products made for wet shavers.  This brush is no exception...great quality and price.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this you&#x27;d think I had lathered up and rubbed my face on my dog.  A few weeks in and it seem to be fine now.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is my first badger brush.</li>
            <li> This brush holds more water and soapy lather than my old boar hair brush. So it is easier to get lathered for shaving. What hasn&#x27;t been so great about this brush is that it smells rather like an unwashed badger each time it gets wet. I have now had it for over a month and the smell is decreasing, but not gone.</li>
            <li> I lost my Parker brush at a hotel so in a fit on rush and based on price point I bout this thing.  What a waste of money.  I jut ordered another Parker and when it comes in this thing is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you like the smell of dead animals and Badger hair all over your face and in your soap bowl then by all means this is the brush for you.........................</li>
            <li> Just what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush but it is very soft, making it hard to get a good lather on harder soaps. I bought another brush less than a week after receiving this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you - this is a quality brush. I will definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Got this along with some other shaving products for my dad who has eveything, he likes the well construtive design and bristles, along with the durability,  great price also.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for a better shaving brush for the money.  It&#x27;s been great.  If you are looking for a new brush or a replacement for an old worn out one, you really should consider this one.  I can tell you this, I keep this one by the sink and another Badger hair brush in the shower that I paid twice the money for.  The quality is very close to equal.  Wish I would have know about the Escali brush long ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my husband because he wanted to keep a brush in our downstairs bathroom and our main bathroom.  As a back-up brush it works well BUT it does loose hairs which is why I give it a 3.  It&#x27;s not the worlds best brush BUT if you just need a back-up brush or need a cheaper brush that still does the job then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> This one was purchased so that the owner will have one at each of his two residences and one in his travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;He says it really does the job.</li>
            <li> This a good brush for the price. Not much animal smell at all but it does lose quite a few hairs in the first 5 uses but then the problem stopped. It took about 2 weeks for the brush to really break in. It still is not the softest brush but creates a good consistent lather relatively quickly. Certainty not the best brush out there but for the price I think this is a fantastic deal and a great brush to start with.</li>
            <li> I bought the Escali brush as part of an effort to change all of my shave equipment and have been very satisfied with its performance.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that loose hairs in the brush will fray and get stuck to your face.  Otherwise it is comfortable and of good quality.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality - great service</li>
            <li> My one experience with the brush is the surprisingly large number of bristles that flaked off the handle while I lathered. Disconcerting to say the least. I remain with my original brush which I was going to replace, but it loses a couple of bristles a shave, the Escali 4 or 5 times that.</li>
            <li> hairs fall out after only a few months. Every day more and more loose hairs fall out. I&#x27;ll soon have to buy another one :-(</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and superb service, I am enjoying my morning shavings now that I am back to the old double edge razor. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> The bristles fell completely off the handle during its second use. Was very disappointed, really wanted a badger bristle brush. Would never purchase this brush again. Cannot send for return because no longer have the packaging.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t impossible to get a good lather with this brush, but it is very difficult. The hairs regularly fall out (a minimum of 5 per shave), and there is a large section of hair that knotted together. I used it for a while without knowing that it was a mediocre brush. Do yourself a favor and pick up and Omega boar brush for the same price OR spring the extra money for a real badger brush.</li>
            <li> Great product.  So far (couple weeks) has performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li> A great value and retains moisture very well. Would have given 5 stars but only using it for a month</li>
            <li> Good quality quick delivery 3 Thumbs Up 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Package came on time, well packaged, and in great condition. Brush works well so far no compliance. It loses few hairs each time when I use it, but it is expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shave brush. It spreads evenly and cleans up nicely. I would buy it again. I love it!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice full lather, well built and well designed, it should last a long time. No more cans of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> it is ok. It does not keep it&#x27;s shape long and some of the bristles fall out. I went synth and love it.</li>
            <li> Soft and good lather.  Quick delivery and exactly as described. I would buy again without hesitation.  It&#x27;s nice and light as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands if shaving brushes over the years and have been disappointed in most of them.  The Escalihas held up well to daily use and is my preferred brush.  No hesitation recommending this item!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my husband as he wanted to go back to single edge shaving.  I ordered some English soap and needed a brush.  This brush had some nice reviews so decided to try it.  He says it works great and doesn&#x27;t look bad setting on the sink (also to dry) during non use. He isn&#x27;t sure why he ever left this way of shaving.</li>
            <li> Some hair came off throughout first use, but has been great since.  Dries very well and keeps the original softness.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you pay for</li>
            <li> Good brush does the job very well.  A great starter brush.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, good clean and soft when applying the shaving soap. The last brush I had, the bristles never stayed on but this seems well done.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  Happy with it. It is soft and does not hurt the skin. I would recommend this  product.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap brush. It has broken in swiftly, and works well for face lathering. On the down side, it sheds like an Old English Sheepdog. I do wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality....smooth application...allows use of natural/organic soaps to improve shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Price+performance&#x3D;value.....  Can&#x27;t believe what some charge for these brushes.  It lathers well, cleans up well, bada boom bada bing!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with this brush. I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Black coloring/dye immediately came out of brush when I wet it for the first time.  Took several tries to get this dye out of the brush, which leads me to believe it is not real badger.  The brush actually stinks also, like a wet dirty animal, which leads me to believe with the dye and the stink, that this is a boar&#x27;s tail brush, not badger.  I have a really nice badger brush for home.  It never smelled like this one does.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck and by using this brush I have less irritation ofter shaving.  I wish I would have tried this years ago.</li>
            <li> This brush is great at what it&#x27;s intended to do: serve as a low cost brush for those introducing themselves to wet shaving. The brush is a bit prickly, at first, though it softens up a bit after extended use. Just keep in mind that it WILL NOT compete with a higher end brush in terms of comfort. Some hairs fall out every shave but, after a month so far, the brush is holding up well. It&#x27;s served well as my learner brush before I upgrade to something a bit nicer, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells bad when you first get it and sheds a lot of bristles, but great results for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Could&#x27;t ask for a better brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good, inexpensive brush.  One minus -- the bristles are a bit short, which makes them tend to feel a bit stiffer than they actually are, and causes the brush to splay a bit.  Still, a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money.  It works up and holds lather well.  The only disappointment is that during my first 10 or so uses, the brush shed some hairs into and onto my shaving soap canister.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and extremely fast shipping with Prime</li>
            <li> Nice brush, a bit stiff, but it may soften with use. I like it even new, and not broken in</li>
            <li> Been so long since I had a new brush it is difficult to rate but I do like it.  My old one was pretty shot.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I never thought something so simple could make shaving that much more enjoyable. I used to just dry shave which was awful. I know love shaving due to the feel of this as well as the aroma of the shaving cream that I use. The best thing is there is a wood handle, so not rust ring on the sink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to clean and awesome to use!</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and have an Escali brush and Bond Street Sandalwood soap. Problem...cant get a good lather. What am I doing wrong?&lt;br /&gt;What do I need to change?  Brush? Soap? You just can&#x27;t beat  Escali for price...Help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe 12 times so far and no sign of wear or pieces falling out. It looks very nice with my chrome stand and certainly feels nice to the face. I probably have not been kind to it in terms of drying properly, but even still it&#x27;s been good so far. I don&#x27;t like the brand name being right there, so always turn that side away when on the stand.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well, and awesome value compared to others I priced out.  I really like how well it works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Works better than described. Better than products 5-6 times more expensive. I am buying several more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush!! Never used one until now, and it spreads the shaving soap smooth and even! dont worry about the bristles falling out, it happens, but not often. great buy!!</li>
            <li> This brush looks good and performs well. It will lose hairs the first few times you use it, which is annoying but probably not all that uncommon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good bang for your buck. Note that a few hairs will come out the first couple of times, but that&#x27;s temporary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush over a year now, and I use it 3 or 4 times a week.  It&#x27;s my second shaving brush, my first being a boar brush.  It performs well enough, I imagine.  But every single time I have used the brush, a dozen or more hairs come off.  Every time.  I will have to buy a new brush soon, as this one has withered away.  My belief is that this shouldn&#x27;t happen.  Be realistic when considering this brush.  It&#x27;s OK.  But it falls apart. After a year with it, I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s worth paying more to get a brush that stays together.</li>
            <li> Good brush, super soft bristles.  Apparently I have super hard water, so getting a really good lather is difficult and is easier with a boar bristle brush for some reason.  This is a good quality brush for a very reasonable price.  Maybe when I move to a different water district it will work better for me, but just concerning the brush I fully endorse.  Handle could be a bit longer, but I think all of the handles on these could be longer.  Otherwise it is a great buy!</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and retain water as expected. I noticed I lost a few badger hairs from the brush after first use. The number of hairs lost after subsequent usage has declined. I am satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Works well but I have nothing to compare it to. It left a few bristles on my face and I would expect that over time it will lose some bristles but it kind of worried me when it lost some the first time I used it. Bristles are just right firmness for what I would expect.</li>
            <li> Well made. Lathers pretty good. Looks classic. Would highly recommend it to anyone tired of high priced razors and want to go back to the days of the double edge razor. I&#x27;ve cut shaving prices down considerably, and get a much shave. This brush is part of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, works very well. There is a little shedding from the brush, but that is expected. It gives a good lathering and feels good on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, I keep it clean and dry and it works pretty well. Can&#x27;t complain much, but I have to say I would probably prefer Tank Riot.</li>
            <li> My father wanted to try traditional shaving, so having watched barbers on film for years, we went for the Escali shaving brush (with some special shaving soap).  I found the brush easy to use, and it was comfortable on my father&#x27;s face.  It could easily have been uncomfortable, prickly, or poorly made - bristles coming out or such - but the Escali shaving brush is fine.  We&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and works well.</li>
            <li> its not a 40.00 shaving brush, but it does the job. Its soft and the handle feels good in my hand. The brush itself feels a little bit bigger than previous ones Ive had but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about six years, so I&#x27;m accustomed to using and caring for a badger hair brush. This brush is of decent quality. As other reviewers have stated, it is a bit prickly at first, but within five or six shaves it softened up. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the brush does tend to lose hairs during every other shave, even following a normal routine of rinsing the brush and allowing it to dry while hanging from a stand, being sure to keep water from getting on the knot, etc. That said, I don&#x27;t regret buying this brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush at a nice price. I use it regularly. Stiff enough to gather soap, soft enough on my face.&lt;br /&gt;recommended.</li>
            <li> Great brush, thank you for making it and too, in USA :o)  The workmanship, the service, and the lather it makes is Perfect.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good brush. I&#x27;m new to shaving &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;, but this works well to lather up.</li>
            <li> Works good on applying the soap to your face.  The wooden handle seems a bit light, but over all very nice.</li>
            <li> Brush looks nice, arrived fast and was priced low.  I used this one time and it shed bristles everywhere, on my face, the soap and in the sink.  Brushes shed sometimes but this was out of control.  I will probably never use it again because it is very annoying to pick all the badger hair out of the soap and off my face.  YMMV but I&#x27;d recommend spending your money on a better quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great brush for the price. It&#x27;s soft, good handle and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in the minority but the brush is shedding pretty bad. I has done it on every use at least 4-5 hairs each time.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Very quick shipment and was well packaged.  The product could be improved by adding more bristle.  It is adequate but just a tiny bit skimpy in that regard.  It will take time to determine whether the bristles are well glued to the handle and if there is any significant loss of bristles over time then replacement time will be shorter.  But, on the whole... good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was right. The problem with this brush is every time i use it 15 or so bristles fall out. I would not recommended unless you want bristles in your soap and on your face.</li>
            <li> Brush works good. Makes lather and applies it to the face as any brush would. But this is where the brush stops. It sheds bristles everywhere on every use no matter the technique used, amount of soap-to-water, soak time, etc. It also never completely dries between uses (daily shaver), and worst of all, I question the claim that it&#x27;s 100% badger hair because early in using this brush it shed ink everywhere (second use and later) with just a gentle squeeze. Could it be fake bristles colored to look like badger fur? Either way, will use until bristles are gone and then spend more money on something higher quality.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. Handle is a tad small for my stand but just large enough to hang on it. Bristles are nice and soft after only a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the money.  Have used it about 10 times so far.  No hairs have come out and it is very comfortable on my face. Great brush and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent. Lathers extremely well, bristles were solid. The break-in period shouldn&#x27;t last more than 5 shaves. After that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> i would recommand .its very soft .and price wise not bad .i been using same bursh long time.and quality very good.Thanks</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using a shaving brush, so I have no past experience with them.  I am pleased with the quality of the product and it seemed to be reasonably priced compared to some others I looked at. So far it is holding up well and I have no reason to believe that it won&#x27;t hold up well over time.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush. I&#x27;ve seen some badger brushes selling for big money, but no reason to buy those when this one is such good quality. It&#x27;s nice and soft, great quality, and feels wonderful on my face. I&#x27;d never used a brush until now, and now I use this brush to whip up my own hot lather. Amazing. Feels like I&#x27;m treating myself every time I shave. Buy this product, and give yourself a reason to look forward to shaving.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  I would put this brush up against art of shaving any day for the money. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but from my personal experience, this is a high quality product. It is built well, from high quality materials,  and is very aesthetically pleasing to have on your counter in a brush and razor holder. It lathers quite nicely, and provides a nice even application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl that uses a safety razor! It lathers nice and I use it every time I shave! I like it cause it was affordable and hasn&#x27;t done me wrong!</li>
            <li> This is my first pure badger shaving brush, and I think it is a quality piece at a fair price.  A definite step up from foam in a can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s badger hair, and it&#x27;s a brush.  Seems to work well.  It did shed a lot of hairs in the beginning and did have a slight wet fur smell for the first few uses.  I washed it a few times using shampoo and really worked the bristles when I first got it to help with these two commonly reported issues.  The smell was gone after about two weeks of use.  A few hairs still drop from time to time.  It seems to work well to get a good lather.  I feel for the price it is a decent brush to start with when one looks at how much a high-end brush would cost.</li>
            <li> Great little addition to complete a set.  I bought it as a add-on to go with a stand and I am really happy I did.  It feels very well built and i don&#x27;t see it coming apart anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Its a good brush. It takes a week or two worth of use before all the loose hairs fall out. Now when I use it there&#x27;s no more left over loose badger hairs.</li>
            <li> for the money, this brush is great.  When I got it in the mail, it had a weird smell to it.  I began washing it out.  Then I realized that the hair was dyed.  The dye washed out in about five washed.  Along with the dye, some of the hair came out.  I have been using it for a month or so now, and it has gotten alot better.  There is no more dye washing out, and if you hang it up after shaking it out, the hair does not come out.  Its a good cheap brush.  It is much better than my boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> It is too light, It looses brishels. It doesn&#x27;t create rich thick lather. Maybe using wrong soap. I don&#x27;t think so!</li>
            <li> Well if you&#x27;re looking for a brush that will end up hairless in a matter of months, this is your best bet! Hairs are not secured well and the lather I get while using this is rather poor. Spend the money on a quality brush</li>
            <li> After having a beard for many years, I decided to go back to a younger, cleaner look and started shaving again.  By &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34;, I mean The Art of Shaving.  No high tech 5 blade flexible rocket drone razors, shaving gel inna can for me.  The Art of Shaving.  English shaving soap, the Escali Shaving Brush and a long handled single edge razor.  This brush is a class act. no propellants released.  I feel better about myself just using it.  You will also.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on price. How can you go wrong for less than $13? I&#x27;ve been using it every day for the past month and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. It is soft, makes a great lather, sheds very few bristles and doesn&#x27;t have any odor. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> We bought these as gifts for our groomsmen. They love the idea of getting them something nice and useful. Everyone&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money - wish it had a stand.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the soft application.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this brush several months (husband and wife sharing). It does the job, but the bristles splayed completely and immediately, so you&#x27;re swiping with a very broad expanse and it&#x27;s hard to control exactly where you&#x27;re applying suds. It also makes us doubt it will last well, as the bristles are bent right at the base, i.e., ready to break off. Most brushes last years, but we&#x27;re not optimistic about this one.</li>
            <li> Good shave brush. The first 2 times I used it a couple of the bristles came out but other than that it works great and hasn&#x27;t happened again. I would buy again. Good quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much being this is my first shaving brush, but I did make sure to buy one that is pure badger hair. I only dig it one star because I felt it was a little less invigorating or exfoliating than I was expecting. I wanted it to really scrub my head in a gentle way lifting the hairs in a rich lather.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a little over a month now and all I can say is that it is a very well made shaving brush and excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Compared to many other badger brushes out there, this is a great deal. It holds shaving cream well and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this style of shaving and accessories. Seems to be of excellent quality and value. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  I also bought a stand for it and care for it properly.  It was fine for the first 6 months or so.  After that it started to shed a lot.  Every time I lather up, there are at least 10-15 bristles on my face.  It&#x27;s extremely annoying.  I can&#x27;t see this lasting another 6 months.  It will be nothing but a stump by then.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> As a first time buyer, this purchase was based solely on other reviewers and boy were they right - this brush is fantastic! Would definitely purchase another if needed or as a gift for a friend. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My first badger brush, so i don&#x27;t have much experience with them.  Makes a nice lather and feels good on my face.  A good value at that price.  I&#x27;ll never go back to disposables!</li>
            <li> Some hairs started to pull out easily at first, but after a few uses it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> Works just fine but its not the softest and each time you shave a few bristles come out. . .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes. Excellent quality. Not as soft as some high end ones though. Definitely worth the price though.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine entry level shaving brush. I chose this primarily because of its price as I was just getting into wet shaving. I also wanted a true badger brush and not a synthetic or boar&#x27;s hair. There is some minimal shedding especially the first use and I occasionally still get 1 or 2 stray hairs once in awhile after about 6 weeks of use. To me it&#x27;s not an issue simply because this is not a premium brush i paid a lot of money for. Eventually I will graduate to a premium brush until then this works just fine. There is a faint odor when the brush is new that goes away after a few uses but not so strong as to be offensive. All in all if you are just getting into the wet shave this is a good brush to start off with letting you experience a badger brush for not a lot of money just in case you decide you don&#x27;t want to continue with the wet shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of badger brushes and this one is definitely a quality item. Would like stiffer bristles, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Excellent Brush, simple as that</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift. I had never used a brush before, but believe I will from now on. Lathers up a lot better than without one. Also feels nice and seems to improve your shave. I like it and may get another one. Get a stand to allow it to properly dry after use.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and does exactly what it is designed to. It has a very affordable price compared to some of the other available shaving brushes, $12 vs $50 approx. The only reason I rate it a 4 instead of 5 is because it does loose brush hairs more often when soaping up then the more expensive brushes i have, but you can buy 4 to 1 which more then makes up for it.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving, after many, many years of buying cream in a can and shaving with whatever the latest fad multiple blade shaver is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a very good badger brush, at an excellent price. Like many brushes, it does have a strong odor when you first use it (it isn&#x27;t offensive, but you can notice it). The smell is only on the brush - it doesn&#x27;t come onto your skin. This smell goes away fairly quickly - you won&#x27;t notice it by the 5th shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a good handle, and the bristles are firm in a good way. When you first use it, you&#x27;ll find it sheds hairs. Again, it stops to shed once it has been worn in, and after  your 5th-10th shave, it will hold true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who have experience with brushes, you&#x27;ll find that the wooden handle is very light. Those that like to have a bit of weight in their handle (like ceramic or brass) will find this one very light. However, if you are looking to start using shaving soap or cream - you will be hard pressed to find fault with this little beauty.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this brush.  It held its shape well and builds a nice lather on on the shave soap.  My only issue is that it left a few hairs on the soap and on my face.  Hopefully this will lessen with more use.</li>
            <li> I just got into using a double edged razor for shaving my face and head. This was a great purchase and it has helped with the whole adjusting to using one of these blades. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use the brush for a while so I delayed submitting this review in order to be more familiar with the product.  Since the brush is new, I expected quite a bit of hair loss for the first few weeks, but I was very surprised to find almost no loose strands, at least so far.  I have used shaving cakes, creams, and regular face soap and the brush has performed flawlessly.  I would definitely recommend this brush over the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it. Recommended for beginners in the wet shaving space.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. This is my first brush, and so far, I am pretty happy with it. Recommended for beginners in the wet shaving space.  Will buy this brush again if it ever wears out. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Makes a creating a good lather for shaving very easy. Highly recommend this product if you are looking for a quality brush to add to your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> From day one the brush has continued to loose bristles. I expected a few to fall out with the first or so uses. made a 3 pointer in the bathroom trash can. went out and purchased another brand, have had no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and I like it much better than my boar brush I bought to start with.</li>
            <li> This product is great, and has been a wonderful addition to my husband&#x27;s shaving process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using my brush but so far it&#x27;s been what I was expecting. It did lose some bristles initially but has since stopped.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a shaving experience that was old tyme style and this is the brush just for that. Its made very well.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t buy a better brush at this price! That&#x27;s why I did buy another one for my son!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy it again if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I replaced a lost Proraso brush with this one. The smell is really bad but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll go away with time. The real problem for me was that it lost it&#x27;s shape with only 1 shave! It&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t really use it any more. Compared to the Proraso brush, it doesn&#x27;t lather well either. It&#x27;s possible mine was defective so I&#x27;m returning it but I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy the Proraso again which had lasted 3 years and counting if not for me leaving it at a hotel.</li>
            <li> the brush is okay. its not that great. i think i probably should&#x27;ve invested in a $30 + brush instead. its okay for a beginner</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out all over the place... after using probably 10 times. I thought it was acceptable the first few times I used it as far as &#x27;breaking in&#x27;... but it is still doing it and also, it&#x27;s not very soft at all. This was my first foray into the shaving brush world and it was not a good one. Buyers remorse for sure on this item.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. I am relatively new to wet shaving and this is my second brush. The first one was from a better known name brand, but was very poor quality and the hair was coming out in clumps. This brush feels great, lathers well, and has almost no &amp;#34;shedding.&amp;#34; I really like the wood handle as well. It looks nice and is quite ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I felt hesitant about spending so little for a badger brush. Sure enough comes my entire disappointment. The brush had a musty smell to it, which in this day and age is an anomaly. Upon first use I noticed the brush shed a few bristles, which one could reasonably expect. However, I was able to easily pull the bristles out of the handle. Halfway through my first shave I simply threw the brush away and wrote off the expense.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, priced perfectly!</li>
            <li> Good product on time delivery.</li>
            <li> Once moistened gets limp and bristles come out on your head</li>
            <li> Smoothly and high quality</li>
            <li> Good Shaving brush as advertised, it was fast delivered after order was placed and seems to be good quality. feels good on face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and is made with good quality.  I was worried that it would have an odor, and the brush is made well enough where it dries fairly quick and stores easily.</li>
            <li> I started shaving just as the twin blades came out.  I really enjoy the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;style! Does a great job. Nothing like a classic shave!</li>
            <li> More than a few hairs fell out on first use, but it seems to be holding up well. It&#x27;s great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush. It&#x27;s seems very durable. Very few bristles are shedding. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would know, I used to have a badger named &#x27;Hodgepodge&#x27; that I would cuddle with. The hairs feel exactly the same as the ones on this brush. Brings back memories...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss you Hodgepodge...</li>
            <li> You can spend more or less on a shaving brush; this one is an excellent find.  It holds water nicely and quickly works up a rich lather.  If you want a close shave and are tired of spending big bucks for 4 - 6 bladed razors, start here with a quality brush.  Be sure to order a shaving brush and razor stand.  Excellent gift for the man in your life or a treat for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have read a few negative reviews and it appears some users are disappointed because they do not understand how to take care of a shaving brush.  It must be soaked in warm water for a few minutes before lathering soap or cream.  It&#x27;s the stored water in the bristles that creates lather not muscle and grinding bristles into soap or cream.  Brush must be dried bristle side down outside a cabinet.  Once dried you can store it in a closed cabinet, if you don&#x27;t allow it to dry it will smell funky.  Why not just display the brush and double edged razor in an attractive chrome stand.  Looks cool and makes me happy happy happy.  Any brush will shed some hairs initially so don&#x27;t fret.  Take time to shape the brush when dry.  Try this for a smooth shave: Take a finger print sized dab of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream and place on top of Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol.  Soak the brush in warm water for a few minutes, shake excess water and lather up cream and soap mix.  Out of this world rich lather!  Added benefit, it exfoliates your skin as you apply lather.  Whether you use up and down stokes, like a painter, or do circles, let the brush do its work without smashing the bristles.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brush for every day shaving.  Certainly, this would be hard to beat for the price.  Since the handle is wood, it is extremely easy to drill a hole and put in an &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; screw to hang up the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had very few bristles fall out.  But, I take care not to soak the handle in water and I always hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> This brush meets all my expectations except one: that badger hair brushes are expensive. I am quite satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the product and would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the comfort of an old-fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brush for about 2 months now, and really enjoy it. nice wood handle, lost only a few bristles at first, and has been stable since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this one again, for myself of for a gift.</li>
            <li> The handle is great, looks good and has a good weight in your hands.  Unfortunately the brush itself tends to lose bristles faster than other models I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a safety razor to save some money on razor cartridges and had to get a shaving brush.  This one has lost a few hairs but overall has been a great experience.  It builds up a good foam in just a few seconds and the bristles have not become dry, brittle or scratchy.  I would recommend this brush to others new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great value, and after losing a few hairs at first, it performs well. I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks, and it has maintained its shape, and softened up significantly. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, especially if it is your first one.  It is soft, and helps give an even application when using a shaving soap.  I have found that the bristles will fall out during soap application, and will get caught in the razor during shaving.  Otherwise it was an excellent purchase, and I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 8 months ago and have yet to have a shave where it didn&#x27;t loose at least 5 bristles in the process. I recently was given a vastly nicer brush with a much-softer (and non-shedding) \\&quot;best badger\\&quot; knot in it and decided to see just how many more bristles the Escali brush would loose. I spent several minutes rubbing the brush on my palm over the sink and coated the porcelain with more than 50 bristles which promptly jammed up the drain. I then cleared the sink and tried it again with almost as many lost in the next round. I don&#x27;t know if all the bristles will just fall out, but I got bored before finding an end-point to the shedding. The brush isn&#x27;t looking \\&quot;thin\\&quot; yet, but the never-ending shedding is annoying as the coarse hairs deposited on your face can jam up your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bristles are pretty sharp (at least compared to my new brush) and I find using it unpleasant aside from the shedding.</li>
            <li> Fills with shaving cream and puts it on my face. The brush seems to be holding up well after being used for a while. At first there were a few individual strands that would come out of the brush, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.</li>
            <li> Great value and works well. It feels great very morning when I am lathering up. Easy to build up a lather with as well.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush. Picks up and holds lather well. Easy to use for applying lather to your face. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Item is perfect for the shaving set I am making as a gift for Christmas. The bristles are soft and it is beautifully crafted. Thank you</li>
            <li> Using this for the first time along my new Proraso Shaving Soap has been an awakening experience for me to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many years I have wasted using cans of goop with fake scents and applying them with my bare hand... now I know that my grandfather was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this is like your own man-mini-spa in the morning. I wish that my beard would grow faster so I would have to use it more than twice or three times a week. Shaving has transformed itself from a chore to something that I look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this for $9 - be aware Amazon changes prices constantly so you may be able to get it for that much too instead of the regular $13 or so.  This makes a great travel brush.  It&#x27;s a little scritchy but that tells me the bristles are getting under my beard &amp; lifting the whiskers to provide for a great shave.  I&#x27;ve found it face lathers and bowl lathers very well with Arko, Proraso green (tube), Proraso white (tub), or Proraso red (tub).  I can&#x27;t speak for how long it will last but I expect at least several years if taken care of.  This brush is a great product.</li>
            <li> Decent, but not as comfortable to use as the much cheaper boar brush it replaced. After a month of use, still feels very harsh and prickly against the skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles started coming out with the first use. My badger seems to have a receding hairlime. I find more of the badger hair on the floor of my shower than my own!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush compared to a Van Der Hagen boar brush. Makes a very nice, thick lather, quick! I&#x27;ve read in the reviews that this brush would not fit in a Colonel Conk stand. Mine fits perfectly and allows the brush to dry properly with the bristles pointing down. There is a very nice gloss finish on the handle.  I&#x27;ve had about 10 shaves with this brush and still experience 1 to 2 hairs falling off the knot each time I lather with it. Price considered, I still think it&#x27;s a solid 5 star and absolutely worth the price if you&#x27;re thinking about moving up from a boar brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good except for losing bristles frequently. It is a good value which for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> . . . before it had completely shed the entire finish on the handle.  This means the wood of the handle is now completely exposed to the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are okay, but the handle is so bad it more than negates any good here.</li>
            <li> My first badger brush so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. After reading some other reviews I purchased Escali since the price wasn&#x27;t going to burn my wallet. I did notice after the first few weeks, a few strands of the brush was coming off. About a month later, no hairs were falling off. It&#x27;s been about 3 months since I started using this brush and the hair is still full and helps create a good lather. I strongly believe this brush will last me at least a decade. Make sure you keep it dry and hanging brush facing down on a stand.</li>
            <li> Not only does the brush work well, but I like that the plastic case it comes in works well for protecting it while traveling. I have traveled with it a bit in the last few months, and have not borken the package yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I have lost a few bristles in the first months of using it. Waiting for that to stop happening. Not enough to notice form the brush, they are just evident in shaving bowl and on counter.</li>
            <li> This brush has been working well for me, however the first time I used it it lost a lot of hairs and every time I have used it since it has lost 3-8 hairs each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash it and clean it out before your first use since it is animal hair and will smell a bit funky at fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good with this brush, just took off a star for the hair loss</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, and I do enjoy using it. A lot of hairs fell out initially, and now it is only 1 or 2 per shave, but I assume the really high end brushes don&#x27;t have any loose hairs. If you want to spend little but still make your shaving more enjoyable, I think this is effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. He says it does the job great and it stimulates the skin.</li>
            <li> Got my hubby this brush along with other items for Christmas and he now shaves more often. At first use, a couple of bristles came off but I&#x27;ve had that happen with good makeup brushes. It arrived nicely packaged and quickly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> delivery was timely.  can&#x27;t really review the brush because we haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far so good.  I looked into how to store these types of brushes and followed the directions--that would be my only recommendation.</li>
            <li> Very few of the Badger hairs fall out, and the comfort is great. I cannot imagine a better price/quality balance.&lt;br /&gt;And the seller shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Happy with this brush. Not a bad product for the money. I would recommend for people on a budget and still want a decent shave.</li>
            <li> There are better quality brushes out there, but you pay for them...it definitely does the job.  I do not regret buying it one bit but know that there are nicer ones out there...</li>
            <li> I love my new shaving brush! I can tell I&#x27;m going to have it for a long time!!! Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Meets my needs, great brush for the price.  Have used it now for 2 weeks and only 1 bristle has come out.  Well made</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush. It did have a little odor at first but after about a week it had disappeared. Very reasonably priced with a nice wooden handle which fits well with brush holders.</li>
            <li> This product was less expensive than many I choose from the list of options for badger brushes. Unfortunately, there was a foul odor especially when wet and after 7 shaves, the bristles are very limp and doesn&#x27;t provide the intended experience a badger brush should.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this brush. It&#x27;s thick and appears to be durable, though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. No issues with shipping or service. Arrived as scheduled!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a lot of badger hair brushes on the market for upwards of $50-100 but there isn&#x27;t really a need to look further than this brush - it&#x27;s the best value out there. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding or smell as some other reviewers have noted here but make sure to sanitize the brush before your first use and then maintain it properly during it&#x27;s life (rinse, blow dry if possible, hang upside down to continue drying).</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.  The recipient said it didn&#x27;t grab on to shaving soap well the first time but after 1 or 2 uses, it&#x27;s great.  Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> Some negatives: it&#x27;s still occasionally losing hair (expected this to stop, it&#x27;s been about a month now) I&#x27;d like to have more soap transferred from the brush to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: it lathers in a cup nicely, is readily cleaned (by rinsing and flicking), dries quickly and gets *enough* soap on my face to (albeit barely) do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s probably something better out there, but this has yet to disappoint me enough to go searching for it.</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush I have ever used. I have had a lot of trouble recently with brushes that would fall apart within a month. This one seems to be holding up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a great job providing a nice thick application of lather. Easy to clean up and store.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these nearly a year ago. My first shaving brush. I splashed some water on my face, got the bristles wet, swirled it around my dish of shaving soap, lathered it up on my chin, cheeks, and neck, aaaaaand suddenly knew what wet badger smelled like. (A lot like wet dog, it turns out.) I also ended up covering my face with badger fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so it turns out badger fur brushes are supposed to be soaked in soapy water and rinsed out before using. I can&#x27;t fault the manufacturers for my ignorance. (I just related my experience to serve as a forewarning for others.) But I CAN fault them for the brush continuing to shed hair for weeks to come. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. It shed fur. Every. Time. I. Shaved. For weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to give up on this brand. It&#x27;s the most affordable one I&#x27;ve seen, and for all I knew this was just how badger fur brushes were. Most of the reviews on this site were positive. Perhaps the one I bought was a fluke? I ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked the new brush in soapy water for a few hours, then rinsed in thoroughly in running water. The first couple shaves the brush still smelled a little musty, and it shed a little. But since then it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, with no smell and nary a loose hair to annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush #2 has been very good, and I&#x27;m going to assume Brush #1 was a fluke. I&#x27;d recommend this product, with the caveat being that a little preparation and patience is necessary.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush comes in at a very reasonable price and has performed well for me. Shaving has gone from being an irksome necessity to something I look forward to. Other than some minor early shedding (which has mostly stopped), it has been very solid. The brush is an excellent value and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably one of the most economical brushes out there and it shows why. Being conscious about hygiene i thought i should first give the brush a wash before using it. I was right to do so! Turns out that as I&#x27;m soaking the brush in warm water, it starts to change the water&#x27;s color to a dark brown. I highly doubt the manufacturers sterilized it. Luckily I have some chlorhexidine solution lying around so I was able to clean it  properly. I suggest anyone who buys one of these brushes do the same. It builds up a decent lather and isn&#x27;t harsh on the face. Its loosing some of the hairs but since its a new brush, it is expected to happen. Lets hope the shedding does not continue much further.</li>
            <li> Great Value.  Works well</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Bought it because it was a bargain price, guess I got what I paid for.  Probably lost 10% of its bristles with less than 30 days use</li>
            <li> Lacking a frame of reference I can only say it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I did buy a shaving kit before with a bowl, soap and brush. The brush was synthetic bristle and was pretty rough on my face. I am so glad I found this one! Works great with the Colonel Conk 775 stand I also bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really an excellent value.  It seems as though there are dozens at the same price-point that have awful reviews.  On the same note, there are tons of shaving brushes many times this price point that seem to get reviews which are no better.  So, the value here is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush for about a year.  It shedded a bit in the first few uses, but that tapered off after using it a bit.  Not really a significant issue, this is to be expected from most brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are great, just about the right &#x27;softness.&#x27;  It has lasted for a year, and I see no signs of needing a new one anytime soon, so all the better on reliability.  The price is right.  I see no reason to pay many times more for a shaving brush, this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice brush, good lather, makes your hair stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it gets wet, it does smell like a farm animal. I guess that proves it&#x27;s authentic. Just hold your breath when it&#x27;s around your upper lip.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush has soft, but stiff bristles, that make it easy to generate a nice lather while softening the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost a couple bristles during first use, as expected, but have not lost any since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a couple of weeks now and I really enjoy it. The bristles are both stiff and soft in just the right way. The brush creates a much better lather than my previous brush. It also does a good job of lifting whiskers while applying the lather to my face. It&#x27;s a great brush and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush to add to your shaving kit. I had a Badger brush I bought from AofS and I replaced it with this one. I love it. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is built well, but the boars hair brushes offered in other brushes are just as cheap and softer. There is a problem with shedding for a while, it did reduce over time. The hair is really sharp and didn&#x27;t seem to get any better. The lather was only alright. Really not much strength in the brush. I recommend the Omega 10048 or 10049 brush (whichever color you prefer).</li>
            <li> Great little brush. Sheds a bit on first few uses, but then is fine. The most interesting, and unexpected aspect of the badger brush is the smell of the wet badger with shaving cream on it.  Its a very pleasant earthy smell that evokes emotions from the past, maybe that was a smell from the barber shop as a kid.  Anyway, the brush makes for a pleasant shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this brush. It&#x27;s cheap and I find the quality is solid for its price. I am African American/Italian and I always suffered from ingrown hair and inflammation on my face (when I cut close to my skin). I recently came across a video on youtube and use this person&#x27;s tips along with exfoliating my skin twice a day with this badger brush, it has done a lot for my skin.    The things that cleared up my facial skin (surprisingly): Selsun Blue Medicated, face scrubber, and Escali badger brush. I apply the Selsun Blue Medicated in the shower with the face scrubber and I apply the badger brush to my beard in the morning and at night. I&#x27;d say my face is about 90% clear or more, it hasn&#x27;t been this good since I didn&#x27;t grow facial hair (more than ten years ago).    But the brush even before I was using the other tips was working well for my skin. It really helps to clean up your skin, as well as lift and soften your hair. I feel this is particularly valuable for those with curly hair that will tend to curl back into the skin (but obviously it could work for anyone). This is a solid brush and I recommend it, if it did what it did for me, no telling what it can do for you!</li>
            <li> solid brush. this is the first shaving brush i have used and i am happy with it. smells like the animal hair when you apply it to your face, but that&#x27;s likely because it&#x27;s made out of animal hair! all in all i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a month...  handle is simple and clean...  bursh hair is firm and is holding together well.  very nice brush.  I would recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> Brief notes from first couple uses -&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable on the face, soft bristles, holds lather well&lt;br /&gt;Whips up a nice lather&lt;br /&gt;Bristles around the edges already coming out, time will tell how well it stays up&lt;br /&gt;Holds shape well when handled correctly, will become misshapen if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great all around if you take care of it :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it - great price!</li>
            <li> Very happy with quality !&lt;br /&gt;Item was as advertised !&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amazon seller !&lt;br /&gt;Timely shipping !</li>
            <li> Great item. I have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> So far it appears to be an excellent product.  No shedding.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great entry level brush. I noticed a huge difference compared to my old boars head brush. I do note a few of the hairs do come loose from time to time but given the price point its not a huge deal for me. Definitely invest in a good stand for both razor and brush and don&#x27;t skimp on the shaving cream/soap!</li>
            <li> Ouch!  I think it&#x27;s made of porcupine fur!  The bristles fall out often.  You can get a Semogue boar brush for the same price that works better!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Escali shaving brush.  The item was accurately described and arrived very quickly after ordering.  It has been some time since I have used a brush and lather from soap in a mug, nearly 30 years.  After using them again, I wonder why I ever left, and in these times it sure is more economical.</li>
            <li> My husband has owned another badger hair brush before and was buying a replacement, but this brush is not at all what he was expecting. On the second use the bristles shed, the soap won&#x27;t lather and it dripped gray water presumably because it didn&#x27;t dry out properly. This brush is much smaller than what he&#x27;s accustomed to as well. Throwing this in the trash and buying another Parker badger brush.</li>
            <li> Loose a few hair every time I use it, other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Was going to go with the next level of badger instead of this. Glad I stayed the course. This is worth buying. I would recommend to anyone. It did have a little smell when I first set it in the water to warm it. It has since, slowly disappeared.</li>
            <li> I started using shaving brushes with this brush, and it was a okay quality and inexpensive way to get into using a shaving brush.  The brush started out rather stinky, but I let it soak in some dish soap for a few hours, and then let it soak in regular hair conditioner and at then end of this process the stink was nearly completely gone, and the brush was much softer than it was when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you really NEED to clean it before your first use or you will do as I did and smear badger smell all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having this for about 9 months all of the bristles came out of the wooden part. They are all glued in as a clump, and I was able to super glue them back in and reglued it every month or so for the past few months, but I am finally moving on and getting a newer and higher quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just getting into brush shaving and you don&#x27;t know if it is right for your, then this is a great brush for you.  If you want a quality brush that is going to last a long time, then check out some of the better brushes.</li>
            <li> Shaving now feels like a nice face message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate it, now I look forward to it. Moving from a Gillette Mach 3, and Gillette shaving cream in a can to a nice Merkur safety razor, using &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream&amp;#34;, and the Pure Badger shaving brush is like taking a short trip to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this years ago! Brush feels great. Some bristles do fall off the first time using, but no big deal. After about 4 shaves I didn&#x27;t notice any more coming off. Brush feels soft and great with a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised - lathers great and is smooth on the face. Great value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really amazing by any standards, it does make lather but sheds like crazy. Every time I shave I end up having to dig through the lather on my face to remove hairs. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for a different brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light shaving brush which I find holds water and shaving creme really well. Bristles are soft and spreads the shaving creme in a wide even pattern. It also fits well in the hand. Nice product and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> works up a decent lather but sheds like crazy. i&#x27;m in the market for another brush.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and does a great job applying the shaving cream. I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for about 3 weeks and so far it performs just as good as a 50$ one I had before it. Smart Buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now. Works as advertised and seems to be holding together well. Has a bit of an animal smell which is to be expected. Not overwhelming and fades with use. A few of the hairs have come out but again, not unexpected and still feels full. Definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Smells with s***!!! I soaked it in water and even cleaned it few times. STILL smells like ass!!!  Do not buy this !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shave brush at a great price. Holds lather very well and makes wet shaving a breeze. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush and I suspect it will outlast me. Very well constructed smooth lather application and the warm lather makes shaving much easier. Follow the instructions on drying the brush and I suspect it will be a one time purchase this brush was built to last...</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores, a shaving brush is a must to spread shaving cream in a proper way. Glad to have found this item. It works great.</li>
            <li> seems to loose bristles on the first use</li>
            <li> It does the job and wasn&#x27;t super expensive. But the brush is already falling apart. The hairs constantly are falling and mixing into the shaving cream</li>
            <li> This was my first brush and still frequently used in my rotation. It&#x27;s a solid performer. It seems to have a little more backbone than my silvertipe badger, so I use it mostly with my cella soap.&lt;br /&gt;Works a up a good lather, quickly and cleans out nicely. It did shed a fair amount of bristles in the first couple of weeks, but it&#x27;s since settled down.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for the money. I would strongly recommend the escali to anyone thinking about getting into DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I am rapidly approaching middle age,&amp;#34;I am 72&amp;#34; I have always since age, about 18 used a garden variety Drug Store, or Grocery Store, shaving brush; well let me tell all who might be interested, this brush is; at least for me, far, far, ahead of those garden variety brushes. It loads and holds lather very well, it feels good on my face. Just for the sake of clarity here, I shave twice almost every morning. I use a variety of straight razors and sometimes a safety razor. The brush holds enough lather that after I have hot ragged my face I can dip the brush in the hot water, shake it out and will still have enough warm lather for my first save, probably for both shaves, good lather, hot water, sharp razors, and a good brush have made shaving a pleasure instead of a chore. This brush is great for me. I especially like the fact that it will load so much lather. First time I used it I saw that it was going to lose some hair, so, for the first two times that I used it I combed it out with the coarse end of my comb, it rarely loses a hair now. I cant tell from it&#x27;s performance that it&#x27;s ever lost any.&lt;br /&gt;  Sign Me, Happy and Satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;  Allen G.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor a month ago so this is my first experience using a brush. it did lose some hair for the first few days but now I&#x27;m not noticing any more strays in the bowl or sink. Since I don&#x27;t really have anything to compair it to, I can only tell you this brush has worked as well as I expected it to. It holds water and lather for the 15 monutes it takes me to shave and it&#x27;s become softer and easier to use over the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. the only gripe I have at all is the wood is kind of cheap and it doesn&#x27;t have the premium feel to match the razor (I paired it with a Edwin Jagger DE89) but what can you expect for such an affordable price? if this isn&#x27;t your first brush, I would look elsewhere as this is probably not going to be an upgrade for you, but if you want to test the safety shaving waters, this is a quailty product with a very low entry fee.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a good idea to start with a cheap, entry-level badger brush for shaving. It was a huge mistake. Do your research! This brush irritates and barely lasts. It&#x27;s not god-awful, but once you put in the cash for a good product that LASTS and that feels good, you&#x27;ll know the difference. And you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever used this thing.</li>
            <li> I received this lovely brush just a few short days after I ordered it. Since my first shave with it I have been creating great this lathers and my face has never been happier.</li>
            <li> After nearly a month of use this brush has lost a substantial amount of bristles. At least 10 to 15+ per shave.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; at first but is softening with use. Makes a good lather. It is possible I got a bum item.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully customer service will take some action.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> helps bring water to the shave used to shave in the shower after health challenges not a good idea this brush helps wet the shave</li>
            <li> Well, perhaps it costs its price, but I would invest a bit more to get something else. This one is not good quality at all, it loses hair, it&#x27;s too soft. It&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I got this as a starter brush and then asked for an expensive full silver hair badger brush for Christmas. Yeah, this one works better. It retains heat and holds soap very well, it also doesn&#x27;t shed like a lab like the waste of money expensive one I got for Christmas. By the way, if you&#x27;re someone who likes expensive products like me, go with Kent. If you like a bargain like me, go with this brush.</li>
            <li> This worked well for about two months until the hairs started falling out so profusely that I had to throw it away because it was clogging my razor.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so far but as soon as I used it, it shed a bunch of bristles, it eventually stopped shedding bristles after about to weeks but from what I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s not supposed to do that. It&#x27;s worth the price but eventually you&#x27;ll want to get a better brush.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is... but this brush just isn&#x27;t doing it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem would probably be the constant shedding this brush does - every time I shave, I have to pick a dozen hairs out of the soap or off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush stinks.  It stunk when I got it, I&#x27;ve washed it multiple times trying to get rid of the stench to no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps forming up a knot in the dead center of the brush.  No idea what causes that, but I&#x27;ve had to go in and work it out twice now.</li>
            <li> good brush, has lost some hairs but lathers well and is easy to hold.  good quality</li>
            <li> This is the third brush I have bought, all at reasonable costs, and yet this is better than the other two. The bristles are on the firm side, which is what I like. Unlike other brushes, this one has not yet shed any bristles. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shaving brush! The bristles are tremendously soft and hold a lather incredibly well. I had no idea why people were freaking out about badger brushes until I actually got to use one. Now I&#x27;m never going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point was really nice, and delivery was swift. If you&#x27;re just starting to move away from canned shaving gels and towards using shaving bars, getting the right equipment is key. THIS is definitely a great way to go.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Great Price.  Buy two!</li>
            <li> No odor like tweezerman, decent size, works well. Seems to last well too. Have used it awhile and no complaints. Tight, wears well and does a good job. Price was quite reasonable too. I used it to exceed 35 dollars merchandise limit for free shipping, It is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Paganelli</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brush</li>
            <li> Better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the world like a great shave with some Proraso Shave Cream and a Pure Badger bristle brush! When I shave, I feel like I am back in Florence, Italy at the local barbieria.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft. The badger hairs make for an elegant way to butter up one&#x27;s face before shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great budget brush for people looking to upgrade their shaving experience. As some of the other reviewers have stated, it is slightly prickly for the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not very annoying. It becomes much softer after probably 3-5 shaves and you quickly forget that it was ever prickly. I never noticed any smell that others noted. It holds water very well, builds lather easily, and behaves much like a brush 2-3 times the cost. I highly recommend it for newbies to wet shaving. At such a low price, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to extend it&#x27;s life as long as possible, I&#x27;d recommend learning how to maintain it during and between shaves via wet shaving forums or youtube channels.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Very well produced and has increased my cream production and defiantly glides well with the 100% badger. Im enjoying this brush and it is defiantly on par with some of my other brushes in my collection that are twice this price!! Good company to do business with and shipping was fast as always. Thank You Perellas, I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.</li>
            <li> I had an insane amount of hairs fall out in the first 2 uses. I lose at least a couple hairs every time after that. Overall its ok, not the softest brush out there.</li>
            <li> I have used this Badger Brush since I received it. It&#x27;s outstanding. Quick delivery, great price. If you want a great shave, this brush is&lt;br /&gt;the one to get. AAAAAAA++++++</li>
            <li> Wonderful item.  Just as described</li>
            <li> Works well. No wonder it&#x27;s the top selling badger brush on Amazon. Quickly works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I am not completely sure if I should be writing a review? I gave it four stars because the bristles occasionally come off. Other than that the brush is great and really creams up my cream!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Big difference over the last brush I had.  Some shedding on day one but that is to be expected.  Nothing since then.</li>
            <li> My dad loved the brush...and I loved the price!</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and feel of the 100% pure badger shaving brush. Shaving cream lathers well.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. :-D Very Happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first to try out wet shaving.  As a new wet shaver my review will be based on my limited experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush and how it feels, soft and great with my shaving cream and spreading the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only piece of critical feedback would be the bristles.  I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s normal, they seem to come out easily. More and more bristles come out of the brush after each shave. Some end up in my lather or stuck on my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good starter brush, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> Brush is smaller that I expected. But it definitely is a good brush for the money. I will use it until I can spring for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using my shaving brush.  Every time I apply cream using this brush, it makes feel more manly.  My order delivered quickly and ahead of schedule. Some reviews point out how the brush feels the first couple of uses, but I actually like the &amp;#34;tickle.&amp;#34;  Also, I use the shaving brush to apply the cream to my scalp and I find the brush holds a fair amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Like to save with this brush. Leathers very good.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It feels great on my face and really works a great lather with the cream.  Great for anyone starting out shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> What can you say? It is a basic boar brush. For a starter brush it does the job. It does lose its bristles but that was to be expected. But it still loses bristles even after 6 applications. I will keep on using this till I find a better brush when I feel I have graduated to it. I am currently a novice D.E. shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush met my expectations.  It applies the shaving cream well and holds the moisture well as well as the shaving cream</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of junk don&#x27;t buy it unless you like many bristles coming out each time you use it.  Nothing could be more annoying.</li>
            <li> i really like this brush,enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I rate this brush a two. It&#x27;s well built and I find nothing wrong with it other than being to soft for me. I bought a boar bristle brush and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first thinking it would be to rough for my face, but it&#x27;s extremely soft and whips up a great lather.  Just make sure to buy a holder and dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> The brush gathers the soap, lathers the soap, and applies the soap to my face. It feels comfortable on my skin. After the first application of soap, it smells of the soap. It shed probably less than a total of six hairs during the first and second shaves, but after that, no more dropped hairs. I hang it to dry on the rack, and it dries perfectly, ready for the next shave. I believe it when the experts say that badger hair brushes are the best, because this brush does what it is supposed to, and does it well. I am totally happy with this brush, and I consider the price point an outstanding value. I would buy it again. I have nothing negative to say about this shaving brush. I hope this helps in your decision making.</li>
            <li> An excellent brush that lifts up your wiskers before shaving.My only regret is that I did not order the stand.</li>
            <li> Lovely brush for shaving. High quality. Will purchase item again when needed. Had one already and this if for a son who will be traveling and living abroad.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Purchased as a Xmas gift for my brother. He loves it and I will most likely purchase one in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product; none of the badger hair comes out of the brush.  Make sure to dry it completely before putting it away.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to give old time shaving a go and this is the brush I went with.&lt;br /&gt;I went with relatively inexpensive items across the board since I was just getting started.&lt;br /&gt;This brush seems to hold lather well and is very comfortable on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I had a few bristles fall out the first couple of uses but since then it seems to have stopped shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush and consider it a great value.</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out every time.</li>
            <li> so far so good. i have only lost one hair strand out of it. It does hold more water than the bore bristles. good product.</li>
            <li> Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush is an incredible value. I recently started shaving with a safety razor, and comparing the price of this brush to the average brush made it a very simple choice. Paired with a quality shaving soap or cream it creates a wonderful lather, however, you can tell the quality is not equal to the 30+ dollar brushes as the bristles are a bit rough. It does the job well, and if you don&#x27;t see the reason to spend double the price on a brush, this one will do the job quite well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat what I got for what I paid. Some minor shedding at first, but that was to be expected. I&#x27;m using less soap than with my old brush and getting a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> First Badger brush for shaving with a safety razor. It works very well, holds water and makes a great lather. I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item two weeks ago and have used it twice the first time there was a lot of hair coming off of the brush I thought maybe it was just new but after the second time the same thing happened you can run your hand across the brush and have a hand full of hair.  I have ordered from Amazon countless times but I can say this is the first time I have ever been disappointed from anything I have received</li>
            <li> Our son bought my husband a shaving brush a few years back. My husband liked it so much he asked me to get him another as his old one was showing wear. He really likes his new shaving brush and tells others too.</li>
            <li> This brush is great especially for the price I might want to get a nicer one if I had been straight edge shaving longer but it feels great on the skin and it is badger just had a little trouble with brissils coming out</li>
            <li> The price is great and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve used the Art of Shaving brush and while it feels better, the price does not match the need.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I feel that the Escali 100% Pure badger Shaving Brush is a great bargain and a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It holds a good among of water to build a good lather in a mug however it did loose about 15 hairs total after three shaves but after that only once in a while does it loose another</li>
            <li> I use to apply the lather and it usually leaves one or two little hairs on my face that I have to pick off and re-apply. It&#x27;s not the best of brushes, obviously, but for the price it&#x27;s not bad and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but will probably spring for a higher quality brush the next time around. Good for a first brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of years--and have given them as gifts.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with the quality--and it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a badger hair brush for under $15.  However, in my experience, the bristles on the Escali are much stiffer than the Tweezerman.  And in my opinion, they don&#x27;t become softer.  But if you want a brush that exfoliates (or if you like to rotate your brushes), this can be a good thing.  If you want softer, I&#x27;d go with the Tweezerman.  I have both and like them equally.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden handle and natural bristles. Did lose a lot of the bristles at first but seems ok no that I&#x27;ve used it for awhile. Like the finish a lot.</li>
            <li> My first brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. Makes it easy to lather up, soft bristles so you don&#x27;t feel like you are brushing your face with a wire brush. Noticed a couple of bristles come off, but not a big deal. Fewer than a high dollar paint brush.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I had an issue with the hairs coming off. Since this is my first shave brush I can&#x27;t be too hard on it. It does build lather very nicely and is very comfortable. My next brush will probably be a boar&#x27;s hair brush since I like a more bristly feel. For the price I paid I&#x27;d say it was money well spent as my first shave brush.</li>
            <li> This brush looks good and the build quality seems good, but I did have some personal issues with it. For the several first shaves, this brush had an unpleasant smell to it and the water that dripped off it after the first use was sooty. I also found it uncomfortably prickly. I had previously used a brush from a Van Der Hagen set that was softer, did not have a smell and had cleaner (whiter) looking bristles. After using this Escali for several shaves, these problems have mostly gone away (or perhaps I have grown used to them). In short, I do not know if my criticisms reflect the quality of the product or merely something to be expected from an animal product. If you&#x27;re okay with a breaking in period, this brush might be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Soft, no poor odor, good handle, and it even looks good.  It hold water well, and it rinses super easy.  I did lose a few bristles on the first use though.  Some reviews seem to indicate a LOT of bristle loss, others almost none.  I can infer that either A) Some reviewers are being too aggressive with it, or B) This product varies in quality and is not consistent.  I&#x27;ll leave that to the reader to decide which they think it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great brush for the money!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Creates a rich lather, cleans up nicely.  Makes me look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little prickly at first but they soften up. Great brush overall</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is made with quality and has very soft badger hair! The wood handle also adds a very classic look.</li>
            <li> Shaved it once and lost half the hairs… literally. Will never buy again. The brush is much smaller than expected. I&#x27;d recommend spending the extra $20 and buying a $30 parker brush.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my beard.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving brush ever. I love it. It feels so good against my skin. Make sure to rinse it properly and do dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> I dumped the multiblade shavers to return to wet safety razor shaving. I only have my fathers shaving brush to compare it to, but i seems fuller. It is a joy to lather up with. I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> less than average quality - tends to lose hair in each use&lt;br /&gt;not so smooth&lt;br /&gt;would definitely consider choose a better quality the next time !</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it! He has to be clean shaven for his job and he loves this brush so much that he even uses it and shaves on his off days!</li>
            <li> excellent for a price</li>
            <li> Works well. Supplier is awesome</li>
            <li> Good quality product, exactly as expected.  Arrived quickly and at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than my boar brush - the bristles are soft and help create a lot of lather.  I occasionally get loose hairs in my lather, though - otherwise it is a five star product.</li>
            <li> I read about this in an article published by The Art of Manliness and was sold.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the softest. It lathers ok, but doesn&#x27;t create enough for two or three passes......  (like it&#x27;s much more expensive counterparts.)  The brush is cheap.  It does not shed particularly and is very much worth the price you pay.  Let&#x27;s face it.  My Simpson Chubby Best Badger or even the Semogue Boar brush I own would be an unfair comparison to this Escali Badger.  If you soak it in a heavy, heavy shampoo bath for a few hours and thoroughly rinse it out when you get it, the fairly pungent badger hair smell disappears and it actually has an attractive bloom as the hairs dry out.  The brush is truly a great value, but should not be expected to perform like a Kent. Omega or Vulfix. It gives a decent shaving experience with very little cash outlay.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft, sheds very little initially, but lathers well. Will purchase again for a gift.</li>
            <li> smooth and good quality, yet the fibers drops down every use.</li>
            <li> Decent brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: I&#x27;m new so I can&#x27;t comment on how well this brush is for creating lather. I&#x27;m still learning and haven&#x27;t had great luck producing a wonderful lather with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irritation: I don&#x27;t find this brush to irritate my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding: sheds 1-4 bristles each shave. These end up on my face and in the sink. It&#x27;s a little annoying cleaning these up every time I shave. This is the basis for my 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine, but I&#x27;m tired of picking badger hair off my face when trying to shave. I&#x27;ve used this brush for about a month now, and the bristles are still coming with just about each use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush the few times I used. But, the head broke off after a few uses. I am quite disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Very soft and makes a much better lather than my previous brush.  Smells a little funny for the first few uses, but maybe that&#x27;s the smell of freshly plucked badger hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  New to the whole shaving game that doesn&#x27;t consist of cream from a can and a store bought name brand razor.  But as a tool to start a new tradition in shaving I feel it works fine and will last a great amount of time.</li>
            <li> It works just as advertised.  I have had about 6-10 hairs fall out of the brush since I started using it.  It&#x27;s been around 4 weeks since I got it.  I never noticed a smell when using it.</li>
            <li> the bristles come out frequently interfering with shaving (with a double edged razor anyway). the aren&#x27;t very good at transferring lather either for some reason. The biggest complaint I have is that the wet bristles really literally stink, what ever they are, the odor is highly unpleasant</li>
            <li> Received this brush as a gift for my son who wants to be an \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaver using a single edge sharp razor and mix his own soap and lather it on.. He loves it and it is super soft on his sensitive skin and he is very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush at a great price.  It seems to shed a little more than some of the other brushes I&#x27;ve encountered but it&#x27;s really a non-issue.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price.  Granted I am new to using a safety razor and a brush for shaving foam, this brush performs well.</li>
            <li> this brush is a high quality product! if you take care of it then it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. As some of the other reviews mentioned, there was a bit of a gamey smell but it only lasted a week.  That should not deter you from buying it.  Great value, good product.  Excellent service, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush about a month ago, because I wasn&#x27;t getting a even application of shaving cream with just my hands. Needless to say, this brush works pretty well. If you follow the proper care directions for owning a badger shaving brush, it will last you a long time. When mine eventually wears out somewhere down the road, I will definitely buy another just like! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This has been my first experience with safety razor shaving and this is my first shaving brush.  From what I had read, badger brushes are the way to go and this brush had an amazing price.  Reading other reviews helped solidify my decision and I haven&#x27;t regretted this purchase once.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is my first shaving brush and I had no idea what to expect. Also keep in mind that I have had it only a short time and can not speak to its durability or lack thereof. Now that the caveats are out of the way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this purchase. The brush feels great on my face and it lathers well with my shave soap. It&#x27;s hard to explain but it somehow makes the shaving experience much more pleasurable for me. My shaves seem closer, but I know that the shave is mostly the result of my razor and shave soap. The wood handle is comfortable in my hand and the feel of the badger bristles is soft and pleasant on the skin. After reading several reviews of various brushes I was under the impression that cleaning the brush might be more difficult than it is. Running it under water and squeezing the brush hairs easily clears the remaining soap from the brush. I squeeze the excessive water out and then hang it upside down on a brush stand that I bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes I can&#x27;t comment on more expensive brushes, but it is hard for me to understand how much better a $50 brush could be than this inexpensive model. Hopefully, I will get that opportunity at some point and if I do I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If half stars were permitted I would have given this product 4 1/2 stars based on how much I like it and the price point. The one minor negative that cost the half point is the perfectly round handle can roll. I noticed that several other brushes have a flat side to prevent this. I can&#x27;t imagine the price would have been significantly different if they had shaped it not to roll.</li>
            <li> My dad  has had the same shave brush for as long as I can remember..20+ years... When the bristles started to fall off, he was sure he&#x27;d never find another just as good...I ordered this brush and he LOVED it even more than his old one!! :)</li>
            <li> It is a very good shaving brush. I am glad that I opt for it after considering many others that are in the market. It holds sufficient water to work up a rich lather.</li>
            <li> This brush is far superior to any that I have used before.  Most of my brushes in the past simply fell apart after a short time.  This one is going strong!!  I&#x27;ve also noticed that there are less bristles that fall out initially and the handle fits perfectly into a shave caddy.</li>
            <li> One great brush, so well liked i will 2 more one for each son, shaving re-invented again</li>
            <li> For the price you can not get a better brush then this! Excellent !</li>
            <li> Not too much to write. Handle is large and very solid, the brush itself is soft and lathers really well. At this price and quality i cant imagine ever buying from anyone else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving (years of using multi-blade systems with canned shaving mush don&#x27;t count), and this is my first badger shaving brush; it replaced a synthetic bristle brush I was using for a few weeks. I use a dry lather method, slowly building up the lather on my palm. This brush is so much better than a synthetic bristle type, and the bristles are soft, while the brush holds a large amount of lather. The resulting lather also feels creamier, maybe due to the fact that it can introduce air and water to the cream more effectively. Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this badger hair shaving brush and have been completely satisfied. The brush does not shrink down too much and spreads the shaving cream on my legs very well. It is made well and I actual prefer it over another brand my husband uses for his face. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on your skin. Just a negligible number of bristles lost during the first uses.</li>
            <li> Great little Shaving brush. The brissels are full and do not fall out in a shaving mug as some others do.</li>
            <li> Meh. Yes, badger hair is what you want in a shaving brush, but the quality of the badger hair is what&#x27;s important. My boyfriend still uses this because we don&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a brush, but the hairs quickly became flattened and somewhat matted after a small amount of use... he shaves like once a week.</li>
            <li> Loses some hairs with every use. But overall good value.</li>
            <li> Works well and makes a good lather. Just enough bristle to massage face but not too much that it pokes.</li>
            <li> outstanding for the money!</li>
            <li> This works just fine.  It is a good price on the basic badger.  If a few hairs fall out at the beginning and then occasionally afterwards, don&#x27;t worry about it as it is not uncommon.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month or so ago and it is really nice for the money.  It first it shed some hairs, probably for the first three or four shaves but not any longer.  I just bought a parker Silvertip brush and I have to say, I kind of like the Escali one better..</li>
            <li> I used this once and had a lot of hair left in my bowl, on my face, in my razor and in the sink. It had to have dropped 20 bristles.</li>
            <li> Yeah, they killed a badger to make this thing.  I love it.  I love stuff made from real animals.  It makes me feel tough, even though I had nothing to do with anything other than putting down $$ American to get it.  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a while now so I feel comfortable writing a brief review. It lathers up all my shaving creame jars quickly no matter what brand I use. Very few loose hairs compared to the other more expensive brand I own. It does not hold the smell of the creames I use which allows me to use it with differnt scents the next day without having to switch brushes(I do rinse the brush after each use). I ordered from perellas and it arrived promptly and as described. I wouldnt hesitate going to perellas in the future.</li>
            <li> Just started using it so will follow up with another review. Nice handle, good brush. Feels good on my face and produces a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a hand made shaving cup with soap &amp; brush holder from one of the craft people at the Homestead Heritage festival in Waco Texas for my son.  The set didn&#x27;t have a brush with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this brush because the reviews were positive.  I made a good choice.  The gift is enjoyed every morning</li>
            <li> I use this with Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol and it works great. This first couple shaves I kept finding the brushes hairs on my face, but i think that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t wet it enough.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Shaved 4 or 5 times with it. holds a good lather, just the right consistency... everything you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> You do indeed get what you pay for, I did not expect much at all from this brush.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought it to take on a cross country trip and did not want to risk &amp;#34;loosing&amp;#34; my good brush to the TSA&lt;br /&gt;  I found the brush is very acceptable, holds plenty of water, makes plenty of lather.&lt;br /&gt;  Have used it with both Proraso shaving creme and Williams Mug Soap and the results were&lt;br /&gt;very good.&lt;br /&gt;  If you are looking for a throw away or starter brush on the cheap this is the one.!!</li>
            <li> britles stay in ,speads out real good . nice quality. if it wears out i will by another.better than more expensive ones</li>
            <li> I love the Escali Badger Brush!  The bristles are perfectly firm to PROPERLY lather up for a shave and invigorate my face while remaining soft enough to lather multiple times during a single shave.  Plus, shaving with this item has a romantic/nostalgic feeling where life slows down and you can be a man.  The only thing missing from this experience is a cigar and a scotch!</li>
            <li> The shaving brush showed up in a short amount of time and it&#x27;s been really great.  The product is of considerable quality and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it to date.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush as part a gift set with a new Double Edge Razor by Merkur. This Brush is a pure Badger Shaving Brush at a great price with excellent quality. I could not have been more pleased!</li>
            <li> I had never really used a shaving brush correctly until I saw a video on how to correctly prepare the brush for shaving. Here&#x27;s the method I learned: soak the brush in warm (not hot) water for a minute or two, then shake gently to unload some of the water. Try not to scrub the brush in a circular motion to generate lather. Once finished, rinse the brush gently to remove the lather (does not require harsh motion) and shake to get the remaining water out. Gently run the brush over a soft towel OR hang in a stand to air dry.Let the brush bloom to aid in drying (the brush does not require that the hair be compacted or shaped). Shedding will occur at first AND if you don&#x27;t prepare the brush in water! Else this brush is well made and very effective.</li>
            <li> Honey badgers don&#x27;t care about your face and if you cut yourself shaving, but this badger brush does, and helps lather up a nice shaving cream for your face, not too prickly and kind of soft.... the only downside is that you have to squeeze some of the water out before you lather up or your shaving cream will be all types of watery</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first brush when I started DE shaving. For the value, it is fantastic. Lost a few hairs on the first few uses but now it works great. As with many things, you get what you pay for. However, I would rate this brush as top tier for the price point. It is now my travel brush and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with this product. The brush handle looks really cool. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about a brush though.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our son for Christmas.  He told us that the first time he used it the bristles fell out and were stuck all over his face.  Needless to say he threw it away.  Just poor quality I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newb to the scene of wet shaving so of course I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a huge amount of money for a brush. I felt that i would try the Escali brush out because so many people recommend it. When I used the brush it lather really and did the job.</li>
            <li> I just received the brush in the mail, after a shower I tried it out, very nice!! I was using an older (5-6yo) boar brush, the badger is a definite improvement! next will be an upgrade to a better badger brush!</li>
            <li> The bristles / hairs are softer than I would prefer. The craftmanship and quality seem to be up to par.</li>
            <li> This brush is my first so I have no room to go into comparisons. I enjoy the feel of the wooden handle over metal though and the badger hair works great to apply my shaving cream. A few hair have fallen out but I imagine it is expected with a new brush. I enjoy using the brush a lot and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to shave with an old &amp;#34; vintage&amp;#34; shaving brush, bowl and razor method.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, but for the price, I am impressed. I have only has 3 bristles fall out after about 10 times of use. Forms and hold s a later with shave soap very easily, and feels awesome when applied to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, I&#x27;m sure there are other good ones out there, but this is the one I chose, and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Fans out when i whip up lather. It seems to be getting slightly better over time so i guess its a good starter.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush is excellent.  I bought this about a month ago and have been using it everyday when I shave.  It&#x27;s holding up very well and am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perrella&#x27;s had it in stock and I bought it with Prime and got it in two days after order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both Escali and Perrella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This brush is far from perfect (I&#x27;m still losing hairs after more than a month of use), but overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. As long as you properly break it in and maintain it, it keeps its shape, it&#x27;s quite soft &amp; it works a lot better than the cheapo brushes you&#x27;ll get at the pharmacy or in most shaving kits.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a high dollar shave set, I almost did until I realized that&#x27;s just stupid. Buy this nice inexpensive brush which works just the same and hold on to the rest of your money. Yes it will lose a few bristles with every use but it works just the same as a high dollar chrome or rose gold plated Merkur or Muhle. Don&#x27;t try to keep up with the Joneses, they&#x27;re huge D-Bags with nice crap and no money.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews mention, a few hairs come out the first couple of times you use it, but then it stops &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s never an issue, or annoying, really. Otherwise, it works fine, feels good, actually. Lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and seems to be holding up pretty well. I use it every day and have had no problems with it falling apart like other people have said. I would purchase this item again when needed.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the brush so much that he got a second one as a gift for a friend. The bristles do not fall out no matter how hard he can use it at times and we love that the product is all natural and the handle is wooden and not plastic. Plus it makes the daily monotony of shaving much for more fun as it can be a very old-timey experience.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. I&#x27;ve been paying tons of money for Mach 3 razor heads for years. Made the switch to old fashioned safety razors and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I put together a starting kit of wet shaving stuff for my husband for Christmas, including this shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does have a smell the first couple of uses. It&#x27;s made of animal hair. The smell WILL fade. Give the bristles a good soak and wash in warm water before using it the first time. Yes, it did lose a number of bristles, but that stopped after several uses. This brush does lather up very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Escali brush and razor stand, which this and the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor fit perfectly in.</li>
            <li> This brush is not worth buying. Every time I use it to apply shaving cream it leaves loose badger hairs all over my face. Save your money and buy a higher quality brush that has secured the hairs within the handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush that i have brought.Dont have anything to compare it with,but its doing a good enough job for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush 10+ times and it is still shedding bristles.  It is annoying, but I still find this brush to be effective for the uses that it is intended for.  I would not recommend this brush to a friend.</li>
            <li> This brush does not exceed expectations, but for the price it&#x27;s being offered at, does more than it&#x27;s job. Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Got into the old way of shaving from my Brother. He has 1000&#x27;s of dollars into it which I think is crazy but to each his own....I bought this due to all the positive reviews. I can&#x27;t give you any long term test but as of now I really like this brush..</li>
            <li> This brush is fine.  For those saying the bristles fall out, that happens with any brush in this cost range the first few times you use it.  It is rather small and is by no means a high end brush but if you want a badger brush, this one is fine.</li>
            <li> My morning shave is my time, no one else&#x27;s.  My chance to start the day, my chance to look good, my chance to take a breath and look out after myself - you don&#x27;t get many chances when you are taking care of your family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need 5 things to do it right, and this is my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: I like it.</li>
            <li> So I just started using a safety razor.  I bought Williams Mug soap and needed a brush.  I did not want to pay too much yet, as I figured it out, so I settled on the Escali Badger.  On the initial use, I noticed many of the hairs came out.  I figured this was due to it being a cheaper brush, so quality would be cheap.  It did soak up soap and lather well, but I figured it would lose all the hairs within 2-3 uses.  Happily, 10 shaves into its use, no more hairs came out.  I am thoroughly pleased with this brush.  It soaks up and distributes lather well and dries quickly.  I worried that a wet dog smell would linger, but I notice no smell.  The vendor was very good as well.</li>
            <li> why buy a $ 50 brush where you can buy this awesome one for a lot less. I hav been using it for 3 weeks now; and it&#x27;s a very good brush for a very good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush every other day for the past 3 months and it works good. In the beginning some of the hairs fell out but not enough that you would even notice. Been holding up well otherwise</li>
            <li> The company shipped it faster than expected! The brush has completely changed my shaving experience and makes it a lot easier, smoother and gentler to do so. No more tugging away, this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, works great, good water retention, and it looks nice. Delivery went off without issue as well. A+</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely perfect for a beginner. It Helped spread the lather on my face perfectly. Would Recommend this brush to others</li>
            <li> First time I used it the brush shed hair. It was also scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Second and third and foruth times it also shed hair and felt small and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks pathetic next to my new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scratchiness fades with time and experience wet-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new brush lost 1 or 2 hairs the first two shaves, but since has not lost any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not gone back to this brush. Do yourself a favor and spend $30 on a nice brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  It actually feels like a squirrel is caressing my neck with lather. Soft and effective, I am really happy with it. It does shed a few hairs with every shave, but I guess this is normal.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift! I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to update this later for a long-term review but initially I am very happy with the quality and how this brush works. I bought it to replace a high cost brush that lasted less than a year before it started to fall apart. From other reviews I have high hopes for this brush and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The brush does a fantastic job of evenly distributing shaving cream onto my face. The bristles take a little time to soften, but they will.  The item arrived as described and on time.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> Great brush- it does the job and dries fast.  Very happy with this purchase.  Would purchase again- thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but so far, so good! Bout 5 uses in, and its starting to break in nicely and become very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t shed much..</li>
            <li> Did have a good amount of sheading early on, maybe first three weeks, then no more. Would recommend soaking it a few times in hot water, and remove the looser bristles.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Great lather, holding up well.  I see no issues at all with this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Badger Shaving Brush for three weeks now. So far its worked great. I have a had a couple of hairs come out of the bundle but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s uncommon. I would recommend a hanger for the brush to dry and a good dish for whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Unlike some badger brushes this one wasn&#x27;t too awful musky on the first few uses.  Works up a great lather.  Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I get at least 2 or 3 hairs that detach and stick to the lather on my face each shave.</li>
            <li> Constantly having hairs fall out of the brush when I&#x27;m trying to work up a lather, which is terribly annoying :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, outside of the brush slowly going bald, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Maybe I should dry it with the bristles down, but I don&#x27;t have a razor caddy *shrugs*</li>
            <li> Product as described ..!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a brush for shaving, so, I have no reference for comparison. I can say that this brush does a good job of getting my skin and whiskers ready for a shave. I use Proraso shave cream and this brush applies it well, holds the moisture well and suits my shaving needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got a Van Der Hagen set recently and the brush fell apart in two weeks. I did some research about proper brush care, bought this guy, and I&#x27;ve been a happy customer since! It really builds lather well when paired with a scuttle.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and is a high quality brush. Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> The brush did not provide a very good lather and I then noticed that the problem was that the bristles in the middle of the brush were all matted together like tangled hair.  I went back to my Tweezerman shaving brush that is still going strong two years after its purchase.  I am disappointed because I bought this based on all the excellent reviews. Perhaps this is just an anomaly.</li>
            <li> Bough along with the Weishi 9306C razor and the Proraso Sandalwood shaving soap. Very happy with the entire set. All very AOK.</li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush, it produces plenty of soap. A few hairs come loose but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price. You&#x27;d pay a lot more for one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Bought over 6 months ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it is so soft and works very well at spreading shaving soap on my face.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great brush, so much easier than using hands to put on shaving cream. Only complaint is that some of the bristle&#x27;s seem to fall out (which I would expect) but it&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush.  It is soft and rinses well and dry fast.</li>
            <li> Good Brush for the price</li>
            <li> I really should have known - you get what you paid for.  I am new to DE shaving so i didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money starting out.  I kept hearing about &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; hair brushes, so I got the cheapest one I could find.  Odd that there could be shaving brushes that costs $100.00 (which I would never buy - I&#x27;d go back the electrics first), and now I know.  This brush smelled really bad at first (I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times), it doesn&#x27;t lather up like the videos I see on youtube, and it SHEDS hairs every time I use it.  So far, its a throw away, but, for $13.00 bucks, well, it&#x27;ll do the job until I find my next one. I just don&#x27;t know how much I should spend on the next one as the prices range quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving better -- that can never be a bad thing</li>
            <li> Great brush at a more than reasonable price. I would recommend it to a friend and would buy it again but I doubt I&#x27;ll have to for a very long time. Special thanks to Perella&#x27;s and their outstanding team. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm guys, and thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair brush and have been using it for about two weeks. I like the brush, mind you I have nothing else to compare it to. It&#x27;s a good size, has a comfortable handle, the bristles are somewhat scratchy. The fourth star is there only because of the low price. Some of the bristles are starting to fall out (I dry my brush on a stand bristles down like you&#x27;re supposed to). If it wasn&#x27;t for the low cost it would get 3 stars on account of the bristles falling out and the scratchiness. It gets the job done and is comfortable, but I think I&#x27;ll be finding a higher quality brush soon.</li>
            <li> Hairs are coming out like there is no tomorrow .</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has not fallen apart like others have on me.</li>
            <li> Been using regularly since last year. It does shed off some hairs over time, but even after almost daily use for a more than a year it  still seems to have about 70 percent brush hairs left. Very good brush inded.</li>
            <li> Tossed it. When i swirl this brush in the bowl, the hairs get knotted up big time. Brush sheds horribly and never stopped. When using it on my face, the hairs just lay over like a cheap child&#x27;s water color paint brush. Using boar hair now. Much stiffer which I like better. YMMV.</li>
            <li> The difference between this brush and the others I have tried is truly noticeable.  The bristles are from natural materials and not synthetic like the other one I had and the handle is solid wood as opposed to plastic.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a goof value for the money.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Doesn&#x27;t cost much. Good quality. Perfect buy for the money for anyone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I rotate from shaving &#x27;old school&#x27; and new school... this brush is as good as it gets... feels great...and cleans off well.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience. Great packing, fast shipping and very good product. This is a quality brush at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> This brush gets good reviews.  There were some complaining of loose hairs.  Yes this does happen for about two weeks and then stops.  Maybe once a week I get a loose hair from the brush.  I use this with Cremo Cream, and it is working well.  I did not get the stand, I leave it in my stainless mixing dish which works fine.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Nice and soft.  But it smells terrible, like a wet dog...I&#x27;d recommend it to someone wanting a fairly priced badger brush</li>
            <li> Great little brush at a very cheap price. It&#x27;s not going to last for a decade or anything, but it was definitely worth a look while I was just trying to get into shaving with lather. I hang it up right below my bathroom mirror and it&#x27;s lasted quite well for the time I&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dog loves this damn thing, though, and it&#x27;s weird because the only time I can get her to volunteer to come across the threshold of the bathroom door is when I&#x27;m shaving as she thinks the brush is a toy for her (I let her sniff it once- big mistake, as she immediately sat pretty to beg for it). The other day I took my brush out, she became entranced and walked right up to me, standing on her back legs and placing both paws on the sink (she&#x27;s a black lab, so it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s tiny). A simple, &amp;#34;Go&amp;#34; command for my wife was all it took to grab the dog and toss her into the bathtub as I quickly placed the brush back and began running the water to clean the pup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you think I&#x27;m joking, but this brush has all sorts of great applications as now I don&#x27;t have to carry 60 pounds of trembling weight to the bathroom when it&#x27;s time to get clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving brush to use when I travel and am satisfied with my purchase.  It is made of reasonably good quality at a very attractive price.  Recommended as a travel brush,  not a primary daily use home brush.  Rating is 4 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> great price great quality.  very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for months now it&#x27;s really good. Although it loses bristles after use, it&#x27;s a handy product and tool for shaving. It holds water, heat, and shaving foam and soap well. Handle is sturdy, the bristles are thick. This product just works and for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I went back to old fashion double sided blades and love it.  The brush works great and adds a great deal of ease to shaving.  It may seem like effort to use this but after a while you cannot image shaving without it.  It makes shaving easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Father&#x27;s day preasant for my husband, he had been shaving with boar bristle brushes since we started dating, and I noticed his shave could be better. After reviewing this product I decided that it would be perfect to get for him to up his shaving experience. Sure enough, he said it&#x27;s the best lather he&#x27;s ever had, and so far there is not a nest of hair clogging up the sink like with the boar hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs the first couple of shaves but is now fine. I really like it. It spreads the soap nicely and even and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a 100% badger shaving brush. I have used it 3 times since I received it and it has gotten progressively softer. Will have to wait on the durability with use, but everything is terrific so far.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s designed for. Super soft. Not really intended for canned shaving cream so I&#x27;m hoping to get better use out of The old school stuff when it arrives.</li>
            <li> This was everything it what advertised to be and I received it in the appropriate time frame. Excellent quality and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This brush smells a bit funky at first, but it&#x27;s quality is undeniable. I&#x27;ve already used it several times now, and Im very happy with the rich lather it helps work up. I like to use William&#x27;s Shaving soap with it. Remember to dry it either upside down or on it&#x27;s side! Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Great brush, very soft.  I have used it for over a week and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Good brush, fairly soft, but it sheds a lot.  Worth the price though.</li>
            <li> Good for the money. Looses 5-6 hairs with each use.</li>
            <li> After its first use, a bunch of what looked like dye can out while rinsing. As I&#x27;ve used it, that hasn&#x27;t happened again.  The ?musk? smell has gone away too.  As my first brush, not sure what I should expect, but it does seem to work well now that I&#x27;m learning to use it.</li>
            <li> It was great for 3 weeks and then since last week or so it&#x27;s been loosing the hair like crazy. I have read about how to use it but still. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if there is something out there that won&#x27;t add hairs on your face!</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my brother, who has a high regard for quality. He was quite pleased with the gift. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it. Bought a starter kit with the brush and bowl, the brush didn&#x27;t last that long so I got this one to replace it. Once it came in, made a world of difference, even made my shaves closer... if that is possible.</li>
            <li> Great price and after I use it my face feels refreshed and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it. It is well made and has helped to reduce razor burn on his neck tremendously. The price was great and we will definitely buy again from this shop.</li>
            <li> When my 30 years old shaving brush was down to its last few bristles, I decided to replace it with the Escali.  I have used it for a week with the same shaving soap which I usually use but can&#x27;t seem to get any lather.  To boot, this thing stinks of animal.  The badger continues to be be its namesake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue to use it hoping that I would be able to break it in.</li>
            <li> Its great except for the hairs that keep getting all over the place because they detach during use, but besides that, its a quality shaving brush and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I wanted it to be, no more and no less. It&#x27;s an everyday brush till I have the money to spend on a better one. I was satisfied with my order and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of weeks and this brush seems to be really good so far. It smelt a bit funny the first 3-4 times I used it but the smell has dissipated since. The brush is soft and works up a good lather. And it doesn&#x27;t shed hair like crazy as other brushes that I have used. So far worth the price!</li>
            <li> Bought this badger brush as a gift for one of my sons.  It is his first shaving brush and he loves it!  It was priced right and the vendor shipped it promptly.</li>
            <li> Great product holds up well, better than art of shaving products</li>
            <li> Outstanding brush for the money!  Every brush sheds a few bristles and they all had a slight odor for a few days.  The negative reviews here make me giggle.  Seems to be a few boys out there with tender hands:). You need to feel important?  Go blow a pile on a silvertip.  You want an outstanding brush for the cost of a 12-pack?  You can&#x27;t go wrong .</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife and I were looking for. High quality and easy to use. Thank you for the fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several very different shaving brushes, this one is great for the price. Just take good care of the brush &amp; it will work fine!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush ALOT of the fur came loose which got annoying fast! Although after a month of using the brush the stray bristles have stopped falling out, and the brush is 10x softer than the boar brush I purchased at a local retailer. For the price your not going to find anything nicer!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving brush.  It cleans up easily.  I would definitely recommend it.  It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The brush really feels great and works a really great lather.  The service was excellent and very professional and I had no problems contacting them if I had any questions.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, service, and all-around experience. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. My shave is as good as JFK&#x27;s or a 50s movie star&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good for your first brush. Nothing fancy, and there are certainly better ones out there. For the price though, this is a great purchase. Just hang to dry and take care of it.</li>
            <li> I had not previously used a shaving brush.  My wife bought me some fancy shaving cream which was incredibly difficult to have lather via hand application.  Finally, it dawned on me that it should be applied by a shaving brush (I am a little slow on the uptake at times, but am now an unstoppable shaving machine).  This little brush could not be of higher quality materials and construction.  Aside from shuddering about the badger that may have been harmed in the making of this handy item, I am thrilled with its performance and can wholeheartedly recommend its use.  In combo with a high quality shaving cream, this applicator will ensure your best shave ever.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and that is the highest compliment I can think of.  Excellent quality and bristles dry soft not stiff.</li>
            <li> I have an older shaving brush that require replacement , So what better replacement that a 100% pure badger hair brush. Sure to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just got it. Nice Feel to it. Going ald skool but feeling good about.</li>
            <li> Great product works vwey well.</li>
            <li> For a $12 shaving brush you can expect a $12 shaving accessory (that wont last forever). If it lasts 6-9 months, it&#x27;s a good investment. The brush does what is expected; help prep the beard for shaving. Care is needed to maintain the brush. Dampen, use, rinse, shake dry, hang upside down, repeat tomorrow. I use Jack Black Beard Lube, dolloped on face and worked in with this brush. The brush is quite functional and I&#x27;d recommend to others who are not too heavy handed in their technique as one could easily beat the life out of the brush within a couple weeks. Shave closely, my friends.</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out every use, wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and decided on this brand due to the high ratings. The brush is awesome. I soak it up in hot water prior to each use and it helps lift the whiskers to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the boar bristles have fallen off but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping of the product was fast and easy. I received it two days later...with prime membership.</li>
            <li> This brush feels nice. It lost a lot of hair initially, but I think that is normal. Mine immediately developed a void of hair directly in the middle so I have to hold the brush by the hair instead if the handle to have proper coverage. Not sure if this is an individual defect or design issue. It is priced for a beginner and a nice starter brush; however, I wonder if it saves more in the long run to upgrade at the start.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with bristles falling out, or excess firmness that other reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the cream on my skin, working in under my stubble even when I have gone a few days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to dry the brush properly! it would be best for the brush to be hung, bristles down. That isn&#x27;t convenient in my home so I simply rinse thoroughly, shake out as much water as I can (~2 minutes of working, shaking while the cream softens facial hair) and then rest the brush on its side in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just wish I could find a razor that I was as happy with...</li>
            <li> Great brush.  My first shaving brush, didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, this one works well.  I have no problem making a good lather with a proraso cream, and its holding up fine.  It is true that it smells a bit funky at first (its fresh animal hair) but I found that just soaking it in hot water while I take a shower, and then the act of using the proraso made that go away in two or three shaves.  Its not too prickly, not too soft, and it holds its bristles well.  I&#x27;d say I tend to lose one bristle with each shave, I just look for it in the bowl as my good luck charm.  I feel no need to buy a more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this shaving brush.  I had not used one in many years.  I was impressed with the construction and durability.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this for the first few weeks he used it. I even bought the stand for it. But, the bristles began falling out. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I decide to shop for another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when he first took up safety razor shaving. It&#x27;s a decent brush for a reasonable price but I will probably spend a little more money on his next brush. He complains that the bristles feel rough on his face, and even after several months of use the bristles shed a bit. Overall I feel that it was a good starter brush and if you are looking for something for a reasonable price this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to change my shaving routine, so after much procrastination i finally made the switch. This brush purchase was the start of my pampering. I was insure of what to expect for quality but after using this brush with proraso shave cream I am just thrilled. The brush makes all the difference when applying shave cream and this brush applies cream with perfection. I am very happy with my purchase from its quality to its cost, both of which made my decision to switch easy. I will recommend this brush to some of my friends who also want to leave hand application of shaving cream behind them.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave 50 years ago with a safety razor but no brush.  I switched over the years to electric and then to all the different multiple blade razors and recently decided to give double edge blades a try.  I&#x27;ve tried several different blades but think the key is prepping the face. I read many reviews on forum sites about brushes and was a bit leery about spending so little on this brush.  However, I am very happy with this brush; it has lost one or two bristles but no big deal. Maybe expensive brushes are &#x27;better,&#x27; but this one is fine and I would recommend it even to people who know me.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, really works up a good lather.  Firm and tight bristles, with a soft and comfortable feel.  Quick ship, no difficulties with product or seller.</li>
            <li> Was a decent brush...not too harsh (and not as soft as hoped) but I was happy with it until it came apart 6 months after buying it (used every other day).  I&#x27;m thinking it was partly due to a handful of bristles falling out everytime I used it, causing the tension holding all the bristles into the base to decrease.  Eventually, the entire &amp;#34;bundle of bristles&amp;#34; came loose from the base and had to throw it away.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this exact brush again, but will try another cheapo for now...</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price. Bristles soften up after a few uses. I would recommend this brush to anyone just starting out with shave soaps or for a quality travel brush.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Have a few comments: villi crumble and they are not a lot of prickly.&lt;br /&gt;But I think over time it will be corrected.</li>
            <li> When the brush was used, the center of the brush would wold mat up.  This seemed to worsen with repeated use.  Had to use a comb/hard brush to straighten out the mat.  Finall tossed the brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband to use with my homemade shaving cream and he is very pleased with the brush .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Very good quality and priced just about where it should be.  Have been using this brush about 2 times per week and I have no complaints so far. I highly recommend getting one of these if you want to try the old school style shave.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because it was cheap. Price, not quality - or at least that&#x27;s what I hoped. Turns out it was a little of both. I lose more bristles each time I use it than I&#x27;d care to admit. I&#x27;m sure before long i won&#x27;t have many bristles left. Buy something a little more expensive to avoid losing quite so many bristles</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad through Amazon when he couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores and he loves it. It is a very nice brush for the price and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had an inexpensive shaving brush bought here at Amazon that worked well, but the middle bristles fell out after about six months. I decided to try this item and was very disappointed. The bristles are stiff, but not unbearably so. The bristles fall out, but not as much as my previous brush. The main problem is that that bristles get all stuck together and matted. After one use, the entire middle portion was a tangle. My prior brush was a pleasure to use, this one is just scratchy and matted.</li>
            <li> First time user to this style of applying shave cream. The brush works very well and makes a good lather very easily. The brush was not super coarse and felt good against the skin. Was not sure which kind to get and I am glad I chose this one. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up pretty well so far. It is nice and soft and produces a rich lather when I mix up my Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream. My only complaint is that I am constantly losing hairs from the brush. I take good care of it and I am not especially rough on it but I am constantly finding badger hairs in my soap, foam, and on my face. That is the only reason I subtract one start. Its a good beginner brush and great value for the price if you don&#x27;t mind a little loose badger hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the highest quality shaving brushes I have used.  Happy with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> This brush compliments my merkur heavy duty razor and fits perfectly on the escali stand. Holds plenty of water and soap.</li>
            <li> This is a very well-made shaving brush at a great price. I would highly recommend it and enjoy using it daily.</li>
            <li> Was using a cheap boar brush from CVS and was having lots of trouble lathering Col Conk almond soap.  Just got my highly rated escali badger brush and used it today.  Never made a better lather or had the best wet shave after 3 weeks of converting to traditional shaving.  Brush is affordable, lathers great, and felt great. Mother downside is the strong animal smell when the brush was wet.  Other reviews say this smell goes away after a few shaves.  Lost some hairs, but not nearly as bad as my CVS boar brush.  Looking forward to my next shave in two days.</li>
            <li> The brush works well enough in creating and holding the lather. Where there&#x27;s trouble is the badger hair consistently falls out. Every time I shave I find about 10 badger hairs in the sink. So now I&#x27;m making a wig for my pet badger with all the excess hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the brush. it has soft bristles and easy to use. I ordered it over the weekend, it can expediatly fast as i was hoping. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for travel.  Its slightly smaller size makes it perfect for that.  It gives me the same smooth cover my more expensive &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; brush gives me.  Unless it fails in some unforeseen way, I will likely buy this same brush when it is time to replace my &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; brush!</li>
            <li> This brush was a gift for my husband. It is very nice and soft and great quality. It was delivered very fast as well. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use it to apply beard oil. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I use the combo of oils described here:[reddit dot com /r/beards/comments/nroa7/lets_talk_about_winter_beard_care_gentlemen/]. Equal dime sized amounts of Argan and Coconut, with 2-3 drops of Tea Tree)</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of basis for comparison with other more expensive brushes, but this brush gets the job done. The brush is comfortable and nice. Some bristles fell out early on, but I think I may have been using too much pressure on my soap. Not many have fallen out since I eased up on the brush when making the lather.</li>
            <li> Just like my Grandpa used to have.  My  boyfriend loves it!  Great Valentines present!  Quick Shipping and Nice packaging!  A bit of Nostalgia!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as advertised. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I will next time I shave. I didn&#x27;t like the packaging it came in as it was easy to just open and have someonr take the contents out. But the product arrived and it is of good quality. So no complaints other then the flimsy packaging.</li>
            <li> You can certainly get more expensive badger hair brushes, but for the money this brush is very effective and did a good job. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank on a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush it great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it needs to be cleaned out when first received. The first time I lathered it up and gently squeezed it out and there was a smelly brown liquid that came out with it. However, after rinsing and re-lather, this has not happened again and brush no longer has any smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks, item was exactly as described and posted in good time.</li>
            <li> Very good brush at a great value!  Defininitely works ands lathers well.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and a very good brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, and altogether I&#x27;m satisfied with it. No, it&#x27;s not a pricey silver-tip brush, but it&#x27;s great for a beginner. As others have noted, it is animal hair, so it will give off a bit of funk the first time it gets wet. It will also shed hairs the first few times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend soaking it in hot water in a cup, and swirl in some shave soap to cleanse the bristles before you use it the first time. When I did this the water turned brown from the dirt and oil on the badger hair. Repeat 2 - 3 times until the water is clear and there&#x27;s no more smell. Also, massage in some shave soap and comb out any loose bristles. Just takes 10 minutes then you&#x27;re ready to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I purchased mine from Amazon seller, Perella&#x27;s, and received it in good condition)</li>
            <li> this brush arrived as advertised, was a great price, and makes a great gift for the new shaver or travel brush.</li>
            <li> For the money its hard to beat along with the Tweezerman. It is heads and tails above the cheap boar bristle brushes i see at pharmacies and big stores. Had it for a while and it holds up well. Sheds some at first though.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Well made and it holds moisture well.  Some people complained about a smell but I didn&#x27;t smell anything funky.  Please note that all natural brushes have some smell initially because they&#x27;re natural products (they come from living creatures!) It takes a couple of uses to break in the brush so expect some of the hairs to shed initially.  Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> THis is a good brush I have been using it for a few weeks now every day, with Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation (from amazon), No real issues I have notices a few hairs come off, but this is to be expected. Overall the feel and work ability is very good. I also would recommend Marvy * Shaving Mug Rubber Green which I use with this brush. The cup is no winner for looks but it works great and being made of maid of hard rubber it does not break or dent when dropped. This brush with the Marvy and the Proraso maek a great team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot make sure you soak the brush in warm water prior to each use. I find that filling the cup with the brush while taking a shower works best for time saving.  This is basic if you use shaving soap, but if you do not then I would still recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush for the price. However, I can&#x27;t seem to get the smell of dead badger out of the bristles. When they say pure badger, they mean it!</li>
            <li> I tried this brush as a start on &#x27;old school&#x27; shaving. It has done the job making lather and seems to be holding up well. A quality product. BTW I am getting almost as many shaves from a single double edge blade as with a &#x27;5 blade&#x27; cartridge. So I plan to stay with double edge.</li>
            <li> I decided to try shaving with a safety razor for the first time in years just to see if there was much difference, and that included buying new shaving soap and a brush. This one had high marks from many reviewers so I gave it a try. So far it&#x27;s held its&#x27; shape well and does an excellent job of building up a nice layer of foam on my face. I simply rinse it off and put it back on its&#x27; hanger and it&#x27;s ready to go next time. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for a little over a month now and it is working really well, it is soft enough on the skin and spreads the soap in an even manner.  It is the best brush I have used in years, I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my husband and my boys, along with a sandalwood shaving cream as both were highly recommended.  My guys love them.</li>
            <li> The Escali is great performing brush. Seldom a product beats expectations with a sledgehammer. And this one does it in style and performs above most expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has my shaving soap usage been reduced, but this brush has sped up the time it takes to build a good lather. Most important is that this brush does not require a user to be an expert latherer, just a willing one.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Some of the hairs came out, but this could be common occurrence for badger brushes.</li>
            <li> Great! Good quality.  Closest shave I have ever been able to get.</li>
            <li> i use it with the soap and it is just what i need to make the kind of lather i need to shave.  I do need newer blades.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  I am a first time safety razor user.  The brush has performed well. I soak it in piping hot water, squeeze most of the water out, and swirl it around the shaving soap. It makes an excellent lather.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face. Works well to whip the shaving cream. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It feels really soft and this does not smell like other reviewers complained about. product arrived shorty after i got the amazon e-mail. This is a great shaving brush for beginners. I would recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> The bristles are skimpy, it is not a very full brush, so much so that even wet, the handle makes the unit top heavy and want to fall out of the shaving mug. The bristles are also cheap grade and rough on the skin. Not a very pleasant shaving experience or quality of product. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> After reading the comments left by others, I went ahead and bought the Escali shaving brush.  I don&#x27;t have any experience with other shaving brush so I can&#x27;t do a comparison.  But from my experience of using this shaving brush the past few weeks, I can honestly say that it does its job and it works.  It lathers up the shaving cream very quickly and it feels great when applying to my face.</li>
            <li> Good built quality, soft, densed bristles and attractively priced .&lt;br /&gt;Using it from 2 weeks with no complains at all.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush provides great lather and holds it shape well.  Very little shedding when new (maybe one or two strands the first two or three times I used it).  Works as well as my parker, which cost 3 times as much.  Highly recommended - especially for the price point.</li>
            <li> as described, works great</li>
            <li> Seller sent this product as promised.  My husband had really wanted this one to replace another that had lasted a long time.  This one seems stronger!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first. The brush seemed to lose bristles every time I shaved. After a few shaves though, it has stopped losing bristles. It works great and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristle knot and metal band slipped out of the handle this morning. I put it right back but this weekend I think a bit of sanding, a laminate shim and some wood glue are going to be used. I&#x27;ll report back on how that works after a few weeks use. This is my first brush with badger bristles and it is far softer and lathers better than the boar variety (VDH). I may eventually have to replace this but when I do it will be badger and the knot will not come out so easily!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I have nothing to compare it to.  However I bought this based on other reviews.  I am a bit disappointed after using this brush for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I keep losing bristles which I though would stop after a day or two, but each day there is at least one or two that come out.  Its kind of annoying to have to pull them out&lt;br /&gt;of the soap.  Other than that the handle is comfortable and the bristles are not too rough, but I would choose another brush.</li>
            <li> Item looks exactly as described. I did noticed that it continues to lose hair ( I use every other day and have owned it for several months now). I also noticed that it carries a funky smell , no matter how long I wash it off .......</li>
            <li> Bought this product after I decided to stop using shave foam and instead decide to go with Sandalwood Shaving Cream of Taylor of Old Bond Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial impression there was a bit of smell which went away eventually. Nice product and serves its purpose very well.Planning on buying 2 more to gift to my dad and my f-in-law.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost my old expensive brush while moving. This works well despite it&#x27;s very low price. I recommend this to any value conscious shopper.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Only issue is that the brush hairs fall out very easily but that may be due to my bad technique haha. I&#x27;d recommend the Escali to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of shaving brushes, so I&#x27;m certainly no expert.  I&#x27;ve read about odors with Badger brushes &amp; hairs coming out.  After only seven uses, I can&#x27;t rate its long-term durability, but I only found two hairs on the shaving soap after the second use and three more after the seventh use.  I also made sure to order the stand for the brush &amp; razor after learning how important it is to let the brush dry with the bristles down. I can say that after rinsing the brush, I couldn&#x27;t detect any unpleasant odors &amp; after the first use, no detectable odor at all.  After the brush was completely dry, I noticed it was softer than when it was new.  The brush did feel \\&quot;strange\\&quot; on my face but that&#x27;s likely because I&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> very disappointing the brush spreads outward making it very messy in applying soap- good news is that at least the bristles don&#x27;t come off the brush but I think they were put in backwards or something &#x3D;&#x3D; it is not the way other brushes have been for me in the past</li>
            <li> This is a simple but well-executed product. The bristles are thick, soft, and installed into the wooden handle very securely. The instructions are concise but very useful, mainly where maintenance of the brush is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[NOTE TO INTERESTED PARTIES: this brush MUST be stored hanging upside-down or on its side; the flat part of the handle easily supports the brush in an upright position, but if you store it that way after using it, the brush will not only start to get a funky smell but it will fall apart after a short time. This is because the moisture in the brush will pool inside the handle and get musty and damage the adhesive holding the bristles in place.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint regarding this product is that they don&#x27;t offer a stand from which to hang the brush upside-down; if they do, I didn&#x27;t see the option anywhere here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great buy for the price. Most real boar bristle shaving brushes typically cost $30-$50. This is well worth the $13.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush. I&#x27;ve been using brushes to shave for 40 years and this one doesn&#x27;t cut it. The bristles have no body to them so by the time I&#x27;m done lathering up, all of the bristles are pointed 90 degrees from the handle. I carefully straighten them back up to let them dry, but the next time it is the same thing. My old brush which I&#x27;m ready to replace does a much nicer job than this one. I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a more substantial brush.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived exactly as described and on time. This product has worked well as a beginner into this style of shaving and I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> While it was the less expensive brush it works fine.  I believe it should last a long time.  I just went back to the double edge razor and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve used.  So for me it appears to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> A great value for gourmet shaving.  The brush effectively works lather into your skin, preparing you for an outstanding gourmet shave.  It wears well, and works well.  I have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> this is a very high quality brush. the first time I used it, it shed quite a few hairs and it smelled bad for the first few uses. However, almost a year later, this brush is doing it&#x27;s job perfectly. it loses a hair every 5 or 6 shaves, but with daily use of this thing, that is very acceptable. it also does not smell bad anymore. I will definitely buy another one of these when my first one needs to be replaced</li>
            <li> This brush broke after only a few uses.  The bristles came unglued from the handle. I would not recommend this. Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> It functions as well as expected. I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare the performance to, but it works up a nice lather and spreads it on your face. every once in a while a bristle will fall out, but it seems to be normal.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It is comfortable on my face and performs exactly how I expected it to. It looks classy too.</li>
            <li> This brush has the same quality as a more expensive alternative but is extremely affordable. As to be expected with any brush, the first few uses felt a bit prickly, but the bristles softened up for me in about four shaves. During first use a few hairs came out of the brush, but since then no more has come out.</li>
            <li> The main reason I gave this 4 stars is the price. Although there are some minor flaws, it&#x27;s really well priced for what you get. The bristles hold up very well and don&#x27;t seem to be coming off any time soon. The brush also holds a lot of water as expected. The only thing I wish they would have done is made the bristles just a tiny bit longer. I use a ceramic shave bowl and the rim tends to knock against the edge of the brush every now and then. I know I&#x27;m being a little nit-picky but it does get a little annoying sometimes.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I tried shaving with shaving soap and a brush- but I was tired of all the aerosol cans of shaving cream (gel).  I got the \\&quot;Art of Shaving- Shaving Cream\\&quot; and the Escali Badger Brush.  The shaving cream is excellent- it works up into a nice thick lather- and since you use hot water- it is warm. The brush is good quality, it does a good job working up the lather, and softening up the beard. My one disappointment is that the brush is about 25% smaller than what I would have liked- it feels a bit small in the hand and the brush size is equally  a bit undersized. Thinking about it- this may result in being able to use less shaving cream to produce a good amount of lather on your face- a bigger brush will retain a lot more of the lather. However, I still would have preferred it a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The brush is a good quality, haven&#x27;t lost many hairs after the initial couple shaves.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  It&#x27;s a little coarse but it&#x27;s slowly softening up with each use (used it about 25 times so far).  I&#x27;ll use it until this wears out and then try and step up a grade in quality, but I would recommend this brush for anyone like myself just getting into safety razor shaving.  Pair it with a good quality shave cream (I&#x27;m using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood, love it).</li>
            <li> So far so good on this brush. It did smell the first time I used it like another reviewer stated but that is to be expected with real animal hair. No bristles fell out yet on this brush. I think I will be able to use this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just got back into straight razor shaving and having this brush lather up the soap is better than I remember. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  It fits perfectly in my hand, easy to use, and absorbs the soap real good.  Prefer to anybody who uses shave soaps!</li>
            <li> This brush is a great product. I had forgotten how good it feels to shave with soap &amp; brush.&lt;br /&gt;Being retired has me looking for ways to save money &amp; this is helpful.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush purchase. Being a novice when it comes to these, I think it does a fine job. At first some of the hair will dislodge and stick to your face and the soap. After a few uses it doesnt happen as much and the bristles become softer.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for the Cremo Cream I purchased.  This brush is great getting my beard ready for the razor.  I liked it so much that I purchased another for my travel kit.  Not sure I can go back to not using a brush to get the beard ready for a shave</li>
            <li> The brush part fell off the handle section during its second use. At $13 it&#x27;s tempting to try, but save your money and spend at least $25 for a well-made brush.</li>
            <li> The brush works as advertised and feels great on my skin.  My only complaint is that it &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; quite a bit but I imagine that is pretty common.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. No need for another one more expensive. This does the job perfectly. I will never go back to canned shaving cream. I am a man of simple tastes- easily satisfied by the best!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as my first, having recently discovered the joys of shaving with a safety razor and brush on shave creams. Took about a week to \\&quot;break in,\\&quot; meaning for the first few days it shed routinely and smelled a bit like a small animal (not a bad smell, but it did smell). After the first week, the brush was extremely comfortable to use, sheds very little, and smells like whatever shave cream I most recently used with it. It&#x27;s held up very well for several months of daily, rough use, and I even bought my wife one just like it so she could use it with her favorite brush-on shave creams. Rave reviews from both of us. I&#x27;ll probably spring for a higher end brush at some point, but for now this one is working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just dropped my rating for this brush from 4 to 3...bought a new one for the wife, who came out of the bathroom sad a few days ago because the knot had detached from the handle after only 3 uses. Super glue and patience got it working again, but there&#x27;s no doubt quality is an issue here. Mine is still going strong after 4 months or so, but is losing hairs at an increasing rate per day. My wife&#x27;s came apart after 3 uses. Kind of a crap shoot. Still a good entry brush, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this brush.  So happy, in fact, I bought two more - one for my son and one for my nephew.</li>
            <li> Many people these days expect the best possible product on the market for a minimum amount of money. This leads to many things, and one is the loss of value. If you&#x27;re looking for the best possible brush, you&#x27;re realistically looking at a couple hundred dollars. Here&#x27;s a nice analogy that describes this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t walk into a department store and buy a $200 suit and expect the construction and quality of a bespoke suit from Saville Row. You can buy the $200 suit and get a shotty quality fused suit and save a boat-load of money. Or you could shell out well over $2000 for a full bespoke suit that has superb quality and be broke. Every now and again you come across a nice half-canvassed suit with decent quality for around $600. It doesn&#x27;t break the bank and you get a decent quality suit; the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half-canvassed suit referenced above is this brush. It&#x27;s not the best brush on the market, but it is an excellent value for the money you pay. I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving for a while and enjoy luxury shaving items, but the reality is they are very costly. This brush provides me with an excellent wet shave and I didn&#x27;t break the bank on it. If you&#x27;re willing to spend more money, spend more money. There&#x27;s no doubt you&#x27;ll get a higher quality brush. But if you aren&#x27;t a shaving enthusiast, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> First brush I ever had. Works well, some times hairs fall out, but I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 6 months and it&#x27;s been great. Lost a few hairs at first. It has softened with use and doesn&#x27;t lose hair now.</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a straight razor and this brush is a must have. It creates great lather, feels good on the skin, and washes clean afterwards. Great buy for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality brush that holds water well. For the price this is by far the best brush in it&#x27;s category. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recently got into acoustic shaving, old school style. This was the brush I chose to start out. A friend recommended me to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush took some time to break in, and early on it would shed a few hairs onto my face when I would use it. This didn&#x27;t really matter because the razor removed the badger hair just as well as it did my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush provides a great environment for my Proraso shaving cream to develop into a warm foamy lather. It also feels really good when I rub it on my face. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, match by terrific pricing, with exceptional delivery...</li>
            <li> Its a pretty big and furry brush. Beats the one my father got in the convenience store, seems like it will last a while!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after receiving a Parker 99r as a gift so I could get started shaving.  I wasn&#x27;t really sure what brush to get but for the price I figured this would be a good brush to start with.  My experience so far with this brush has been adequate to this point. I have three main points as to why I deducted stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush is prickly. To be honest it isn&#x27;t that bad but I am guessing other brushes would be softer.&lt;br /&gt;2. Sheds. This brush sheds and continues to do so. I think I typically lose a hair from the brush every use or every other use. It has not affected its performance yet but I am sure at some point it will.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not work as well with actual soaps.  The brush worked well with the first two creams I purchased but I just purchased an actual soap so loading the brush is harder.  The first time I tried the hairs flattened out and couldn&#x27;t get any soap on the brush.  I then discovered if I support the hairs by grabbing the hairs at the knot then I am able to load the brush with plenty of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this should be an entire point or not but it feels like the hairs are starting to get weaker. I am not sure if this is a perception issue or if it simply is getting softer(to soft) over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:  If you are on a tight budge, this little guy will get you by until such time you can afford a better brush since this one will not be the last brush you ever buy.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. This is much nicer than applying by hand, and it actually does help to get shaving cream under the hairs to raise them up a little.</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars I would. Do not buy this brush. The reviews about it smelling like badger are correct. It has a horrid smell right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Arrived QUICKLY and packaged nicely. The brush has a wooden handle that fits your fingers nicely. The brush is soft and feels quite well on the face. All and all I am quite satisfied and would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush had shed a lot of hairs initially (in the first two weeks) then stabilized to one or two hairs falling everyday. Its OK, not a great product as I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised; have enjoyed using this brush.</li>
            <li> Good brush, makes a good lather. Only issue is that it looses quite a bit of hair so it ends up in the lather.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to purchase a shaving kit to start getting cleaner shaves. The Escali Badger brush was highly recommended, so I decided to purchase it and was very satisfied. The bristles feel great and massaging against my skin and dry well in between uses. Although I only recently purchased the brush, I imagine it will hold up over time, as it is showing no indication of wear. The brush creates a great lather with the soap by twirling it around in circular motions. I would recommend this brush for anyone looking to get a real shaving kit.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible brush! Makes a great lather quickly. I would buy it again in a second.  The bristles are perfect and the handle is really comfortable.  Fits perfectly on my Colonel Conk brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, nice price.</li>
            <li> I bought this. Two month&#x27;s use and the bristles literally started falling out every time it was used. And yes, my brushes hang in a stand and are properly cared for. Seems you gotta spend fifty bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good brush, definitely worth the price, but bristles fall out quite frequently.</li>
            <li> Works fine. The shedding is minimal and keep in mind it&#x27;s not a 250$ silver tip. Yes it&#x27;s funky, they all are. Google how to break it in and you&#x27;ll never have a problem. As far as a random bristle here and there... Big whoop. It perfect for me.  I&#x27;ve wet shaved for over a decade so ..., YMMV</li>
            <li> I went through the normal process to break in this badger brush and still, it sheds like a dog in June.  I&#x27;ve purchased one other badger brush, but it was from Elite, and same story.  It seems I can&#x27;t get a good brush from Amazon.  I hear the tweezerman doesn&#x27;t shed so I will probably check that one out next.  If you dont like digging hair out of your shaving soap, dont pick this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and feels really great on my face.  I use it with some hot shave soap lather and it&#x27;s like a little luxury in the morning.  Great product!</li>
            <li> ThuS far Seems like a good shaving brush as expected.</li>
            <li> Ihave been soAP &amp; Brush shaving since 1943. This brush does a good job in mixing lather. I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is as good as any and better than most. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Brush gives smooth finish of shaving soap. Very pleased. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush. I can&#x27;t stand it when shaving brushes leave stray hairs in my soap mug.(pet peeve).&lt;br /&gt;So far, after about six uses,no hairs on my soap.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice lather,soft on your face, and almost makes shaving fun. So much nicer than boar brissel.</li>
            <li> This brush was much more than I expected for the price. For the first few shaves it shed a bristle or two, then no more. For the price I consider it a real bargain and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, economical brush. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.  Has a bit of an odor when first used, but makes a good head of foam and brushes on well.  Fibers tend to come loose a little more than I would like.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. As described it is easy to use and so far ibhave not had any issues with the bristles falling out I have experience on other models. Quick and easy shipping.</li>
            <li> Softer than I thought it would be and excellent all around.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do, no complaints.  Good overall product.</li>
            <li> Works as described. No real issues or red flags.</li>
            <li> Great company. Got my husbands birthday gift early :-)))</li>
            <li> Great brush. Great price&lt;br /&gt;Not much to these really so why spend a ton of cash&lt;br /&gt;This gets the job done as well as the one I have that out three times as much</li>
            <li> I have been completely satisfied with the Escali shaving brush. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the smaller brushes I&#x27;ve owned but it is by far the softest. It seems to be well put together with minimal lose hairs.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells. It has a weird wild animal / chemical odor, but since you&#x27;re using shaving soap it isn&#x27;t an issue. The creamy lather I&#x27;m getting since getting this brush is ridiculous, the bristles are soft and it seems very durable. Expect some shedding for the first few days and then you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I prepared the brush following reccomendations in Badger and Blade website. There is no funky smell, it works well, and has not fallen apart after 2 weeks of steady use. Keep in mind I do hang it up after use (bristles down) and I did prepare it before use as all animal gair brushes should be. It does occasionally lise a hair or two every few days so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali brush about a week ago, and it&#x27;s been treating me good thus far, iv only seen about 2 hairs shed, it lathers great, its soft on the face i like the tinted wood color on the handle, it makes a good fancy piece in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The brush is on the smaller side. It was rough out the box, but after 5-6 uses, it&#x27;s now softened up a lot and is nice to use. Quite a few bristles have come out, not enough to change the shape in any way, but a decent number have. However, for ~$10, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the finest quality or anything. This was more a brush to ease my way into wetshaving without spending a lot, and I&#x27;ll likely make a future purchase for a nicer brush. However, this works just fine for right now and I&#x27;ll probably keep using it as a compact travel brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased about a year ago and so far so good, works great, feels great on your skin,  not to rough and has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> I wore out a boar brush from the drug store in about two months, so I was ready to upgrade to badger, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $50 on a fancy one.  The Escali brush, for $13 is a phenomenal value.  It lathers well, didn&#x27;t lose many bristles at all.  Only drawback is the animal smell at first, which frankly I expected.  That went away after about four uses, so it was no big deal.  I&#x27;m very happy with the brush, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving, and got this brush because it was well priced and had good reviews. That said, I have been thoroughly disappointed. At first I thought the hair loss was due to the break in, but months later I was still losing several hairs on every shave. Further, the bristles are quite flimsy - I find it difficult to work the lather under my beard hairs. I am definitely going to invest in a more expensive brush so as to avoid these issues.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and produces a good lather.  Excellent item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, but you can get better quality brushes for cheaper at maggardrazors.com. Broken-in boar brushes will be more comfortable than this, because it uses clipped Badger hair, which makes it more prickly and less comfortable. It&#x27;s not going to feel like the &amp;#34;face massage&amp;#34; that a lot of people talk about when it comes to wet shaving. Also, it sheds like crazy, ~3-6 hairs every time I shave with it. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it&#x27;s not great. I&#x27;ll probably an Omega boar brush at some point, since they&#x27;re better quality for about the same money.</li>
            <li> For a person that just started shaving whit brush is perfect because is cheap compared to others that are $50 and up a good way to try it without spending too much money really happy with this product hope it last.</li>
            <li> great brush, hasn&#x27;t lost bristles..</li>
            <li> Being new to safety razor shaving, this is my first shaving brush. I use it with Proraso shaving soap. I wouldn&#x27;t really know a good brush from a bad one since I don&#x27;t have much experience with them. It feels and looks like it&#x27;s a quality product. It works well when loading the soap, building it up and applying it. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> 12/18/14 - It hasnt been used yet, its part of a Christmas present. Im sure it will do a fine job. If it doesnt, I will edit this review. So until then, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about. Product works great. Provides me with a great lather on my face to shave. Not exactly sure if these things last forever or the life expectancy, but I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one from Escali.</li>
            <li> Lots of loose hairs on this brush even after months of use, but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> very useful brush; lathers well, good value</li>
            <li> Even though I have given this brush a 3 star rating t is still pretty hard to beat for the money. The brush itself works fine as you would expect from a pure Badger haired brush. The bundle however did fall out the 3rd time I used it and required that I reglue the bundle back into the handle. I suggest using a small amount of Gorilla glue. Don&#x27;t be too critical. A decent Badger haired brush can cost you over $100.00.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is definitely high quality. I&#x27;m taking good care of it.</li>
            <li> Product is just as described, delivery and packaging were perfect.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son for Christmas.  He said he loved the lather but that is was kind of rough when he first started using.  It has held up well.  Wish it came with a stand to let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving brush.  He has sensitive skin, but this brush allows him to apply natural products evenly to achieve a close and gentle shave.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The hairs seem to fall out in the shaving soap, not at an excessive rate, but still...!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft, and feels really nice on the skin! Cleans easy enough.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is a well constructed and comfortable gadget to hold and to lather.  If you follow the rinsing and drying instructions the bristles will maintain their shape</li>
            <li> Great brush. Makes good lather. Bought one for my son as well. I am new to wet shaving and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I had a badger brush from a starter kit but that brush was a little stiff. This one is much nicer</li>
            <li> The brush does exactly what is supposed to do.  The price was fair and you get exactly what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and is still going strong.  The only draw back is that it will start to loose a lot of the hairs and they sometimes get stuck on you face when you apply the soap.  But over all I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty poor quality. Not sure what I was expecting for the price, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs are very coarse and sharp and the density is pretty lacking. They really scratched up my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wood handle is discernibly cheap in quality and of finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is almost mini. It&#x27;s much more petite than other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing a higher quality brush. The one I like is from Art of Shaving. I like it for it&#x27;s weight and thickness, density and softness of the bristles, and general quality. They</li>
            <li> More like 3/12 Stars. My husband likes it but it shed A LOT the first several times he used it. Enough that we almost bought a different brush. Fortunately after shave number 5 or so it settled and now only loses a few hairs with each shave. FYI-if you are just learning to use a straight razor you DO NOT want a brush that sheds like mad.</li>
            <li> A good starter if you&#x27;re interested in trying brushes - a few hairs come out, but that seems to stop after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The recipient was quite enthusiastic about the quality of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;It was refreshing to see that there are still fine quality old-style shaving products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and effective -Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 2 weeks and it is great.  Cleans easily and holds the shaving cream well.</li>
            <li> Poorly made brush which after several months continues to lose bristles both on my face and during rinsing.</li>
            <li> This pure badger shaving brush is a great price and quality.  The wood I received was actually a very expensive burl, but I would not expect that.  I have been using the brush for a month.  The bristles are NOT falling out.  The brush easily makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> Works well to lather my shave soap. The hairs keep shedding but its nothing to worry much about. I give it a quick rinse and shake it dry after use</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush!  Works perfectly for a nice lather.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft, hold water without drenching.  Note to future purchasers - wash brush thoroughly before use to remove some of the loose follicles.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it did have a little bit of odor. This went away by the second use. Also the first three uses This brush shed about twenty hair each time. But after a week no more hair loss and the brush has turned into the best part of my morning shave.</li>
            <li> My first brush. As other reviewers said, it shed lots at first, but now it sheds very little. It&#x27;s light and well balanced, and the handle makes it easy to hang on to, even with wet hands. I don&#x27;t have a stand for it, but the instructions say you can store it on its side, so I let the brush side hang off a little ledge in our shower. One note: if this is your first time using a brush for shaving, expect your skin to sting a little afterwards (at least compared to using a cream).</li>
            <li> I love my Badger brush! Fast service.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving brush came extra fast, and has proven to be more than worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Does the job, people complain about the smell of wet badger hair but I actually enjoy it. Maybe I&#x27;m just weird.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a well made brush, it really gets the saving cream into your beard, evenly spread--I highly recommend from anyone, beginner to expert.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked the brush. For the price it did a great job and seemed solid. After a month or two I&#x27;ve started to notice bristles in the sink or soap. I&#x27;m hoping that this might just be an initial bristle loss, but I&#x27;ll keep an eye on that and post an update.  [Update] After 10 months I need to replace this brush. I lose bristles every time I use it. I take proper care of the brush rinsing it and gently squeezing it (not wringing it) and then hanging it in a stand. The past several shaves the bristle loss has increased and the brush is noticeably less full than when I started using it. Along with the loss of bristles it seems that they have softened too.   Honestly for the price you could just plan on replacing it every 6 months, but for now I&#x27;ll upgrade to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> First one so don&#x27;t know what to compare it to but it works and feels great. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> very bristle-y brush, i have had some hairs come out but nothing crazy.  i found that the middle part gets tangled up and the soap doesn&#x27;t rinse out of that very easily but it doesn&#x27;t bother me to much.  I like the brush</li>
            <li> Did not know what to expect, but it really works well!!! I would recommend this brush to anyone using a straight razor to shave.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and works great.  Would buy a again.  Good value, good seller.</li>
            <li> For the price I was not disappointed. I needed a cheap and affordable badger brush and thats exactly what I got. The brush does its job well enough, but some of the hairs do fall out of it while you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush purchase, so, my experience is somewhat limited.  Having said that, I feel like this is a great value.  The brush works well, is easy to handle, and feels great on my face.  I did notice that there was a slight &amp;#34;wet animal&amp;#34; smell for the first week or so of use -- but honestly, isn&#x27;t that to be expected in a brush with real natural fibers?  I think I&#x27;d be more concerned if it DIDN&#x27;T have a bit of an odor.  Nevertheless, the smell went away after just a few uses.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and it seems to be holding up well.  I think I&#x27;ve only noticed one or two fibers falling out.  I&#x27;d recommend anyone give this a try as an &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Still holding up well after a year of regular use. Great deal for the price and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned because some of the reviews said a lot of the hairs fell out at first use and although they did after first use, after that everything is now staying together. I&#x27;m sure it is not the softest of brushes but for half the price of the apothecary near me and for being a first time straight edge shaver, this product got the job done at a great price. I will definitely be purchasing again (but hopefully a long time from now).</li>
            <li> Works like it should.  Seems to be made well,  Hangs perfectly in the wooden holder I bought to hang it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced wet shaver.  I have never used a bigger piece of junk. I use boars that have less scratch than this, this thing never did stop shedding. I gave it more than a fair shake then pitched it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little brush, especially for the price. Perfect for beginners like me who don&#x27;t want to go all out on a brush before I know if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaving brush for my husband based on the good reviews and the great price.  At first, he did not like it compared to his old (cheap) brush.  He said this one smelled a bit and didn&#x27;t lather well.  However, after his old brush completely fell apart, he started using this one and has come to like it very much.  Maybe it still had some oils on it?  We would purchase again but maybe wash well before using the first time.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a couple of times and it&#x27;s already falling apart. It also smells terrible when wet. I expected a better product with all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully paired up with my Taylor Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream. Other than a few bristles shedding from time to time it is holding up well after a couple of months. Recommend you squeeze excess water out then spin it around with your fingers to dry it before placing back in the brush stand.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush with a great weight and feel. The bristles hold well and the brush is perfect and at a perfect price</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this brush because it was one of the cheapest real badger hair brushes that I could find. That being said, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect in terms of quality. However, this brush really surprised me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and I really enjoy it. It looks just as good as the expensive ones and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no problems. This brush does have a bit of a smell when you use it the first couple times, but I expected that as its hair from a real badger. My dog freaked out when I first unpackaged it lol. The smell fades quickly though, and ends up smelling more like the shave soap you use. The only reason this brush doesn&#x27;t get five stars is because in the first few uses some of the bristles came out, but this is the only brush I&#x27;ve owned so this could just be a normal thing that I am unaware of.</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft and works up a good lather in my dish. Applies soap easily and cleans up with warm water and let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps i shape and stays soft and pliable. Price was great and works. Can&#x27;t compare to a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; as I have not used one but compared to the real cheap one I got locally it is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend with no problem.</li>
            <li> My first and my mainstay brush.&lt;br /&gt;Price is damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll lose a few hairs on break in but once that&#x27;s over it&#x27;s a good brush that will get the job done. Looks good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely sets the standard.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought came broken (the wood handle and brush was not connected) when I received it. The seller sent me a new one free of charge. However, within weeks the second one broke in the same way. The glue that holds the handle and brush together is weak/cheap. The brush itself is very nice; however cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Why are other brushes so darn much.  This one gets the job done.  Does have an interesting scent when wet.  Wish amazon did not have a work minimum on reviews.</li>
            <li> A very good brush at an outstanding price.  You lose some fibers the first few uses but after that nothing.</li>
            <li> Since I have nothing to compare this brush to I cannot give it 5 stars, but so far it is doing OK. One thing I noticed is that it looses bristles each time I use it. I don&#x27;t know if that is normal for this type of brush or if the brush is made poorly. You decide. Despite the falling bristles the brush lathers up well and spreads the shaving soap pretty evenly.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and easy to lather up. Very little shedding. Great value for the money! You have to follow the instructions for drying (upside down) and rinse with every wash. I have had this now for a few months and performing to expectations.</li>
            <li> I am just trying to get in to DE shaving. I purchased this brush as a part of a starter kit. I thought an inexpensive brush would be the best option until I got some lathering skill. The brush stunk, irritated my face, and she&#x27;d like crazy. After only a week or so, there was a &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; in the middle of the brush where the hairs had completely fallen out, or tangled together. I would say I got about 5-6 uses out of the brush and never got a good lather. I picked up a travel brush, as well as a cheap boar brush from the local grocery, and both outperformed this brush. Even $13 is too much for only a weeks worth of bad performance.</li>
            <li> The badger shaving brush is exactly as advertised. It lathers the shaving soap nicely and works it into my stubble nicely. It is a good value.</li>
            <li> Product is great for the price you pay. I use mine to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be quite as nice as some of the more expensive brushes, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this one.</li>
            <li> This brush replaced a boar hair shaving brush that I had been using for a couple years.  It had very minimal shedding but it should be rinsed thoroughly before the first use to remove the dark dye(?) from the bristles.  It holds water very well and creates a nice wet lather on your face.  I&#x27;ll never go back to boar hair again.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, and highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so take my review with a grain of salt but I am very happy with it. It seems high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price.  It works very well at lathering up shaving cream, holds water well, and it is easy to rinse.  It also has a very soft feel on my face.  I learned that they must dry upside down, so i purchase a stand for the razor and for the brush.  In summary, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great brush that is priced right you can find it right here. A well balanced brush soft in every way.</li>
            <li> Great price. Appears to be comparable to brushes costing twice as much. If they hold up (looks like they will) I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This brush works well, but after using it I always seem to find badger hairs on the counter.  I&#x27;m assuming that one day I will have to replace this brush since it can&#x27;t have unlimited hair.  The brush fits perfectly in the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it. It was better than my Art of Shaving brush that I had, However after several uses, I began noticing the whiskers to start falling off. Not sure if there are any guidelines to prevent such a thing. I still use it and like how it feels, but I just wished the whiskers wouldn&#x27;t keep falling out.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. So I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison with other brands. What I can say is that it has real badger hair, the hairs in the brush even have a natural smell and the first time I soaked it in water it dripped real hair oil. I use it with a TOBS shaving soap and when I leave it soaking in water for about 5 min, it absorbs water well. It creates abundant latter with just a couple of swirls in the soap. The brush also helps to prepare your skin for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every shave I lose at least a couple hairs form the brush, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m to rough when I&#x27;m using the brush to create latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always remember after using it to dry it up and never leave it facing up. The brush must be left hunging with the hairs looking down.</li>
            <li> My go to shaving brush that is durable and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> i hate it because hair on the brush kept coming off, even after i&#x27;ve used it a dozen times!  the hair on the brush could be softer and not as sharp at the tip.  when i lift the brush off my face when the tip of the hair touches my face it sorta pokes and makes shaving not completely enjoyable.  the handle is great, just the right size and feels wonderful.  i just hate the hair part and wished they had made a better product.  sometimes i wonder if i would have a more comfortable shaving experience if i use a wall paint brush???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a few weeks now and its a really good brush. Lathers everything well and dries well also. It does tend to shed more than I hoped maybe 4 hairs a shave so far, but for the price it is a great brush. Going to try a synthetic brush soon and i will update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been a week or so now. I bought this brush, a Merkur long handle razor, and Proraso soap to start with. So far everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;This brush lathers great, is not too rough, and I anticipate it getting softer the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not have a bad smell as I&#x27;ve noticed that some people say a new brush will. I removed it straight from the package and used it the first day with no issues at all. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I forgot to mention that it does shed a little bit but I&#x27;m sure that will diminish over time. A great all around brush for a DE shave noob such as myself. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good just went you dip it in the water it drops hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter brush</li>
            <li> The hairs in this brush don&#x27;t stay. After every use I have to clean my soap. I imagine this thing wouldn&#x27;t last much more than another week if I kept using it.  I went back to my boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Some few of the hairs fall off when I am whipping up a rich, thick shave lather. However, I like it.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and good quality.</li>
            <li> My Husband truly enjoyed this shaving brush.  This was a first purchase on shaving brushes to see if he&#x27;d like the change at a reasonable price and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> great brush. a little bit short, but works great</li>
            <li> Works great; great price; no issues with hair falling out at all. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great quality for the price, been using for 2 months and never had such a great shave!!</li>
            <li> It sheds a bit, but for the money... I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, be it work or play.</li>
            <li> exceptional, nice craftsmanship  , I use it every day.  trustworthy store very professional I will be a repeat costumer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend megabucks for a brush, but wanted a good one.  Used a natural bristle brush previously, and this is MUCH better!!  Had 4 or 5 bristles come out during the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve used it, but I think that is to be expected.  Using it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin and get a great lather.  Make sure I soak the brush in warm water for a minute or 2 prior to using it, make sure I get all the soap out after (squeeze, don&#x27;t twist the bristles), and hang it to dry in a razor and brush stand.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, soft, and husband loves it</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift by my wife for my bday. Use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> works great use it every day</li>
            <li> This is a good brush.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my partner to replace his very old brush. He was so pleased with this brush he actually threw the old one away.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality brush it&#x27;s the 2nd brush I buy of this brand . The 1st I bought was for myself 2nd one as a gift for my older bRotherham that was using a terible boar brisle one that swe lIke a wire brush to removerstae rus rat her than apoly shaVing cream. Great quality fast shipping from vendor</li>
            <li> Great brush! It is replacing my old one that was 5 X the cost of this one that I had for 4yrs. First impression: fits my hand, soft bristles, does a great job whipping up and holding lather, no matting or balling of bristles, easy cleaning and dries completely. Haven&#x27;t had any issue with shedding bristles at this time but over time I expect it will (all of them do) Had a slight odor the first 2 times of use (not overwhelming or foul). For the price I am very happy no complaints. Will update this in a month or so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after reading all the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using a boar hair brush for years and liked it just fine, but since I was getting a new double edge razor I figured I&#x27;d go for a new brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this one a few times I am back to my old boar hair brush. I&#x27;m not really sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to badger hair brushes. The bristles flatten out way too easily when your applying cream using very little pressure. So you end up with a pancaked shaped brush with a handle. My old boar hair brush is much stiffer and does not flatten out like this one. I guess if you used real light pressure and babied it the brush would stand up fine, but that is not my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this might work fine for you if you use a brush that way, but if you like to be more aggressive when applying your shaving cream this might not be the brush for you. Oh and the bristles were falling out a lot too. I suspect they might stop after more uses, but it was annoying having to shave with bristles stuck to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this brush even at the low price point.</li>
            <li> Love it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this product for the price.  The only improvement I think could be made is weight.  It feels a bit light in the hands...however I believe that the affordability and quality of this product are excellent.  It creates a beautiful lather and soaks up water wonderfully.  I would highly recommend for wet shavers on a budget.</li>
            <li> Essentially became only 50% useful after two to three weeks of use, at around 3 days between shaves. First lather on shave soap showed some brown oily residue, I figured since the brush was brand new I would have to break it in, but yet here I am months later and still brown residue coming off bristles. The bristles themselves are very coarse to the skin, especially for those who have sensitive skin and are likely to bleed during a shave. What did it in for me was that after about 6 uses, with typical lather technique, the middle part of the brush (essentially the core of the brush where most lather should be) became depressed into the brush, the bristles became tangled down there and that results in a garbage lather. Lastly, I feel the handle is too small as most of the lather created always drips down. Still using, but only until my Edwin Jagger Best badger brush arrives. You get what you pay for. Since badger brushes are graded by hair, it&#x27;s like the three little pigs story. Don&#x27;t start with the hay house (this brush) spend your 16$ and go to the next level.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the fact that no hair come off (after the first couple of uses). Be sure to dry in horizontal position. Bought a 2nd one for my Dad</li>
            <li> Great value and it will hold up with proper care.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for several years now, and can count the number of bristles that have fallen out on one hand.  No problems with the wood handle either.  If you care for it then it will last.  If you just plop it on the sink wet, with the bristles up, then it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It does the job well.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase for a shave cream brush and I really like it. It was losing some bristles in the beginning but I think that is normal? I say this because I later purchased a large Kent silver tipped Badger brush for 0ver $200.00 and the same occurred. So in my opinion this is a great shave brush. It gets the job done and it is a really good quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;  Honestly I should have just stayed with this brush and saved $200.00. This brush fits well in my Shaving Stand and produces a great lather!</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what I ordered and expected to receive. It works great and with minimal shedding. A great addition to any one&#x27;s shaving collection.</li>
            <li> if you are a retro dude who likes shaving to be a ritual then go for this man. really nice</li>
            <li> Surprised at the quality for the price. Bristles are nice and strong not a lot of flaking.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving brush and decent price.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smaller than I expected but the bristles are nice and soft. Item came to my home 1 day after ordering!</li>
            <li> i bought this brush, because my cousing tollme about it,along with shave soap foam. the pruduct arrive pretty fast and everything was nice and clean, im going to reorder again one set for my father. i know is a good product. i given 5 start  because is a honest good quality for the price. i recomended to my family and friends to shave old schoold to avoid all the chemicals the shave cans have. not enviromental friendly products.&lt;br /&gt;go Escali, go natural.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush at a great price!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Holds lather fine. Make sure to soak it in hot water for a good long time before the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> Excellent brush!  I have been enjoying it for about 2 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problem with it getting ratty looking or too many bristles coming out.  I&#x27;ve had a couple bristles on my face, but it&#x27;s been an excellent brush so far.  As a first time badger brush user I must say I enjoy the way the bristles kind of &#x27;poke&#x27; at the skin and make the hair come up a bit.  I&#x27;ve done some experiments with using the brush on one side and not on the other and I feel like I can sense a difference in the smoothness using this brush and the Proraso shave cream that is sold on Amazon too.  My wife can feel the difference too, and it&#x27;s nice and tingly.  I&#x27;m enjoying my new shave experience with this brush and the new cream.  Certainly not that expensive and it makes shave time more elegant feeling!</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush, but it loses a couple of bristles every time I use it. Good for starting out, perhaps, if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush is sturdy and exceptional. Very smooth application of lather.</li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t buy a pure wolverine brush you can make do nicely with this one.  I&#x27;m not a Wisconsin alumni or even a fan but I really find this a very functional brush for lathering up for a shave.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good. The hairs feel very smooth against my skin and have not come dislodged after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Makes great foam, a lot better than a hog bristle brush.  Has a funky smell to it, not sure if that&#x27;s normal.  I have washed it a few times and reduced the odor.</li>
            <li> Nice Brush for the price. Holds water well and is quite soft. I have both boar and badger hair brushes but I seem to keep using this one.</li>
            <li> First saving brush I&#x27;ve purchased for many years. Purchased it to take on vacation. Have been using it for about three weeks and I am very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> Great seller offering a great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but it&#x27;s on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. A middle grade brush at best. Maybe it works better for dry makeup or powders, but as for a shaving brush. One to use with old fashioned shaving cream it falls short. Doesn&#x27;t hold enough hot water, nor does it keep enough air between the hairs to help lather effectively. However it gets the job done with some patience.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I am impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Every shave from day one is obstructed due to loose hairs produced by this brush. Nothing more to be said.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, soft bristles yet holds its shape very well. Creates a good lather and rinses clean very easily. Excellent buy for DE starters and enthusiasts alike!</li>
            <li> I love the brush but it took some getting used to.  The handle is very soft and comfortable but could be more rigid.  The part that goes against your face is wood, which is unusual.  The brush works well but the shave cream doesn&#x27;t penetrate the wood applicator very well and it&#x27;s kind of hard against your face.  Great price though!</li>
            <li> The brush tips are &amp;#34;scritchy&amp;#34;. They are trimmed and supposedly that means the tips will never soften as they are the thickest part of the hair. I use Proraso green so I don&#x27;t feel the irritation. I also cannot use it in the swirling motion (which exfoliates better) on my face because of said irritation. So I can only paint the lather on my face for application. Further more I&#x27;m still losing one or two hairs every time I make a lather (it&#x27;s been used for about 40+ shaves), which causes me to not want to use tubs/soaps and instead use creams, so I don&#x27;t have to fish lost hairs out of my tubs.  As I understand a pure badger is usually lower quality than boar. I would recommend a boar or even horse hair brush instead of this (or any pure badger) brush. Hopefully mine stops losing hair or I&#x27;ll just break down and get a whipped dog silvertip, which can be had for the cost of 3 of these things.</li>
            <li> This brush is great as an entry level shaving brush. Honestly, this should be used only if you&#x27;re trying to decide whether to switch from a foam (e.g. Gilette) to a brush, as I was. The first shave, I found the bristles very stiff and &amp;#34;poky.&amp;#34; I thought I may be doing it wrong. After some research, I learned that there are three grades to badger brush hair: Pure, Best, Silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, Pure is meant to be &amp;#34;poky.&amp;#34; It is the stiffest of the grades. That said, after a few more shaves, I actually started to appreciate the feel on my face. It occurred to me that shaving brushes were Man&#x27;s original exfoliant. Women have creams. Men have brushes. Even so, I still thought it was a tad bit sharp for my test, so eventually I will be opting for a good Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, for the price and the use I have gotten out of it so far (~3 months) this brush was well worth the price for an introduction into brush lathering.</li>
            <li> Quality craftsmanship with people on a budget. The hairs tend to fall out (one or two at each shave), but otherwise very tightly packed. I easily got rid of the scent of animal hair by soaking in vinegar for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well. The individual threads keep coming off every time I use this product and it keeps sticking to my skin. Its a little abrasive too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s slowly breaking in.  The first 6 or shaves were extremely disappointing as 15-20 hairs fell out each time and I spent the majority of the time picking them out. It&#x27;s slowing improving now to only a couple hairs a shave that fall put. I just put hates a new better brush as I am tired of trying to use this one.</li>
            <li> This brush surpassed all expectations! Its soft bristles are the perfect compliment to any shave butter and the end result is a soft supple shave.  Anyone looking to upgrade their daily shave should consider using this all natural bristle brush that is soft to the touch and gentle on even dry winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I will definitely be buying this product again. I hope that the Badger did not suffer too much.</li>
            <li> It does shed a good bit on the first 7 or so uses but after that the amount shedding decreases immensely.  For the price, it is great and I would recommend it</li>
            <li> My husband has not yet used it.  We bought it for his at Christmas time.  But the shaving brush looks good and we hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an excellent value for the money, and my husband likes it.  Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This  is my first badge brush.  I have been using the brush for about a month now and occasionally I would find a hair in my sink or on my face.</li>
            <li> For the wet shaver this brush is a must. I am very pleased with this brush and would recommend this brush without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job. It&#x27;s soft and made with a quality handle. Fits perfectly in brush and razor holder.</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; brushes on good - but just used for 2nd time - and the same as the 1st time - the hairs keep falling out &amp; sticking on my face and in the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my brother in law for Christmas, and he loved it! He said he had the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its supposed to do.  Its not the best brush but its far, far away from being the worst.  Its a cheaper brush, and its a little on the thin side, but it works just fine for getting a decent lather.</li>
            <li> I must admit that this is my first shaving brush, but I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I have been using it for awhile now, and it looks great and seems very well crafted. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and, most importantly, can make a great lather. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re hear for, right?</li>
            <li> I have owned and used this brush for about one month and it is working very well thus far creating and comfortably administering lather.</li>
            <li> I have four shaving brushes - this is my favorite - and keep them at the different places I live and stay at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality and density of  the bristles is very good; it is a pure badger hair brush, and does every bit as well as my silvertip brush - only for a lot less money.  The silvertip brush is softer and carries a bigger load, but if your objective is to create a creamy thick lather for a good shave, well, it loads well with water and lathers with the best of them...at a much more modest price.  For those starting out or that have been wet shaving for years, you cannot go wrong.  Very nice brush, very modest price, very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...and I purchased a second one...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about shaving brushes, but saw this one had great reviews on Amazon and was much less than some of the others. Amazon was right. This is a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> This is overall a great brush. For the price I paid I was amazed at how nice it is. I haven&#x27;t used other brushes, but this one has been doing its job every single day for 2 months without a hitch. I would have given 4.5 stars if I could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the looks of it and it feels very well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has been periodically shedding a hair here and there for the past 2 months. I expected a bit of shedding at the beginning and I was right, as it did happen. However, eventually the shedding slowed down to no more than about 1 hair every other day, sometimes 1 hair every day.  I don&#x27;t know a lot of about shaving brushes, so take this information with a grain of salt as it&#x27;s possible that this is normal for them or that it&#x27;s not going to cause any problems for a long time.</li>
            <li> The brush is inexpensive, decent looking, and works nicely.  After about a half dozen uses, I&#x27;m still losing 1 or 2 hairs per shave (the first couple of shaves I was losing closer to 5), so I can&#x27;t yet say if this will eventually stop, or if at some point that ONE final hair will fall out that causes a catastrophic drop below minimum required density and the whole pack of badger hairs fall into the sink with a soft &amp;#34;fump&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell. Some people mention an odor, mine had a slight &amp;#34;badgery&amp;#34; smell the first couple of uses, but this has all but disappeared. It&#x27;s a good brush. As long as it lasts, I see no need to pay any more than this.</li>
            <li> Skip this one. I have had this brush for about a month, used it almost every day. I lost a substantial amount of bristles during the first 10 uses. At this point it hardly lathers at all. Fortunately most of the rank bathroom smell is gone, though.  If you are in the market for a good first brush get an Omega boar hair. They are just all around better in every way, softer, quicker lather, feels better on the face. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with this product. Brush does not appear to be of really good quality seems to have not much body however the company got it to me in less time than expected</li>
            <li> I like the stiffness of the brush but its a bit too small for my hands. I purchased the Van der Hagan set and the brush came apart after six months. This brush is a little smaller than that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a smell when I first used it and when I first rinsed the brush the water would run brown like there was oil on the brush. All in a all a good brush but I will be looking for a bigger one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product especially if paired with Dove Men+ Care Total Comfort Shave Cream. Makes any shave prep a better prep. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I just started using this kind of brush for shaving and I have found this to be an excellent brush for lathering up.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Great Brush for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Lathers up well. Great quality. First month there has not been any bristles falling out or deformation. Excellent size. And so nice to lather up in this fashion.</li>
            <li> Great for the price sheds every now and again. Started out kinda of stiff but, over time has become nice and soft. Happy with purchase. Great buy for beginners.</li>
            <li> This brush has major manufacturer&#x27;s defects.  I paid the $12.95 price.  Thought the Escali would be at least as good as the one at Walgreen&#x27;s.  But I was wrong.  The Walgreen&#x27;s brush has lasted for years.  And I don&#x27;t remember when the last time was I saw a loose bristle.  With the Escali brush, on average I lose 30 to 40 bristles during each daily shave.  They stick all over the razor, on my face, in the lather, and all over the sink bowl.  It&#x27;s disgusting.  The loose bristles interfere with the shaving process and are difficult to remove from the razor.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use hot or cold water.  Same thing happens.  A month later still dropping bristles like crazy.  Do not buy this brush, you will be sorry if you do.  Will write the seller and request a refund or credit, not sure how that&#x27;s going to work out.</li>
            <li> Can feel the quality when holding brush</li>
            <li> Use with shaving soap from a bowl, had no issues so far, good feel on skin and nicely priced</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a brush that did niot &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; into the shave cream or on the skin.  This brush sheds and several of the bristles became in-tangled. Not much better than the Walmart brush I had been using which costs about half what the Escali costs. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush! I find it holds a lot of moisture and is perfect for lathering my face. The badger hair definitely makes a difference. In the past I have bought my husband other shaving brushes made from different material and they did not work as well. I like that you know exactly what the material is because your face is a sensitive area of your body. I also like how they also give you directions on how to maintain its shape.  Escali recommends that after using your rinse the brush with water, making sure to remove all of the shaving cream. They also recommend hanging the brush upside down to dry. I saw someone commented that they added a screw in their brush to hook it to hang. This is a great idea.  I received this brush at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, does not shed any of the brush particles!  I don&#x27;t think I will but if should ever need a replacement or my son should ever need one this will be at the top of my list!</li>
            <li> Great Brush for the price! No problems; holds a great lather. I highly recommend pre-conditioning the brush before first use. I Recommend this</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin but stiff enough to produce a decent lather with shaving soap.</li>
            <li> When I first started using a badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d keep using it.  After all, guess what a wet badger brush smells like?  You guessed it.  A wet badger.  The stink nearly turned me off from it entirely.  Thankfully after a couple weeks of shaving with good soaps the smell finally went away.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and it&#x27;s lost probably 10 hairs or so.  Not a big deal in my opinion.  Overall a nice looking and performing brush, and good quality for the money.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and was exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for. It made a great gift. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Even though this is the first Badger shaving brush I have purchased it has served me quite well. Some others may complain of a gamey smell, but that will disappear after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Lets me foam up my shaving cream and apply it to my face evenly. Works wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I got this for a reduced price for a product review and my opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li> stiff beard bristles so it doest seem to get those hairs standing upright...its the first brush ive tried..its ok  (Jeff Abel)</li>
            <li> loses a lot of hairs every time I use it. They are still coming out 2 months later.</li>
            <li> Good brush for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It shed a few hairs at first and had a faint smell. What do you expect for a brush of this price? Use it and the odor goes away, replaced by your soap&#x27;s smell. When the hairs that are going to shed fall out (and there&#x27;s not enough to make a difference), the shedding essentially stops.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and it is great. If you want a brush that does not shed at all and has no smell at all, pay $100 for a brush. If you want a good deal, buy this one and use it.</li>
            <li> Just as good as I had hoped. Great product</li>
            <li> Descent brush. Only issue I have is it is still shedding. Now I know for only a very short time I had no idea how to properly store the brush (maybe a week) but it does shed a lot. Maybe it&#x27;ll stop someday but yeah everyday it sheds a bunch at this rate it&#x27;ll be bald in a new more months</li>
            <li> Quick service,  quality product equals very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Holds a good amount of lather with just enough water to keep everything well lubricated during the entirety of my shave. Dries quickly and lasts a long time (I&#x27;ve had this one 3 years and it&#x27;s still going strong).</li>
            <li> It beats a sharp stick in the eye</li>
            <li> Works very smoothly with a very minimal loss of bristle(s), rarely, Unlike the previous shaving brush which lost bristles constantly.</li>
            <li> At first a few hairs came out and it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought, but that turned out to be a good thing. The hairs eventually stop coming out after a few uses. The hardness actually seems to soften my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Will be getting another</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of a great shave.  I&#x27;m glad to be back to safety razors, too</li>
            <li> I love using this brush to shave.  It feels good and holds the bristles well.  The purists would rather use a bowl to work up a lather, but in my opinion its quicker and feels a helluva lot better when one works up the lather directly on the stubble. (I used to be a purist!)</li>
            <li> Great brush; lathers well; comfortable grip. This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving Brush it we&#x27;ll out last me! And my great grandson we&#x27;ll be using it&lt;br /&gt;after I get full use of it.</li>
            <li> Good brush and soft enough on my face, especially for the price. I got this along with an Escali deluxe chrome stand and Edwin Jagger safety razor and they fit in it nicely. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet. It will lose a little hair the first few uses but that seems pretty normal. As long as you properly rinse it out and dry it stays just as fluffy as when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I said in the subject line. Great brush for the price. Is it as comparable with most of the top name brushes out there? Not too much, but it&#x27;s close enough for being a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do follow general brush care (get a stand, clean it, etc.) and this one should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> For the price you can really beat it. It just has one thing that i don&#x27;t like about it, it smells like a stable yard that hasnt been cleaned in awhile. But once the cream was on it i couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush as part of my introduction into the world of DE safety razor shaving; very pleased with the quality of the product and delivery was a breeze.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I had done enough research to determine that I wanted to go with a Badger brush compared to either Boar or Horse hair brushes.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find quality shaving products in the retail marketplace.  With the amount excellent reviews, and the shear number of reviews, I figured I can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.  I found the brush to be adequate for the price.  There is a slight scent to it, and the bristles are somewhat scratchy - which was expected.  What wasn&#x27;t expected, even for what I assume is a machine made brush, was the amount of hairs that this brush has lost.  I soaked it, shampooed it, and brushed the hairs as you are supposed to prior to using it, but i continually get about 10-12 loose hairs during each use.  The hairs get in the shave cream and on the face, and presents an (albeit small) obstacle when shaving.  You can get a highly regarded quality Boars hair brush like the Semogue 1305 for just a few dollars more, but if you are committed to wet shaving, you might want to go a little bit further and get the Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush.  Either of those brushes I feel would be a step up from this one, for not that much more money.</li>
            <li> Found out about shaving this way from a friend could not say enough good things to say about shaving with straight edge. Bought this product to try it out any loved it. Really gives you a nice lather before you shave.</li>
            <li> Great brush, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better brush</li>
            <li> Nice brush and bristles. I tried washing all of the loose hairs out of the brush before my first shave but it still shed for about 4 or 5 shaves.  It whips a nice lather up and feels nice.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this brush to shave with, but to paint a face medicine on my face. It worked extremely well! Now that I have use it will&lt;br /&gt;be using it to shave. It has taken tuff chemical abuse. I love the feel of the brush and I will be using a shaving cup and soap!&lt;br /&gt;I believe it to be a deal not to miss out. I give it the &amp;#34;Buy sign&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I&#x27;m relatively new to the quality shave movement, so I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank on supplies, but I wanted a quality brush as well. My wife heard good things about this brush and got it for me for Father&#x27;s Day and it&#x27;s been great! I don&#x27;t see any reason to change, and don&#x27;t anticipate needing or wanting to upgrade for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice Full brush! Some bristle loss but still a great value. Will buy another when the time comes. It makes a nice foamy lather.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Brush does not whip the shaving soap as well as a higher quality brush. Does not loose the bristles after the using it for a few days. Only lost a few bristles, which does not impact the brush reliability.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband &amp; he loves it!</li>
            <li> I generally see a hair or two fall out during every shave, but otherwise it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the quality of the brush, given the price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Seems as high a quality as the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> When I decided to start using the brush, I did some research, and fount that there is no reason to spend a lot of money for something simple. This brush is good for the job for the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other shaving brush so no comparisons. But this one certainly does the job fairly good. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Exactly as described. The thin brass band gives it a premium touch of class. Shipping promptly and arrive in good condition.</li>
            <li> Excited to get this new shaving brush, I have had some badger brushes in the past, and I was looking to replace my current brush of 5 years from Art of Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Opened the box, and the smell of manure hits me. OK, strange, none of my other bushes smells like this. Well, it must be temporary, maybe I just need to break it in. Soak in water for a few mins, warm water makes the smell worse. Wash with dawn (just a little), no help. Lather with Taylor of Bond street shaving creme, rinse, lather, rinse, later, put on face, almost throw up. It was literally like lathering with manure. Even after leaving with creme overnight as recommended to get rid of smells, no help. This brush was not like any of the other badger brushes i have, and I finally just tossed the thing. I guess you et what you pay for. Sprung for a moderately priced silver tip, no smell, lathers great. Caveat Emptor!</li>
            <li> Soft on the skin and helps work up a great lather. I have only been using this for a few months but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this as my very first shaving brush. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months now. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few shaves, it did shed perhaps 6-8 long bristles per shave, but that seems to have stopped.&lt;br /&gt;It also did have an &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell (wet badger???) for the first day, but as I started using my Lavender shave cream daily, that smell quickly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great brush for the money and I&#x27;ll likely buy another one of these should this one wear out.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth bristles and provided a good lather but after 5 uses it is still shedding and smells a bit like wet dog but both are diminishing.</li>
            <li> This badger shaving brush is not cheap, but if an old fashioned shaving experience is what you desire, you need this high quality,well made brush.  I&#x27;ve had it only a few weeks, but I&#x27;m sure it will outlast me. (I just had my 80th birthday.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was prompt and all arrived in good order.</li>
            <li> First off let me start off by saying that ever since I switched to the &amp;#34; real&amp;#34; way on how to shave I have seen a huge difference in my face. I have really sensitive skin and for the longest have always used Gillette -brands, these always left my face with ingrown hairs and such- yuck. I have since invested in a decent razor - merkur, and have invested in other products. This badger brush is decent, it is good quality. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times so far and it does loose a couple of bristles when you first start using this, the more you use it the better it gets. My brush did come with a slight smell but after rinsing continuously it has since decreased by each use. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> If you like shaving badger hair off your beard this is it!  Spend the money for a good badger brush, stay away from this one!</li>
            <li> After going through three cheap drug-store boar hair brushes, I broke down and bought this.  After the normal conditioning procedure, it works well.  I&#x27;m hanging mine from some string on a towel rack until I have time to make a proper stand, but it&#x27;s treated me well so far.  It&#x27;s also much softer than the boar hair brushes I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> A high quality small handle badger brush, I like it.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li> This brush fell apart in my hands after one month of use.  The bristles come loose in the soap cup leaving an unattractive debris to pick out of the shaving cup.  I have brushes that are years old with no such problems.  i bought this brush for a summer stay and left my regular brush at home.  In the vernacular, this is a piece of s---!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three brushes, a very high end Badger brush, a not so expensive badger and this rather inexpensive brush. The second brush is a backup to my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush for travel knowing that I will eventually leave it somewhere. So I purchased this to lose it. I was very pleasantly surprised that for 12 bucks I could get an very acceptable brush. In fact, the Badger hair is a bit firmer than my more expensive one and so this one provides a more vigorous application of shaving soap. It also helps whip up the lather better. The firmness feels quite nice on my face where others have said it \\&quot;scratches\\&quot;. I disagree, but understand why they may think that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush holds water nicely, drys nicely, and holds soap perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 4 stars? Two reasons. First, the weight is very light, ideal for travel but I like a heavier brush. So it&#x27;s a personal preference. The second reason is that it loses hairs pretty easily. I know this will end after more use, but a brush should not lose more than a few a shave. In the early going, of this brush produced way too many in the sink. It seems to continuing losing them as I continue using it. So I might lose the brush, the badger may escape on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would these two detract from me recommending this? No way. In my humble opinion, this brush is exactly what I need for travel. It also is perfectly priced for my absentmindedness. It will be lost, and I won&#x27;t care. Unlike my primary, and very expensive brush, this one is cheap and priced nearly as if it was disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main point is that the brush works and is inexpensive. If it were my main brush, I&#x27;d would not enjoy shaving as much, but on the road it is perfectly acceptable, temporary solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> Never had one of these before. Decided to try this one. Nice product. Does the job. Good price given the competition.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this brush. He had been using a cheaper shave brush that we just purchased at the market. This one is much nicer quality, and my husband likes it.</li>
            <li> The difference between a badger hair brush and a boar hair brush is akin to comparing a Merkur and a Bic, there is just no comparison.  Twice around the soap bowl is all I need to make a nice full lather with plenty left over to go over my mouth and chin area twice.  I plan on buying another in case I can&#x27;t find them again if the first one ever wears out.</li>
            <li> For starters I think that for the price this brush can&#x27;t be beat! I have used a mug, brush, and, cheap soap for years on end .I always used cheap junk because I didn&#x27;t know better. Not any more... And you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get a decent brush to lather up! Escali 100% Pure Badger Brush is a great place to start assembling your kit. Treated good this brush may serve you for years!  Rinse, shake , air dry in an Escali  stand, . Shave on !</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as a gift for my husband who has been using brushes and shaving soap for about a year now. He really likes the badger brush and this was a great replacement for his old, worn out brush. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very prickly and the brushes keep falling out of the brush and get stuck to my face.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Terrible brush. Has absolutely no back bone and is too short.Even if you could work up a decent lather with it, it can&#x27;t hold the lather. I prefer my cheap boar hair brush to this.</li>
            <li> This badger brush is a great value for the money. The first 2-3 uses there&#x27;s a smell, which is expected of a badger brush and it sheds a bit but after that the smell goes away and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed anymore. Makes a good lather too. I greatly recommend this brush. The size is perfect too when it comes to handling.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and whips up a nice frothy lather. Shavin like Grandpa did and lovin it. A must have.</li>
            <li> A quality product that lathers well and is comfortable to hold. I use it for wet shaving and I would recommend this product to anyone doing the same.</li>
            <li> After you use it a few times, it starts to lose the wet animal smell. I just wanted to give a bit of assurance to new wet shavers. It&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush, feels so great on my face. A real treat to use!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> As described, works great</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect travel companion, fits nicely into my travel bag, holds it&#x27;s bristles, and gives me the same lather-up feeling as my more expensive brush that I use at home.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality with a simple clean wooden handle.  Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this is my first brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about six-weeks now day after day.  I really like this brush!  The brush holds a lot of water and allows me to create a water rich lather that really accentuates this wonderful new shaving experience I&#x27;ve been enjoying!!!  The only problem, aside from a few shed hairs here and there, is that I can only shave once a day.  It&#x27;s been a while since any experience has made me want to repeat it as quickly, and often as possible and this brush help&#x27;s make DE shaving that experience.  There will be others, but this is my first.</li>
            <li> I received the Escali brush in a timely manner. I know that probably sounds normal, but several of the other shaving items I ordered took MUCH longer to arrive and one of them was fraudulently advertised (see link at bottom), so it was nice to see delivery come as expected when expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works very well. Not too stiff, but not too soft either. It makes me wonder if I will ever need to spring for a silver tip brush because they might be too soft. The brush works up a good lather and there has been minimal shedding. In fact, after a couple of weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fraudulently advertised ad of which I spoke.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EYOLIL563XW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0027R4PTG&amp;channel&#x3D;detail-glance&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty</li>
            <li> The badger brush works as described.  It is a really great quality for the price.  I would certainly recommend this product to a friend.  The item was shipped right away.  I have used it several times so far and it creates a really nice lather.</li>
            <li> Well made, feels great on face, bought several as gifts, everyone happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but sheds a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Quality - 3/5&lt;br /&gt;Get&#x27;s the job done - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a cheap brush that gets the job done. You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is of high quality.  It creates a nice lather for shaving.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  My cat must have thought it was a real badger because he was afraid of it and swatted at it.  Funny!</li>
            <li> I am new to the classic safety razor and brush shave and didn&#x27;t want to invest a small fortune into something I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like or not.  Originally I started TOO cheap.      I started with a VHD boar bristle brush, VHD shaving soap, and a feather safety razor.  (VHD products are sold at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, etc...)  My first issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get a thick lather using the boar bristle brush and the VHD shaving soap.  Having done a &#x27;little&#x27; research beforehand, I assumed this was due to my brush method, so I stuck with it, to no avail.    My second thought was that the shaving soap I was using was poor.  Yet review after review stated that the VHD soap was indeed fine.  Far from the best, but not bad for the price.  I finally decided to try a budget badger brush which brought me to the Escali shaving brush.  It is like night and day compared to my previous VHD boar bristle shaving brush.  I have no problems getting a thick lather using the VHD soap.    I highly recommend this brush for anyone getting started with the classic shave or for an extra travel brush.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A little rough at first, this brush will get softer over time. Some stray hair will come out of the brush, but after about two weeks of use, I rarely see that anymore. A good solid beginning brush for those who want a close shave.</li>
            <li> Gets the soap to my face, lathers it up well, and is an essential part of my re-newed daily routine. Go for this good brush.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done but it sheds a bit. Dont know if that is normal for this kind of brush but just a heads up.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Brush has held up well after a month of daily shaving. Wooden handle is comfortable.  Would recommend.  Solid choice for the price.</li>
            <li> I just opened up the amazon box with the brush few hours ago and shaved with it once.  From such amazing reviews, I expected an amazing product.  Here is my experience:  - tiny brush  - very coarse, to the point of somewhat uncomfortable to my beard  - did not make a good lather  - I was constantly picking bristles off my lathered face (maybe 10 bristles or more fell off)  - the whole hair bundle broke off the hand when I was squeezing water of out of it to dry it.    That brush is about 4 HOURS old.  It performed horribly for these four hours and managed to break too!  I&#x27;m shocked.    Maybe I got a bad one because I doubt everyone reviewing it on amazon is mistaken... but that&#x27;s my experience.    I just ordered a Parker one.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago I decided I wanted to try using shave soap and a safety razor instead of my collection of Gillette products that just weren&#x27;t very fun to use. After looking around, I decided to try this brush and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it. It was affordable, so I wasn&#x27;t going to waste a lot of money if I decided I didn&#x27;t like this method of shaving. It picks up soap well and after the first couple days of breaking it in, it makes a very nice lather. The hairs are very soft but are still stiff enough to work the lather into your face. It&#x27;s like getting a face massage every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it loses hairs faster than higher-end brushes. It lost a fair number the first couple days (to be expected), and now it loses about 1 hair a day. I&#x27;m ok with that because I always viewed this as my entry-brush and I&#x27;m planning on getting myself a nicer brush when this one finally does wear out.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this brush a 5 is because it is the first shaving brush my husband has owned, so he has nothing to compare it to.  However, it had no smell when it arrived and he says it is working great.  He has been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> i think the title says it all. i&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
            <li> This is my first time going old school and using a shaving brush with a merkur razor. I&#x27;ve used it a little over a month and so far it has done its job and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Been a long time disposable razor user in the past.  Used this brush with my first safety razor with shaving soap.  Works pretty good when used as directed.  Not many bristles come off.  The safety razor shaves pretty well, but you have to be careful.  Badger brushes like this are known to create the lather quicker than other types of brushes, which is a plus when you&#x27;re using it regularly and can&#x27;t spend a long time making lather (such as when you have to get to work).  I typically do 20 circle swipes to get the soap on the brush, then it takes another minute of applying the brush to the beard to get an adequate lather.  There is usually enough for two passes when used this way.</li>
            <li> At this cheap price, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong, but if you&#x27;re looking for a quality brush spend an extra 10 or 20 dollars more for a better lather.</li>
            <li> The brush works well and is just like I remember them from the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; days!  I have been really frustrated with the modern razors and decided to go back to the basics; so far so good!</li>
            <li> Whenever I see a really bad review here or anywhere online I often wonder if the product is really that bad or if the reviewer is just someone who is never pleased with ANYTHING. Well; I have purchased dozens of things online over the years and, as far as I remember, this is the only item that I have ever returned. When attempting to shave with this brush many hairs fell out with each use, but most importantly, it smells horribly!!! I can&#x27;t even tell you what the smell is, but it is putrid. Having never owned a shaving brush before, I thought that perhaps the smell was normal for a new brush and would go away, but after talking with friends that shave with a badger brush they assured me that they had never noticed any smell in their own brushes. In short; the manufacturer of this item should be ashamed, and the retailer should fire their buyer who placed the purchase order. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews the brush did shed a bit when I first got it then stopped after a week, so this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal to me. The biggest problem is that after 2 months of use the bristles are so lose that using this brush is the equivalent of just spreading the cream with my hands. Wore down far faster than it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find a way to protect the brush it might last a few years as a travel brush in your luggage while on vacation...If you expect to get more use out of it than that you&#x27;re kidding yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and still looks new, even over a year after I purchased it. Kind of glad I didn&#x27;t opt for an expensive $50 brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a mid-price range. It seems to work well, and my my boyfriend seems to like it. It arrived the next day, which was amazing. Good quality, good value.</li>
            <li> It seems that every time i use this brush a lot of the bristles come out that clog my razor and stick to my face.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this brush, the quality was awful. After using for a couple of weeks the bristles are still falling out and go in my tub of shave cream, on my leg, everywhere. However I would be able to deal with constantly cleaning bristle hairs out of everything if it weren&#x27;t for the chipping on the handle. After only three days in my shower (NOT in direct contact with water) the plastic-y film that makes the wood smooth and shiny looking is chipping off. Besides now being rough to touch it looks absolutely awful and I no longer want to display it with my stand and razor. Something that is made to be in some kind of contact with water should be better protected! Absolutely terrible quality. Very disappointed since I ordered based on good reviews, I guess quality has gone downhill.</li>
            <li> I have been using a shaving brush for years but this is the first time I ordered from Escali. There is no comparison to the quality of this brush over any I have ever used in the past. I won&#x27;t ever use anything else again!!</li>
            <li> Its not fancy, it isnt the best, but it does the job.  There were a few hairs that shed with the first dozen uses but that seems to have ended at this point.  I havent had a long history with it yet, so I cant speak to its long term value.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I thought it may be a little too rough but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s perfect and I love how the brush dries when hung properly.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in the quality of your shave</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; exactly as described!  A gift for my son-in-law who was thrilled with it.  Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with other shaving items, for my boyfriend. He really enjoys it along with the stand I bought to hold the brush and razor, and now his face is extra smooth :)</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve since bought more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I purchased it because of the positive reviews and the prices. The brush did shed a few bristles at first but overall it has performed great.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. The bristles began to come off on the first use. Not sure that if that is supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected. I use this brush every morning and it has not disappointed! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. For the price, it&#x27;s great. I am losing hairs way more than I should. I know there is a break in period but it is ridiculous.  A break in period should lose maybe three hairs per shave. I am getting enough hairs on my face that I pick them off after I lather up. I could just have a lemon though. It happens.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  Not up to the standards of my Art of Shaving brush (which has more badger fur and feels more robust) but far better than my previous cheapo brush.  I&#x27;ll happily use it for travel.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this brush because it is thicker than other brands because of the generous bristles.  It holds it&#x27;s shape and doesn&#x27;t shed.  Really nice product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little brother for Christmas along with the rest of the wet shaving supplies. I&#x27;ve received reports from him that he loves it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price. Sheds a bit, but not too bad, less and less as I use it. It did take several washings to eliminate the badger smell, but beyond that, works great. Soooo much softer than a boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted to get away from spending much more on the throw-away razors and blades and shaving cream.  It just seemed like a waste of money.  Therefore I invested in a German razor, the Escali shaving brush, and a jar of sensitive shaving cream that lasts quite a bit longer than the canned foam.  I gave the brush five stars because it&#x27;s soft and spreads the shaving cream well.  The Escali shaving brush also keeps it&#x27;s shape, and of course it&#x27;s recommended to rinse it out and hang it up each shave so it drys thoroughly for the next shave.  I bought a stand to hold the razor and brush.  The brush then hangs upside down for maximum drying time.  I believe this product will last for years.  I also purchased a traveling case for the brush and razor.  I am very satisfied with each shave.  This is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, is very well made, bristles do not fall out or otherwise cause problems.  This brush really does the job whipping up foam and applying to beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush does what I need. I really like the fact I lose almost no bristles. It feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> I am not one to indulge the &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;S GREAT&amp;#34; reviews, because they don&#x27;t really give you a realistic expectation. This is the first badger hair brush I have used, and I like it so far. This combined with the soap I use have led to much less irritation when I shave which is a win in my book.</li>
            <li> Great beginner&#x27;s shave brush! Kind of a small handle but I&#x27;ve gotten used to. It shed some hairs for the first 2-3 weeks but no more than I would expect of any other brush. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good brush, great price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this shaving brush--great quality!</li>
            <li> looks good on my counter, however, bristles are too soft and shedding too much. Didn&#x27;t bother to return it...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent starter brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to change-up your shaving by introducing a brush and cream to your routine then for the dollar this brush will be hard to beat. As some have reported/reviewed there was a limited amount of shedding -- by no means enough for me to consider it a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mate this with some TOBS Sandalwood Shaving Cream and you&#x27;ll be convinced that your choice was a wise one.</li>
            <li> There is a knot in the hair of my brush that makes the center hollow instead of having hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Once you use a shaving brush with gel in the shower, you&#x27;ll never shave without it. I get a much closer and less irritating shave with the brush than without it. Brush is well constructed and has held up very well for over a year.</li>
            <li> Works like an average badger brush, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The glue that holds the brush hairs into the handle broke off mid stroke one morning and the brush had to go in the trash after only 2 months.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush, but perhaps at this price point I was hoping for too much. I have generally used a boars hair brush and decided to try a badger hair. I found this brush very prickly. I was pleased with the foam I could generate but unfortunately the odor from the brush was overpowering. Natural hair brushes can have some odor and I perhaps didn&#x27;t give it enough time, but the odor seemed to cover up the smell of the shaving soap which left my skin smelling like the brush rather than soap after shaving. It also made the bathroom smell</li>
            <li> Top quality brush! Pure badger hair is the only way to go to ensure a proper lather that gets into the beard.</li>
            <li> You really won&#x27;t find a better brush for the price. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m completely happy with it. You do need to keep in mind though, this is not a $100 handmade brush, so it&#x27;s not going to be amazing. Some could call it an excellent starter brush but I truly think if you are on a \\&quot;beer\\&quot; budget expect beer, not wine...In other words, it works. I lost a little bit of hair the first couple uses but that&#x27;s normal. Just make sure to wash it first (some use shampoo some use dish soap, either will work) and soak it overnight and you&#x27;ll have an awesome cheap brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has held up far better than I could have hoped for given the price. It also is comfortable, firm enough to massage in the cream but not so raspy as to irritate my face.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Makes good lather&lt;br /&gt;Does what it&#x27;s supposed to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Stinky for first couple of shaves&lt;br /&gt;Still loses a hair now and then after a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over All:&lt;br /&gt;Good first brush or travel brush for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Really well made. I had a lot of trouble with razor bumps and ingrown hairs. This brush paired with a safety razor made all of my bumps went away within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Nice bang for your buck brush.  Sheds a little at the beginning(few hairs) but settles down afterward with little shed.  Whips up lather nice and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shaving brush!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Beat the price, quality is excellent, shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Had it for about 3~4 weeks now. Only a couple of hairs have fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;The rest are holding on quite strong. As long as you follow the proper care procedures. I think this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Shaves are better and closer. I was using some el cheapo brush so I am happy to say this brush has changed my shaving experience each day. Be sure to dry brush per instructions. DO NOT STAND ON END.</li>
            <li> A really nice brush.  I use it every time I shave now!</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush and wooden handle that works up a great lather. For me, it&#x27;s the only way to get a great shave. It fits in a standard brush/single blade razor holder and looks great on my bathroom counter. Fast delivery too. I ordered two so I could take one on the road with me. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> - Sharp and prickly, regardless of how long it&#x27;s soaked in warm water&lt;br /&gt;- Loses 2-3 hairs each shave that ends up on my face or the razor</li>
            <li> I love it....quick fast and right on time</li>
            <li> This brush would rate higher but I have two problems with it.  First, it routinely sheds bristles onto my soap and face.  I&#x27;d hoped after a break-in period that it&#x27;d stop but the hairs keep coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the bristles separated from the handle.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is how it&#x27;s supposed to work but I just glued it back together and now it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be too disappointed about the performance for the price but if I had to do it again I&#x27;d definitely opt for the more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> I love the brush it is easy to use and the shave is second to non!! Buy with easy as you will be happy too.</li>
            <li> The brush does its job but is low quality. Every time I use it two or three of the hairs come out.</li>
            <li> For the price this is awesome. Little rough to start, but over the last year it has held up VERY nicely. Unless I was going to spend $100 on an Art of Shaving brush, I see no need for another one.</li>
            <li> This is prehaps an odd item for a woman to order, but I used to steal my grandfather&#x27;s when I ran out of shaving cream all the time.  I told my girls about it so I ordered this to show them.  It is very much like the one I remember. I am not sure if this will help anyone who is shopping for a shaving brush or not.  It did arrive very promptly and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> works OK, some of the hairs come out onto your face when you are spreading the shaving cream on your face.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush sure is nicer than the old cheap rough, stiff, brush I used the last few years. Nice &amp; soft, really feels nice on your face. Quality made.</li>
            <li> Nice quality shaving brush.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good Brush for the Money... Odor is small and goes away quickly..</li>
            <li> Excellent badger shaving brush, really soft and makes lots of smooth nice lather</li>
            <li> Gets better as it wears</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast service</li>
            <li> I like it, helps me make a good lather, but I feel that it is kind of soft</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. If it is your first badger brush, don&#x27;t be concerned on the first use if you get some shedding of bristles, it is normal to happen on the first couple of uses. After it gets broken in, this guy makes a sweet lather. I am using with Proraso cream, and it is a great shave.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot of hair and has a smell of a dead animal, other than that a great brush</li>
            <li> I used the brush (given to me by my family for birthday)&amp;#62; I enjoy using it with the cream when I have time for a slow shave. Most mornings I end up shaving in the shower with regular shaving cream and razor.</li>
            <li> This brush feels good and looks good.  I am very happy with it.  I would recommend this brush to someone starting out.</li>
            <li> First time for me using such a product.  I had researched it prior and found this to be the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and quality from the supplier was spot on.</li>
            <li> The Badger Brush is the absolute best!I bought the stand and the Merkur safety Razor to go with it. The stand is perfect its chrokme and and wood search shaving razor and brish stands you will find it. The Brush never frays is perfectl and drys well in this stand. The merkur ois also the ONLY razor to buy made in Germany its top of the line. The shaving soap I bought also oin Amazon is Proraso the combo of the awesome and quality Badger Brush , with stand Merkur Razor and extra blades with Proraso shave soap have made me a happy man a closer shave , no burn and I dont buy disposable razors now for over 2 months!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush..very smooth and soft feel. Great for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Not too happy with the bristles falling out and small bristles sticking out the side.  Can&#x27;t see much of a difference between this and a standard horse hair one I got for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Good quality. It is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a shaving brush. It&#x27;s pretty nice and does the job i need it to.  I actually have a much cheaper brush I got from Target that I like a little better.  All in all I&#x27;ll give this brush 4 stars.  It&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but also hasn&#x27;t changed my life.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father.  He has been looking for a legacy shaving kit for quite a while but has not been able to find one.  When I saw this, I had to buy it for him.  I am glad I did.  He loves it.... exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> Got this for my birthday from my lovely wife, who just got me into old-fashioned double edged safety razor shaving. The brush is incredibly soft and makes a fine lather (I use Taylor of Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream - Awesome stuff!) with only a small amount of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it a number of bristles seemed to come out, but that seems to have stopped. Overall very pleased with the brush, and my wife says the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works as designed.</li>
            <li> 4 stars for price/quality ratio. A great deal. Works well and is soft. Dislike the &amp;#34;escali&amp;#34; branding on it, would prefer it to be plain, and hairs do fall out here and there, but I am hoping this stops eventually, I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Kinda cool.  Bummed I didn&#x27;t do this sooner!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for shaving - used now for over month and very happy works great with all natural shaving soap</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use shaving soap, this is definitely the brush.  Holds the lather, and feels great going on.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described. The handle is quite comfortable while applying shaving cream. Using my hands to apply shaving cream seems like such a chore now.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with badger hair falling off. I recommend that the brush be washed with warm water and shaving soap prior to first use; most of the stray badger hairs will fall off this way. I shave about twice a week, and for the price this brush is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a beginner or veteran shaver. Works as it should. Sheds some lose hairs to start but that is the only complaint. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Why spend any more money on a much more expensive brush?  This one works.  Lathers up well. I bought it to replace another one for which I paid a lot more and used for years until it started shedding hairs.  This one works and feels better.</li>
            <li> Good quality shave brush. Nice feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Everything went very smoothly (pun 100% intended)!</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Just started shaving with the safety razor and bought this brush based on reviews and price. It&#x27;s a great brush and is very well made. Is comfortable in your hand and lathers up nicely.  Looks like it is going to last a very long time. I should have bought this sooner. Don&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use for shaving. I&#x27;ve had it for several months and have seen very little hair loss. I just shake it dry and hang from a stand with the bristles down. Feels good on my face. Makes a nice lather. No problems.  Update Mar 2017: I came to purchase one of these for my teenage son and noticed that I bought mine all the way back in 2013. I still love this brush. I had expected to replace my brush once a year, but it turns out, when cared for properly, it lasts for an extremely long time.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as entry brushes for a few friends looking to get into higher quality shaving. The brushes work well and appear as though they will hold up with proper care. The only issue that I have is that most brushes come with a brush stand that is used for drying. This would be a great improvement on the product. I would have easily been willing to pay more per brush for a stand to be included with it.  The current situation had me purchasing extra stands.  It&#x27;s not a huge price or a big deal. It would just be nice.  Still a very good entry level product to see if you really want to start investing into straight razor or safety razor shaving without beginning with a huge investment.</li>
            <li> My son is new to the shave brush and loves the feel of the brush on his face.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and yes a few bristles will be lost but that&#x27;s normal. Had mine for months and it&#x27;s still working great RARELY losing them.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush that give a consistent lather every time.  It feels great on my face and it works just as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used othe brushes and this one is finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for. The lather is outstanding. I just dip the brush in water for a second and then start to swirl my shaving soap bar then...whoosh! Real lather! I recommend this highly. The cheap brushes don&#x27;t perform like this.</li>
            <li> I got a boars hair brush but the badger hair brush works a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed having the brush and it works OK. However, it sheds 4-5 bristles each time I use it and those end up on my face, a little frustrating. But I guess for what you pay, it is an OK value.</li>
            <li> No comparison for Van Der Hagen brush.</li>
            <li> Great product very pleased.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. You can easily spend 2-5 times as much on a brush, but this one will work just as well. It&#x27;s badger hair (the top of the line in shaving brush material. I&#x27;m told), and it&#x27;s soft on the face. Lathers nicely. Yes, I have lost a few hairs the first couple times. Don&#x27;t worry, it happens. The rest will stay put.</li>
            <li> Nice brush!  Smelled a little badger-y but after a few uses it was all good.  Good quality and will last if its not abused, I believe.</li>
            <li> Excellent basic shaving brush.  Well made from quality materials.</li>
            <li> Seem fine first time purchasing a shave brush. A musty animal smell for a few shaves/washes of the brush, but doesn&#x27;t linger after use whatsoever. I expected and compared to others I&#x27;ve tried using before, the bristles seem not to be as firm as the higher dollar ones, but for $12 or so, its a good way to try out the brush/shaving soap method.</li>
            <li> I used this brush about four weeks. The form of the brush is classical. The hairs stay put .I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of shaving in the &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li> Zounds what a brush.  Shaving is a pleasure with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and for the price is great holds moisture great and soft for applying lather to face and it&#x27;s a great size not small at all</li>
            <li> This brush has been great and has worked as advertised. Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> My first experience with brush shaving....really enjoyable.  Item got here fast and intact.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I have used it for a few weeks, the brush is very soft, it forms a lovely lather of shaving cream, and exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight smell of wet dog when I first got it but that was expected from a brush made of Badger hair. The smell went away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> good brush for the price</li>
            <li> Does the jobs. Sheds a lot, but then again, you get what you pay for. Its a great starter brush, but will definitely invest more on a future brush.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  No loose hair.  Love useing it when I shave.</li>
            <li> Sounded counter intuitive to me at first, but badger hair is perfect for this application.  I even bought a second one for my son.  Good brush, good hair.</li>
            <li> Being new to the whole wet shave thing, I bought this brush off of a recommendation from a friend.  So far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  A good brush is the start of a good shave, and this one is definitely worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The Shaving brush is really comfortable and feels nice when you work up the lather. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a decent badger brush in a reasonable price range. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I used to use when I began shaving 50 years ago.  Love the feel of a brush and the ability to re-wet my face with it.</li>
            <li> Not too bad, but can&#x27;t compete even a little with silvertip brushes.  The price is right if you aren&#x27;t into a super awesome shave</li>
            <li> i have used the shaving brush for about a month. it has worked wonderfully. i would recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rjm</li>
            <li> Shed a whole month for me. But great otherwise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had my brush for 2 years and it still performs as it did out of the box. Haven&#x27;t lost many bristle after daily use and nothing shows signs of wearing. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this brush. Keep in mind I&#x27;ve done a good job of storing mine upside-down to dry...you&#x27;ll want to do the same if you plan on keeping a brush for some time.</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush I&#x27;v ever had. Been shaving for 60 years; so few qualified to say this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking Badger brush, and does a good job.  My only concern is the durability.  It loses a hair or two about every time I use it and I know that some day soon I will need a new one.  I bet it will last less than 2 years.  Other than that it is a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the brush stand (Escali) to help extend its life, and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush and it works great -  Holds up well and does not shed - been using it for about 6-weeks or so and no complaints.  I hang it upside down after every use on the stand and use it with the shave soap and looks like it was made to last.</li>
            <li> Really quality badger brush, soft and supple, durable build, makes for a lovely lather. Would recommend for any wet-shavers - double edged or straight.</li>
            <li> Prefer it so much more than those synthetic bristles brushes. Out of the packet you&#x27;ll get a very distinct smell but it disappears after you use it for about a week. Soap foams up well and the bristles don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and wanted a good brush that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. After reading reviews I decided to purchase this brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It took a few shaves to break it in and soften the bristles, but since then it has been very soft and produced great lather.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is listed on Reddits r/TheWickedEdge not recommended list. I purchased this brush not really knowing anything because it was inexpensive. It does work, but sheds like a husky and is very rough on the face. I have since upgraded to another brush in the ~$30 range and it is a huge difference in feel. This brush will do the job just fine, I have shaved with it plenty of time, but there is not much joy in using it and my shave cream is covered in hairs that have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Works better than any brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This brush had a bit of a break-in period for me...&lt;br /&gt;The first few uses, it lost a hefty amount of hairs (now it might lose one or two hairs a week).&lt;br /&gt;The badger-ish aroma was strong, but after several uses, it&#x27;s faded away completely on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;And it took a solid week of shaving to soften up the bristles enough to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;But now, it works well, does it&#x27;s job, lathers well once I got used to its characteristics, and does the job well. The price point makes this 4-star worthy; If it cost any more, the star level would go down a notch or two. But for what it is, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Great and comfortable except some of the hairs fall out after some use.  Would definitely recommend it considering the price</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it. I just starting using shaving cream and I was not impressed, but using the Escali shaving brush has made me a convert.</li>
            <li> Good inexpensive brush. Holds lather well.&lt;br /&gt;Some bristles come out on occasion but what brush doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this brush again</li>
            <li> This shaving brush does have an odor the first few times you use it but it goes away completely after a few uses. It has an easy grip handle and it very soft to the touch. The bristles have remained in place as I have not lost any of them. Just remember to rinse well and let it dry by hanging it up in a stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, soft brush, feels nice, I&#x27;m unsure how we&#x27;ll it will hold up over time though. Many times the bristles in small brushes like this seem to just fall off. I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor but it seems to be nice quality and works fine for lathering.  It sheds a lot at first but that goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It sheds a little as I suspect any brush does. Other than that, it easily lays down a nice layer of cream. I have no major complaints and I would purchase it again if I needed another.</li>
            <li> After using this brush for a very short while I knew I&#x27;d be upgrading soon.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, you have to start somewhere and if you&#x27;re not 100% on what you need you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of cash on your first brush. This brush works and will get you lathered up just fine. It sheds and is light, but is fairly soft as well. I don&#x27;t see a need for a $100 brush, but I&#x27;ll be making the move to a Simpson very soon. After using this brush I have a much better idea on ideal handle and knot size that I prefer. It&#x27;s not a waste of money, but I don&#x27;t think people that purchase this brush will stop here. Boar brushes are another option and are less expensive than badger. A good boar brush will be better than a cheap badger brush and cost may be similar...&lt;br /&gt;Check out badgerandblade.com if you&#x27;re serious about shaving or just have questions.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction! Awesome product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> skip the pricier brushes; this brush is perfect; lathers up easily, gets the lather where it needs to go, feels great in the hand, and dries quickly; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price, the brush is quite good. I&#x27;ll admit this is my first shaving brush so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 5-6 weeks now and it works perfectly fine. It&#x27;s fairly soft, lathers well, is easy to grip, and, well, that&#x27;s what a shaving brush should do. Perfectly happy with it. I did buy a stand with it, as these brushes need to be kept horizontal or upside down after shaving, to dry properly (I bought [[ASIN:B0098NPUGY Chrome Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was delivered swiftly, and as promised, so no issues there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving brush. Not much to it. It works great. Some people have commented that their bristles are coming out or that the hairs are too abrasive. I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had a problem with either.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush and I could not be happier. I took off one star because the second one is a little coarser.</li>
            <li> This Escali brush is worth every penny. I highly recommend this Pure Badger Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a similar brush from another company a year ago and within 2 weeks the wooden handle started peeling off layers of lacquer.&lt;br /&gt;My Escali hasn&#x27;t had issues of lacquer peeling and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now. It&#x27;s a great Badger Brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 1 month. No issues with it so far. The brush was just as described.</li>
            <li> happy with this brush .it works well</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve purchased and it was well worth it. It did smell a little funny at first but after using it a couple of times it seems to have faded away. Plus since my shaving cream has a scent, I could never smell the brush while using it anyways. I&#x27;ve had a few hairs fall out but nothing to be concerned about. For the price of this brush you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have a pretty thick beard and once I started using this brush I&#x27;ve gotten a much closer, comfortable shave than ever before. No more razor burn or ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about a month.  Badger fur is a fiber that stays stiff while wet (no dirty jokes intended).  It helps get a good lather and lift the hairs prior to shaving.  I notice that I get less ingrown hairs and a smoother closer shave.  At this price, it&#x27;s a no brainer.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Enoy it every morning</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to handle and hangs well on the rack I have for it and my razor.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good priced quality shaving brush I came across this Escali Badger. When I bought it I wasn&#x27;t sure what level of quality I would get at this price, but when I first used it I was impress. It works up a nice smooth lather, holds a lot of moisture and with continued use feels delightful on the face. It has been some minimal shedding, as I expected. Just a word of advise, always let the brush dry upside down on a stand or at the very least on it&#x27;s side to prevent the brush for falling apart. I am pleased with this purchase. Excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> Started shedding just after 4 uses. Low quality brush. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up to old school shaving.  Every now and then you may lose 1 bristle on the brush...no big deal though.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new shaving brush for a little over a week now and it works as intended.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. I&#x27;ve had mine about six months now.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with it so its very good</li>
            <li> Badger hair brushes are great for newbies to double edge shaving. They are far softer than boar hair and so they&#x27;re great for working lather up on your face when you are still learning the ropes of this art. I like this brush because it won&#x27;t break the bank, seems to holds its bristles well, had a standard sized handle and is very soft. This is a great starter brush, or if you find yourself fully satisfied after learning how to double edge shave, it&#x27;s a good long term brush too.</li>
            <li> Great starter badger brush. In comparison to other brushes its much cheaper and gets the job done. The brush sheds a little bit here in there in the first week but nothing to warrant spending twice the price on another.</li>
            <li> Most shaving brushes either lose hair or disintegrate after a few months of use. These brushes are the best gift for any man or woman who want an organic shaving experience. The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> May be is a good choice for start, but if you want go to next level, maybe choice another one.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Really really excellent brush - very much impressed with the quality and how the badger hairs are able to hold water to provide a rich lather for shaving.  Happy with the purchase and and very happy with the value!</li>
            <li> worked amazingly well</li>
            <li> Love the smell of fresh Badger on my face in the morning. LOL.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and works great! Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> great brush, slight smell, but expected with animal hair brush.  Works perfect. Lather is great and rich.  Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Good brush for a good price.  It&#x27;s probably not the fanciest one you could buy but it gets the job done for a decent price.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little over a year now and it&#x27;s still working fine!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for about two weeks now ( I shave everyday). It takes about a week to soften, till then it sheds hair. Second week, it softer, creates more lather, sheds less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to see, if it will stop shedding hair... only time will tell</li>
            <li> Works great. Great price.</li>
            <li> New to the world of wet shaving, this was the brush i bought, and a smart choice it was. All i wanted&lt;br /&gt;was a sturdy and dependable brush and that&#x27;s exactly what this is. I use it primarily with Taylor of Old&lt;br /&gt;Bond Street shaving cream. Expect it to be a bit stiff at first, at least for the beginning 5 or 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;After that the badger hair softens a bit and you can feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect some shedding at first, it&#x27;s normal. I have not as of yet purchased a stand in which to let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;i just get the excess water out and lay it on it&#x27;s side,no problems with that so far. Be sure to grab the base&lt;br /&gt;of the hair and not the handle of the brush as you flick it. I&#x27;ve notice the brush has achieved a nice thick blossom&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving quite a bit now. Sure, it&#x27;s not as expensive as other brushes but i have no doubt it can hold it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;own with any other brushes with their fancy bells and whistles. A great buy for beginners. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to buy another one for my traveling kit.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It arrived quickly too, which I appreciated :)</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Dad said he likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving brush. It is a nice texture for the skin. No problems with receiving or packaging.</li>
            <li> First noticed it has a funky smell when applying C.O. Bigelow shave cream.  It isn&#x27;t the cream, I&#x27;ve applied it by hand and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;It does do a great job lathering the cream on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But and this it the reason for the low rating, it sheds tons on of bristles on the cream on my face, I had to go pick them off.  It sheds even more when you rinse it and give it a light shake to get the water out.  There were 40+ bristles in the sink and just as many hanging out of the brush.  I am not sure if this is a one time thing, but it must be 10% of the hairs out of the brush after just one use.  Might be a defective brush or just a really crappy product. But not worth driving to the shipping store to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!  Do not by this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I wanted to try out wet shaving, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to see if it was something I wanted to do long term or not.  I used it for every shave for about a 8 month period, and it served me well.  After 8 months or so, it started to shed bristles pretty regularly, and I just decided to upgrade to a nicer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try out using a bush and wet shaving, but don&#x27;t want to drop a few hundred bucks on all of the nicest gear, this is a great brush for you to get stated with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a fine brush to pass down to your kids...and you think you can get it at this price point... you probably shouldn&#x27;t be having kids.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did just what I needed it to do, and I feel like I got my $&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Great little brush they got here. I have had it for 3 months now, using it every day and from the getgo i haven&#x27;t seen many bristles falling out at all. One word of caution though, the entire brush head did fall off though. It was still all glued together, but it popped out of the body. I did a quick fix by throwing some epoxy on it and sticking it back it so it didnt bother me at all. Still working great. For the price I would absolutely recommend it. Gets a great lather going for me.</li>
            <li> I have been to specialty sites and found that most decent brushes start in the $45 range and go on up to the mid-200&#x27;s! That&#x27;s more than you will spend on a fine razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an el cheapo kit from the grocery store months ago that had soap, a soap dish and a brush for about $8. It seemed like a good buy at the time, and was. The brush broke and so it was time to buy anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not getting a brush for Christmas, I ordered this due SOLELY on the reviews. 1300 reviews can&#x27;t be wrong. It came in and I used it with some Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Soap (try it if you haven&#x27;t) and I got to feel what quality in a shave brush feels like. I am nicely impressed, and have no regrets springing for this brush!</li>
            <li> I like this brush but I noticed especially when I started using it that some of the bristles came off on my face as I was applying soap. It seems to be fine now after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> For the price I have no complaints. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars was because it lost quite a few bristles the first few uses. It still has plenty left but it made my soap look kind of gross. Also I have used softer brushes. But honestly for the price of this thing it is great. It would make an excellent travel brush but I use it as my primary for now.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband&#x27;s birthday because he wanted to try shaving the old-fashioned way. This brush works great. Just what was needed.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great brush. Yes it has a weird odor at first but it disappeared after 2 or 3 uses. And yes several hairs fell out my first couple shaves, but I am sure that happens with most brushes. There are so many other hairs in this brush it did not make any kind of difference. Bristles soften up after use and feels really nice on my mug. Good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, now. It works great. It creates a nice, rich lather and exfoliates the skin well. It seems to be holding up just fine. I&#x27;ve got nothing to compare it to and bought it based on reviews for starter brushes. Definitely a good one to start with. After some time and some comparisons it might be a good one to keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> Though slightly smaller than an average brush the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush does an excellent job. Whether you are looking for your first badger or just adding to your collection I would recommend this brush, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The brush sheds hair and prior to the first use the wood knob disconnected from the hair.  I utilized 5 minute epoxy to join the two back together, but a new product should require such measures.  Spend a bit extra a get a quality brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty well. There is nothing fancy about it. It sheds a couple of bristles each time I use it. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush. It is soft, distributes soap well, and has shed only a few hairs in the month that I&#x27;ve had it. I have not noticed any adverse odors from the hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with the value of this purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to commit to a more expensive option.</li>
            <li> I just got into the wet shaving world (using a DE shaver on my legs has been an interesting transition). This brush gets soft over time and it&#x27;s easy to charge / load with soap and holds a decent amount. Builds a good lather pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is stout and fairly easy to hold even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I order this item 2 times. The first one was fine. The 2nd brush was all deformed and missing bristles in the center of the brush. Basically it was completely useless so I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first brush with my first safety razor and have had no issues with it. It loses a few hairs every shave but I think that is to be expected. It feels good on your skin and makes a nice lather. For the price it&#x27;s a good start!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years using an electric or whatever the latest craze was.Now I&#x27;m going old school and I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Got a couple of razors ,soap and the brush I chose was the Escali pure badger shaving brush.I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.It&#x27;s very soft feels great on my face and the price was right.Lost very few hairs the first couple of times I used it none since.I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a couple of months now, It works great and doesn&#x27;t lose bristles .</li>
            <li> I intend on using this brush when I am travelling.  I tried it out when I received it and it exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wish the density of the brush was higher.  When working with the badger brush, it tends to flatten and give very, very easily.  The only resolution I had that&#x27;s motivating me to keep it is to tie a rubber band 2-3 times around the base of the brush hair to help the badger hair be more stiff and easier to work with to create an easy lather.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in the wet shave world so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. I found this brush on here and it has been great. I have used it for 3 months now with no complaints. Don&#x27;t freak out if you lose some hairs early on, its normal.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this brush, it gets the job done and looks nice hanging on my shaving rack. The only complaint I have is that my cat likes to steal it and take it around the house with her. So every time I need to shave I have to go look for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 6+ months, it works good to get up a lather and apply to face.  My only complaint is that every time I use it I end up with a bristle or two on my face or in my shaving cream, which has been happening consistently since purchased.  That said, I do not notice the brush being any less full or useful, just a bit disconcerting that it keeps losing bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job and is very soft.  I use it with Proraso shaving soap and it does a great job.  When I first used it, it lost several of the hairs.  The second time just a few and since it has lost none, despite daily use.  It cleans easily and dries quickly once the excess water is removed.</li>
            <li> this brush was the best thing I got in the order. I would recommend  it every time  soft and plush</li>
            <li> There were a few loose bristles the first time I used it but other than that its been great. Lathers nicely and feels good</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the price. Didn&#x27;t have an odor that I expected from a natural brush. Dries quickly and retains its shape. 4 stars because it loses more bristles than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I would bet dollars to donuts that the people giving this brush good reviews simply have not experienced better brushes.  This brush is just awful.  It&#x27;s not soft, it&#x27;s actually quite prickly and does not soften after being broken in.  A good badger hair brush (even pure badger which is the lowest grade badger hair brush)  should soften significantly after 10-20 shaves.  This brush is just as prickly after 50 shaves as it was on day one.  It sheds an unacceptable amount.  A good badger hair brush should lose approximately 5-10 hairs in the first 5 shaves and then only the occasional errant hair every once in a while.  This brush sheds 5-10 hairs per shave.  Do not trust reviews from people who don&#x27;t know better.  For the same price, get a boar hair brush from Omega or Semogue.  If you&#x27;re dead set on a badger hair brush you&#x27;ll need to spend more money to get a quality product.</li>
            <li> The brush came on time and it works well.  It&#x27;s my first time shaving with a brush, so I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it. But this seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> You can spend $75 on a brush with a fantastic handle and hairs that never come out, or you can buy this one for less than 1/5th of the price, and get the same value for less money...which increases its value....technically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush lost a some hairs during the first two weeks of shaving.  Since then, none have come out, and I have used the brush several more times.  It works well for anyone how wet shaves, and wants to decrease razor burn by preparing your skin for a blade to slide on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really more of a $25-30 brush at less than half the price...and the reason I shop on Amazon.  Items like this are simply hard or impossible to find in my hometown.</li>
            <li> Good product I recommend it to evryone who shaves. Holds moister and a very good price for this product .</li>
            <li> Great brush, once you get it broken in.  At first, it looses a good bit of hairs, which is really to be expected.  But compared to the cheaper brush I had before this one, there is no comparison.  The cheap price of it is what puts it above the other options out there on Amazon.  Also, its probably a good idea to soak it for some time in very hot water to break it in and soften the bristles up as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Brush...my husband loves it!!</li>
            <li> This brush is so cheap, I dare not put it to my face.  It&#x27;s just sitting in the cabinet now.  Smells like gas, and I can&#x27;t get the smell out even after soaking it in soap, water, and even rubbing alcohol. Don&#x27;t buy this cheap brush if you&#x27;re serious about your shave.</li>
            <li> A decent starter brush. You could do much worse, you could do much better. But for a middle of the road brush, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Its a good looking shaving Brush, no problems with the ordering and delivery of the item, but sorry to say I am very disappointed in the Brush, the bristles stick together when soap is applied and does not make good latter. after use I have to use a comb to untangle the bristles and make sure all soap is removed, I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I recently read a short book on ways to improve the shaving experience and comfort.  The book repeatedly suggested using a badger hair shaving brush (no other hair was suggested) as being superior to using the fingers.  The bristles are soft and hold a lot of water, warming the shaving cream or gel, and softening the beard. This badger brush was very reasonably priced compared to others and I am absolutely delighted with the results.  Haven&#x27;t nicked myself once in three weeks !!  And no razor burn if I apply a good after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - buy this one!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush, and have had this for about 6 weeks so far and love it!  I&#x27;m using it with shaving cream (from Bath &amp; Body Works) instead of shaving soap, but I am using much less of the cream with this brush, plus i feel like i&#x27;m getting a better shave.  I think I may have lost 6 bristles - most of them the first time i used it, but not 1 since.  Can&#x27;t beat this for the price.  Similar brushes in speciality stores go for $40-$60!</li>
            <li> Easy ordering and fast shipping... What&#x27;s better? The product itself. It will change the tedious task of shaving on a daily basis to something you look forward to everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it looses bristles often. Maybe that will stop over time but it is annoying. It is a 100% badger brush and that&#x27;s what I read I should buy. Hopefully it will be a long lasting worthwhile brush.</li>
            <li> everything as represented.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very good quality brush and my first.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very rough with it but a bristle falls off about every other shave so far, but not a big deal and I expect that it would stop soon.  The overall feel is good after I learned that I have to apply at an angle an not perpendicular to my face as it is a little bit prickly that way.</li>
            <li> good quality  delightful gift</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality product. I recommend it. I bougth this product three weeks ago and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ruin your face with synthetic brushes, this is the real deal right here! Cheaper than art of shaving too!&lt;br /&gt;There will be a few hairs that fall out the first couple of times, and I suggest letting it soak in hot water for a few minutes when you first get it. The wet badger smell goes away pretty quick after a few good rinses and soaks.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger hair brush for wet shaving with a double edged safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to. It&#x27;s a very nice brush though, and the bristles do well at both holding soap and applying it. The bristles are perfectly stiff, while still soft enough (at least for me, I&#x27;ve noticed others complain about it being too stiff, but I like the stiffness as it helps to liften facial hairs more). It seemed to lose a few bristles in the beginning, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any substantial loss since. For the price, this seems like a great product, and is definitely a good introduction for wet shaving. For any looking to get into it, I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> had it for almost 3 months and i really love this thing. Dont know if shaving would be as fun without it. It has lost some of the hairs but it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Okay guys I hate to write reviews, but I do love this really soft brush and thought well this time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and like the feel of it. Creates a good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and got this brush because it was an inexpensive option to get started.  So far, it is working great and I find it much more comfortable than a cartridge shave.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive, quality brush.  This one meets both of those requirements.  It is compact, but lathers very well.  It seems well constructed.  You expect a few bristles to fall out of a new brush, and this has lost a few, but in line with what I expect.  As had been stated many times, here and elsewhere, if you want the brush to last, hang it bristles down, on a stand.  The is a very good brush and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and can recommend it.  So satisfied in fact that I bought a second one to use at a cabin I have.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband for Christmas to replace his 30-year-old brush.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the old brush, but he says the denser bristles coat the shaving soap better on his face for a smoother shave.  He&#x27;s very happy.  So am I.  Has a distinctive animal smell that I assume is badger and I expect will fade with time.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very happy with purchase. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> This is by no means the perfect badger hair brush, but as an entry-level improvement to a boar bristle brush, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. For nearly the same price as a boar brush, you get a much improved shaving experience. My only issue is that the brush did shed several of its bristles on the first shave, and continues to lose an average of one or two per shave a couple of weeks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic buy for the price (something like 12 bucks when I purchased it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cheap little brush for a couple years now, and I dig it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the softest brush out there, but with a few uses there&#x27;s definitely some breaking-in that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is good, and the loss of bristles has been very slow, only notice 1-2 every week or so (some others have had better, and others worse experiences in that regard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat it for a sub-$20 brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is a huge difference from the one that came in my kit from a local store.  This one is so much softer and lathers better on my face.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> My fiance gave me a Merkur DE razor for Christmas so I hopped on Amazon and did a ton of research to find an affordable brush to get me started.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brush and would recommend it to anyone.  I highly recommend getting a stand to hold your razor and to hold the brush so it dries properly.</li>
            <li> Quality product, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Great brush for an even better price.</li>
            <li> Brush creates a fantastic lather, much better than doing it with your hands. Also has a nice weighted feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great choice in this pice range!</li>
            <li> A soft, well-made brush that whips up a nice lather. I had already switched from the old aerosol can to a a pump bottle cream and this is much better than applying it with my fingertips. I am sure it would work as well with the old fashion soap-in-a-can type.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my Poraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The brush was not fastened to the handle properly. I went to use it and the brush fell off with shaving cream all over. This brush needs to be secured to the base of the handle so it does not fall off.</li>
            <li> Garbage. It gets all over the place and absorbs too much water. It&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> Great brush with minimal fall off. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this. No need to spend the big $$$ for a good performing shave brush. Great value.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is a great size, and creates/holds a good amount of lather. It is easy to clean too and it is an excellent price for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The store had a very fast turnaround in shipping, and I received it sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> Some discolouration comes out of the brush</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than a year. I really like this brush, it is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing on your face, and does a really good job at making a nice lather! I&#x27;ve noticed about 1-2 stray hairs each time after using it, so I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s just some loose hairs that didn&#x27;t make it onto the brush.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality.  The brush looses it&#x27;s shape quickly.</li>
            <li> Initially the brush was a little stiff which I didn&#x27;t mind since it since it seemed to exfoliate the skin.  After a few months the bristles did soften but personally i liked them stiffer. The brush is inexpensive and so don&#x27;t expect the greatest durability.  The finish after a year has chipped on part of the handle and now the bristles all over my beard when I apply the shaving cream.  For the price it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how much of a difference there was between my boar bristle and a badger brush with out spending a lot of money. HUGE difference. I am not going back to my boar bristle. Soft out of the box, I used some shampoo with conditioner to soften it even more before first use. Held water like a champ and did a good lather in the bowl and on my face. I have pulled a few bristles out of the soap and off my face, but I chalk it up that it&#x27;s a $10 brush, not one of the 25-40 dollar ones. I&#x27;m happy with it. Hopefully, i will get a more sturdy made one, but this will do just fine. Shiny.</li>
            <li> This brush loses so much hair with every use. Save the money and invest in something better.</li>
            <li> First time using a brush and am very pleased with the way it sets up my beard for the razor.</li>
            <li> I think I know why there are mixed reviews about the smell. When I bought this, I was using Col.Conk Bay Rum soap, which has a very mild scent. The smell from the brush faded over the first few uses, but remained strong. I&#x27;d heard good things about Proraso, so I tried it. Proraso has a much stronger smell. Almost immediately, all aroma was gone from the brush. If you&#x27;re going to use a mild soap, consider a different brush. If you&#x27;re using something stronger, this brush will be good. Now that my brush is getting old, the finish is starting separate.</li>
            <li> it was everything I had hoped in providing me with a great shave</li>
            <li> I got standard shipping, but received the product within two days. It has held up extremely well compared to the previous brush that I purchased from a local shop. Going on more than a month a haven&#x27;t lost any of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the softness of the bristles, but it flattens when up use it. I&#x27;m not sure if it is my technique or what, but I end up having to use it like a paint brush. I didn&#x27;t have this issue with my old boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I need one that has a fuller knot?</li>
            <li> Nice and soft. I really like the wooden handle. Works great!</li>
            <li> Had been shaving for awhile without using a shaving brush so i decided to try this out and all i can say this has improved my lathering alot and get a better shave then previous times. I like this item.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a safety raiser, soap dish, and brush.  I&#x27;ve had the brush 2 months and I have no complaints.  I enjoy the aesthetics much more of shaving this way.  Also, previously I used my hands to lather aerosal foam, and with this brush my hands don&#x27;t get wet.  This keeps the sink are a bit cleaner.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, and shipping was fast and efficient!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush while deployed and it got here before the earliest estimated arrival date. So far it has stood up to the abuse of my daily shaving and not being able to care for it as well as I should. The brush is exactly what was described in the ad and works like a charm. It&#x27;s extremely soft but will lather up beautifully. I highly recommend this brush!  UPDATE: Its not on year 2 and still going strong. It gets softer every use, and has stood up great to my daily use and irregular care. Best brush for the money.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out on my first brush so I gave it a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;, after writing a negative review on here, the company called me and offered a replacement. Within a few days, a 5 star brush showed up at the door. I&#x27;ve give this brush an average of 4.</li>
            <li> A very good brush to use and a great value.</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter brush if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving. The brush is a bit harsh compared to other (albeit more expensive) options out there.  But, if you&#x27;re just getting started this isn&#x27;t a terrible place to start.</li>
            <li> I waited a year to post this review. It still makes great lather one year later and hasn&#x27;t lost a lot of hair. That&#x27;s all that count. As for all the shaving elitists that say that say that you need a $50 brush they can just suck it.</li>
            <li> use it every day thanks for a well made brush</li>
            <li> This is my first time using one of these.  It works great.  I have no doubt that thus us genuine badger fir.  The slight smell gives it away.  I had a couple if ferrets growing up and the smell reminds me of them.  The smell isn&#x27;t very strong.  Also, it looks great next to my other shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased.  I have used it for a few weeks and it looses some bristles; nothing major.  Great delivery and service from seller.</li>
            <li> Use it often, love the product. This product is also a good price.</li>
            <li> My bristles have started falling out after less than 6 months of use.  I suppose this is an instance of getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is normal, but the brush does shed a hair or 2 every time I mix up the lather.  The first day I lost quite a few, but now the loss is tolerable.  I wonder if the brush is going to wear down over time, but thats fine as the price is crazy lower than others, and Im not sure that they wouldnt do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love a creamy product from Real Shave and wanted to apply it with something other than rubbing my hads together.  This works just as I was expecting and it has reduced the amount of shave cream needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. No issue with rough bristles or any falling out. This shaving brush compares favorably to the more expensive ones we have ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about this brush. Badger hair is the gold standard for shaving brushes and the wood is of fantastic quality. If you need a shaving brush, there should be nothing stopping you here!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before, so I have no frame of reference, but it is doing a nice job as far as I can tell. Bristles hold a good amount of shave soap, and the handle is a good size and shape</li>
            <li> love this thing. I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor and needed a good shave brush. this was it. it doesn&#x27;t have the animal smell like people complain about. just remember to let your Escali brush soak in a cup of hot water for a few minutes before you shave. it softens up the hairs and really holds a lot of water. again, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately every time I use the brush I get the bristles all in my face and the shaving cream. It is a horrible product, I have no idea how it has such high reviews.  maybe i got a defective product?</li>
            <li> If your going to face later with this......it will  pinch and be scratchy...if you bowl lather, apply fast and with light pressure...got brushed burned with face lathering :(</li>
            <li> I used this brush for over a year, and it did a great job. It was the first brush I ever used, and i absolutely loved it. At first, several of the bristles come out, but that is to be expected. It held up for over a year, but I switched over to The Art of Shaving Pure Tip Badger brush and it is pretty similar to this, just a tad bit softer. I recommend this for anyone who is new to using a Shaving Brush.</li>
            <li> all that you would expect of a quality badger hair brush</li>
            <li> Nice item. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am starting to shave with brush and safety razor again after 40 years with canned foam and cartridge razors.  I bought the Escali brush mainly because it looked nice and the price was right.  When I first saw it, I thought it looked too small but after a week using it, I found it fits my hand just fine and the bristles have expanded and rounded out nicely.  It holds foam, and with a light touch makes a great lather on the face.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better re-introduction to an artful form of shaving.</li>
            <li> Great job!!! Ordered on Tuesday night, received it on friday!! Feels great and looks like a quality brush!!  Update: I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s starting to shed....  go ahead and get a quality brand name brush....</li>
            <li> I got this brush several weeks ago and was anxious to try it. The first thing I noticed was how short the handle is...not that easy to use for me. Initially it didn&#x27;t shed any of its bristles but that was short lived...it&#x27;s still shedding.  I read several reviews before buying, which for the most part were positive.  Had I known about these things, I would not have gotten it.  I would not recommend this one to anyone looking for a brush.</li>
            <li> Great, soft brush, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Great price and works fantastically.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft brush, however it sheds pretty badly. I enjoy it&#x27;s softness on my face, but I question how long it will actually last due to the shedding.</li>
            <li> I have used this every shave and it is great. I&#x27;m only 2 weeks in so I cannot attest to durability, but so far I have noticed minimal loss after a dozen or so shaves. Overall a fantastic buy - fast shipping, exactly as advertised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely, no problems. Haven&#x27;t begun using it yet, but feels like a quality brush for the money. In the future, I know I will replace it with another.</li>
            <li> Great brush for wet shaving! Very soft and doesn’t irritate the face. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my face!  Only downside is that the first few times I used it, some of the hair/bristles fell out while lathering.  I think this may be the case with most shaving brushes though.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for my husband and he really likes it. He has no complaints with it at all.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is. Works well for me. Item was delivered on time, and was as described. I haven&#x27;t used this extensively, and this is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything, but it hasn&#x27;t exploded or set my face on fire or anything.</li>
            <li> The main problem with this brush is that hairs constantly fall out of it. They must not have used a good enough adhesive to keep the hairs attached to the wood because as I lather up my beard hairs come off and get stuck in the lather, which is itchy and infuriating. At first I thought that only the loose hairs were falling out and that after a while It would stop, but no, I have had it for months and every morning more hairs fall out. This complet ruins the brush for me, and I am buying another, more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Got this as a beginner shaving brush. The bristles comes off every time i shave. But I guess I will invest more in a shaving brush next time. For now this is a good brush for beginners.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my son;you would have thought that I had given him a thousand dollars!  He is in the Forest  Service and apparently this brand is the best thing going.  He reports that he is very satisfied with the full coverage of the brush and the smooth shave resulting from its use.  The Escal fells solid with a very full brush of hairs.  Good job, guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap drug store shaving brushes before.  The difference between those and the Escali is night and day.  The Escali brush churns up rich foamy lather with very little effort and is very comfortable.  I have sensitive skin and really appreciate the softness of the brush.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the brush and the price is a real bargin!  Of course, Amazon shipping/handling is superb.  I needed a small crown brush to work around my beard and moustache.  If you like or need a smaller badger brush, you can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
            <li> Well made.................. Check&lt;br /&gt;Holds water well........... Check&lt;br /&gt;Lathers shave cream well... Check&lt;br /&gt;Good price................. Check&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast............... Check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first shave brush I have ever used. I wanted a cheap badger hair brush to start with since I didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for. And even though I have nothing to compare to, this brush immensely improved my shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush for a little over a month now. A few bristles have fallen out in this time, but this is to be expected. The brush has also bloomed out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great purchase. There are definitely better quality brushes out there but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality brush.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like the handle, but seems like lose bristles every time I use it.  Also was surprisingly &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;, especially when new, but that seems to be getting a little better with time.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a good price... doing the job getting my face ready for a shave... very happy</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Used quite a few times so far and there has been minimal loose hairs. For the price this can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> My husband loves this new shaving brush!  Next to no &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and the bristles are soft and thick, providing great coverage of his shaving cream.  Excellent price, too.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased two different shaving brushes since I travel often and never unpack.  The other was lower in cost, but wasn&#x27;t 100% Pure Badger.  After a month of using both of these equally I have found this Pure Badger one to be more comfortable to use and of greater quality.  The other continually loses bristles and is not nearly as comfortable during application as the other product.  This one is $3 more, but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]First time DE safety razor user; This brush works well, however you do lose about 1-2 bristles per shave, so YMMV. Overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Kids&#x27; gift for dad- he loves this shaving brush, we all love the great quality, this brush works, great gift, super value!</li>
            <li> Product is good, delivery on time.</li>
            <li> This was must first brush so I don&#x27;t have a basis to compare to, but it seems like a good brush. Doesn&#x27;t shed, wood base, and feels pretty soft. I bought it because it was extraordinarily cheap and I would say this is not reflected in the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> works great and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I was convinced to purchase this brush by the &amp;#34;outstanding&amp;#34; reviews and of course the price.  I must have got the only defective one ever produced.  I have been shaving with a brush for over 55 years and I wound up so disgusted after 4 weeks of use, I threw it in the garbage.  First, it started to shed the hairs and continued to do so for 4 weeks.  The biggest problem was there were not enough hairs left and they were too soft. The brush was not stiff enough.  When lathering your face, you were rubbing the wooden handle against your skin because the too few hairs were splayed sideways against your face.  Consequently not much shaving cream was being left on the skin.  A very frustrating experience and my first disappointment from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent buy. I&#x27;ve just started using the brush and it feels amazing. Creates a nice lather and is very soft. I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> My partner loves it! I think he feels extra cool using it to whip up a shaving lather :0</li>
            <li> As my first brush, it definitely has introduced me to a whole new world of shaving like a man.  It feels great and works like a charm.  Now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to using a brush on soap, I think I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to a fuller, more expensive brush (maybe even silvertip!).  However, I&#x27;ll still hang on to this brush, most likely turning it into my travel brush.</li>
            <li> It Lost a few bristles in the beginning but quickly stopped doing it.  Very soft and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I had brought this Shaving Brush, and it&#x27;s an excellent brush. I have been using it for over a month now and gives excellent results</li>
            <li> The shaving brush I got had a funny smell.  Either it was a used brush or the brush is made from some cheap chemicals.  I learned my lesson not to purchase things that touch your skin on the web.</li>
            <li> My first time with a brush, so I was not sure what to expect.  It was a little prickly at first, but seems to have improved after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it holds the water and brings out the lather.  I can also see a big difference in lather quality depending on whether i use soft water (which we have at home) and other tap water (when I am traveling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two gripes:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It sheds&lt;br /&gt;2.  At least in mine, I think there are some knots in the core, which is puzzling.</li>
            <li> I remember my father using a shaving brush each morning.  I am now, and have purchased on for my grandson.  He probably shaves once a month!  A Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the proper way to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really all that happy with the brush. The bristles were folded (or something) when they were glued into the handle, so they don&#x27;t fluff evenly. Not sure if that will make sense to anyone reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap brush and I didn&#x27;t really expect much, but was definitely disappointed by the lack of quality control. I will be purchasing a better brush to replace this cheap thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s worse than I originally thought. Almost two months later, it still reeks of badger and the bristles are falling out. The finish is now peeling off of the wood - it&#x27;s a fake finish. It&#x27;s only a sticker. This could be the worst product that I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, and that&#x27;s saying a lot. I&#x27;ve posted a few pictures for you.</li>
            <li> Let me say this: it&#x27;s a good brush. It&#x27;s also my first shaving brush, so I am in no position to claim expertise. The only issue is that is sheds some hair in the shaving bowl and on your face when you apply your lather.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the initial shedding of bristles, this brush works well. I would recommend it as a second brush for travel, gym, etc.</li>
            <li> Great brush for travel - it fits into my carrying case (which I purchased separately) well, dries quickly and, most importantly, does a great job of creating and applying a thick lather. I was concerned after the 1st shave because it shed a few more hairs than I expected. However, that was only after the first shave - no shedding at all after that. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaving brush for some new high end shaving cream. This brush is fantastic. It reminds me of getting a shave at the barbershop, and I use a lot less shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Recently a friend of mine bought two-bladed disposable razors at the store.  \\&quot;Two bladed?\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot;  When I asked why, he mentioned that he was transitioning to an old school non-disposable razor because that&#x27;s what his father used to use.  He was working up to using a straight razor like his granddaddy had used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now there&#x27;s a fever for manliness*.  Whether it&#x27;s in the form of Ron Swanson, Mr. Rogers, Ronald Reagan, or Teddy Roosevelt, people want to feel self-reliant and they want to smell like the good old days when you had to walk to school uphill both ways.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the growing popularity of the barbershop cult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two-bladed friend and I were perusing Amazon, looking for the shaving products he wanted, and he showed me a soap he particularly liked.  As soon as he was gone I bought the soap.  I knew he had his father&#x27;s razor but did not have a suitable brush.  Part of the self-reliance mindset is buying items of quality while taking your budget into consideration; given these parameters I found a few brushes made of quality materials within my price range, but the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush had the best reviews.  Not only was it made of durable, natural materials, but also the bristles were 100% pure badger hair-- the most frequently recommended bristle material for an old-timey shave.  Even better, they do not shed as they would in cheaply constructed brushes.  This is the kind of brush will last.  The quality is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Amazon box arrived, I gave it to my friend.  He opened it, found the soap he&#x27;d been wanting, and thanked me.  \\&quot;Keep going,\\&quot; I said.  \\&quot;There&#x27;s something else inside.\\&quot;  When he pulled out the brush his eyes widened.  He turned the box to view it from every angle.  \\&quot;Badger hair,\\&quot; he breathed reverently.  \\&quot;Do you know how long this will last?  I can&#x27;t believe you spent that much on me.\\&quot;  Thanks to this shop, I didn&#x27;t spend that much money at all,and every penny was worth it for the tears in my friend&#x27;s eyes (he probably just had something in his eyes, of course, like TEARS) and the satisfaction of knowing that he has a quality brush that will serve him for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to mention the politeness and punctuality of the shop vendors.  As someone who has experienced unannounced months-long back orders and excuses from some shops, I appreciate being left alone but for polite updates letting me know that my item is in the mail, and quickly, too.  These vendors are personable and although I&#x27;m being sent a form letter update, they manage to make it seem personal and respectful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of The Art of Manliness will probably like this brush.  Gents, or hey-- ladies-- who want to return to wet shaving, the double-edge safety razor and shaving brush:  This is the real deal.  Badger hair.  Affordable.  Perfect size.  Does not shed.  Want to get back to basics?  Want that rugged, clean WWI balanced budget feeling?  Go for the combination of quality and economy in this brush.  Make every morning shave feel like something Indiana Jones would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Nota bene:  I&#x27;d like to point out that the fever for \\&quot;manliness\\&quot; should more properly be thought of as a fever for self-reliance, integrity, and discipline, but \\&quot;The Art of Self-Reliance, Integrity, and Discipline\\&quot; sounds a bit punitive for a light-hearted popular website, I suppose.  All the same, you can&#x27;t argue with the cool factor of anyone that shaves with a brush and straight razor.</li>
            <li> Working great so far.  It does loose a bit of hair, especially at first, but otherwise it produces a good lather and it&#x27;s comfortable.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it at this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough brush that gets the job done. My main concern at the moment is the amount of hairs it sheds. I had a different type of brush that did a lot of shedding too and now doesn&#x27;t do it anymore, so I&#x27;m hoping the same will happen here.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with Derby blades, a blade sample pack, the Edwin Jagger DE razor, and Proraso shave foam and pre-shave cream.  I spent a while reading about the various options for each of these products and was impressed most by these. The Escali brush is of the finest craftsmanship and quality. I am delighted with all of these items.  The Derby blades are for learning and honing my technique and then the sample pack is to see which blade works best for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Inexpensive and it does what I need it to do. It has a nice look to it and it has been holding up great for the past month or so. I will probably buy another when this one is worn out.</li>
            <li> The hairs started falling out but all in all it does the job. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this again because I don&#x27;t use it that much and the hairs appear to have stopped falling out but still not cool.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to be very high quality and works very well</li>
            <li> First off, I am new to DE shaving and purchased this brush due to other posted reviews about one month ago. The brush was very dirty upon arrival and needed to be thoroughly cleaned before use. After several cleanings the brush has lost its odor and softened up tremendously. To date the brush has lost about 8-10 hairs and has since stopped. For the price, this brush is a great value, but I will eventually upgrade to a something more substantial after I become more familiar with DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Even growing up I always used canned shaving cream, not a brush and soap.  But I&#x27;m re-learning to shave with a double edge razor, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I love using this brush.  I get a great lather (I&#x27;ve only used the Proraso Shaving Cream so far), and this brush feels wonderful as I&#x27;m lathering my face.  It really changes the shaving experience, even if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  Using this brush, the cream, and a small metal bowl, I really don&#x27;t think it takes any longer to apply than a canned product.</li>
            <li> I have a large, high price, super-duper, silver tip badger brush that I use at home.  I was looking for a smaller, less expensive travel shaving brush.  In past, low price has mean a pig bristle brush - OK but not as good as a badger bristle  brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Escali brush has the quality of a badger brush ( because it is a badger brush )  and the price of a bristle brush.  Another plus, the bristles stay firmly in place.  In many cheaper brushes the bristles have a tendency to fall out.  I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> I read that it should shred for the first couple of weeks. But I&#x27;m using it for over two months now and still shreds. It&#x27;s annoying. I really hope it&#x27;s only mine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price. This is the a great quality product that is comparable to brushes that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> bought this guy with a few other shaving supplies to up my shave game. so far very pleased. It was pretty cheap and really gets the lather going. bought it with a tube of Proraso and works really well together. I&#x27;ve also used it with the shaving cream stuff they sell at trader joes and it works a lot better than just rubbing it on with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i actually wrapped a rubber band around the base and hang it in the shower to dry -  seems to be a good alternative to a separate stand (which i dont have room for on my sink)</li>
            <li> This is my first time to purchase a shaving brush and so there are some learning curves at first. After a couple uses the loose hairs are starting to minimize. The lather created is wonderful. Now I just need a stand for my brush and razor to complete the ensemble.</li>
            <li> Look, pure badger brushes can cost serious cash, and I found myself strongly drawn to this item because of its reasonable price. I have also had a good experience with a similar brush by Tweezerman. I was disappointed to discover, however, that the Escali has much longer bristles than the Tweezerman and lacks the other brush&#x27;s bristle density. The Escali therefore doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the face, doesn&#x27;t generate a robust a lather. If you&#x27;re going to cheap out -- and why not do so -- I recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This badger brush was exactly what I was looking for.  It lathers well, cleans up easy, and maintains it shape.  Very happy to buy again from Escali.</li>
            <li> did not lose a lot of brissles</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! This brush will leave stray badger hairs all over your face and in your lather.  I have used mine 7 times and the hair loss problem has not improved.  I found the bristles to be pretty stiff, too. I am hoping they will soften over time, but for the price, this is a passable product, and perhaps the value is not the affordability, but rather in learning the importance of investing in a more expensive, quality shaving brush. I don&#x27;t expect this one to hold out for long, but I enjoy the ease of lathering up with a brush, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll do more research next time and purchase a nice one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polyurethane finish isn&#x27;t the greatest, but could be better.  Mine is kind of &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; in how it was applied and dried.  Not the prettiest, but again, for the price, you can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> They were  good quality products ,  Hair more smoother, it feels when use it with foam. I am happy with the products</li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving, this is my first brush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it for the six weeks I&#x27;ve had it. As others mentioned, it does have a slight odor -- not bad or overpowering, but noticeable -- however this went away after two or three uses. The brush has lost only a few bristles and has softened with use. I imagine I&#x27;ll use this brush for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month or so and am very pleased. It does a good job and I&#x27;ve only lost a couple of bristles. You might get a little softer or a lose a few less bristles if you buy a more expensive product, but for the price it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get get a stand to go with it. It will dry much faster and last longer.</li>
            <li> There were several options available and i am glad that I purchased your brush. I do own three and yours is the best.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with this product. Remember that it is badger hair so it will have a slight smell and be a little rough at first. I have had it for over a month now and it is still holding together. There were a couple of hairs that came out at first, but that has not really happened any more.</li>
            <li> Nice product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> After having shaved with only an electric razor for over 30 years, a few years ago I decided to try blade shaving again, using the wet shaving method.  I&#x27;ve been slowly moving towards &amp;#34;upping my game&amp;#34; by using better shaving products as I find them.  Upon hearing about and ordering an awesome shaving cream (Duke Cannon Superior Grade Shaving Cream), I figured the next step would be a shaving brush.  Doing some research led me to bristle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Escali.  I found brushes ranging from $20-$250 and everywhere in between. I wanted an introductory brush at a reasonable price and Escali seemed to fit the bill.  I read all the reviews, both good and bad, then ordered.  I&#x27;m no expert at using a bristle brush, this being my first foray, but the Escali Badger Brush works perfectly well.  It does exactly as it says, builds up a nice foam/lather, covers well/evenly, feels good, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE ** - I&#x27;m leaving this original review info in place for full disclosure/historical purposes, but *please* read my update at the bottom, about the scent being gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one biggest criticism I read here is about the scent of the brush when it&#x27;s wet.  OK, so yes it does have a mild scent.  BUT, I have found the following to be true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is strongest when the brush is used for the first time&lt;br /&gt;- It only lasts while you&#x27;re shaving and does not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to you&lt;br /&gt;- You can use hair shampoo on the brush to help eliminate the residual scent&lt;br /&gt;- The scent *does* decrease over time - and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  If I really wanted to make a concerted effort, I could shampoo/rinse it a bunch of times in a row, but it just doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, folks, that MAYBE if they doubled the cost of the brush, they could deliver one with ZERO scent; maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me close by saying that the scent thing is really No Big Deal; I merely included the info above to give a full &amp; complete review, not glossing over anything.  But at the end of the day (and the review), let me leave you with these final Q&amp;A points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Do I like the brush?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Do I enjoy using it?&lt;br /&gt;A:  Definitely - it does exactly what I need, and quite well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q:  Would I buy it again?&lt;br /&gt;A:  YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update ** 03/05/2016:  TWO Major Points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The scent is essentially GONE from their new brushes.  Whatever Escali has done, they practically eliminated that &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; which people talked about a few years ago.  There&#x27;s nothing noticeable when it&#x27;s wet, unless you stick your nose INSIDE of the brush and inhale deeply, and even then, it&#x27;s barely there.  Plus, **NOTHING** comes off on your skin.  Nice job, Escali!  You got rid of the one major complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I liked this brush so much, that after we bought some special Basin shaving cream for our 17-year-old son, I bought him his first Escali Badger Shaving Brush, and HE loves it, too.  Says that it makes shaving more pleasant and even a little fun, which is saying a lot, coming from a teen.  Now, you have two different generations who both enjoy Escali&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new shaving brush and wanted the best quality one for the most reasonable cost; local stores don&#x27;t carry shave brushes here in south florida.&lt;br /&gt;So I took a chance on the one offered by perella&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;great quality Badger brush works up a good lather and it was reasonable and shipped lightening fast.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to dealing with this vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;Two big thumbs up for Perella&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Best shave of my life</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase process, gift so no performance comments</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a month now and it is perfect. Great feel and the hairs are not falling out at all. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does what is is supposed to do work up lather and aplly to face.  Good buy compared to more expensive options</li>
            <li> Nice little starter brush.</li>
            <li> Product works really well</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about three weeks.  It works quite well in stimulating my beard to &#x27;stand up&#x27; for shaving.  Some have said they like to let it soak with in the soap mug with hot water for a bit before using in order to soften the bristles.  I actually prefer the bristles to be firm and stiff allowing them to get in and prop those beard hairs up a bit.  Now, when this brush first arrived, it did have the smell of badger hair.  It was pretty strong, but not overly offensive.  After three weeks of usage, the smell has dissipated and I mostly smell the scent of the shaving soap I use.  On the matter of bristle leakage, yes, every other shaving session, a bristle may fall out.  That is to be expected.  But, by properly rinsing, squeegeeing, and hanging the brush handle-up via stand, this brush should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Badger hairs bristles are soft and it creates a rich lather but during first use, lot of black color come out. Also, lot of bristles are coming out during each shaving.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the price. I only had a few hairs shed in the first few days and no shedding after that. Holds a good amount of water and helps make a good lather.</li>
            <li> This brush has quite the odor until you wash it and use it a couple times. And it Sheds really bad for a while, but it&#x27;s a decent product for the money, and I would recommend to others that are trying to branch out in the world of wet shaving. 6.5/10 would buy again. Shipping was timely too.</li>
            <li> Had it for a couple weeks, seems to be good quality at a great price. Yes, hairs do fall out at first but eventually slow down; think of it like your brush is getting a haircut. It does its job.</li>
            <li> Great Brush everyone should have one!</li>
            <li> Fine brush overall, particularly at this price point.  Sheds a bit for the first week, but then its fine.  Recommend for someone on a budget or as backup.</li>
            <li> i am amateur at these purchases. but the product is well built, much better than those gillete plastic brushes. hope it lasts</li>
            <li> Just started out wet shaving I got the Escali brush happy with my purchase. I looked at some brushes in the high-end stores all I can say is  this brush is a exceptional value. After a couple uses it seems to have gotten even softer and feels really good on my face. I&#x27;ve had only a couple hairs shed and none of late. I highly recommend this brush again you can&#x27;t beat the cost/performance with this brush. FYI it came packed well and on time.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush that not only whips up the shaving lather but also deep cleans your skin pores. The item was adequately package and arrived on time. Nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I used a boar hair brush for a few years and finally upgraded and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> Great little brush for starting out. Used with the right cream it whips up a wicked lather.</li>
            <li> Bristles are clumped and tangled in the middle of the brush- probably from the way the brush was assembled. Result is central defect in brush and lathering is poor..  I would not recommend this item.  I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great Brush. The badger hair seems like it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Has for two years now. Awesome brush, worth more than the price asked!! Works up a great lather and feels great on my face! Just makes me want to shave even more!!! Just rinse really good and dry then hang up.</li>
            <li> This is my very first badger hair brush. I liked the other reviews and this is cheap enough that if i didn&#x27;t like it i could either re-purpose the brush or just toss it. I certainly won&#x27;t be doing either of those though. I see why badger hair is a big deal with these brushes now. You need a certain level of thickness to the brush to get it to work up the shaving cream into a lather. The hair is perfect for that. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the brush. It does its job well looks like it&#x27;s going to hold up for a long time. I recommend the Taylor Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream with this brush. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using now. I&#x27;m in love with that shaving cream, truly but this brush with that cream is simply magic. Customer for life with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Worked okay at first. I didn&#x27;t know any better as this was my first brush. A little over a month and this thing is shedding like crazy. I had to buy another type and it doesn&#x27;t shed. Avoid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Received the message below offering refund or replacement. To my surprise they actually sent a replacement. I&#x27;ll try this one and hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. The quality of the brush is excellent, and it holds water and later very well. My only gripe with the product is that it had a strong odor of, well, badger. I don&#x27;t know if that is normal, but it is definitely a gamey scent. After a few uses, the smell has all but gone, but it&#x27;s still lingering a bit. Not terrible, but again, I don&#x27;t know if that is normal for a real badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Makes the lather very well and spreads the soap well on the beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well built brush. Not too soft, not too stiff. It picks up and distributes the shave cream.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I soak it in hot water before using and it fattens up.  I slip some shaving soap in-between the the bristles and whip up a nice cream.  The handles finish could be thicker, I feel it may not take the everyday wetting.  But that will be easy to fix.  Over all it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Have not used long term yet, but product feels very good quality and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, brown color drips off, and it sheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but its not very good.  Are these part of normal break in?  Should I return it?  The price is right, but its just a bit off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to look totally sweet for the ladies. I don&#x27;t even shave with a razor but ever since I have started displaying this in my bathroom the level of classy girls I entertain has greatly increased. I highly recommend it for anybody who is trying to up their bathroom game.</li>
            <li> It broke in half after using it twice.</li>
            <li> This badger brush is everything I expected it to be, and I am very pleased with it. Creates a great lather with the sandalwood shaving cream I got. I would recommend getting some sort of stand with it for drying purposes (I got an Escali Stainless Steel stand, and it works/fits perfectly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years. I honestly can&#x27;t imagine what would justify getting a brush more expensive. I don&#x27;t notice stray hairs coming out very often at all, and the integrity of the bristles have remained intact. Above all, I&#x27;m impressed with its softness and ability to generate a lather. Moreover, the gloss finish over the wood looks fantastic, and hasn&#x27;t degraded over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, for both experienced and novice shavers!</li>
            <li> After less than 30 days of use, the handle separated itself from the brush. The brush has always been properly stored hanging bristle side down from a brush/ razor hanger. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It stinks. I don&#x27;t know why, but it has a very pungent odor to it. It&#x27;s going away with time, but still..&lt;br /&gt;Also, mediocre at best at building a lather.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Fell apart shortly after purchase.  I do not recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice, reasonably priced. I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s wonderful.  I liked the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting softer as I use it but my only complaint is its smaller than I thought. I find myself going back to the soap to load up again since you just can&#x27;t load this one enough due to its size. Granted I&#x27;m shaving my head and have some real estate to cover so if your only shaving your face you&#x27;ll be ok. It just feels small and not very substantial.</li>
            <li> great price , good quality</li>
            <li> Looses a lot of hair in the beginning.  Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Never ever buy this brush. There is some chemical odor from it that is nauseating - cannot leave indoors . So etching wrong - I could have returned but could not bear to repack it so put it in a trash bag, tied it up and threw it away</li>
            <li> Still using this product after several year from purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat pure badger for a good old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers noted, this is a great shaving brush; really holds water and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great quality, great price.</li>
            <li> Does the job but hairs keep coming out. Worth the price. :: 08/26/2015, I have to update this review and change it to 5 stars. I received an email form the manufacturer because my first review was only 3 stars. They offered to replace or refund. Can you believe this customer service? For now on I will only buy from Escali. Even the best paint brush ($30 to 50.00) will loose a bristle now and then. Way to go Naomi. ~Rick</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, having received it in February, when I first started DE shaving. Having nothing to compare it to, I will give my general opinions. It whips up a real nice lather, which can be controlled easily by adding water or cream to make a perfect ratio if at first you don&#x27;t succeed. That being said, I am still getting stray hairs which come out in every shave. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it&#x27;s a little discouraging, having owned this brush for seven months, to continue to get the stray hairs. Other than that I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Essential tool for a great traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> This is a quality shaving brush with a light weight feel and great bristle strength which leads to an excellent shaving experience. I love this brush and glad I made the investment!</li>
            <li> Good quality, good pricing.  I decided on the Escali because of the many reviews.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the product, that while simplistic in nature, it does it&#x27;s work.  I use the Proraso shave soap, and this brush creates a good deal of lather/foam.  You must remember to clean lightly, don&#x27;t be rough when cleaning it.  And let it dry on it&#x27;s side or get a brush stand.  Never leave facing up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush may shed a couple of bristles once in a while.  And it may have a &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; smell... it&#x27;s from a real animal.  The smell goes away considerably with use.  The saving soap, whichever you use, will mask any brush smell.  By the way, the brush smell will not stick with you or your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, recommended.</li>
            <li> okay brush for the money....better ones def out there though.  i wouldnt&#x27; buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush I noticed a distinct animal smell. Now it seems gone and the brush works fine. I lost a couple bristles at first too but that seems to have dissipated. I can&#x27;t find a reason to give this less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is all new to me so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like using it.  Gives a closer shave and makes it feel old school.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and good price. This is my first brush so I have anything to compare it to. But I think it does a great job and I haven&#x27;t noticed too much bristle loss.</li>
            <li> The 100% pure badger shaving brush does a very good job. It was delivered quickly. It does have a &#x27;&#x27;new&#x27;&#x27; smell for the first few times that you use it but my experience is that they all do. For the money it is an exceptional brush and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Consider a holder for it as well.</li>
            <li> Great value especially for the price you pay.  This brush is soft and works up a really good lather.  As previousely stated in other reviews it does shed a little.  I used it about 4 times and there is no more shredding.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because when I first ordered this brush I also received ph test strips.  But after contacting Amazon the order was fixed free of charge and very quickly with 1 day shipping.  My guess is that the brush was just stocked wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the brush works very nicely.  I have used it for three weeks now and still looks and feels new.  This is my first shaving brush and hope it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Is this the best shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever seen? No - and it&#x27;s not trying to be at this price.  The brush is not nearly as scratchy as hog bristle, nor did the smell of badger linger on the brush after is was washed.  It has shed a few individual hairs, but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t expect from all but the most expensive brushes.  I&#x27;ve shaved with it for about a week, and i have no complaints.  When I opened the package and first soaked it in hot water, it smelled like hot badger booty, but after a little soap and a rinse, the smell is all but gone.  Mostly I just smell shaving soap.  Overall I feel I got more than I paid for.</li>
            <li> I just made the switch to safety razors and I needed a shaving brush. This is my first brush and I&#x27;m enjoying it. It does shed some hair with use, but I figure that&#x27;s normal. I haven&#x27;t yet bought a hanger, so I dry it propped on its side. I would recommend this product to a friend, but I also don&#x27;t know how it compares to others out there.</li>
            <li> I recently left my Art of Shaving (lower end) brush in a hotel room and needed one quick. I bought this one based on reviews and price and figured I&#x27;d demote this to a travel brush and get a quality brush later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush however is not worth 12.95:&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very skimpy and do not hold water.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently the brush struggles to produce a proper lather.&lt;br /&gt;Using real shaving cream with this brush just wastes the cream and much is needed to get a lather.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs smell like wet dog when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not even recommend this product for a beginner. If you want a proper wet shave, start with a brush that costs around $60. They do get much more expensive, but that is the necessary starting point. I assure you it is a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush back in May 2011. This is a very nice brush and gets better the more you use it and break it in. I did have a one time issue that caused this brush to seperate from its handle. Seller was notified and a replacement brush was sent and I received within days of notification. The issue with my particular brush was a one time issue. I have no problems recommending this brush for those that want a great shaving experience at a wonderful price. Since I got my replacement this brush has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple of weeks now.     I am no expert - I can&#x27;t compare it to other brushes for I have used no others - but it works up a nice lather, quickly.    It was inexpensive for what it offers and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This 100% pure badger shaving brush works very very well.  It takes about a week to break in, but after that it puts shaving cream on your face very smoothly and is very easy to clean, 5 -10 seconds under faucet and it&#x27;s clean!  Highly recommend over any of the other shaving brushes, could not be happier!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a month and can&#x27;t complain.  It was inexpensive for a first time wet shaver, Badger instead of Boar, and on my very first try I got a fantastic lather.  Applying the shaving cream was comfortable and the bristles feel soft.  For the price, I think this is the best buy on Amazon for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered a shaving brush made from Badger hair after reading some blogs that said it was much better than just using shaving gel.  The brush worked up a wonderful lather from the shaving soap mug and the shave was better than I&#x27;d ever experienced.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to shaving without a brush.</li>
            <li> I had bought a chrome handled shaving brush in the past and it wasnt but a few uses and the hair was falling out getting on my face and in the sink so i started looking for a new one . I found this product and i really didn&#x27;t want a wood handle brush but after looking at all the good reviews i went ahead and bought it and i am very happy i did this is a great product and i haven&#x27;t seen one hair fall out yet</li>
            <li> I started out wet shaving by purchasing a cheap badger brush, had I known about this brush, I would have spent the extra few bucks for this.  Yes it shed a bit and smelled when I first got it, but after combing it with a fine-tooth comb and using some shampoo on it, both problems were solved.  I am SSSOOO happy with this brush, so much more than I am with both my badger and synthetic brushes.  The lather it makes is great and it feels so nice.  If I could persuade anyone who is investigating wet shaving to get this brush, I assure you you will not be sorry.  My guess is even the frugal experienced shaver will love it.  AAA++++</li>
            <li> This is going to be a permanent fixture in my shaving items. Its a great product and I am going to use it for as long as I can...</li>
            <li> Does a great job lathering, and dries well after clean up.  Will make sure my brother gets one for his gift, and I will probably get a second one for for my shaving bag.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a shaving brush and I cannot see how much better it can get with more expensive brushes. Brush has held its shape and most of its hair after one month of daily use. Will recommend and re purchase if unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Retains bristles and the bristles are soft. Expect this to last longer than the drugstore brushes that I have used in  the past.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t know what to look for when I bought this brush.  I bought it along with my first safety razor.  First I want to say I am thrilled to now be a wet shaver!  It is amazing the difference.    I do like the way this brush lathers and is not overly harsh on the face, but it does lose quit alot of bristles despite taking care of it and hanging it upside down on a stand after each shave.  At first I thought it was natural for a brush to loose a half a dozen bristles per shave until I started noticing that minimal bristle loss comes up over and over again in a good review.  I think for the money its not a bad brush, but I will spend more next time.</li>
            <li> The brush is great if your&#x27;e trying to get into wet shaving. You do lose a few hairs when you first start but it has held up fine for me. Again, this isn&#x27;t some fancy brush that will last you a decade. It is a steal, however, for how cheap it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this item to anyone that was looking for a badger hair brush. It gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I got this about 1 month ago and I have been loving it ever since. I got this with the merkur long handled razor and a shaving mug. I have found shaving to be very quick and painless. Thanks due in part to this wonderful brush. High reccomended.</li>
            <li> The item was as advertised and it arrived in a timely fashion. I would buy this brush again.It has been effective since it arrived and I began using it.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush I bought.  Excellent product (I use this with a metal shaving bowl, shaving mugs seemed too small).  There could be better brushes but not likely at this price.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must have for any safety/straight razor enthusiast.  It&#x27;s definitely soft and durable as described (used it for several months now with minimal loss of brush hairs).  I will mention that is has a pretty strong animal smell at the beginning and is somewhat rough but after running it through hot water and shaving cream several times, the smell has gone away and the hairs are very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaving brush. I&#x27;ve always used a shaving brush and bought this when I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a badger hair brush, but I am very impressed.  I am currently using it with Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.), and it does an excellent job. I am able to get a thick, even lather with very little effort. I have only noticed a few hairs coming out of the brush with a few weeks use. I wet it before using it, rinse and wring it after using it, and dry it on its side. It seems to be holding up pretty darn well. I think this product is an excellent investment for a novice shaver wanting to try out some pro shaving equipment. ;) I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He has yet to use it, but we both are very happy with the looks of the brush. It does seem like it may be made of good quality.</li>
            <li> Although not as soft as the higher priced brushes this one is perfectly acceptable. I use it for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;After \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; I have noticed only one hair that came loose. For the money this is a good brush.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this brush, but you get what you pay for. The brush sheds like crazy and has an AWFUL scent to it. I ended up throwing it away after two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> My previous brush was a $10 purchase at the drug store.  It started losing bristles immediately.  I&#x27;ve used this one for over a month and haven&#x27;t lost any.  It works well.  **Sept 2016 Update**  -- This brush is STILL great with almost daily use!  Who knew badgers were so tough?</li>
            <li> This brush gives a very nice lather with a nice feel on my face.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaving brush at an unbeatable price.  The brush will shed a few hairs in the first few uses, which is expected.  It will produce a rich lather using soaps and creams; and does a great job on face lathering, albeit quite exfoliating.  Again WHAT A GREAT BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the biggest flaw, the bristles on this brush constantly fall off. I used the brush to apply shaving cream and the bristles stuck to my face along with the cream--man bristles so that when I ran my straight razor over my face it was not smooth, but bumpy and bristles bending and interrupting the cut. It was not my idea of a smooth shave because I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the bristles are very stiff and cheap feeling, they stick out unevenly from the brush base--giving further evidence of their ability to fall off.</li>
            <li> Good brush for good price.  Wash it a few times before use as it will have a bit of a wet dog smell for the first few uses.  A few hairs came out in use the first few times.  After about 5 uses it is really broken in and works great with shaving soap and mug.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; item to see how well he liked shaving with shaving soap instead of shaving cream. The brush is a good quality, works well, and has lasted so far. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s great. Easily and quickly creates a nice thick lather. Has an elegant wood handle and was a great price. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I got this with some shaving cream for my fiance since he has a safety razor but was being frugal about getting a brush for himself. For the value, it&#x27;s a great brush. He enjoys the way the badger hair lathers the soap and helps lift the hair from his face. There were quite a few loose hairs when he first started using it, but it has since stopped shedding so much.</li>
            <li> Good brush for those of you who likes a little more rigid than average hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Holds shaving cream good.  It has quiet specific smell at the beginning, but it is go away&lt;br /&gt;after a few shavings. Worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly getting interested in getting back to the basics with shaving. I bought this brush as it was very affordable, and since it was my first, if I did not like it, I would not be so out of pocket. It did sting a little while brushing, but that could just be me pressing down too hard. I noticed a few strands came out after the first use, but not many. These minor complaints aside, it is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush makes great lather for a great price.</li>
            <li> As advertised for both product and delivery !</li>
            <li> Lemme tell ya, I love this shave brush.  The bristles are amazing soft, and it takes the smallest amount of shave soap/cream and spreads it so thick and even (I could never get that kind of application with just my fingers).  Where I&#x27;ve really noticed the benefit is on my neck (which usually gets irritated when I shave because of the \\&quot;dead spots\\&quot; where I didn&#x27;t get enough shave lube spread about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a wood rack to go with, and not only is it a great shave tool, it looks pretty darn cool on my counter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone I know who shaves more than once a month.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used. That said, I was surprised that it was a little &amp;#34;pricklier&amp;#34; than I had expected (again no frame of reference). I&#x27;ve since read/learned that the brush&#x27;s purpose is also to exfoliate and lift hairs. So I think that&#x27;s part of its design. But I also noticed stray hairs &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; from it, ending up in my razor - maybe 3-4 per shave. I like it and like the price. But I am going to try a different brush so as to have a comparison.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 101 year old Pop in Law and we are very happy with it. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;When we need another one we shall return.</li>
            <li> Using for about two months. Terrific product. Well worth the money. The brush has remained stable and essentially as it was when new.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try out this brush since it was a good price. I bought this to replace a $30 brush that was wearing out after a couple of years. What strikes me about this brush is that the bristles are shorter than my previous brush. This is not a huge issue, but did take some getting used to. What bothers me the most about this brush is that it smells bad. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the finish on the handle or the adhesive, but it is not pleasant at all. Each time I use the brush I lose a few bristles. I am hoping that this is just because the brush is new. My old brush rarely lost bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $10 CVS boar&#x27;s hair brush for over a year. I kept reading one review after another about how superior badger hair brushes are, so I picked this reasonably priced one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was it was about half the size of my old brush. No big deal there. Then I dunked it in hot water...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my gentle Jesus, how dead were the Badgers these hairs come from!?!!?!?! My bathroom instantly smelled like a dog groomers x10!!!!!! I nearly vomited!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wiping down and Febreezing the bathroom, AND running my shaving mug through the dishwasher with a fresh soap puck afterwards, this brush went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is a great introduction badger brush. It shed quite a bit over the first few uses, but I&#x27;m now at a month in and it is holding strong.</li>
            <li> Great product, glad I bought it, fast shipping bad great service</li>
            <li> Went to old school shaving and have been using this brush for a month now. Only complaints is 3-4 bristles seem to make their way out every time I use it. Not a big deal really. Otherwise functional and well made.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and I like that he doesn&#x27;t get rashes. I even bought a beautiful stand for it so it would dry properly.</li>
            <li> The brush has an odd exfoliating texture.  If you like super soft silky brushes, this isn&#x27;t for you.  It creates a create lather.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I have nothing to compare it to but I like it. bristles tend to fall out occasionally at a rate of 2 per shave, but like it said this is my first brush and i have nothing to compare it to. I use to use shaving cream out of a can, but this is far and away much better. Just get a good shave soap. I use Poraso brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it with different brushes.  But I have had no problems with bristles falling out; the only time I lost a few hairs was the very first time I used the brush.  It seems to lather up the soap well.  Some reviews said it was small.  As a beginner I have no idea if it is small compared to other brushes, but I don&#x27;t know why the brush would need to be any larger.  When I get a lather going, the bristles take up nearly my entire cheek and I am able to lather up 3 times with out getting more soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you are a beginner and trying to find the brush for you, based off of highest amazon review and lowest price, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. Leathers it up just right. Perfect size, and handles very well. Very easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> A week in and still working great. Great transaction!</li>
            <li> It smells like they caged a badger in its own feces for a year, clubbed it over the head, took a patch of its hair, then put that hair in the brush. I tried soaking the brush in soapy water for a week, even that didn&#x27;t get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles continue to come loose out of the brush, I&#x27;d say a hundred hairs have fallen out after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a week but I like it, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For $15 dollars I&#x27;d expect more. I&#x27;m not going to get all technical in my review as I think many others here have already done exceedingly well in that area. I&#x27;m not an expert by any means but I could tell from my first lather that this brush is cheap. The soap loads alright but once I go to face lather, the bristles get all bunched up don&#x27;t spread the soap very well. Also there seems to be a cluster of bristles in the center of the brush that are all clumped and matted together and look like they might be stuck together with glue. You can see this in other photos that have been uploaded. Also I noticed the first time I used it, once I rinsed the brush out my sink was full of brown water - absolutely disgusting! Not sure it&#x27;s animal byproduct or dirt from manufacturing process. Also there is a noticeable animal smell when I&#x27;m applying the soap to my face which is quite displeasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an alternate brush for around the same price, but significantly higher quality, check out the Omega line, specifically the 20102 or 10066. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Exfoliates the face while, elegant handle, medium soft bristles and light weight. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Decent brush, doesn&#x27;t lather extremely well, but good for beginning shavers.</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price. Been using for couple months now. Bristles have held up quite good (considering some reveiws indicated that it would shed like crazy). There was a slight chemical scent on the bristles at first but dissapated over week or two after a couple uses with some nice shave soaps. Would re-order based on the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve owned. It has only lost one hair since I got it. Me and my wife uses it every day. Going to get everyone I know one for a holiday gift.</li>
            <li> Good quality but bristles are little stiff.</li>
            <li> Great I&#x27;ll order another one real soon</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, works great.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the uncomfortable shaves with conventional razors so did some research and found a shaving system that worked for me.  I use this brush along with a safety razor and some good shave cream.  Best and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Brush is excellent at building lather and so far hasn&#x27;t lost any of its bristles.</li>
            <li> First brush I have ever used.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for two weeks now. Although this is my first shaving brush, I have a had no issues with the product. It helps build a lather quickly .</li>
            <li> I just started using this brush with shaving cream that I bought on amazon. It makes a huge difference! I get a nice even application of the shaving cream and it lathers the cream quickly. The bristles are soft and it dries overnight.</li>
            <li> Great brush, and great having bussines with you</li>
            <li> Works great so far. Really good value. Will probably buy again.  10 months later: This brush still sheds. Even so, it is a great value. I recently purchased a $50+ EJ brush, hoping to step up in quality. The more expensive brush doesn&#x27;t shed, but is about 1/3 less &#x27;full&#x27;. There isn&#x27;t as much brush there to make lather. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate this Escali brush more, now that I&#x27;ve compared it to a more expensive one. If I had to pick between an expensive one that didn&#x27;t shed and this Escali, I&#x27;d pick the Escali.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush with very little shedding. I keep mine in the shower and let it dry by hanging upside down. The seller shipped quickly and the item arrived very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I never thought using a brush would make a difference in shaving, but it is like night and day. This brush does a great job of stimulating the hair prior to shaving and makes a small amount of shaving cream go a long way. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great brush. very smooth to the touch and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This pure badger brush is a great starter brush. The bristles have softened with use and the amount of shedding (happens with all brushes no matter the quality) is pretty miniscule only a few hairs after four sessions. The water retention is good and it lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a starter brush and it&#x27;s worth keeping around as an inexpensive travel brush when you upgrade. 10/10</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but immediately there was a difference.  Feels very comfortable to the skin and creates a good lather, of course you need a good soap to go with it as well.  I guess the brush will get better as you continuously use it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this brush for the money.  I bought it to use as a travel brush, but find myself grabbing for it here at home, too.  Spend the few bucks and treat your face!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price but the brush certainly has proved to be a good buy.  It hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles and after using it for several shaves it preforms well.  Intend to buy one for my son who is beginning to use a safety razor.  I would recommend this brush to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  Loved the first one and couldn&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Rated number 1 for a reason. I read ALL the reviews of ALL the shaving brushes and chose Escali. Shipped quick and arrived as promised and feels good on my face. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After trying several different shaving brushes, this one stands alone for comfort and durability.  When warmed in water for a few seconds, it holds just enough to make a rich lather that goes on smooth.  It does not shed it&#x27;s bristles like some of the other did.  It &amp;#34;paints&amp;#34; your face with a soft yet firm feeling.  This brush will not collapse against your face.  It stands up and lets the point of each bristle do its job.&lt;br /&gt;I can see that we will have a long lasting and loving relationship together.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This brush has been going on for several month and there have been zero issues with hair loss. Does a good job with lather and cleans quick.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for starters, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Shed bristles like crazy after 1 year.</li>
            <li> A good, general purpose shave brush, lathers well, semi-soft, retains moisture and shaving foam well.</li>
            <li> I got very tired of paying big bucks for 4 or 5 blade razor refills.  So I went back to what my father and grandfather used.  A single blade razor, a shaving brush, and shaving soap.  I believe  the Badger Shaving Brush is the best in the world.  You cannot go wrong with this brush, and you will save some money from buying expensive 4 blade razor refills.  Go back to the old way of shaving, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> brush sheds like mad, but decent enough as a starter brush.  Upgrade as soon as you decide to stick with brush-and-cream as your face prep.</li>
            <li> good value for money, very nice brush</li>
            <li> My husband loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very high quality wooden handle and the brush holds a generous amount of shaving soap without dripping, which is an issue I have had in the past with lesser quality brushes. As well the bristles are fine and soft with a natural feel, which works very well on the face. I highly recommend this product for both its quality and functionality.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality...both brush and the razor \ brush stand are, surprisingly substantial and sturdy in construction. Excellent value for the price...would reccomend highly.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft brush for the money. Can not beat the price for a badger hair shave brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great and affordable shaving brush. As this was my first purchase of the kind, i must say I am completely satisfied. I will not look for another brush until this one is done. Great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush can&#x27;t go a day of shaving with out it</li>
            <li> A great brush. A great price. If you use a badger brush to shave, make sure it is bristles down in a holder when not in use.  Some people say it is scratchy, it is supposed to be. That helps exfoliate your skin. I shaved with a brush/mug many years ago and now remember why I liked it so much.  They can be a little messy but I shave in the shower so not a problem. I also get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this brush. I bought it to replace a cheap one that came in a shave soap kit. I was a little thrown off by the smell the bristles give off at first. But it has faded after a few uses and I attribute it to the real material it&#x27;s made of as well as the fact that my other one im used to is just a cheap synthetic bristle with no smell. It&#x27;s only lost a few of its bristles in about ten shaves I&#x27;ve used it for. Compare to my other that would lose probably 3 or 4 bristles per shave.&lt;br /&gt;Store it the way they tell you to and it stays fluffy and ready for the next use. A toss up between 4-5 stars, the $12 price tag tips my scale to the 5.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I think it&#x27;s important for me to admit that my original review of this brush was only three stars.  The brush I received had several coarse hairs noticeable on first inspection.  The brush had a fairly strong odor to it, and the first several rinses resulted in a filthy brackish water pouring from it.  After a thorough cleaning, the brush functioned fine, and I reported as much.   My review was not overly harsh, but it was honest.  A day later, I was contacted by a representative of the supplier, Perella&#x27;s.  The CSR expressed regret that I had been unhappy with their product and offered to send me a replacement for free.  My replacement brush has since arrived and proved to be much cleaner and had fewer coarse hairs apparent.  The new brush returns reliably to original shape and builds excellent lather.  It has a slight odor to it, but this is the case for several other natural badger hair brushes that I have tried as well.  Altogether I think this is an excellent value for the price, you could easily spend three times as much or more for a shaving brush from some other companies that would not be significantly better than the Escali.  I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Perella&#x27;s went above and beyond in this instance; I did not submit any complaint to them directly, nor did I offer a terrible review, but they still reached out to me in an effort to make me happy.  So this review is half for the actual brush, and half for the seller.  I am impressed by a small company willing to go out of their way to provide excellent customer service and a quality product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of daily use, I&#x27;ve only lost a few bristles.  Soft feel, easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent low cost yet high quality badger hair shaving brush. The softness of the badger hair allows for an almost relaxing shaving (are there people who actually like to shave every other day?!) experience.</li>
            <li> The Escali Badger Bristle shaving brush is a welcome tool to my grooming arsenal as I need all the help I can get. When armed with some warm water, a decent hunk of shaving soap in my surplus mug, and a proper blade, I have no doubt that the goal of a clean, close and comfortable shave will be met. It&#x27;s a bit of a comfort knowing that in addition to the sheer enjoyment of using the brush with its good robust bristles in play after tuning up with the aforementioned warm water enervated lather, at the end of the day I also will find this an economical way to stay in the game. Only the best.</li>
            <li> I have this product for just a short time but I am very impressed.  When used in conjunction with a nice safety razor; I purchased a Merkur &amp;#34;1904&amp;#34; 42C, nice blades; I purchased Astra Super Premium Platinum Double and a nice shaving cream, you will get the best shave of your life.  As a reference point when I say that, I started shaving in the 1960s and experienced the horrors of the old Gillette Blue Blades. This product is very high quality and has a nice price point.  You can always pay more, but if you&#x27;re just putting your toe in the water for this type of a shave, no need to drop a king&#x27;s ransom.  For those who are considering moving over to a wet shaving system here is a nice tutorial link:  http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/double-edge-razor-guide-de/.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft yet stiff enough to generate a good lather. It holds warmth well and the handle is excellent. The bristles do not fall out easily and it still looks great with only minimum care.</li>
            <li> Have a N-ice brush and the Van Der Hagen one as well. The N-ice one is also good but a little stiffer. This Escali one is the softest and easiest to load/lather of the three for me. Very soft, doesn&#x27;t poke into the face for the dermically weak such as myself.</li>
            <li> Only one I have tried so its hard to compare to anything else but it does very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, exactly as described.  A great shaving brush!  I bought it as a gift and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! The quality of this product is awesome. You might find similar quality at the&amp;#34; Art of Shaving&amp;#34; fancy stores but it will cost you 4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! My shaving experience is better and definitely less abrasive on facial skin from daily shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Some loss of bristles during first few uses but seems to be holding up nicely. Perfect balance of stiffness and comfort when applying shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with fast shipping</li>
            <li> I just switched to the single blade razor and my friend told me I needed the cream and brush to go along with my new shaving system. The brush works great! It holds a lather really well and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple badger brushes in the past but just recently got back into wet-shaving.  So I was looking for something inexpensive until the holiday season.  This product was exactly what I expected.  Great quality for a very reasonable price.  A few random hairs fall out during the first uses, but after soaking the brush in hot water and using it a couple times, everything seems to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Brush works well, and exactly as it should. Great deal for the brush overall! No complaints and fast shipping! I may order another one.</li>
            <li> I know fresh brushes are supposed to have a light &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; odor of a badger....BUT HOT DAMN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the packages and WOOSH! my nose was violated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More bristles than I would like fall off onto my face.</li>
            <li> i love it except that it doesnt fit the holder that i have but i can live witht hat</li>
            <li> First experience owning a badger brush - so I can&#x27;t offer experience in comparing to other brushes.  However my experience so far has been very positive.  The brush seems well made and definitely makes shaving a more enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping it from 5 stars it seems to shed a couple hairs with every use (2 or 3 tops).  I&#x27;ve only used the brush 5 or 6 times so I&#x27;m hopeful this will stop eventually.  Before using the brush I broke it in using the tips found online.  This definitely helped soften it up some but I had hoped it would also remove all the loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said though it seems like a solid brush.  I&#x27;m thinking of picking a few up with some good cream for Xmas for friends and family.  Definitely seems to be a great starting point for someone looking to try a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, I highly recommend it, as long as you take care of it and hang dry it you should have it forever</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product at a phenomenal price. Would definitely recommend this over more expensive brushes that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Shaving brush is ok. It start loosing hair after first use but not as much as purchsed from CVS for same price</li>
            <li> Badger brushes... why on earth would I ever need that?  That&#x27;s what I always thought as a boy of 23 years old.  Then, on my 24th birthday, my Opa buys me a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? I asked my Opa (yes we&#x27;re german).&lt;br /&gt;He says to me, BOY! BECOME A MAN! SHAVE LIKE A MAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a crying child of 24, I went upstairs to the washroom and proceeded to shave my face using the badger brush.  The way it felt in my had felt oddly right, like it was ment to be there.  The warm water rushed across the brush as it dampened.  The way it magically turned the shaving soap into a nice thick lather.  The prickly, smooth feel against my skin and I slid it across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew then as I know now, I had taken a huge step to becoming a real man.  Sadly it was not until I purchased my safety razor that I had truly become a man.  But atleast on my birthday I felt like I almost was.  There might have even been a slight twinkle in my Opa&#x27;s eyes when I came downstairs with a shockingly smooth face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to shaving, again, after many years of having just a trimmed beard. I have ALWAYS (well, since my Dad taught me to shave) used a shaving brush to apply any shaving soap/gel/foam and this one is excellent. Snaps back to &#x27;original&#x27; shape after being wet... just an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent price and fast shipping. It was a gift and he loved it. Why pay inflated prices when you can get a quality product for much less? Recommend this seller highly!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush at a good price. Minimal badger hair loss. The wooden handle looks sharp too. Word.</li>
            <li> A great product! I went from a switched from a multi-blade with shave gel to this Escali Badger brush, safety razor, and nice quality shave soap and will never go back again. Its a very high quality brush, prompt shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Good quality/ good feel.  Enjoying a close shave with the help of this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is just ok. Every time I use it, one or two of the badger hairs come out so no telling how long till they are all gone. The hairs themselves are also a bit prickly which i was not expecting. I had hoped that they would be soft but they are not, at least not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about 5 years and recently purchased another for a relative for Christmas. Mine has held up especially well for a daily shave accessory. Badger hair is also, supposedly, the bee&#x27;s knees, so I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Pokey yet brushy - perfect shaving compliment to my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great sellers - product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> I gave this item a five star rating because it appears to be as advertised, arrived on time, and was well-packed.  Having said that, it is a (serious) stocking stuffer and won&#x27;t be put to an actual use test until after Christmas.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a year.  The bristles fall out with every shave, a few at a time, every day.  Not a big deal, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is soft and holds lather well. It doesn&#x27;t shed any hairs and keeps its shape.  I really enjoy using it and would certainly recommend its purchase.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price.  I&#x27;ve seen other brushes that cost more and I can&#x27;t imagine why.  This is a great brush.  Buy it and enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> This brush might be a great deal according to the other reviews here, but this brush shed hair worse than a Persian cat in the summer time.  I couldn&#x27;t even use it once before it made its way to the circular filing cabinet.  Do not waste your money on this brush.  I guess it&#x27;s true when people say you get what you pay for.  Consider saving up some more money and then yourself a good brush.</li>
            <li> As noted by other reviewers, this does have a &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; scent to it--if you don&#x27;t mind that kinda musky smell, it is okay.  My husband prefers his old boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, never shaved better. Delivered very promptly, I think even one day early!</li>
            <li> I really want to rate it better, and honestly it is pretty average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done, but not in luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably a great brush for a beginner like me, but I am still losing bristles occasionally. If you are just starting out this should be fine, but it is not *amazing*</li>
            <li> that was for my husband and he love it..</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because they work so well. I gave it 5 stars because I have absolutely no complaints and I would recommend it to anyone that uses a brush to apply shave cream.</li>
            <li> A good brush for what u pay, but any seasoned shaver knows you should shave n a circular motion. With this brush there is not enough bristles in the middle of the brush to make this style viable</li>
            <li> Nice brush, wish it was maybe a little softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Good brush but my first shaving brush so not many to compare it to</li>
            <li> It is OK, but I find I now need to purchase a holder to keep it in.  Even though the top is flat and it is shown standing on it&#x27;s head, it says to store it upside down.</li>
            <li> I had a shaving cream brush before.  It must have been made from straw or re-bar; after getting this badger brush I&#x27;m truly excited about how good it feels to get a good lather going.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor and needed a brush. After reading some online reviews I found this brush on Amazon. Perella&#x27;s had it for the best price and got it to me quickly. The brush was packed in a stout but not too big cardboard box. I&#x27;ve used the brush for a few weeks, it does a nice job of lathering up the shaving soap that I use.</li>
            <li> There are great brushes out there for over $100, I have seen some for 200 Euros. This brush is their equal in quality, it is a great value.  Now if you want to spend over $100 be my guest, however I would buy this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush in about 40 years. I was surprised at how my shaves improved. I dry it on its side and it holds its shape well. No bristles lost either.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made badger hair brush that does its job. The bristles are quite stiff- possibly uncomfortably so initially- but they soften in a week or two. The brush comes with a bit of a smell, the \\&quot;extra badger\\&quot; that I referred to above, but it goes away after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a brush in years, using cans of shaving cream, but, since I had a container of shaving soap several years old and not wanting to waste it, I decided to try it. After reading the reviews of various brushes, I chose this one and, after a month or so, am very pleased with it. Only a few hairs have come out and only a few at a time so losing them has caused on problem. The brush is smaller than some I&#x27;ve seen but still fits nicely in my hand. It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, hardly sheds bristles, and I like it so much I think I won&#x27;t return to canned cream. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional review: Now, after three months of daily use, this brush is still a great buy. No more hairs have fallen out after the first week. It still works well with my soap and has presented no problems.</li>
            <li> The hairs on this brush initially were falling out like crazy, but after a few weeks of using it, that pretty much stopped. The bristles are nice a firm and makes a nice lather. I use it with Williams Mug Soap which is the best deal there is for shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you use a Mach8 32 blade razor, you should still use a quality brush when shaving. This one will get the job done for you.</li>
            <li> This badger brush is a great brush at a great price! I would definitely recommend this brush for anyone looking to start using one.</li>
            <li> I just started my foray into wet shaving with a safety razor and this Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush is the perfect accoutrement to my set. I highly recommend this item and the company.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for dual edge razor shaving beginners. Can&#x27;t beat the price for a badger hair brush. I now use it as a hydrating brush.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the cheapest 100% badger brush of high quality available on Amazon. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a slightly higher quality brush out there selling for 50 or 60 dollars - but at $13.00, this brush is really excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned: You WILL, consistently, get stray badger hairs on your face and hands the first 5 or 10 times you shave with this brush. However, a month later using this brush and I consistently get perfectly whipped lather and only very occasionally do I get a stray badger hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE CARE OF THIS BRUSH: get a cheapy plastic brush stand (4.25 plus shipping on ebay), and keep your brush on it whenever its not in your hand. Thoroughly rinse out your brush and squeeze out the soap, then shake it out til it&#x27;s good and bushy, then hang it up and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I decided that after 23 years of shaving with a mix of electrics and plastic disposables I would go \\&quot;old school\\&quot;. I ordered the Escali along with the safety razor and all the fixings. I likes the reviews the brush received making it a pretty easy choice for me. I am very happy with it. I have been shaving with it everyday for about a month now and it holds up great! It picks up soap well and lathers nicely as well. All in all very happy with my purchase and will be picking up another whenever I have to replace this one. Thank you for making a nice product that not only holds up well with constant use, but one that looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> A little to stiff hopefuly will soften with use.  Price ok but expected more.  handle feels ok in hand will continue to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems to work just fine. Though everytime I shave it seems that at least 5 of the hairs fall out when I&#x27;m applying the shaving cream to my face. It&#x27;s really not a big deal, just not sure if they all do that or if I&#x27;m applying too much pressure or what. But overall it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied. Seems to lose at least a few bristles each time I shave, so we&#x27;ll see about longevity of life.</li>
            <li> Quite befitting the man i bought this for.It doesn&#x27;t appear to be hard to open,&amp; it came well protected among some other orders with inflated plastic.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this brush it leaves hair inside the shaving bowl.  And yes, I soak it in water first.  Im hoping it stops losing hair after I break it in, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush based on reviews and it makes a great lather with Taylor of old bond street for the price of this brush you can&#x27;t go wrong. Bought a second one for my father and he loves it. Easy to wash and dry. Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaving brush for a month now and no bristles have fallen out. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been drying it the wrong way (right side up, without a stand), and it still retains its softness and fluff. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Van Der Hagen shave brush that comes with their &amp;#34;Premium Shave Set.&amp;#34;  I think it&#x27;s a pretty good upgrade, although I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes besides these two.  It&#x27;s much softer and it seems to hold a lather better than the Van Der Hagen brush.  Some of the hairs fall out in the beginning as other reviews mention, but it&#x27;s only a few and doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality of the brush or the shaves.  Good value for the product, and I may purchase another one to put in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I have had this for several months now and it works ok.  It has lost some hairs.  The main body of the brush is doing good.  When wet it clumps up but it gets the job done.  I was waiting to do this review until after I had some time with it.  Its pretty good for the  price and as a starter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a couple weeks and the hairs are really starting to soften. It also took several uses before it shed all of the loose hair. The first couple shaves I was losing 10-20 hairs, but now it&#x27;s down to a hair or two per shave. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush. I get a nice, thick foam and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of years. It has shed quit a bit over time. about 2 bristles every other shave. Disturbingly though the Brush clump has seperated from the handle. Nothing I can think of that I did to cause this failure. I have always stored the brush on a hanger and rinsed it thoroughly after each use so hard to figure the cause of this failure. I&#x27;m hoping there are much better brushes available.</li>
            <li> For my first 5-6 uses, I had 10-12 bristles falling out during each use, which was a bit annoying.  After a dozen uses I still get 2-3 bristles falling out. Other reviewers don&#x27;t seem to be having this problem.  Perhaps mine is slightly defective.  But for now, it works, and for the price, I would say it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger as advertised.  If you are space constrained don&#x27;t plan on storing it as shown in the picture, it is to be stored  on its side or from a brush hanger.</li>
            <li> I received my order of the shaving brush very quickly and was very pleased with the item and it&#x27;s quality. It has become more difficult to find old fashioned razors and the associated brushes and soaps needed. Due entirely to those crummy disposable razors that wear out quickly. It is nice to know some businesses share my views and can supply quality products for a reasonable cost and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you:&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Martin</li>
            <li> You can spend $145.00 on a badger brush, sure, but why would you? This badger brush from Escali holds up just as well as an overpriced brush that does the same job. I challenge anyone to stack this Escali badger brush up against a $145.00 badger brush and tell me there&#x27;s a difference...</li>
            <li> I just went back to single edge wet shaving recently and this brush is great. It lathers the soap and my face well, is soft, easy to rinse and dry. I have an Escali chrome razor and brush hanger which fits the handle on the Badger brush perfectly. The brush drys quickly by hanging it up side down as Badger recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints at all, the Badger is well worth the money and I expect to get many years of service from it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been shedding steadily into my soap since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with classic shaving implements so I&#x27;m not sure whether this is normal or not.</li>
            <li> Brush was $12 so I guess one could say \\&quot;well what did you expect?\\&quot;. Next time I&#x27;ll spend the money and get something of better quality. My advice is to skip this one unless you&#x27;re just getting into this style of shaving and aren&#x27;t sure you&#x27;ll stick with it because it is cheap, I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
            <li> Brush works as advertised. The bristles smell pretty bad and are a little too soft.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This was part of a valentine&#x27;s day gift for my husband.  He specifically wanted a brush with this type of bristle.  He absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this brush will take a few uses before it is &amp;#34;worn in&amp;#34;.  By that I mean that for the first few uses the brush was stiff and a little uncomfortable on my skin.  But now it&#x27;s soft and I really like using it.  I am new to safety razor shaving and so far I see no potential for me to ever go back to a 6 blade razor and shaving cream from a can.  Use this brush and a nice shave soap.  You can thank me later.</li>
            <li> The brush has a dense, thick head of soft fine bristles that produces a great lather. Best brush I have had.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I use it together with [[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap]] and the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Safety Razor]] and so far I am very impressed with the results. The brush gives a good even layer of shaving foam, is very durable, easy to clean and is gentle on the skin. It looks good to, so in short its a great purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how one 100% pure badger shaving brush can sell for $12.95 and another 100% pure badger shaving brush goes for $175!!  What the!?!?  Obviously some badgers rank a lot higher than others.  At $12.95, my brush clearly came off badgers from the &#x27;hood.  Unrefined and edgy.  However, when I wet my brush and swirled Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream in a bowl with it, a rich, thick lather appeared.....just like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I didn&#x27;t have issues using the brush to apply the lather to my face.  I rate the brush 5 stars because it performs like it&#x27;s supposed to and looks nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great Badger hair brush that is great for anyone trying to upgrade their shaving experience. I bought this with the Marvy Shaving Mug and Proraso shaving cream. There are a few things you should know about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1) This is real badger hair and will smell when you first get it wet! To get around this I washed it with Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo a few times until it was tolerable to use, and the smell went away after a few uses. I found this also helped get rid of some of the loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2) You want to get a bowl that is wide enough for your fingers and deep enough that the lather won&#x27;t splash around.&lt;br /&gt;I found that this brush was compatible with the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. It takes a minute or two to work up a nice lather, and feels great on your face while you shave. For the first two uses there was a slight &amp;#34;prickle&amp;#34;, but it didn&#x27;t bother me and completely went away after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very inexpensive brush that is great to use or give as a gift. It will tremendously improve your shaving experience and greatly facilitated my transition into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It was on my brother-in-law&#x27;s wish list, and he thought it was a nice present. Though he did think it smelled very odd.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit for the new brush smell to leave, but it&#x27;s a very worthy brush for the price.  Soft, holds and makes a great lather, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got a safety razor setup for my husband for Christmas.  This was part of it. He loves it. Stays in shape.  Looks like it was last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brush has so many positive reviews, don&#x27;t make a mistake people, simply put this is a junk, first of all it does not hold its shape, second it left so much hair in the lather that I had to throw the whole thing away, third the lather was of white, almost brown color that leads me to believe that the hair on this brush are painted. After disastrous first attempt I gave it a second try, thought maybe I didn&#x27;t left it seating in the water long enough, left it in the water for 20 minutes while taking a shower, same results with a little less hair in the bowl. Tried to apply lather on my face with no success, it does not hold its shape and whatever little lather it created falls off of it. Don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because it was a lot less than the retailers price. Also great quality. I liked it so much I bought another for my father-in-law.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good brush. I usually lose 1-2 bristles per shave, but I also don&#x27;t shave often so maybe it still has a break-in period. I would probably buy again for this price!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush so I have nothing to compare it with. However it works great and is very smooth when applying cream.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It makes it easy to lather up, and it isn&#x27;t rough. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there a few of the hairs have come out after only a few uses, however, the number is 1 or 2, and the overall quality is very good.</li>
            <li> This thing will lather up some shave creme like I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  This is the only brush I have ever used and for 12.99 it is a good deal</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, quick lather up. Did loose a few hairs right off but not enough to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> My first brush and I love it. This makes mixing my Dreadnought Luxury Shaving a breeze each and every shave.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this brush. First, I found the brush very dirty and I had to clean it and my shaving cup. Second, it sheds something awful, and lastly, it is rather lean on bristles and does not make up a good lather. This is what I get for selecting on price alone.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a single edge razor back in early March. Not wanting to spend too much, I opted for a cheap beginner brush. Using it the last month, I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It has shed about 10 hairs since I&#x27;ve received it hence why I gave it 4 stars. If you&#x27;re looking to start a better wet shave regimen, this is a good brush to start with and experiment. If you want something nicer then later down the road invest in another brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is good quality, but considerably smaller that the one I&#x27;ve been using.  It does a good job, but you&#x27;re paying more for the name than the product you receive.  I will not purchase this brand again.  It is a person&lt;br /&gt;Nal choice, you have to make you&#x27;re own decisions.</li>
            <li> I started out with a $3 brush.  It works well.  I purchased this thinking my life would change.  My life hasn&#x27;t changed, but I do use this brush more often than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure this brush had some coloration that washed out during the first few goes.  And there might have been a smell.  If you can&#x27;t handle a short breaking in period, go pay more for a company to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few bristles did fall out, but I didn&#x27;t cut my face because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the size is smaller than the Van Der Hagen, but functionality isn&#x27;t affected (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A3HPT0/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give it a shot</li>
            <li> After reading The Art of Manliness, I decided to use a safety razor. At the recommendation of the book, I decided to go for the badger hair brush, due to it&#x27;s comfort. Boy, am I glad that I did. This is an excellent product that I use on a daily basis. It&#x27;s both comfortable and extremely affordable. I highly recommend this product to anyone that is deciding to take a more traditional approach to shaving.</li>
            <li> very impressed with this brush, as long as you rinse it and hang it, it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Great quality, speedy shipping, and a great price. Yes, it does have a bit of musk to it when it is new...it is a badger brush. Get over it.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft, haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  A few things that I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but gets the job done well (I like the size).&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel good, and are soft&lt;br /&gt;Shedding - this did shed a decent amount over the first few uses, but now it&#x27;s just the occasional hair here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you store it vertically, with the bristles hanging down.  You want to thoroughly rinse it after every use, then put it in a stand to dry.  This will extend the useful life of the brush, and help prevent premature shedding/rotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine wears out, I will most likely buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely an upgrade over the cheap low-quality drugstore brush I had been using.  I can get a nice thick lather with this brush, and it feels good to use.  The first several uses, it lost some bristles.  After using it for a couple weeks of use, always storing it upside down, it now loses one every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the brand was gone from the brush on arrival, so it said &amp;#34;ESCAL.&amp;#34;  Not a big deal, I&#x27;d actually prefer it to say nothing at all, but it speaks to the quality of the brush.  Not the best brush in the world, but definitely good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shave brush several weeks ago and it is fantastic. Holds water as it should and feels great on the skin! Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush at a great price. It is soft but it gets the job done in terms of lifting the hairs and getting out the dirt. It also fits the stand easily. Cleans and drys well too.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned, but so far am very happy with it.  Great price, does what it should.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a synthetic I had. The price was tempting so I opted to start with this instead of the $30 brushes (or more). It feels much softer than synthetic and and lathers nicely, one difference I notice with the badger hair than the synthetic is it absorbs water MUCH more, so you really gotta soak it to get the soap wet. This allows the soap to fill up the brush more as well so you can really lather up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have an odd smell, not sure if it&#x27;s normal badger smell or just exclusive to this brush as I&#x27;ve never had another badger hair brush before (or smelt a badger!). But it&#x27;s nothing bad or potent, just noticeable compared to no smell, also you won&#x27;t smell anything once it&#x27;s covered in soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles started falling immediately, stuck in the soap dish and fell into the sink during rinsing. I think this is normal first-use wear out of a badger brush as I only lightly whipped up the soap (I&#x27;m sure pricier brushes lose less though). No significant amount of hairs have been lossed, and very few if any fall out now that it&#x27;s broken in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price, it&#x27;s nice, especially if it&#x27;s your first brush or need a spare travel to not worry to much about if you lose it. I&#x27;ll probably upgrade eventually, but this should last me a while with proper care.</li>
            <li> Brush feels great, is affordable and actually looks more pleasant than other brushes in the same price range! Will definitely be buying a couple of these as gifts for my fellow wet-shaving buddies</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush while it lasted.  I bought the shaving brush on November 30, 2014 and on March 9, 2015 the bristles separated from the handle.  I was surprised to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t extend that far into the handle; they&#x27;re just seated in glue.  Apparently the glue gave way and now the bristles have separated, en masse, from the handle.  I was careful with this brush and always hung it upside down when wet.  Very disappointed.  UPDATE: A little glue from the hot glue gun and I&#x27;m back in business.  I get a great lather with this brush with Proraso from the tube.</li>
            <li> Decent shave brush but is still losing bristles after 6 months of use,</li>
            <li> Works well to create a rich lather.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying my escali brush. I owned a cheaper quality brush before this one and I&#x27;m very glad I switched. I&#x27;ve lost a few hairs the first time I shaved but haven&#x27;t since. Which is to be expected. It holds water very well and lathers quite a bit even without tons a shaving soap. I did notice the water turned a little brown when I rinse bur I&#x27;m sure that will stop after a few more shaves. I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell from it like some of the of the other reviews. Honestly I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this brush. I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> It smells like a wild animal.  I thought the smell would go away but it hasn&#x27;t.  I will be buying a new brush.</li>
            <li> Bought a Parker silver tip and I like this escali better. Not too &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and bushy. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect upon ordering this brush. I had ordered it without even looking at the reviews, because at the time I was inexperienced with Amazon and didn&#x27;t think to look.&lt;br /&gt;Now, however, I must agree with most of the reviews in saying that this brush works wonders for its price. It smells like wet badger when it&#x27;s wet (the scent fades a bit after use), but what else is to be expected? The bristles are of medium stiffness, so it still forces soap into your whiskers, but doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;As with most of the other users, I have lost my fair share of bristles; more during the first few uses than after. I usually lose about 1 per shave currently, although I&#x27;m sure that will become less as time goes by. As with any tool, take care of it and it will take care of you. I dry mine upside down on the counter, wedged between a wall and the case it comes in (for about 1 day).&lt;br /&gt;Good product. If you need a brush and are on a budget, get this. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Hands down best brush I have ever owned, it is very soft on the skin, but strong enough to create thick foam.</li>
            <li> I have only used the brush once but thought I would go ahead and write a review. This is my first shaving brush and everything that I read made it clear a badger hair brush is the way to go. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of other brushes made of a lot of other material but I&#x27;ve passed them by regardless of price because I wanted to get  one brush and love it.  I found one badger hair brush that was about half the size of this brush which, by the way, is probably a standard size brush which is a good size to me. so don&#x27;t assume all brushes are the same size. The badger hair bristles did feel good on my face. I think I&#x27;m not using very good soap so although I can&#x27;t blame the brush for the amount of lather I got. It was enough to shave comfortably, but my face did not look like it was covered in Cool Whip. After rincing the soap out of the brush, I noticed that the water was cloudy, almost brown. I don&#x27;t think the brush was dirty or there was badger poop in the water, but I&#x27;m guessing there is a breaking in period for the brush. After shaving a couple strokes I rinsed my razor out and noticed that I had apparently grown badger hair because that&#x27;s partly what rinsed out of my razor. Again, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a breaking in period and those loose hairs will get worked out. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with this brush for a long time and after looking at all the brushes and brush sets I think I chose the best one for the price. Rather than purchase a shaving brush stand I nailed a little picture frame holder to the side of my medicine cabinet and put a screw eye  into the handle of the brush so I can hang the brush from the side of the medicine cabinet. It would have been nice if the packaging was a little more interesting or even included tip sheet on shaving.</li>
            <li> Following a few simple care suggestions and it seems to do OK. Loses a hair once in a while but it isn&#x27;t falling apart by any sense. Rinse, hold brush bristles together and give it a shake, hang in stand. Easy.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great value! This brush is exactly as described and delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> First impression of the brush was great.  The brush was is soft enough on the face not to bother me.  It does tend to lose some bristles each application but has never been a issue for me.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush with low expectations, and boy was I surprised! it holds plenty of water, ensuring you get a great lather. I&#x27;ve noticed a few loose bristles, which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of 5,  but all in all, this brush is worth owning.</li>
            <li> Newly purchased. Works fine for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now since my original cheap brush came apart.  It produces much more foam with my inexpensive soap than the old one &amp; when I used it with shaving lotion, it helped give me the smoothest shave I can remember.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but so far, only a couple of bristles have come out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you - this is a great shaving brush. Super soft bristles and a solid wood handle, this thing rivals other 100% badger shaving brushes that cost 4x more. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the sexier name brands when this will do everything those will and keep your wallet heavier.</li>
            <li> Love using the brush.  I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; way of shaving, but I have to say, it&#x27;s made a difference regarding post-shave comfort.  Shedding a few bristles initially, but that&#x27;s subsided with each use.  I came to understand this was normal after reading a few articles regarding brush shaving.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the way I was shaving prior to using the brush.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I should have thought about this one, and added it to my order from a &amp;#34;frequently bought with&amp;#34; suggestion for the razor I was buying. But it is of course real fur, and it had a persistent wet animal smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I replaced it with a synthetic brush that was odorless and worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Sheds a bit more than I thought it would. But still like it its soft.</li>
            <li> The brush works great. nice an soft. If you are looking for this type of item, it perfect. I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you.</li>
            <li> I just started use a DE razor and whipping up my own lather and this brush is great. Does a wonderful job in creating lather and feels wonder on the skin. Super soft and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Husband switched from boar to this badger brush. Generally satisfied with quality of shave. Has lost a few bristles.   I like it because his face is smooth and I encourage this behavior with kisses.</li>
            <li> Delivered ontime good quality</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used enough shaving brushes to comepare, but this one seems OK. Does the job, isn&#x27;t losing bristles, I am happy with it and it certainly comes at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I bought it as a gift for my teenage son and its handsome style and easy-to-use and care for qualities made it a hit! And I was told it makes shaving fun!</li>
            <li> Works well for about a year and then loses bristles quickly.  If it lasted longer I would give it a full 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> Great addition to shave with. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing but I won&#x27;t shave again without this little badger brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now. Very impressed with the quality. My previous brush would constantly shed and this brush rarely sheds. For those who do not have a stand, I rest mine on its side in my medicine cabinet after using. This seems to keep the bristles happy. Overall, I would highly recommend this brush, it will get the job done. I pair this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College.</li>
            <li> Good brush, good price, I use it every day now.</li>
            <li> Excellent lathering action, and a good feel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With care, this should last for years and years.</li>
            <li> I had never used a safety two edge razor prior to a week ago.  I will never look back.  This brush does exactly what it is intended to do.  Using sandlewood shaving cream with this brush gives a very nice lather.  Also, this brush has a classy look and when applying the lather, it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking to switch to a safety two edge razor, or if you are looking for a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, what a difference it makes when shaving.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! It was like a night and day difference between this brush and my old boar bristle brush. I get lots of good lather and a much better shave.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the price! You could spend three times as much and get something a lot worse than this excellent-quality badger. Soft on dry skin and doesn&#x27;t shed like a spaniel in August. Doubt I could have done better. Very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was a good brush for a cheap price, but it sheds a lot. The other brushes that I own would stop shedding after a month of use, but this one still sheds a hair occasionally. It&#x27;s a good product, but I will probably avoid Escali in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible brush! The reason it has such great ratings is because people switch from cartridge shaving to wet and see this as the number one seller so they buy it (my wife got it for me when she hooked me up with my starter kit because of this).  There is no backbone and it will not stop shedding.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but want a decent brush get an Omega than.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush and does it&#x27;s job. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between badger and boar, other than the color.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase: I don&#x27;t shave every day and have used my new brush approximately a dozen times so far. I LOVE it! Handles well!</li>
            <li> Six months old and the brush fell apart. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> The brush is total junk. All of the hairs are falling out and it is totally useless.</li>
            <li> spreads my shaving soap just fine, but it lose bristles every single time and it forces me to scratch my face while removing the bristle, and then i have to reapply shaving soap to the area. you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush. Worked perfectly the first time and created a great lather. High quality feeling handle and bristles. Easy to rinse out for next usage too. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My wife threw out my first accidentally so I purchased it again. Works well, though bristles do fall out occasionally. Closer shave than without one.</li>
            <li> Quick break in, quality brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Works great. Not too soft. Great little brush. Shed, maybe 3-4 hairs and none since after using this for awhile.</li>
            <li> I first bought this brush years ago and since that time I have bought at least 4 or 5 for gifts. It&#x27;s such an amazing product for the price. My wife even uses one.</li>
            <li> cheap brush bristles keep falling out -dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, lathers well, real soft badger hair, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this brush and vendor</li>
            <li> Recieved fast! Great brush! Very good seller store! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive shaving brush for traveling. I have been very pleased so far with the Escali.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush.  Works well and well made.  Perella&#x27;s is an excellent company to do business with.  They were very helpful and knowledgeable.  I look forward to being a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Really nice little shaving brush for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Received it fast and what a great brush. Very well made and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The Escali shaving brush is exactly what one would expect it to be. It is your basic brush and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The brush broke out/off of the handle during the first use.  It looks like it was cheaply glued into the handle.  I guess this is what you get when you buy the cheapest version of this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush and a great price.  Delivered quickly, packaged well and a bargain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush in an effort to escape the cartridge shaving cycle, and I could not be happier. It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Gentle brush, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Coupled with dreadnought shaving cream, my skin has never looked or felt  better.  Goodbye Gillette!  A big advertising budget can&#x27;t argue with results.  When this brush is used up, will probably upgrade to best (softer) badger bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gel or foam shave creams for a long time and after a demonstration of a pre-shave cream, I decided to change the way I shave, most of it due some skin irritations and ingrown hair. I bought Proraso pre-shave and shave soap and Escali shaving brush. The brush is very soft, does a nice foam and does its job. Of course with an attractive price.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I loved the results: less irritation, smooth face and the shadow lasts long to appear.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want change the way of shaving, old school shaving is totally recommended !!</li>
            <li> Not pleased. Immediately upon usage it started loosing bristles.</li>
            <li> I Have used this a dozen times now, works well, lathers my Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream very well, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, but the brush stinks like an animal. I have soaked it overnight in a vinegar solution to dissipate the smell multiple times, which has helped, but still after a few months,it has a very pungent odor. For this reason, I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s and I just switched to a safety razor. Well, had to get a shave brush too. Very happy with my badger brush, soft and lathers my face well. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I like the look of this brush, but I am still using the old one until it wears out . . .then it is on to this new Badger Shaving Brush.  Looking forward to it.  :)</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money! Has held up nicely so far!</li>
            <li> Bought for Husband. He thinks it is great... a little on the soft side.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.</li>
            <li> This is my first time shaving n i freaking love this brush. A++</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great brush! I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend excessively on my initial brush, soap, safety razor etc. This brush does what it needs to do if you use it correctly. I let it soak in hot water while I&#x27;m in the shower, then hang it to dry when I&#x27;m done. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with bristles falling off and overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> Why pay more?  The brush does everything I ask of it... fortunately, it&#x27;s a simple job.  It dries quickly and without dripping water on my sink and I&#x27;ve only found a couple of hairs on my face but I would expect that on any brush that is new.  After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, but have been nothing but pleased.  After using for several weeks the brush looks like new. ( I rinse after use and hang bristles down.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I have had this brush less than a month, but am pleased with it.  If this changes, I will comment.</li>
            <li> Works great.  No issues.</li>
            <li> Great price on a great brush! Only shed a couple of hairs in the first few uses, afterwards it&#x27;s been perfect.  Prompt shipping from a great seller.</li>
            <li> I have used many brushes in my life time but this one is the best so far. Because it can not be imported in Canada, I assume because of badger hair and perhaps badger being one of the protected animals in Canada.</li>
            <li> Using these brushes can&#x27;t be beat. They really help a lot with application of shaving soap and cream. I use barbasol and a little bowl to lather up with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a full 5 is because it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> Great brush, lathers up quite well. Great experience with seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because of a recommendation from another website. I have to say while I do like it and will continue to use it, its far from ideal. Firstly the brush is a little more coarse then I thought it would be but this is my first badger brush so maybe they&#x27;re all like this but I would like one a little softer on my face. I can live with that though. The handle is made well and very light surprisingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint for this brush has been when it comes to the actual use. It lathers rather poorly and I had around 2 dozen bristles come out when I first went to use it. All in all I would recommend it to other people but only because its the best of only a handful of brushes I have used mostly purchased from drug stores. I am still looking for one that creates an amazing lather and is soft to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again, no.</li>
            <li> No backbone at all and hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my husband along with some Italian soap for shaving.  The brush is great and works the cream into a nice thick lather (maybe I will try it on my legs?!).  It reminds me of the brush my Dad used to use when I was a kid and he had that brush for as long as I can remember. Good quality brush, I am glad I selected this one to buy.  Good price and fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Nice and handy for travel</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the scrilla.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Brush is great, I have been using for about a month and no complaints, does a good job.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush, but I am very impress with the product. It is soft and has a large surface area of use. I look forward to using and appreciating this product in the coming months.</li>
            <li> Great look and feel to this brush prompt delivery too.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect, very well made and really works the lather into the face for &amp;#34;really good shaves&amp;#34; +++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a solid brush but I was expecting a bit better based on other reviews I saw.  Disclaimer - this is the very first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used so I don&#x27;t have a great point of reference.  I was a bit surprised to see that, after only one use, many of the hairs fall off this brush into my shaving cream when I apply it to the brush.  Some hairs even fall out as I use he brush on my face.  Maybe this is something that stops after consistent usage but it&#x27;s a pain to get all those hairs out of my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is my second shaving brush.  I can say that I&#x27;m happy with the way this brush makes lather and glides on my face. The bristle are soft and I think sturdy. I&#x27;m not losing too much bristle when I clean it and comb it once it&#x27;s dry. For the price I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again. I&#x27;m not yet a sophisticated wet shaver so I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this 100% pure badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is stunning, to begin with. It was purchased as a gift and the recipient was very excited to receive it. All of the reviews I read before ordering it were very positive so I felt it was safe to order it. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed because it was as promised. We took it out of the packaging and the bristles are very soft and seem like they will work very well to create a wonderful lather for the purpose of shaving. I&#x27;m glad I did my research!</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Not too hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> Small, comfortable, beautiful copper ring around the shaft. Not to mention, the badger brush itself is excellent soft, spreads evenly and also lathers very well so you can just pull the lather soap right off and hand apply is preferred.......I loved it you guys and thanks bunches!!!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when this brush arrived. The knot stuck up out of the handle into the middle of the brush. Not the quality i expected from Escali.I guess the saying, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34; applies here.</li>
            <li> Super good merchandise.  Fast shipping.  About as good as it gets!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Didn&#x27;t shed much, works great. I am a beginner to safety razor shaving,and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of VERY expensive badger brushes around, but this inexpensive one does the job for a fraction of the cost. A good choice.</li>
            <li> Im new to wet shaving. Decided on purchasing this brush because of positive reviews and low price. I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied for the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to which I can compare, but I can tell you this:  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about two weeks and it seems to do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and although there are many other brushes for more money, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made (I hate when I purchase something and it feels cheap - because it usually means it is) and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap on sensitive my skin.  I was wondering if I was going to see the badger hairs falling out from the handle as I used it but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t happened. I even pull on the hairs every day while cleaning it and still I&#x27;ve not seen any come apart from the handle. So, so far, I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> Bought brush based on suggestion from amazon.  After watching a couple YouTube clips on proper usage (newbie to using a safety razor/shaving balm) use this brush every morning to make a great thick foam. Would absolutely recommend</li>
            <li> I have owned only cheap brushes up until I ordered this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and I love it.  There has been some shedding but only slightly and that is expected after the first couple uses.  Five stars for value and quality.</li>
            <li> While not as soft as I would personally like, but it works great when I shave.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush to assist in shaving 100% pure badgers. It may seem difficult to cut the badger&#x27;s hair with this brush, but persistence is key. Eventually your badger will have the freshest and best shave of all the badgers on your block. Careful though honey badger may pretend not to care, but can be very jealous at the sight of another freshly-shorn badger.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are to hard</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job great and it last a long time. It creates a perfect lather every time and it&#x27;s a really nice looking brush. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny and I highly recommend it. I will buy another one next time for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great, minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and pieces of hair are already falling out. The badger hair stuck to my face and screwed up my shaver.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase a badger brush to try as a person new to wet shaving but did not want to buy something expensive until I knew that it would be worth the investment. As a lot of people say, you get what you pay for. I properly cured this brush before using. I have used this brush quite a few times now and am very disappointed in its performance. 1. It sheds hair with every use. 2. It still has an awful smell. 3. It has absolutely no firmness to it what so ever! Its like trying to apply lather with a wet cats tail! My super cheap seven dollar Van der Hagen boar bristle brush that I purchased at a grocery store is a far superior brush to this crap! Do yourself a favor and do some research in some of the DE/wet shaving websites and invest your money in a better brush!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, super fast shipping!  Feels great, no worries with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality, easy to hold, and very soft. I have since moved to a boars brush for a stiffer bristle but that&#x27;s my evolving personal preferance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beginners brush. I really don&#x27;t understand the complaints about this brush and its quality.  It&#x27;s real badger (not boar) and is priced at $13-14 dollars. Does the brush stink of badger when first used? of course it does even a $100 brush is going to smell bad until it has been cleaned and used awhile. Is it top quality badger and manufacturing? Not really but it&#x27;s just as good as some of the $20.00-$30.00 brushes sold out there.    For those complaining about losing hairs, all brushes lose hair upon first use, my Kent BK8 which many would consider a top of the line brush shed hair the first few weeks, these brushes have literally thousands of badger hairs of course they will shed in the beginning.    It&#x27;s a beginners shaving brush for under $15.00; it works pretty good and would make a fine travel brush when a more high end brush would replace it at home. For those complaining about quality and smell I would have to ask what exactly do you expect for this kind of money.</li>
            <li> First of all, this badger brush looks pretty cool and when you use it to put Shaving Cream, it feels great. The issue is that, I&#x27;m having massive shedding of this brush to the point that its abnormal. When the brush arrived the bristles were all over the place, and that causes an issue when I lather. My face has like 15 bristles every time, I use it and I used it once. I don&#x27;t even have a beard, It takes me 4 days to get a 5 o clock shadow so this shouldn&#x27;t be happening. If this is a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; process, and it gets better, than this will be reviewed once more. If this is normal behavior for this brush, please help me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten 6 months of good service from this brush, and I can&#x27;t see how much more I could get out of one costing $100 or more. I&#x27;ve read a few complaints about several other less expensive brushes, and I really think the issues users had (bristle loss) are because they&#x27;re not soaking the brush in water for several minutes before they shave. After 6 months I see a bristle from time to time, but that&#x27;s all. It lathers the cream, and puts it onto your face before you shave, and it does a decent job of it. Just soak it in hot water to assure it&#x27;s fully hydrated before using. I think you should also let it dry it hanging upside down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good brush for the price. Light shedding when I used it the first couple of times, but it has since stopped. Lathers up nicely and it&#x27;s really soft on my face which I like. Dries back to original shape really well. Make sure you hang it upside down or on its side though to help it maintain it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are prickly and fall out fairly easily.  I will do more research before buying my next one.</li>
            <li> It is an ok shaving brush. What really bothers me is how much it sheds hair. I been using it for a month or so and it is still loosing hair which than get caught in the shaver. The shedding has decreased compared to the first few days; its down to 1 to 2 hairs per shave now. Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> On my quest to go old-school with my shaving I purchased this brush and love it for my daily shaving routine. I find that soaking it a coffee-cup full of hot water for a minute or so prior makes everything much easier. Nice and warm soap lather and softer bristles. It lost quite a few hairs at first but now it&#x27;s working like a champ and nicely broken in.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.  The brush is very soft and works up a great lather.  Would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is same product as advertised. Good quality brush. Loses some bristles at first but no big deal.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that the handle is too short to grip when your hand is wet.  I liked my old brush better.</li>
            <li> Its an entry level brush, nothing amazing but it gets the job done. It loses a bit of hair the first couple times you use it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly from the seller, just as described.  It&#x27;s a good brush for the price, builds a very good lather with a little work.  I have not noticed the musky odor that some others have noted.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush daily for a couple of weeks, and I am very happy. Being new to wet shaving I first made the mistake buying a boar brush at the local drug store. Don&#x27;t buy boar! Boar belongs in hair brushes, not shaving brushes.  The boar was stiff and hard even after soaking in hot water for a few minutes. This brush, costing only 3-4 dollars more, was a spectacular upgrade. Whips up a nice fluffy lather in no time and then applies the lather softly. I first soak the brush for a few minutes in a small ceramic bowl in really hot water (tea pot hot water). Then I pour the water out and shake excess water from the brush, not all. I quirt maybe 3/4 of inch of Proraso cream [...] into the bowl and whip it up. Ready to go. The ceramic bowl retains the heat well so the lather stays nice and hot.  After use I rinse out the brush in running hot water and let it dry hanging down (handle up) so the water doesn&#x27;t pool in the handle. There was some very light shedding, a handful of bristles maybe, the first time I used it, but that was it.</li>
            <li> The brush is full and lightweight without feeling cheap. It is just the right weight for agility and control. I have used it a lot - and in fact, abused it a bit - and the bristles, shape, and finish hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this would be a starter brush for me until I saved up for something more fancy. Having used this brush and travelled with it, I do not plan on trading it in for a different brush. This does everything I need and looks and feels much more expensive than it costs. Not only did it end up being a great brush, it also ended up being a wise investment.</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these and they are nice.  You&#x27;ll loose a few bristles the first couple of times you use them, that&#x27;s normal.  Nice wood handle, nice feel to the bristles</li>
            <li> I carefully checked over this brush comparing it to others. I settled for thi escali  badger hair brush ,and I could not be happier.the hair is just the right stiffness, add lathers up very good. I use proroso shave soap , ( the tube type ) thiis is great stuff. after wetting the brush i squeez out approx. 1/2 &amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34; proroso onto brush and lather my face. you could repeat this lathering 4 times easy without adding anymore proroso . just keep squeezing the escali brush between your thumb and fore finger. this produces lots of lather. Im very satisfied. thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Smelled a little funny at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a badger brush. It didn&#x27;t lose that many hairs when first used, and makes applying shaving soap so much easier than synthetic brushes. I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent value for your money. I found it to be a drastic improvement over the boar hair brush I had been using. I&#x27;ve been sure to care for it correctly by hanging it bristles down in a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it shed a few hairs (I assumed this was normal); it seems to have settled in after just a few shaves. Overall, for the very low price - I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say as I haven&#x27;t exactly checked out the market on badger shaving brushes. But it shipped very quickly (showed up before the razor!) and works really well. Very comfortable and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> so this is my first shaving brush and dont really have any complains,hmmmm maybe one and its that some hairs fall out,very little thought,just got it,good brush for beginners.</li>
            <li> This Badger Shaving Brush is replacing a Boar Bristle one and it is much better. I never had a Badger Brush and now I would not go back to any artificial or natural Boar type. The price is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff but not too scratchy, lifts hairs, and lathers soap well. I would recommend for daily use. Initially lost a few hairs at first use (~50?) but has stopped shedding since then. Used for about a month daily now and no damage to wood handle. Store it bristle down. Don&#x27;t stand on end.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no substitute for badger bristles, in the soap or on the face.  The Escali 100% pure badger bristle shaving brush fulfills it&#x27;s purpose and at the best price available.  A few lost bristles is my only complaint, and only while breaking it in.  Step up from synthetic - buy an Escali.</li>
            <li> This brush offers an amazing value. The price is minimal compared to the quality shave this brush helps to provide. A worthwhile investment, and this brush from this seller is the best value out there.</li>
            <li> So first the good: sharp, pointy bristles produce a nice thick lather and the price is right. Now the bad: this thing smells like a wet badger!  Seriously, it reeks when it gets wet!  If you enjoy smelling like a wet badger, you will LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about six months now.  It replaces an Art of Shaving Badger brush that mysteriously disappeared.  The Escali is very similar to my old brush; it loses a lot of hairs at first.  This lasts a month or so and then you don&#x27;t lose as many.  It also takes a couple weeks a breaking in until it starts producing its best lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback that I see is the wooden handle.  The finish is starting to chip on my brush.  Now, keep in mind, I don&#x27;t hang my brush upside down, like recommend.  I dry it as best I can and then lay it on its side.  With that being said, I knew what I was getting into when I purchased the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it.  I&#x27;ve purchased a second one for my brother, if that tells you anything.</li>
            <li> Considering how damn expensive and fancy these brushes get, I want to point out that this brush is an exceptional value. The quality of the bristles are great - it creates a nice rich lather and are just rough enough to exfoliate the skin. If dried properly (hanging freely upside down) the bristles dry perfectly resulting in a nice bloom effect. The wood handle is easy to hold and looks nice. Although it can be a bit on the small end in larger hands, it is good enough for me. The \\&quot;escali\\&quot; name on the front leads one to believe it&#x27;s an Italian product, however I&#x27;m not sure this is in fact true as there is no indication on the product page or on the product itself as to where it&#x27;s manufactured. So, it may be \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; but whatever - a badger is a badger no matter what the country. Enjoy this brush and be proud of yourself for not wasting upwards of $50 on something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush twice, and it is shedding like crazy.  It&#x27;s got a very strong chemical smell which has faded a little after washing it a few times.  Otherwise it&#x27;s soft, and works up a good lather.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.   Update: I was contacted by the company after posting my first review.  I was sent a replacement free of charge.  The replacement is great.  The quality is excellent, and it does not shed.  There is no chemical smell either.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush, and much more satisfied with Perella&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn good. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a 100 dollar brush, so it won&#x27;t make a thick lather in a few seconds, but if you take care of it (READ: DO NOT LET TRY WOOD DOWN. HANG TO DRY). It will last, and make great lathers and feel FANTASTIC on your face.  You will feel like a man using old school wet-shaving methods, and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> So far very nice. It lost a lot of brisltes the first couple times but now seems good. Great price.</li>
            <li> Practical and understated. It does job well.</li>
            <li> This is an ok brush for the money but not great. Smelled fairly strong like wet animal initially - which is not unusual for a natural brush, but this continued for the first three weeks of near daily use which seemed longer than with other brushes. Loses hairs fairly regularly despite being well cared for.</li>
            <li> For context, this is only the second badger brush that I have used and the first was from The Art of Shaving (which, apparently, set a very high expectation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product once, briefly, my sink was left with an uncomfortable amount of bristles from this brush. The experience of applying shave cream with this brush did not feel &#x27;right,&#x27; and I can&#x27;t expect this brush to last more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth it to spend the extra money and get what you pay for when it comes to shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived well packaged and in nice shape.  I love the wood handle and it looks great on my shaving stand.</li>
            <li> Great brush. No issues!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but it does it&#x27;s job. The price is fair, but it does loose hairs like some other people have said.</li>
            <li> I was pleased right away at the softness of the brush and enjoyed the fact that the bristles retain their shape in application.  Ensure you follow the drying instructions provided with the brush so that it maintains its shape!  Great brush for the money--  super high quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. I&#x27;m new to old style safety razor shaving (have always used multi-blade ones). The brush makes all the difference in a thick lather. I do wonder if it is normal for the brush to lose bristles as quickly as this has (after only a few shaves it seems to &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; all the time).</li>
            <li> Works very well, and very affordable</li>
            <li> I recently decided to upgrade my shaving experience after being unsatisfied with using cartridges. In combination with a good DE razor and some decent shaving soap, this was a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little prickly at first but once wet that goes away and it makes lathering up much easier and cleaner. It holds lots of water and soap and I have have not had any problem with hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does need to be wrung out after use and kept stored upside down so water doesn&#x27;t collect in the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of safety razor shaving, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this brush to, but ice used it for a week now and it does a good job of whipping up a nice lather and feels great brushing it onto my face. The price seems great, and I can&#x27;t imagine anything this brush can&#x27;t do that another one could.</li>
            <li> I got tired of shaving with the fussion razor and did some research and bought thr murker 34c and this nice brush along with it. It works great. some of the reviews say it is a little frickly but I think it suppose to be in order to clean the face and get those hairs to stand up. I am blind and enjoy using this razor and brush. Make your shaving an enjoyable experience and get yourself one of these</li>
            <li> So far a nice brush. Hope it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used the Escali brush for several days and it works well. Very soft and odor free. I will review again after a few months to make sure the brush holds up well.</li>
            <li> It was a very affordable brush, but it was to mushy on the face. This would be a good starter brush, but not a very stiff brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it is good. It foams well. For the first two uses, I had some string coming out, but now none of them do.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush for my husband as part of a Valentine&#x27;s gift basket.  He has just started shaving with the shaving soap and a double edge razor.  This brush has held up pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and the bristles have not lost their shape after a lot of use.  It looks very expensive and it has a nice weighty feel.  I would recommned it to a friend.</li>
            <li> After using a boar hair brush, this badger hair brush has been all I wanted.  Works up a good smooth lather with little effort.</li>
            <li> Bristles come out a little easier than I care for but overall, this is a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush. Bristles are reasonably soft. After a few came out at first I have had none falling out on me. Seeing as how some badger brushes go for $60+ I am very happy with the quality at this price. Bristles are nice and full just as pictured as well.</li>
            <li> If we here in America knew about shaving with this brush, we would have been using it from day 1. Highly recommend this product and the company from which it came. Use Italian shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> I do give this awesome brush a 5 star rating, because it is a well made product, that functions exactly as describes. That being said, I have lost a few strands within a few weeks of purchase, but besides that, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, so I can&#x27;t compare it, but I am happy with how it functions.  It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that I don&#x27;t feel like it lifts my whiskers, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to drop too many hairs.</li>
            <li> Loses some hair every time I shave, but for the $, hard to find a better value. Nice later from regular soap, smell of badger was stronger when I first got it, but now after a year it is barely there. (Or maybe my nose is dead?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper care (drying), I think it should last me another 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> The bristles started falling out after using it for 2 months.  My previous supermarket cheapy went 9 years and still had more hair than I.  The plastic handle broke so I bought this wood loser</li>
            <li> This is the real deal old school brush with quality. I used for 7 months still looks new.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush.  Seems to do the trick.  However, this is my first brush and I&#x27;ve only been wet shaving for a couple of months now.  Only negative is that the brush is still loosing bristles occasionally.  I figured this would happen with a new brush, but it&#x27;s a little beyond that point now.  Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t continue.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brush prior to this one at my local drug store.  What a mistake that was!  This is a fantastic brush, the speed of delivery was also great.  I high recommend that you purchase this brush, from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Brush is really really good. Works very well with market shaving creams.</li>
            <li> It works.  It&#x27;s soft and effective.  My friend recommended it because he loves his so much.  Rubbing it against your face brings so much pleasure to shaving.</li>
            <li> This brush works great! It takes a few times of usage to get the smell off it but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> Very good product for the money</li>
            <li> brush fell apart a few mouth in. now i just hold the badger hare with my hand.</li>
            <li> Bought it maybe 2 months ago. Initially a lot of the hairs would come loose and for a while I worried that all the hairs would fall out. After several shaves that stopped happening and it has been a solid brush so far. Only current complaint is that the waterproof plastic layer over the wood is slowly peeling off but as of yet that hasn&#x27;t had any negative impacts to my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have used a brush and shaving cream to prepare for a shave.  You know what? Shaving is now a joy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brush,reminds me about the old days.</li>
            <li> It seems to drop a lot of hairs, but it&#x27;s still going strong now past the one year mark.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old brush, which served me well for two years but was cheap and fell apart.  Unfortunately, this brush has a scent to it that my male cat finds irresistible.  I had to order a new shaving bowl because he knocked my old one out of the cabinet in pursuit of this brush.  I have found it, in the living room, the hallway, and the office.  We now have to keep the bathroom door closed 24/7 to keep him away from the brush which he apparently views as either prey or a toy, or both.  I love the brush, but those who share their homes with felines should beware!</li>
            <li> A great beginner shaving brush... great value! I&#x27;ve just started wet shaving and needed a brush. I read all the reviews on different brushes and what they were made of... decided to purchase this brush, based on the many reviews. I am very pleased with the performance of this little badger brush by Escali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush for awhile now... and feel this brush is an excellent starter brush... and will give many years of good service!</li>
            <li> This product is decent. Worth the cost. If I&#x27;d&#x27;ve paid $25-$100+ (what other quality badger shaving products go for) I would expect better quality and not expect hairs to come loose regularly. So to sum up, the quality is ok. Worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li> After owning for a year, this whole time I have been losing hairs from the brush in my shave soap/cream and they come loose on my face or stick in the shave soap. Not sure if this is common or not but I don&#x27;t like for this to happen  Original post: Much softer than my original brush from another company (it may have been a boar hair brush). I really like it and use it with shave soap.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. I&#x27;ve had it for two years and it is still in good shape.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush, not impressed. It knots up in the middle over time when you lather up shave soap, etc. These knots wont comb out they pull out. It sheds nonstop, be prepared to lift off brush hairs from your face after applying shave soap, etc. Have since been using the Omega boar hair brush. The Omega does not knot and it rarely sheds brush hair. I prefer the Omega boar hair shave brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use one and ordered 3 as gifts this year.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, no funky smell. Soft bristles and evenly spreads the shaving cream or paste.  Make sure to rinse well and hang with bristles down to dry.  It is well made and I would happily purchase again.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job as intended; as this is the first time I used brush &amp; cream, I can&#x27;t be a more critical judge - I see no great hair loss, no offensive odor or any other negatives as read in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it is comfortable and leaves a nice lather. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! I wanted a pure badger hair brush without the steep price. I have used it multiple times and I love it. Thanks for a great product with a very fair price!</li>
            <li> The Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush is an exceptional shaving brush. It took a bit of time to break it in, but that is the beauty of it. I have been shaving with brushes for years and can highly recommend this one. It lathers up beautifully, dries perfectly and is quite durable. It also fits in the hand very nicely. The price for this type of brush is amazingly economical. My overall impression is smooth, I get a smooth and clean shave. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but I&#x27;m not convinced badger hair is any better than synthetic.</li>
            <li> All shaving brushes have a slight odor because they do come from a badger but the odor diminishes over a very short period of time. But this brush smelled like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I wish I had started using this years ago.</li>
            <li> Just a great as the more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> I like the Badger Shaving Brush. Good quality for the money.  Works well. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell. Yes it smells like a wet dog at first, but it goes away quickly and is honestly not that bad. Even a mild shave cream or soap will cover the smell for the first couple of uses till it goes away. At least you know it&#x27;s real badger hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the brush was a little rough on my face and lost a number of bristles for the first week or so and picking them out of the shave soap was very annoying. After the first week however it softened up considerably and I rarely lose any bristles now. Using circular motions creates more of an exfoliating feeling from the brush while up/down or back/forth motions feel really soft and produce a wonderful lather with my Proraso Shave Soap. If you want to break in the brush quickly you can always mix up some lather on the brush and let it sit overnight, rinse well in the morning and it should be much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some discoloration of the wood around the knot (where the bristles meet the handle), as well wear around the top edge of the handle, as if the finish is wearing off, not sure how the brush will hold up long term but I didn&#x27;t buy it expecting it to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush for anyone starting with DE shaving, or just looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush.  Not much to add except it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  It makes my Art of Shaving cream last about 10 times as long since now I need so little and the brush lathers it up so well and spreads it evenly.  Get it!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great deal if just need to get the job done. A badger hair brush with a solid feel at a great price.</li>
            <li> too soft.. just flops around.. doesn&#x27;t make a lather because the bristles just flop like a wet mop.. completely disappointing... my 12 dollar fake brush works 10 times better.. looks ok on the stand.. that&#x27;s all i can say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times but it seems to get better each time. I only lost couple of bristles the first couple of times and lost none the last few times. It mixes lather great and its easy on the face. I&#x27;m hoping to have this brush for a long time as I am very happy with it. And with its price......wow!</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product that should for years of comfortable shaves.  The bristles seem to be very securely held in the handle.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this brush, if you are just starting out with double edge safety razor shaving, this is a perfect brush to learn on.  Later you can invest or ask for Xmas for a more expensive brush when you turn in to a wet shaving geek - like we all do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions that are on the reviews and the internet to learn how to properly whip up shaving cream -soap lather, and especially how to clean your brush (run under water till clean, blot dry on towel, put in brush holder - handle up to dry - brush down).</li>
            <li> This Brush is amazing, its soft feels good on your face. When it dries it is still soft, cleans easy. love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, who has been brush shaving for years. When his old brush finally needed to be replaced, I chose this one as a birthday gift . He has been pleased with it so far, which has been about a month and a half now. I selected the brush from others for it&#x27;s price value, it&#x27;s looks, and seemingly good construction. I guess I chose well according to the user!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to get started with safety razor shaving. I&#x27;ve always heard that real badger hair is the best, and so I went with this brush. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than any other brush out there, because this is the only brush I&#x27;ve ever tried. But I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with this brush, and I couldn&#x27;t expect anything more. It&#x27;s light, but seems solid. It lost a few hairs initially, which I hear this is normal, and I haven&#x27;t lost any hairs since the first week. I&#x27;ve been storing it with a brush stand, which I would recommend to buy for any brush.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the $10 brush everybody starts out with.&lt;br /&gt;Wish somebody would have pointed me to this Escali brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with construction of this brush for me. I use&lt;br /&gt;very hot water on the brush but only submerge the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this brush along with Merkur razor and Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and good is hard to do. Escali seems like they pulled it off.</li>
            <li> Do not be intimidated by the name... although the brush is 100% pure badger, it is only badger fur, not the entire beast.  I find that lathering with just the fur of a badger is much easier than using the entire animal.  Badgers are not known for their polite disposition.  The brush arrived on time and is of great quality for the price. I would recommend this item, especially over using live badger.</li>
            <li> I purchased two Escali Pure Badger shaving brushes through Amazon with plans of presenting them to my grandsons. I have not used them myself but after inspecting them they appear to be of quality brissel and compared to the brush I use myself they appear to be a quality brush.</li>
            <li> It looks great and works well. Love it! Oh and you can use normal shaving cream with it too - you don&#x27;t *need* the solid stuff. Just spray it on and dab away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few brush and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First use &#x3D; badger hair mixed in with the cream. I was surprised that all the hair was falling off at the first use - this never happens. I am not too happy so far and probably will go back to my old brushes - they don&#x27;t shed like this Escali.</li>
            <li> Granted I&#x27;ve only used the brush twice, but I can&#x27;t believe this product will suddenly redeem itself.  First time I used it it instantly produced a bad odor when I got it wet, then when I whipped up my lather I had a bowl full of mediocre lather and probably 30 badger hairs.  I rinsed the bowl clean and whipped up a new lather only to find the same results.  I tried the brush the next day to see if I could have a better experience.  Unfortunately the results were the same.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection, but I was expecting a decent product.  Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m currently shopping for a new brush.</li>
            <li> Update 1/30/16: Still going strong.     I have been more than satisfied with this brush.  I use it on my head and face.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s held up wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised and I really can&#x27;t complain at all. Price was extremely reasonable and this is a very well built shaving brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  It really holds the lather well and it isn&#x27;t overly hard against the skin.  Great product, great service, too!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good brush, lathers well but just a little big.</li>
            <li> After years of paying more and more money for more and more blades in my razor and more and more formulations of canned shaving cream, I decided to get back to basics.  Although it&#x27;s more work to whip up some shaving cream with this brush than to push the button on the top of a can, I find the process somehow more satisfying and the resulting cream more effective than modern alternatives.  This brush seems perfect for the job.  The bristles keep their shape and the brush rinses out quickly and completely when I&#x27;m finished.  Sure I&#x27;d buy it again, but it may last so long that i don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Not fancy or showy but nice bristles that stay in place. I also find that the feel of wood is nicer than that of plastic or metal for these brushes.</li>
            <li> A nice brush. Easy to clean. Can&#x27;t go back to the plastic types ever again. a a a a a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a decent enough first brush for getting introduced to wet shaving. It&#x27;s not a great brush but it fits the bill for being cheap and getting you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a good lather with the brush. It has a nice combination of softness and roughness at the same time. In the month I&#x27;ve used it, it loses hair with each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a quality brush, this fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works perfectly, easy to hydrate in the mornings.</li>
            <li> An excellent brush.  Takes a little breaking in, but lathers up well.  Little to no bristle loss.</li>
            <li> For the price this is really good. Only a few hairs dislodged on the first few uses but after multiple uses it is still holds up. Very well made with high-quality badger bristles. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> First time using the brush I had hair falling out of it before I even put any shaving cream on my face with it. I feel it will wear out and therefore am not saving any money by buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Some hair fell out when I first started using it, but after the break in it stopped shedding. If you&#x27;re looking for a shave brush, this is it.</li>
            <li> it is losing a few bristles now and then, but I still like it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it very much... the brush is a good quality brush, the bristles are not falling out...he has used it many times and its still nice and soft. He is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby for his first attempt at using a safety razor. It&#x27;s very soft and easy to clean. So far he has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Ok I know nothing about shaving brushes, and as a result I may be complaining about something that is normal even with expensive brushes but if I have to remove from my face more hair from the brush than the hair from my face then I&#x27;m not using brushes ever again. Now if this is an issue with cheap brushes then go buy something more expensive trust me you going to hate this problem of the brush loosing hair and getting stuck on your face and the shaving cream. Now if this is not an issue not even with the cheap brushes then this brush sucks badly.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this for Christmas, and so we ordered in time to take it road tripping with us to open there.  It was wonderful, he loves it, and it was shipped in a timely fashion and well-packed.  I would certainly do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is probably a good brush for the price, especially since it&#x27;s the first one I bought and I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out more money for something nicer until I had the hang of things. Overall, it mostly does the job but I definitely want to upgrade soon. It smelled really funny at first, (like wet dirty animal) which made the fist couple of weeks of use somewhat unpleasant. The smell eventually dissipated. I expected to lose a few hairs on the first few uses but the brush is still shedding hair after a month and a half of daily use. They get all over the sink and stuck to my face. I&#x27;m not sure how long the brush will last at this rate. I&#x27;m also having a difficult time working a lather up with it, which may be user error but also seems to be a design issue. After lathering the brush in my hand or in a cup, there&#x27;s shaving cream in it but it doesn&#x27;t transfer well to my face. All of the shaving cream seems to move to the outside of the brush rather than the tips of the bristles. If I strip the bristles with my fingers there&#x27;s plenty of shaving cream but if I rub it on my skin the lather doesn&#x27;t really do much. Maybe denser bristles would help move the soap from the area where the hair meets the handle to the end of the bristles. I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I buy my second, hopefully better, shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best hands down. Keeps it shape and distributes soap evenly. I highly recommend this great product!</li>
            <li> I looked ALL over for a badger hair shaving brush for my husband and found that they were mostly overpriced, or difficult to find individually (sold outside a shaving kit). This brush is perfect and, even better, they were able to ship it to me very quickly so I&#x27;d have it in time to add to my husband&#x27;s stocking. I&#x27;d definitely trust this seller again... especially if I needed a gift ASAP.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush performs well. It&#x27;s very functional and has lasted me six months already. The only complaints I could make concern the initial uses of the brush. The bristles were too firm and slightly pokey the first couple times I used the brush on my face, but that problem soon faded after a dozen uses or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t say the brush is extremely comfortable by any means, it&#x27;s soft enough for my delicate skin and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it! Bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Got the brush for my husband since he recently switched to a double-edge razor and wanted a better lather. He really enjoys it. I would recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> No the best brush. Better to find a better brand. Also, no matter how long you use it, clean it, or dry it, it has an awful smell.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money.  I have used it twice and a few of the bristles are falling out.  For the money, though, I couldn&#x27;t have gotten another badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Soft brush, a little small but definitely feels good on the face. Not sure I like the handle design but if you&#x27;re hanging it on a rack it makes sense. Good brush overall</li>
            <li> I know this is old school, but I truly enjoy using this brush when I shave!!! It&#x27;s soft and comfy. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It had been more than 30 years from my last experience with a DE razor, when i decided to give wet shaving a shot again.  After reading a lot of reviews on brushes I decided to start on the  lower cost. This one seemed like a safe bet. Turned out to  be a great buying decision. When i got it I made a couple of batches of lather to see how well the soap  foamed. I would recommend the same  to anyone who has a new brush. It helps get rid of a lot of the loose hairs. By my third shave, it stopped shedding hair. By the end of the second week of use you could see a nice bloom shape on the dried brush. I have used it to lather my face directly and used a bowl. It worked very well in both instances. While I  am curious as to why someone would $50+ for a bush and how it would feel on my face, I would spend the money on something else. I have been using it for 2 months now and am very happy with the value  i got with this brush.</li>
            <li> Have used for over 2 years. Works well! Bought a second one to go in my travel bag as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my son. It&#x27;s comparable to a much more expensive brush I bought for myself years ago. I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> The surface is not as smooth as in other more expensive brushes and it lost more bristles than I expected during the first uses. However, it produces a very good lather for a brush in this price tag.</li>
            <li> for just $12 you cant go wrong,its attractive  and works just fine,it looses a couple hairs now and then but for 12 bucks i,am not worried about it,i clean it real good and let it dry out completely before using and i,ll get some serious use out it,will purchase again when the time comes.     /////////   2 years later and it still is holding together ,bought at $12,what a steal!</li>
            <li> I wanted to start wet shaving so I wanted a shaving brush. But once I wet it smells like something is burning. When I use my shaving cream or gel, the brush still smells bad and I don&#x27;t want it on my face. Barring the smell the brush does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine earlier who is really into the art of shaving. He commended on its styling and construction so much that I bought one for myself as well. It&#x27;s really an excellent product not just for its price but as overall value. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> when I read all the reviews on here I was pretty confident I was getting a quality brush. When I first opened it it was all frizzy and looked like it was used before they put it in the package. When I went to use it to lather up I was disappointed to see how much bristles came out. I thought ok maybe this is just normal for the first couple of uses. Well after about 2 weeks I cant say it has improved all that much. The brush is soft but sometimes i feel like it was a bit prickly to my face.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the Escali as my daily shaving brush, I pulled it out and noticed that the badger hairs in a few areas had bound together in clumps.  I realized that this was glue that had traveled up past the handle into the hairs.  I had to use a flathead screw driver to break apart the excess glue among the hairs.  The brush barely lathered before that fix.  My item may have been a one off quality control problem.  After the fix, the brush works fine, other than the glue problem I have no complaints on its performance.  The brush has shed a bit of hairs but that is to be expected in this price point.  I would recommend it as a starter brush, but there are alot of other options in this range.</li>
            <li> This is my first animal hair brush.  I had used a couple of synthetic brushes.  not sure if i notice much difference between real and synthetic but this is a good brush for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product,,  Arrived when stated,&lt;br /&gt;Quality of brush is good&lt;br /&gt;Would have been better if it included a stand, as has to be left upside down to dry</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, but I am wonderfully satisfied with it over against the boar brush I have used in the past. The price is right on this item, and the service by Perella&#x27;s was fantastic. I would not hesitate to recommend this brush or this small business!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Good price.  Fast service.  So very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot.  It holds just enough water to make adding the cream easy without making a wet mess of things.  It might be a tad rough for sensitive skin but it does exactly what I need it to reliably.</li>
            <li> This brush is holding up well.  It was prickly at the beginning, when new, but is softening with use and does not shed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience for comparisions, but this seems like a very nice brush, and well worth what I paid. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why badger hair was so essential to making a good lather until I tried it; it holds in moisture between the hairs that other synthetic hairs simply can&#x27;t, making a rich lather that you can apply right next to the grain of your beard that you can&#x27;t with your fingers alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care to let it drip dry brush side down so the wood doesn&#x27;t crack from moisture!</li>
            <li> Not the best badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used, a bit coarse and uneven.  But for $12, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He likes it a lot better than his last shaving brush.  The bristles are softer and don&#x27;t fall out.  For the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, and it&#x27;s exactly what is promised in the description. Not as pricey as some, but still really great quality. Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The last brush my husband had fell apart in weeks- he seems to like this one much more!  He&#x27;s had it just over a month and no shedding yet.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these as gifts at Christmas time.  15 of them!  They look very nice, and seem to be great quality.  Although I haev not used it personally!</li>
            <li> This brush feels really nice on the skin, and is well constructed. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about six months with no problems. Other reviews mentioned the adhesive comes undone, but as long as you let it dry bristles down, you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> basically as expected item.  4 stars because its a little smaller than expected but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;You need a stand or have to lay it down on its side.</li>
            <li> This is a fine little brush and will give you a solid lather without much work. While it isn&#x27;t top of the line Silvertip Badger, the badger hair in this brush provides a rich wet lather with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> As I only allow the finest of badger fur to touch my skin, this product is quite satisfactory. It&#x27;s smooth badger fur carcasses my face every morning in a way that camel hair brushes could only dream of. I highly recommend this product for the gentleman who can appreciate the finer things in life.</li>
            <li> It seems okay, smooth and soft and easy to clean thus far.  I will see how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> Poor quality bristles. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Nice; some bristles have begun to fall out, but otherwise a fine brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a shaving brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the face but the hairs can be a bit prickly. I recommend soaking the badger hair in shave soap/cream and water overnight to help remedy this minor problem.</li>
            <li> I like the brush! Bristles don&#x27;t come out and it gets the job done nicely. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these brushes for well over a year and really love it. Since I started shaving my head in addition to my face I want lots of lather, and I want it to last. Using this brush with Proraso or Trumper shave cream gives me a great shave. It&#x27;s very easy to clean. Only precaution is to store it with the bristles down - easy enough with a rubber band wrapped around a small towel rod. I just bought a second for my step-son.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-prickly, pokes a lot&lt;br /&gt;-shed a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion worth it for the price but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Dad! He loved it! Said, it changed his shaving experience. Recommended it to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but will not WOW you</li>
            <li> Very good for the money</li>
            <li> This brush will replace my current badger bristle brush. It seems to be a well made brush.&lt;br /&gt;My current brush is approaching 9 years old. I lose a few bristles a week. So, it is wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;This new brush was about half the cost of the old one.&lt;br /&gt;JF</li>
            <li> The best badger brush available for the price!</li>
            <li> The brush is great once all the loose bristles are gone.</li>
            <li> Had for two years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I had never used one of these before but was told that I should on account that I get horrible ingrown hairs. Between switching to a safety razor and using this brush, I get ingrown hairs about 3% as often as I used to. And as a bonus, it feels pretty cool when your applying the shaving cream too!!!</li>
            <li> Its a brush...that does brush things. Good job.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush feels really nice on my skin. Excellent quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, just what I needed and just as good as the expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> This brush irritates my face.  Not a very sturdy brush either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several brushes and this one seems like the best one yet. Great price, great quality, delivered quickly. With my other brushes the bristles came unglued and fell off, seemingly due to moisture. Time will tell if that will happen with this brush but it seems better put together than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Affordable and does everything the more expensive brushes do - fast shipping and zero complaints!</li>
            <li> very good brush good value</li>
            <li> This brush makes luxurious lather.  Very nice shaves as a result.  Good price point compared to other pure badger brushes.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for hubby. He likes that it lathers well. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush! Have recently started using this and Taylor of old bond street shaving cream and love it. Much more economical than canned shaving crème, just as good, and I like the old time ritual. Reminds me of my grandpa.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so I can&#x27;t compare to any others. I educated myself on what I should look for and what to expect. For an entry level brush that I wanted to be of quality and last - it has filled the bill. It really has done a good job for me and I would buy again. I didn&#x27;t have the loss of a lot of hairs as I had read was normal - there were only a few the very first few times.  I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any doubts.</li>
            <li> Product great for my husband.  He now loves the shaving soap and brush instead of the aerosol shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This brush takes a little getting used to if you&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before. Used in circles it is a bit prickly (a good thing as it makes your hairs stand on end) Light weight, medium quality, great for the price. It has a gold ring below the bristles.</li>
            <li> Great value for money.  I have brushes multiple times more expensive than this without any noticeable difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very big brush so keep that in mind.  The brush is very soft and does a decent job of working a lather but the hairs clump very quickly.  I have mine on a stand, upside down and still the hairs clump like crazy.  It&#x27;s an OK brush and if you can get it cheap it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality brush and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great so far.  Using this with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  This is my first shaving brush and I love the feel (not too soft, not too coarse).  No problems with bristles falling out ( I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve actually seen any).  I&#x27;m hanging it to dry using the Perfecto Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand and it looks like new each morning.</li>
            <li> The Badger used for this Brush must have had alopecia. It sheds bristles with very use. They get all over you face, neck, hands and sink. If that wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason not to buy this product, the laminated clear coating on the wooden handle has delaminated and is peeling off like a 2-day old Sunburn.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with my soaps and creams. It&#x27;s my first badger brush, I&#x27;ve never owned a boar or synthetic brush either so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say it does build a great lather quickly. After the break in period the animal smell went away and I enjoy using it with every shave. If there is anything negative that I&#x27;ve noticed it would have to be the fact that it loses a bristle or two into the mixing bowl almost every time I use it. Great starter brush as far as I&#x27;m concerned, maybe one day I&#x27;ll upgrade to a silvertip but at the moment I see no need to spend $100+, but given this works so well I&#x27;m curious to see what all the fuss is about with premium fine badger brushes.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this brush!  I use shave soap and it&#x27; holds a good amount of water to create a nice thick lather quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading many reviews, and I had hoped that my experience would be like the majority.  Unfortunately I was part of the minority that had a brush that shed like crazy.  I lost something like 15-20 hairs the first use and a few more reliably on each use.  Now the shaving brush looks seriously deformed and patchy when it should be in full bloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed and upset, and as an additional factor, the musky animal smell has remained after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> This is my first entrance to using a shaving brush so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  I&#x27;ve had this item for about 3 weeks.  It is soft yet still stimulating when applying shave lotion/cream.  A few hairs came out the first time I shaved, but this was not unexpected.  It holds moisture well so I don&#x27;t have to constantly wet it to mix with the shave lotion.  Overall a great price for a great product!! I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to use but the two star i deducted, the bristles are falling apart and it&#x27;s only the first use. Good brush, small and easy to use but hopefully for others it&#x27;s just my brush that has that problem.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for maybe 5 weeks now and have had no issue with it. For the first week or so bristles would come off regularly but it is quite rare now. Note that I am properly handing it up on a stand (lucky find at a Goodwill for $2) rather than just setting it on its base or side when not using it. I have heard that storing a brush with the bristles facing up like that can significantly shorten its life, so bare that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this has been an excellent purchase and a good price</li>
            <li> I have not used this brush as much as I thought I would because hairs kept falling out.  Also, I am not sure if it is the brush or me that is not able to whip of the shaving cream adequately.</li>
            <li> I rated this brush with a 5-star rating only because of how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;. . . . . . . . . . .&lt;br /&gt;However, the bristles still had the dirty wild animal grime in them and I had to use a concoction of boiling water with borax, washing soda, dish soap and 91% rubbing alcohol.  When I did this, the watery concoction of cleaner turned a dirty dark brown, like poo-water.  The smell was that of a dirty badger.  I&#x27;ve skinned them before so I know.  I had to change the watery cleaning concoction three times to get the smell out, until the water stayed clear.  Then rinsed it well.&lt;br /&gt;Now that the brush is actually clean, the smell is completely gone and it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine what would have happened if I had taken it straight to my face from the package.  LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. It holds up great and gets the job done. Very good brush for the price, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape well.  I kind of flattens out.  Besides that it smells bad</li>
            <li> Smooth face here. Good for a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; shaver. Everything has their snobs, and this is a good one for none of those ppl.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time and undamaged. Dig it!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. A few hairs fell out the first time I used it, but after that it&#x27;s been pretty solid. The badger hair is decently firm, but soft. Feels great!</li>
            <li> An excellent badger brush at an excellent price.  Here are my personal observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Excellent quality and price&lt;br /&gt;+ Soft bristles with only minor break-in required&lt;br /&gt;+ Nice wooden handle that fits perfectly in my shaving stand&lt;br /&gt;+ Holds a lot of water&lt;br /&gt;+ Bristles are finer than horse or boar hair so are more densely packed into the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Slight musky odor typical of all natural bristle brushes (vanishes with time and use and not unexpected)&lt;br /&gt;- Minor shedding with first few uses (also not unexpected)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Rounded head of bristles can be a little different to use versus a flat or fan-shaped cut&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; The Escali name is upside-down when the brush is hanging in my stand, but definitely not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent choice for a basic shaving item,  If you were ever interested in using a badger hair brush for the first time then this is a very good choice considering the low cost and high quality.  It was shipped very fast and I would choose it again.</li>
            <li> this is my first genuine badger hair shaving brush, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier by both the purchase and the reliability of the vendor (Perella&#x27;s).  I also ordered the razor/brush stand it&#x27;s a thing of beauty and well-priced...</li>
            <li> Its just OK. For the price can&#x27;t complain. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is the second shave soap brush that I have owned. The first had synthetic bristles and a plastic handle. This brush lathers well and gets under facial hair just as well. I recommend it for those wanting a good brush with out spending lots of money.</li>
            <li> i do not have enough experience with brush quality to give it 5 stars. It has lost a few bristles and a couple are jutting out on the sides but that might be normal.</li>
            <li> This brush does everything that other brushes costing 5 times as much do.</li>
            <li> Good brush. Spread shave cream good. Badger Badger Badger.</li>
            <li> Wow, Using a badger brush makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this brush is good, and the weird &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; smell weans in about 2 to 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush that does the job and lasts a really long time. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this brush is Great. I rubber band the hairs when I travel and the shape is maintained.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft touch and feel. Totally enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Real garbage. Hairs falling out constantly and was super hard to get the roadkill smell out of it. There&#x27;s a reason that this is on reddit&#x27;s wicked edge&#x27;s bad gear list.</li>
            <li> Overall a good quality brush with only a few loose hairs.  The brush did have that &#x27;animal&#x27; smell at first which required some conditioning to get rid of... not really too hard, just look on YouTube for how to break in a badger brush and you&#x27;ll find videos explaining the process.  I&#x27;m still trying to determine which is better for me (badger vs. boar).</li>
            <li> Love the brush, so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable brush definitely gets a good lather on my head.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I have to say, for a first one this ain&#x27;t half bad! I actually enjoy lathering my face with shaving cream now!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever shave brush so I cannot really compare it to much. However I really like this one and its quality. You cannot beat it for the price and durability. I shave every morning and I use this along with my shave cream and I have had no issues with it. When it is time for me to get a new one I will more then likely purchase this same one.</li>
            <li> This is a great badger hair brush for the price. It brought the soap up to foam like a champion and felt nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  The wood handle is nice looking and bristles are soft.  This was the first shaving brush I purchased and could not be happier.  I can&#x27;t see the need to pay more.</li>
            <li> This brush shed more than my dog when her coat changes for the winter months, returned.</li>
            <li> Really lathers up nicer than the synthetic brushes</li>
            <li> Very pleased w your product and service</li>
            <li> Low quality but cheap.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving brush, especially for the price.  Makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month. It works well. hold up well to the daily use. And was pretty cheap too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been drying it with the Colonel Conk brush stand ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00764EF6I/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) which travels with me everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And have been storing it in a leather pouch ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M3B8W4/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) that has doen a great job at protecting it...</li>
            <li> This was my first brush I purchased and It gets the job done well but is a little prickly. I got this as my first brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much and overall I am pleased, but this would not be a choice I would make as a long term purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it is everything i expected. For someone who wants to get into a more classic style of shaving it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about 4 months now and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it. It creates a good lather, doesn&#x27;t smell, and feels great. I&#x27;ve only had one issue with it, it loses hair faster than I do.  I have only about 40% of the brush left. Each time I shave, I loose between 8-15 hairs (on the brush) and since it doesn&#x27;t grow back, I&#x27;ll have to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> I like the brush and it is a very good value for the price but it still looses bristles (two to three per day). If it will continue this way the brush will not lust long.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I was amazed at how much of a difference that this made with shaving. It will make a huge difference in your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Initial impression- This is a good shaving brush for me, a newbie to shaving with a safety razor, brush and shaving soap. This brush is not too soft nor too firm in that it easily creates a nice creamy lather in a mug that I can work into my beard. It appears to be well made...time will tell.  October - several months after the initial purchase. Time has told! The brush is Great for creating shaving lather....BUT, it sheds hair like a sick cat. At the current rate of hair loss from the brush, it will be bald in 6 more months. I guess it wasn&#x27;t that well made.</li>
            <li> This is stiffer then my Parker brush I use every day, but the price is way lower then the Parker brush. In use this when I am on the road and don&#x27;t worry about damaging it.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve used so far for wet shaving and does a good job lathering up my Proraso shave cream.</li>
            <li> Escali Badger Shaving Brush-&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to double edge wet shaving (I&#x27;m glad I did) and upgrading to the Proraso shave cream, I was in need of a shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a 100% badger hair brush and at $12.95 (prime, free shipping) this turned out to be a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is high and it holds shave cream &amp; water to lather up my face just right.</li>
            <li> I hate to run against the grain.  I bought this cheap brush after leaving my fancy dancy one at my sisters house during vacation.  Back Ground:  I shave my face and head every morning before work.  The problem, this brush does not keep it&#x27;s shape.  It is in a permanent &amp;#34;smashed&amp;#34; state no matter how well I dry it.  I bought a cheap  brush many years ago (Omega 63171 Stripey 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand) and it worked fantastic.  This one will be used for camping.  I&#x27;d rather use my hands than try to spread lather with the smashed bristles.  I would not buy again. High Density Pure Badger Shaving Brush WSP &amp;#34;Prince&amp;#34; Black&amp;#34; is the one I use now, Very Very Recommended.  Thanks.  Bald Mike</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. Bought it along with the Escali stand and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Got into traditional wet shaving about 3-4 months ago and purchased this product as my starter brush.  It is worth every penny!  Lost a few hairs along the way, but take care of it properly and it will work like a brush 3-4 times it&#x27;s cost!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product and the price and service were great, highly recommend this brush. nice bristles and handle.</li>
            <li> The product is really well made. And although the only problem I have with the brush is that it will occasionally lose the bristles into the cup, whilst I stir the shaving cream, I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving, I thought to save a little money when buying in. The Escali brush is inexpensive...and cheap. The brush constantly looses hairs. Sometimes lots of hairs at a time. It is a rather poor lather builder and a lather hog (doesn&#x27;t release lather very well). I haven&#x27;t tried the Tweezerman brush, at about the same price, but if inexpensive is your need maybe it would fit your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a Vulfix 2234S ($60) and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my First time using aby type of brush for shaving and I Love it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this brush again</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful badger brush for the price. The delivery was prompt and the packaging was good. The wood on the handle seems a bit cheap, but I guess for the price that&#x27;s quite acceptable.</li>
            <li> My very first use with this brush and it was relatively coarse, although it did get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue was that the hairs fell out like CRAZY! Twenty-something hairs fell out between my mug, sink and face. That&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shelling out more next time and getting a Parker.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because of it&#x27;s high number of 4+ star reviews and that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; product .Not sure how it got so many great ratings. The brush has been coarse, uncomfortable, and bristles fall out with every use. It continually left my face sore after most uses. I tried different techniques but no luck. Have used it for 2 weeks and am moving on.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the brush came with a distinct smell of wet animal, in addition to a lot of shedding. It took several decent lathers to have it settle in it&#x27;s sweet spot where your soap/gel scent gets absorbed and the shedding stops.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is exactly what is described.  It is dense enough to do the job, but still a little soft.  You simply have to get used to the bristles, because they are helping soften your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works best after about 2-3 uses.  At first it has a bit of a smell (wet badger?), and also in the beginning it stains the soap a little bit tan/brown.  Being a natural product, I was not surprised or taken aback, and now it is odor-free and does not stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the handle, but almost wish it could have been made from something completely impervious to water...plastic, maybe?  Eventually all finished wood is going to look bad after water exposure.  But that&#x27;s years in the future, and it was reasonably inexpensive.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas gifts.  He loves it, because it is soft, but still firm, and firm without being prickly or too stiff, He has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> After having used another shaving brush , this one is much more comfortable. Its bristles are are soft and not prickly. I have a tough beard but sensitive skin and this brush is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a straight razor about a year ago, but I didn&#x27;t invest in a brush until recently.  I was a bit concerned that one of the cheapest brushes on Amazon might not be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for almost a month now and it&#x27;s holding up well.  You&#x27;ll lose a few hairs from the brush initially, but that&#x27;s normal.  I&#x27;ve only lost one or two hairs from it since the first week.  The brush is pretty soft out of the box and holds water and cream well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have tried several others and found this brush to be excellent. I bought a second for my wife to shave her legs. I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is good brush looks nice the handle is made well. The brush it self the first time I used it I hated it because after using it as it should be it lost a lot of bristles and I was left with a face full of beaver hair and more in the shaving mug. I really thought I got a defective product, but since I liked the Escali I decided to give it another try next time It still lost a couple ok improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I always rinse it and hang it upside down to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now after some use the brush is excellent works very well and may be looses a bristle or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this brush for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;09/24/2013 Now after using this brush on a regular basis for months the brush is still working great or I should say seems to look and work better.</li>
            <li> I had a few hairs fall out from the brush the first couple times I used it, but nothing major and it has since stopped. Aside from that it&#x27;s great! Soft and sturdy I&#x27;m totally happy with my brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father as a replacement for his old brush and he absolutely loves it. He&#x27;s elderly so he has used multiple brushes over the years and while there are more expensive brushes out there he said he was thrilled with the quality, especially considering what I paid for it.  Thank you so much...he&#x27;s picky!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush with the introduction to safety razor shaving. I saw many different types of brushes including boar and bear bristles; however, I decided to settle with a badger brush after some research. Boy I tell ya&#x27;, it was the right move. This brush is perfect for a novice or experienced shaver. The reason it&#x27;s so great is because of it&#x27;s water containing abilities and the stiffness of the bristles. Once you get this brush soaked, the water really stays in there which leads to a fantastic lather. The texture of the bristles feels great on the face and it honestly feels like a face massage. The brush seems to be well made. The handle is solid wood and the brush itself has a ton of bristles. Occasionally a few will fall out but I don&#x27;t think it is a big deal. Overall, I really enjoy using it and it really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the Escali Pure Badger Shaving Brush. It&#x27;s soft and comfortable when applying shaving cream, and it&#x27;s durable insofar as, the bristles don&#x27;t come loose or fall out.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps losing a few hairs but overall very nice feel.  I recommend a stand to let it dry upside down.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.It dries quickly and was a good price.Why pay a lot for a different brush.I like it.Easily recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money.  Maybe there are better ones for a higher price, but for this price I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> A good value for money. Great for starting to wet shave. Bristles come off on the first use, but better after that.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for the cheapo brush that came with a shaving kit so I decided on this after reading the description and checking out some reviews. I have been using it for almost a month and it is a better brush than my previous one. When it arrived and for several shaves it had the smell of what I assume is a wet badger but that has eventually disappeared. As I broke it in the usual bristles fell out every shave but that has also settled down.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who makes custom brushes, though they are in the $100+ range. He suggested since I was just getting into the wet shaving trend, I buy this particular brush. It has badger hair and is a solid item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that even after eight uses, the hairs are still coming out of it a little too much (according to my friend who makes the brushes). However, the friend assures me that this is what you get with the cheaper brushes, and that even with the expensive ones, there will always be a hair or two that gets dislodged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush to anyone who is getting into the wet shaving trend that is making a comeback. I would definitely buy another one (assuming my friend doesn&#x27;t offer me one of his custom brushes at a good discount!).</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It makes applying shaving soap very easy and without much effort. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning works really well just make sure to rinse well with plenty of water so it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to (please excuse the ending preposition).  Every review says I am supposed to make mounds of lather with these types of brushes, but I have not experienced this at this writing.  I&#x27;ll keep trying, and, perhaps, I&#x27;ll spring for another, more expensive brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, January 18, 2014.  I just received a new brush that cost twice as much,  Guess what?  Twice as much lather!</li>
            <li> I spent a decade scraping hair off my face with a piece of metal.  It wasn&#x27;t until I bought a proper safety razor and this brush, that I ever truly SHAVED!</li>
            <li> I searched many vendors at Amazon to find a shaving brush as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas.  I kept coming back to this vendor and their line of brushes.  The one I selected was perfect and actually came much sooner that originally thought.  I would recommend this vendor to anyone who is looking for Shaving materials.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for my old, boar&#x27;s hair brush, and I have to say this makes all the difference. It&#x27;s pretty soft after you use it a few times and the wooden handle seems to not be affected by the water if you let it sit in there for a few minutes while soaking the bristles pre-shave status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I did was I bought the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream when I bought this. I soaked these bristles for a few minutes, then I put some of that shaving cream on the end and lathered it up. I added a bit of water to my cup and let the bristles sit in the soapy water for about an hour or so. I don&#x27;t know if this is how you get that last little bit of animal scent out of your brush, but it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might lose a few bristles out of this brush for your first few shaves, but I&#x27;ve used it about seven or eight times in the month that I&#x27;ve had it and mine seemed to stop shedding after like four uses. Cheap and nice, can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he really likes it.  Just make sure you wash it with soapy water before you use it.</li>
            <li> This was the first badger shave brush I purchased when I started wet shaving. After using it for several months, I purchased a more expensive best badger brush. The best badger brush is slightly softer and more absorbent, but it was also 4X the price of the Escali Pure Badger. Overall, the Escali Pure Badger is a better value. For the money, the Escali brush is very soft and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with the Escali is that it does shed a bit more than desired. Even after a couple of months of use, I still find a few hairs left behind in the soap bowl. It&#x27;s not enough to consider a significant problem, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> hAVE NEVER USED ANY OTHER BADGER BRUSHES BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ENTRY LEVEL BRUSH IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. PUT LATHER ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and works well with the cup soap.  Feels great on the face.  Does not come apart with use.</li>
            <li> If you want a real firm bristle brush, then this isn&#x27;t it, but for someone like myself who prefers a soft bristle, this one is perfect.  The wood is nicely finished and I have had minimal loss of bristles after over a month&#x27;s worth of use.  I dry it (as prior experience taught me) with the bristles hanging down from a holder, and each shave is perfect.  I have been using a shaving brush and shaving soap for nearly 40 years and have gone through a number of brushes.  This one appears to be a good deal for the price.  I don&#x27;t like the plastic ones, and a cheap wood one cracks and/or loses bristles quickly.  So far . . . so good!</li>
            <li> My Son in Law loves it. His response at Christmas was &amp;#34;Are you serious - you got me a real badger shaving brush?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time. It was the quality that was described. Great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter texted me after Christmas to say &amp;#34;He is in there lathering himself and both boys, everybody is very happy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very small brush for the price I paid. It does the job but not as good as the larger brush I bought from CVS for $3. I would not recommend for purchase</li>
            <li> Got this brush after reading reviews of badger hair brushes vs boar bristle - and I have to say, I am very pleased with it. Not only is the brush high quality, but I get more lather in half the time compared to my old boar brush. The only negative is a funky smell to the bristles the first couple of weeks, but that goes away, and isn&#x27;t offensive, just... off-putting. Worth the smell, even if it lingered longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after initially starting out with a Boar brush. Wow what a difference it made. Best badger brush I have tried for the price.</li>
            <li> Having used this brush for several months now, I highly recommend this purchase to others.  It performs well and seems durable, with only the occasional bristle working its way out.</li>
            <li> Not Sure about what to compare it to. It makes the soap foam up nicely. Shipping was quick I&#x27;ll review more once I&#x27;ve bought another and have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old brush that did not last very long (all hairs where falling apart after less than a year of use).&lt;br /&gt;I found the Escali product available at a reasonable price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The comfort and sensation are very good (much better than my previous one, and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will last longer than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works very well. Smooth coverage and has held up to daily use without issues. Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping, nothing to complain about. I bought a few brushes and razors, and this one has held up better than expected, losing very few hairs and taking a good bit of abuse. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my first real badger brush. I like it very much. It is soft and holds a lot of water, which is what you need if you&#x27;re mixing up lather from a cake of shaving soap in a mug or using a brush-type shaving cream from a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There are brushless shaving creams in tubes as well. They&#x27;re not meant to use with a brush, but I prefer to use a brush even with these. Generally this lets me work a bit more water into the hairs before shaving, which is usually a good thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others reported the brush smelled. Mine didn&#x27;t, except of the sandalwood shave cream afterward, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seemed well made, but there were some loose hairs in it. I expect there will be some that weren&#x27;t glued in when the brush was made. Those are going to come out within the first few times I use it. If the shedding turns out to be more than this, I will edit my review later to say so.</li>
            <li> This is my first shave brush and I would say the quality to cost of the brush make it well worth it. Though I do not have anything else to compare it to, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is a nice touch, but the brush does shed some bristles. I would have thought that woul have stopped by now, but I do like the brush.</li>
            <li> It works. but it is not great. the brush took a little while to break in which is perfectly normal- it creates a good lather with the shave soap. But, the hairs fall out everywhere...constantly. I get them on my face, in the soap, in the water, and just all over my sink.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats an old-fashioned shave with a safety razor and good quality shaving soap. No multiple-blade razor or canned shaving cream can compare. The secret to using shaving soap is having a quality badger bristle brush to whip up the lather. This Escali brush fills the bill perfectly. I&#x27;m very happy with it. So is my face.</li>
            <li> Its wood and lightweight. Smelled funny in the beginning but not now. I guess those badgers are really stinky? WOW</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice&lt;br /&gt;I lather directly on my face and it produces a great lather in under a minute (this also depends on the soap/cream you are using, though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few of the hairs came out of the brush the first uses, and continued for at least a few weeks&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s real badger hair, and you can definitely SMELL it.  This isn&#x27;t really a con, because it&#x27;s advertised as real badger hair, but just be aware that it&#x27;s going to have a slight odor to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, especially for the price.  I switched to safety razor shaving recently after 10 years of cartridge shaving and it feels SOOO much better.  Creating the lather directly on my face feels great, and if you do it correctly you get the shaving cream up UNDER the hairs and on the skin directly, as opposed to smearing it around on top of all the hairs if you are using shaving gel from a can and your hand.  This really helps to create a more comfortable AND closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took 1 star away for the fact that quite a few of the hairs came out of the brush the first few weeks of using, and the slight smell to the brush.  But, I&#x27;d still probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I wondered at first if the price indicated low quality. BOY, WAS I WRONG! Anyone who pays twice, three times, TEN TIMES this much for a shaving brush is making a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break it in: (1) soak it for five minutes in hot water (2) load it with a good shaving soap  (3)  work up a good, heavy lather  (4) let the brush sit overnight in its stand (5) rinse soap out and repeat steps 1-3 at your next shave. Voila! EASY!</li>
            <li> first several shaves it smelled like hair might have come from badgers rear end. Eight shaves later a little less smell but still stinks when wet. Also still losing hair, but fewer each shave. Overall an OK brush, maybe time will mellow it. And yes I do dry it on a stand.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving. Amazon reviews have done a lot to help me choose affordable, quality equipment. This brush is both of those things. I can get a good comfortable lather with this and my proraso sensitive soap. Now I am getting the best shaves of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the animal smell; yes it is there, but only for the first few uses. It is not terribly repulsive, and the brush is well worth it if you can tough it out.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Buy a few, they are a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> take the time to learn how to condition the brush and get it ready for use. its animal hair, and smells like it out of the box. several week late, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, and my first time using shaving cream not in a condensed can. This brush is amazing! It wicks away water correctly, spreads evenly, and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush a lot when I first started using it, but the boar hair brushes I&#x27;ve tried handily trump this brush. Compared to a boar brush, the Escali feels prickly and doesn&#x27;t generate as much lather. So if you are looking for an inexpensive shaving brush, I would skip cheap, \\&quot;pure badger\\&quot; brushes altogether. Instead, check out [[ASIN:B003BWNR9A Omega]] and [[ASIN:B006FAIPDI Semogue]] boar hair brushes, or the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a badger hair brush, splurge for a Best or Silvertip brush instead of settling for a cheaper one like this.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was skeptical but this product has turned out to be an game changer.  I have truly enjoyed a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Some shedding of bristles sticking to my face which is an annoyance, but it works great and dries out well.</li>
            <li> Mine did not have any odor whatsoever and minimal hair loss at first use as i expected. I found it good for what I paid for it YMMV.....</li>
            <li> This brush does the job. It stands up, but also has a handle conducive to sitting in a stand. Its soft, and lathers on the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li> The brush is prickley. Amazon says 20-word minimum, so I will add that this brush prickles. I think one has to spend more money to get a better quality brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first ever brush for shaving with a double edge razor. As some reviews have mentioned, it is a bit rough, but the key is to keep it wet and the soap lathery. Other than that it&#x27;s well made, some of the hairs will fall out every now and then but that&#x27;s a minor price to pay considering how little you&#x27;re actually paying for the product. Definitely recommend for a beginner.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He says it is so much better than the brush has had before, which kept having the hairs fall out.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and really holds water well.  I would recommend it as a starter badger brush or a traveling brush.  For the last month, it has been the only brush in my shaving arsenal and I have no problem with that.  Great brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is at a good price point, but my brush continued to have hairs fall out DAILY even after 3 months of use. I just got into wet shaving and did not know much about quality of brushes. I had heard that badger brushes are good and so I was quite intrigued to see such a relatively inexpensive brush that was \\&quot;pure Badger\\&quot; ... which I incorrectly assumed meant that the brush has nothing but Badger hair. Although pure Badger brushes do only have Badger hair, that&#x27;s not the definition. If you look online, you&#x27;ll see that there are different badger brush qualities where many consider the order (lowest to highest) being: pure -&gt; best -&gt; super -&gt; silvertip. As such the pricing of these types of brushes also usually goes in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference lies in what part of the badger body where the hairs come from. You can look online for the detailed explanations of this. But the names of these brushes aren&#x27;t necessarily all that helpful. For example, \\&quot;best\\&quot; is not necessarily the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that silvertip tends to be the most expensive, that does not mean it is the best for everyone. It is regarded as the softest but some prefer that their brushes have a bit more \\&quot;backbone\\&quot; so that the brush can get into the beard and help the hairs stand up prior to shaving. Some have stated that pure badger brushes tend to be of poorer quality and are prone to having knots form within. I found this to be the case with my Escali brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want something too soft (silvertip) so I instead went with a best badger brush by Edwin Jagger (Model 1ej947sds):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002QI45Z0 Edwin Jagger Best Badger Shaving Brush With Drip Stand, Imitation Ivory, Medium]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have stated that the Jagger best brush has a great quality and has sufficient backbone. So far I found that this is true and this brush suits my needs better than the Escali. And, even in the first use, I found that NO HAIRS fell out for the Jagger. That was not the case with the Escali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that the Escali is a poor choice for everyone. At that price point it could be a very attractive brush, and it&#x27;s hard to argue with the MANY high product ratings. But I thought it&#x27;d alert other new wet shavers who don&#x27;t know much about  badger brushes that there are other types aside from \\&quot;pure\\&quot; and that \\&quot;pure\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t just mean \\&quot;100%\\&quot; in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, try visiting a store that carries various brushes (for example, Art of Shaving but beware that their prices are HIGH). When testing brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t brush the face directly as you have no idea how much that brush has been handled and what&#x27;s on it. Instead apply it somewhere like the back of your hand or on your forearm. I found that the sensitivity in the palm of your hand is not very good, but you could feel differences on your forearm. Try out the different brushes and you&#x27;ll notice a difference between the pure and other brushes. Honestly, I could HARDLY tell the difference between a best and silvertip, but you might appreciate the difference. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing every day for the past year and it&#x27;s still fantastic even after all that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend using with Proraso/Bigelow shave cream.</li>
            <li> Liked:&lt;br /&gt;* Price - quite inexpensive, but not cheap feeling, looking or performing&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t require break-in, soft right out of the box&lt;br /&gt;* Holds lots of water and lather&lt;br /&gt;* Classic wood handle looks nice, not flashy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;* Sheds like a dog during summer for at least the first few shaves - seriously, hair everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;* Would like it if the handle was just a little bit longer / bigger</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used this, it left a bunch of little hairs all over his face. It hasn&#x27;t happened since then and he really likes it now.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush performs well. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a year now, bristles are still soft and has retained it&#x27;s shape. Great lathering and shaves using this brush.</li>
            <li> After 2 ½ months of usage, the hair bristles are falling out despite proper cleaning and storage upside down. It remains true that you get what you pay for and I should have known that at that price the quality cannot good.</li>
            <li> great value for the money.the bristles shed very little and the water retention was great.Construction very good better than expected</li>
            <li> Sheds every time. Not sure who rated this junk so high.  NEVER EVER WILL I BUY OR  RECOMMEND THIS USELESS STUFF</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It has a real wood handle, not plastic. The badger hairs are nice and soft.  There is a slight smell to it as other reviewers have noted, but should go away within the first month of use.  It holds a very large amount of water and it is very fast to clean to be put up for later for the next shave.  It lathers exceptional! My face can attest to that! I store mine laying flat on a washcloth.  I do not use a stand, so I will see how long it lasts.  There was some slight shedding of the hairs but has lessened to one or so now per shave.  I have had the brush for about a week so the shedding should completely stop.  Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> The seller (Perella&#x27;s) was swift in fulfillment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brush every other day. The product has held up and the bristles are still stiff after about two months&#x27; use. As other reviewers have mentioned, I make it a point to rinse the brush well after use, shake it out, and let dry upside-down. I bent a wire hanger into a brush and razor holder and my lady has mentioned how nice the whole setup looks in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, there were some loose bristles that ended up in the cup or on my face, that was annoying, but the loose ones have since worked their way out, and I no longer experience that problem. I&#x27;d imagine that is common to all such brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job although it sheds more than I would like.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I needed. Simple, efficient, and one of the cheapest badger shaving brushes on the market. I highly recommend and would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star rating because I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about.  That said, this is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.  The brush seems to be of quality construction and works as well as I would expect it to.</li>
            <li> This brush is guaranteed to lose bristles every time you use it. You will be picking bristles out of your shave bowl, off of your face, and off the bathroom counter every single time. It literally has 1 job, and it does it quite poorly. It is popular on here because it is cheap, not because it is good.</li>
            <li> this item arrived quickly and was a great price for it&#x27;s quality . I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a horsehair brush before but had heard that badger is better.  If this brush is representative of the typical badger brush I&#x27;d recommend horsehair in the future.  The hairs come off and the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t lather as well as with horsehair.</li>
            <li> are there nicer brushes out there?  yes, but for the money...this is a great brush...if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving or thinking about trying shaving with a brush and soap...this is a nice brush to start with....I like the wooden handle and this brush feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li> It does its job perfectly and it is very easy to clean and dry out. I have a feeling I will be a proud owner of the Escali shaving brush for a good while.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush, feels like it did years ago and makes shaving easier. I really like it. Try one yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Bill Goodwin</li>
            <li> Upon receiving brush, I opened packaging everything seemed normal except for a terrible smell! The bristles smelled like road-kill! It was a horrendous dead animal-smell! I then washed bristles with soap and hot-water and smell dissipated!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight, affordable shaving brush that does not loose its badger hair in application.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft on the skin and does well in spreading out shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Fine looking.  Something you could show off on your bathroom shelf.  Classy.</li>
            <li> This is a top notch brush that is soft and ideally shaped. I bought it for my son&#x27;s 17th birthday and, like his father, he now chooses to shave with a brush and silver razor. I have nixed the option of a Sweeney Todd style knife!  Shipping was reasonably fast. Wold use this company again to replace.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. Much cheaper than others that I have seen and just as good.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and I like the shape of the handle.  This is my first shaving brush so it is hard to say if it is the best, but I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but I prefer a stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li> I think it can be a 5 star but I haven&#x27;t tired other brushes so thats why I give it 4/5. But I&#x27;m extremely happy with it. The shipping was fast. And the broduct arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  Outstanding value!  My first experience into wet shaving.  Brush is excellent and I certainly recommend it, particularly if you are new to the process.</li>
            <li> after years of using spray shaving cream into hands and rubbing on the face. I tried the shaving brush and Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream and feel like I&#x27;m getting a better shave, easier to apply and using less cream</li>
            <li> I bought another shaving brush that was also highly rated on amazon. Both brushes were well priced but the first one I bought (I don&#x27;t want to mention them) felt very uncomfortable on the face. It literally felt like I was rubbing rat hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The escali shaving brush does not feel this way. The escali brush feels very comfortable touching my face. I get a much better shave using this brush and shaving soap than I do just using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The brush effectively applies lather to the face and feels fantastic in the process. I would highly recommend this choice.</li>
            <li> I use to get quite a bit of shaving rash on my neck. I did all the tricks and and used all the off the shelf shaving creams you apply by hand. Finally decided to spend a little bit of money on this and a nice shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin) and since then my rash has been almost non existent. The brush has been great and I do believe its part of the reason for the reduction in my shaving rash. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it.  It&#x27;s not too hard or prickly and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the brush but really thought that a badger hair brush would not shed as much as this one - but, I guess I should not have expected perfection, in spite of the marketing.  I am sure that it is quite superior to most shaving brushes available today.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVE THIS BRUSH AND WOULD TELL ANYONE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY SHAVING BRUSH AT A GREAT PRICE TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN IF NEEDED!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three weeks.  I think for what I paid for it, it is an excellent bargain.  I did lose some of the hair in it as to be expected. I still will lose one here and there, but for the most part the shedding has stopped.</li>
            <li> purchased first time - returned, bristles are coming off easily, contacted escali customer care, they sent me free another one, a little better, but still bristles are coming off from the first use. Will not buy again unless they start making quality product.</li>
            <li> love it, great shave, feels great!!  Works well with custom soaps.  Best shave I have had in a long time.  My face feels great!!</li>
            <li> I have never used a shaving brush to shave with before buying this one. I did not have any experience with one prior to this so I was looking for something in expensive.  I would recommend this to anyone starting to explore wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, along with a whole set of stuff. He now shaves his face every day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush builds lather nicely. It&#x27;s not too stiff, but is soft enough for a gentle exfoliation of your face. You really have to rinse the lather out and shake the brush dry for it to stay nice and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know? I&#x27;ve tried it out on my legs (shhhhhh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, came quickly and as described. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product, gave it as a gift to my brother, he seems quite pleased with its lather and its appearance.</li>
            <li> No problems with this brush I have been using it every day. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> My husband said it was the best brush he&#x27;s owned. He&#x27;s been shaving&lt;br /&gt;almost  50 years.</li>
            <li> This was a part of a birthday gift basket for my husband and the \\&quot;I Love It\\&quot; is from him.  Lather quickly and smoothly with easy spreading about the face and chin.  He says it is the best brush ever.  Thanks Amazon for having the best products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, but it does have a tendency to lose a hair or two each time I use it - which is annoying. Besides that, it&#x27;s a good brush and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice for the price and a lot softer than my boar&#x27;s hair brush. The only reason it lost a star is because for the first several times you shave with it, it will smell like a zoo. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles falling out (other than one here or there).</li>
            <li> I expected this shaving brush to have a smell, and I tried several methods to reduce the smell to a comfortable level before returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running the brush through warm soapy water did not help. The smell from this brush once wet with warm water was overpowering and nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for other methods to reduce the smell from a badger hair shaving brush. I began with soaking the brush in a diluted distilled vinegar and warm water solution close to 10% vinegar for 20 minutes. I found this did not improve the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I next tried soaking the brush in a 50% vinegar and 50% water solution overnight. This marginally improved the smell from the brush, but it was still overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I soaked the brush in water with dissolved baking soda overnight. This slightly improved the smell, but it was still very strong and difficult to even test smell once wet with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, I cleaned the brush with shampoo and conditioner and then made a baking soda paste, thoroughly worked this paste into the brush, let it sit overnight, and finally proceeded with several cleaning cycles of warm water and shaving soap and again with warm water and shampoo and conditioner. This did not improve the smell; it seemed no additional cleaning cycles improved it beyond this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that this much cleaning may have impacted the quality of the brush as well, but I did not care. The smell was so strong that I was more interested in reducing it rather than thinking about its use later. I do expect a brush like this to have a smell, but the smell from this brush was simply too strong. I suspect that there was a defect in how this hair was treated and processed initially before being manufactured as a shaving brush. The \\&quot;pure\\&quot; in the description is an indication of quality for badger shaving brushes. Pure is the lowest quality classification typically used. My next purchase will be a higher quality classification.</li>
            <li> This brush is very nicely made. It does a very nice lather. Has a  good price and was delivered very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was the smell when i first used it. After a few uses the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap handle and some hairs are coming out</li>
            <li> Produces a wonderful lather to shave- better than spraying foam from a can into your hand and wiping that on your face and head.  The bristles, when put in warm water and then on your skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great and NO loss of brush hair.  Use it with Gillette Pro Glide Fusion gel to spread it evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> sheds every time I use it</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; ok. Have a distinct smell, which might not bother others but it does bother me. I have used it several times so far and the smell is still there. Also leaves some hair every single time I rub it on my face. Not the best quality shaving brush but gets the work done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush once thus far. I have two other brushes, one I keep in my travel shaving kit at all&lt;br /&gt;times, one in my master bath and this one is in my guest bath. Thus far it feels a tad stiffer than my other&lt;br /&gt;brushes but it works fine. I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a good price but you do get what you pay for.  I lost several bristles in the first few uses.  Creates a lather not much better than the $8 Wal-mart brushes.  Doesn&#x27;t include a stand which means you can get a better brush and a stand for the price of this brush and a addition stand.</li>
            <li> The brush appears to be well made. I have have only used it a couple of times, it has produced great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard raving reviews on this product, and it&#x27;s living up to its name thus far. My previous brush I&#x27;d picked up at a Walgreens in San Diego area. It was boar, which is softer, but it was very poor construction - the glue failed months ago in it and finally the whole thing separated in two. In comparison, this one appears to have excellent construction - I&#x27;m not worried about it falling apart like the other, and I expect to use it for quite some time. The badger hair seems rather prickly and somewhat more stiff, but I&#x27;m guessing that will go away in time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift and have no personal knowledge of its performance.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> This is my very first Brush, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, this is a quality brush.&lt;br /&gt;Add a little luxury to your life.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to wet shaving and didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on an expensive brush. I bought this brush due to the low price and the amazing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am kind of disappointed in it ( I would give it 2.5 stars if I could).&lt;br /&gt;The brush has lost about 10-15 bristles after about 2 weeks of use. I think that is unacceptable, and I do not expect this brush to last very long. It is also quite prickly, and not near as soft as I thought it would be. I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a sub-par brush, but I would recommend spending a little bit more. I am saving up for a new, higher quality one, since I am not fully satisfied with this one</li>
            <li> I have no previous experience with a shaving brush, but this one works great so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave brush at an affordable price. Shipping was fast. I&#x27;ve upgraded from a boar hair brush and the quality of this brush is impressive for the price. No &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell as some people claim and it helps achieve a great lather. I would recommend this brush and the seller.</li>
            <li> Great item, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job of building a lot of lather.  I am very happy with the quality of this product.  Great quality at an affordable price.  The product arrived very quickly after ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush to trial shaving the old fashioned way. Only a few bristles have come out from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price to the brush and great customer service.</li>
            <li> will be a great addition to whatever cream you use.  Notice I said cream not soap.  I purchased Taylor of Old Bond w/this brush and they are amazing.  I&#x27;m sure many of the more spendy creams are good also, but at Taylors price it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I will have to say for the price this is a great brush.  It did shed a little the first 2-3 times I used it but since then no issues.  The brush is soft and lathers very very well.  I actually plan on getting one of these for a buddy of mine so I truly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a double edge razors. One of the must have items for safety razor shaving is a shaving brush. Being a novice, I didn&#x27;t know whether or not I would like it. Aside from the initial investment of the hardware, the blades are cheap and the soaps and creams reasonably priced but the shaving brushes were all over the spectrum. After spending a money on an Edwin Jagger razor, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a shaving brush in case I decided this type of shaving wasn&#x27;t for me. At least with the razor itself, I can sell it but the brush I wasn&#x27;t sure I could due to hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the brush itself, it was priced much less than some I saw. Not having used any other one, my review may be one sided. In any case, I found this brush to be very nice. The hairs themselves are soft and the wooden handle gripped nicely and felt nice on the hand. A few hairs fell off but only because I realized I wasn&#x27;t wetting the brush enough before lathering up with the soap. Once I got that down, no more hairs fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying lather to my face felt so soft and gentle that I actually enjoy the whole process. Cleaning is so simple I just run water through it and shake it a bit to get the excess water out, sometimes i just press the hairs with my fingers a few time and before hanging it on my stand to dry off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a well built quality brush. Not having  another brush to compare it to I still give it a five star. There probably are better brushes out there but I found this one to be more than adequate and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 7 months now and while it is great for the price I still have a few badger hairs fall out. No biggie, still works as intended. Make sure to use a stand with this product and don&#x27;t leave it lying around.</li>
            <li> Hair fell out first use. Will give it time. Brush smaller than anticipated and didn&#x27;t generate that heat. After more uses will know quality After a months use hairs ok works up great lather and heat</li>
            <li> This is my first badger hair shaving brush and I am very pleased with it. Some hairs did come off of the brush during the first few uses, but that stopped after ~5 uses. I think it is a great first brush.</li>
            <li> So far, this is proving to be a great brush. Nice and soft, but still stiff enough to apply the lather and lift hairs. No shedding, and minimal mushroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a Merkur 180, to get into wet shaving.  While I don&#x27;t imagine I will be using this brush forever, this is a great brush for the price.  I highly reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced starter brush.</li>
            <li> looses some hairs but holds up overall.</li>
            <li> Just received and used this weekend this new Escali Shaving Brush, and I fell in love with its smoothness, and excellent lathering ability. Excellent price, outstanding quality and no problem whatsoever like other shaving brushes with any distinct unpleasant odor! Recommending to all who may consider a quality shaving brush with a professional look and quality! Al</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush, works nice</li>
            <li> This took about 5 days to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times there was some hair loss and a funny order, but the last 2 times no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I keep the brush hairs pointing down to dry by tying it to a towel holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a combo of soap, glycerin-soap and cream and learned to take about 2 + minutes to whip the shaving lather into a rich smooth application before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I&#x27;m a beginner,and still learning my tools.  Don&#x27;t have  another brush to compare this to but believe it works well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush. It loses a hair every now and again, but it&#x27;s not too big and it fits in the shaving stand nicely.</li>
            <li> I have owned a total of about 4 or 5 shaving brushes over the years. The Escali shaving brush is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and lives up to its description</li>
            <li> Expensive but good quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my father in law and he loves it! Great service and product.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush to my fiance for Christmas and on the first use he said it&#x27;s a lot softer than his previous brush, and provides a nicer soap lather. The thicker lather has changed the quality of his shave, and his skin feels so much smoother afterwards. He&#x27;s very happy with the brush, I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!  Note: I followed the advice in other reviews and washed the brush before he used it the first time (I used shampoo and conditioner) and it softened it up a fair bit.</li>
            <li> Although it looks good at first sight, it loses bristles continuously.  After a while I decided to get rid of it, as it was making every shaving a hunt for lost bristles in the lather.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Performs magnificently. Whips your soap into a nice lather and apply&#x27;s it well to one&#x27;s face. Much better than the last sheving brush I used.</li>
            <li> Great performance at a great price. I recently tried a more expensive version and was somewhat disappointed by the overall quality based on what I paid for it. I get the exact same performance from this Escali brush at a fraction of the cost of my other brush. I&#x27;m still experimenting with different brushes, but after using this one for a few months, I can confidently rate it at 5 stars for performance and cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush when I first switched to using a safety razor. I am pretty impressed with how well (and long) this brush as held up.</li>
            <li> It feels ok on the skin, but hairs come out of it every time I use it even though I&#x27;m trying to be gentle with it. I don&#x27;t expect it last long, but for the price, what can you say.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with it.  This was his first time trying shaving soap and a brush...so far so good!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with shave soap. Very soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about a month, and it more or less what I expected it to be. I have used this brush exclusively with shaving soap (Queen Charlotte, DR Harris, Edwin Jagger, Tabac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is capable of creating good lather from the soap.  However, it has continuously lost 2-5 hair strands every use, but that does seem to finally be slowing down now.  I have to make sure that I really load the brush to produce enough lather for 3+ passes. I have had to reload the brush occasionally.  There is also a section of hair in the middle, but a little off center, that has more backbone that the surrounding hairs.  This took some adjustment, but it is not a problem after a few uses.  I have also found that this brush works much better with a shaving mug as opposed to a face lathering. I considered ranking this as three stars due to the issues listed above, but for the price, I think these issues are acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This brush is perfectly fine for a beginner, but you will probably want to upgrade if you continue wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift, and it was a big hit!</li>
            <li> This brush has that new badger brush &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34; right out of the package. I can tell its going to be legit. The handle is wood, but its Lacquered with something so that it is smooth to the touch and water resistant. I find myself using less cream because this brush makes better foam than my old brush. I store it upside down and it dries quickly. It is my second brush and definitely a step up in performance and style.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great brush, I am very pleased with my purchase. As a barber I would definatly order more products from this business.</li>
            <li> Soak this in hot water before your shave for best results. You&#x27;ll never go back to shaving cream from a can!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brushes and this is easily one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add the costs in and hands down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing better</li>
            <li> Has a slight odor to it initially but that goes away after a few shaves and leaves pure luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first badger hair brush and it has changed my life. very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the hairs do fall out faster than my previous brush.</li>
            <li> Received the product as described, and on time.</li>
            <li> I like the brush because it whips-up a good lather without losing many bristles.  I held off from writing a review until I had several shaves with the Escali brush.  The bristles are firm and adequately secured within the holder. Another benefit - it&#x27;s almost odorless.  Other badger hair brushes contain a strong, wet-wool-like odor that lingers for about three months.  And it&#x27;s priced low compared to most badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy.  The bargain price is no excuse for being covered in badger hair.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with the hairs falling out of this brush at a rate much quicker than I observed with prior brushes.  I would not buy this model again. Also, does not contain a stand, but many shave pros likely have one already.</li>
            <li> I had my first one from walmart until it began to fall apart due to reaching it&#x27;s end of use point. This one works well it has a strange smell but nothing to be unbearable or intolerable I would recommend it and will probably replace it again with Escali when it needs it.</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving brush I ever bought and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed. Light weight, inexpensive and serves the purpose. It did have a weird smell in the beginning, but after a couple of uses, it was fine. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product.Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Very nice entry-level Badger Brush. I started with a Boar&#x27;s-hair brush from Walgreens, which was very much pricklier, but I didn&#x27;t know any better - it was my first brush!  Jumping into a reasonably-priced badger brush should be the FIRST brush I picked up. I&#x27;m impulsive and impatient though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Soft, not very much hair falling out after 4 weeks of use.  Fits in my brush-and-razor holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/SimplyBeautiful-Deluxe-Razor-Brush-Stand/dp/B00AG92BXY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415538809&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;razor+brush+stand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very very light gamey smell for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to go with a Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap in a Wooden Bowl. I did a bunch of research and extensive reading of reviews before hand. This came out as a clear winner, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks very sharp and elegant, and does a great job. It&#x27;s also a very good price point, considering the alternatives tend to be either terribly expensive or very cheap looking. I am very pleased with this, would buy again, and definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> This brush was one of my first badger brushes when I started traditional shaving several years ago. Unfortunately, I cannot recommended this brush to new traditional wet shavers. Easily one of the worst brushes on the market. Sheds like crazy even after the &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period. Does make lather very well, and doesn&#x27;t retain water at all. If you are new to shaving brushes, do yourself a favor and go with an Omega Boar pro48 or one of the many low cost Semogue boar brushes. These brushes are inexpensive and very well made. Stay away from Escali!!!</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  A few hairs here and there come off the brush, but no big deal.  Well worth the price and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, comfortable in hand</li>
            <li> Shaving brush is great best I ever use.</li>
            <li> I am value conscious, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to buy cheaply made items.  This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve tried in its class.  I have been using it for a few months now, and it whips up a great lather, but more importantly, after the initial week or so of minor shedding, it hasn&#x27;t lost more than a hair every few shaves.  It is a little scratchy at first, but that goes away over time.  It also has that distinctive badger smell when you first wet it, but that disappears after a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;ll be buying another when this one wears out (which doesn&#x27;t appear to be any time soon).  A solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li> falls apart so easily</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but the hairs come out for week quite some time.</li>
            <li> works perfectly lathering up just as expected! Will purchase again</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Using this brush has upped the anty on shaving. Love it applies shaving soap well and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see why this product received so many good reviews. mine came with the name rubbed off half way (which was no big deal) but the main reason i give this brush 2 stars is that it sheds like crazy! i&#x27;ve been using it every day for months and the hairs still keep falling out every time. its actually starting to get thin. i would try my luck with something else. i will say that i haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes so i can&#x27;t compare it to anything. all i know is any good brush weather its a painting brush or a shaving brush should not shed at all. maybe a bristle here or there but not a dozen every time. take my advice and pass on the Escali Badger Shaving Brush. my dog sheds less.</li>
            <li> Mine feel apart. The bristles separated from the handle. Only used twice. Returned.</li>
            <li> It feels great in my skin. Washes very easily. I bought mine about a year ago and use it everyday, but there is no show of wearing.</li>
            <li> This is not the best shaving brush. Said that, it is probably the best PURE BADGER shaving brush in the under $20 price range. So, definately go for it - if you can not afford a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Nice badger shaving brush.  It has a nice wooden look and holds water well for proper lathering.  Fine for use with a mug or direct application to face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have many brushes to compare it to but I really like the feel and quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Quick service and brush works like a champ!!</li>
            <li> A very good brush for the price. Holds the lather well and is just stiff enough to give your muttons a tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> Had it for a month now and so far it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart . Excellent value for money, although not the softest of brushes but still quite luxurious</li>
            <li> Unbeatable value for your money. After breaking it in, it lost a few bristles, which is absolutely normal. I could whip up a good lather, it is soft on the skin. I am going to buy a second one for a reserve</li>
            <li> Good product.  Fair price!</li>
            <li> Developed rashes after using the brush. Needed antibiotics to reduce the inflammation. Rashes went away after I stopped using the brush.</li>
            <li> What more can a person say about a fine 100% pure Badger Shaving Brush? That is one amazing item. Quality is excellent and service is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading reviews of it and others in this price range. I did not expect to receive a premium quality level shaving brush, just one that would apply lather, not shed much and enhance my daily shaving ritual.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did shed a bit for the first week or so, but after about 6 weeks it rarely throws a bristle. I&#x27;m pleased with it and who knows, maybe someday I&#x27;ll consider moving up to a super or silvertip quality level! Of course, I&#x27;ll have to shell out 5 to 10 times, or more, for one of those. Hmmmm? Anyway, if you&#x27;re considering a shaving brush for the first time, buying this one will be a good decision.</li>
            <li> It works, well...it really helps lathering up a cinch and its rather large in size! I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it every day. I would recommend it for the cost that you pay. Highly enjoyable product.</li>
            <li> The Escali shaving brush is an excellent value for the cost and the softness of the brush.  I would recommend this brush for anyone interested in saving money.</li>
            <li> Smells bad. Very light handle. Feels poor quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same brush for over 10 years and knew it was time for a change when the bristles began falling out of the base. After using this Escali brush for a few weeks, i now realize that my old, trusty brush was not pure badger. What a difference! I know look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is very soft after you break it in, and it is an excellent value for the price. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Around December I decided to switch to wet shaving due to being tired of getting horrible irritation from any other form of shaving. I made the mistake of not doing as much research as I should have and wound up on the page for this brush due to the fact that it had such good reviews. I also got a few other popular products to begin my shave den such as Proraso Green, my Merkur 34C, and a decent brush/razor stand. Those turned out to be fantastic, the brush, however, turned out to be a disaster. Not only did it seem like a disaster, I also felt completely swindled into buying a totally crap product.  On my very first shave, I may not have known exactly what to expect, but I knew I had watched enough videos on YouTube about loading a brush and creating a lather to know that the Proraso puck shouldn&#x27;t have been caked with &amp;#34;badger hair&amp;#34; from the knot. I also use the term badger hair lightly. After using several different brushes at this point and knowing what REAL badger hair looks, feels, and smells (yes this is important) like, I am very hard pressed to believe that this vendor is telling the truth when they say 100% badger hair in the product description. Please, please, please do not waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;**New wet shavers and old alike, if you are looking for cheaper options (like me) for brushes, this is not your answer. There are plenty of other cheaper brushes that work wonders and will last you for ages. Some of these options can even be found here on Amazon. Check out Omega boar brushes. I got an Omega 10066 boar hair brush after this piece of crap and I still use it almost every day even though I have several different brushes now. Above all just do a little research about this stuff if you are new to wet shaving of thinking about getting into it. Don&#x27;t waste your initial investment like I did, and don&#x27;t let bogus products like this one take away from the enjoyment you can get from a good old school shave!</li>
            <li> I have done reviews of the VDH ensemble so you might like to read that on also. So far so good. Works very well--you just need to figure how well your soap is going to work with your brush. Some soap like more or less soap, so you will have to figure out how much water to shake out. Some soaps are also picky as to which soaps they will do their best work with. It is trial and error. Williams seems to be the pickiest, did not like at all the VDH brush so I am using this one.</li>
            <li> This Product is awesome.  My very first shave brush.  I have used it twice now with no complications.  The only thing I would say is the first use I had some hairs fall out.  Nothing major but enough to mention it.  I look forward to many more shaves with this brush.</li>
            <li> Beautiful goods !! Thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> Soft, affordable, functional, stylish. These words sum up the escali, hopefully in an effective way. I have another one by the Art of Shaving, which honestly is a complete rip-off. This is fantastic, and functions as well as The Art of Shaving one.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. You will love the difference this makes with a good quality shaving soap as opposed to squeezing cream out of a can. Time to go old school and shave like a man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at this kind of shaving, but I can say that this brush produces a great lather with the soap I use.  It does shed a few hairs every so often, but at the current price, that&#x27;s fine with me. I would highly recommend this brush to first time users.</li>
            <li> This was a pressent for me and is my first shaving brush. The hair is quite stiff, which you wouldn&#x27;t know from just looking at it, but not stiff to the point of irritation. When it&#x27;s actually lathered you don&#x27;t notice its coarse nature. It does seem to exfoliate quite well and conserves cream better than say spraying barbasol on your face alone. Just a little bit on the end can cover the entire surface. It also rinses quite easily, so there isn&#x27;t a great deal of clean up involved. The only thing that keeps it from perfection is the single hair that fell from the brush, as no doubt eventually will come a day when I&#x27;ll have to replace it. However, I&#x27;ll be sure to replace it with the same brand.</li>
            <li> This brush is about like any other.  Was disappointed to discover many of the hairs coming out and becoming lodged in the soap with each use.  Seems to not grip the badger fur tightly enough or something.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my husband and he has been very satisfied with it. He shaves daily and has very coarse, fast-growing facial hair (think wolfman). The brush did lose some bristles initially (the 1st few uses), but since then it has not lost any more. There are much more expensive brushes out there, but this one is affordable and does what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Feels much better than my old cheapo</li>
            <li> Great brush have not used it long but it&#x27;s well built and looks like it will last plus it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush at an awesome price.  I got a brush holder to help dry it.  It is holding shape very well. It is a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for my husband who loves it. No complaints. fair price for a quality product. A good entry level badger shaving brush that will meet most people&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I purchased the Escali brush and stand. The only item I need now to complete the set is the perfect Razor. The products shipped quickly and are of good quality. I would use this company again.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pleasure to use; small and very effective.  If you enjoy shaving with a brush &amp; cup, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Great first time shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Quick delivery and good quality.  I like this brush</li>
            <li> Works great. Not as stiff a shaft as my $100 plus Jagger Silver Tip. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. This is a GREAT starter brush if you are interested in testing out the \\&quot;old school\\&quot; way of shaving with a brush and shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will shed hairs for about the first week or so. Or at least mine did. It also had a funky odor but I soaked mine overnight a few times in diluted lemon dish washing liquid and the odor came right out. I&#x27;m thinking the scent of your shaving soap will eventually replace the odor as well if you don&#x27;t want to speed up the process like I did by using dish washing soap.</li>
            <li> I have several brushes.  This is a decent brush for the money!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and my SIL said it was fine.  A few bristles came out, but he said they always do when you first use them.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but it&#x27;s been working great for me for the last three months.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my dad...he says its great quality...he loves it</li>
            <li> This Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush is a great product for a great price.  Upon receiving mine and having a first shave with it, I noticed a pungent odor not unlike that of a wet badger.  It was bad enough to make me dry-heave when lathering my mustache area beneath my nose.  Some quick googling revealed that this is not uncommon.  An overnight soak in white vinegar followed by a rinsing in dish soap thoroughly stripped away all the funk.  I have used this brush every morning since I bought it and am very pleased.  The bristles are soft, yet firm enough to lift the whiskers. The odor is completely eliminated - not a trace.  I recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re willing to soak it overnight in white vinegar before using it.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheap for a reason. Bad smell. Poor lather. Poor durability. Try the Parker Safety Razor Synthetic Brush instead.  [[ASIN:B002WA0QGY Parker Safety Razor SYNTHETIC Bristle Shaving Brush with White handle and Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for my son as a gift along with other shaving products. He told me he loves it! He was fed up with buying the expensive cartridges for his other razor and decided to go back to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; way of shaving.</li>
            <li> I got this shaving brush from my wife for Christmas and I love it! I&#x27;m used to spreading shaving cream on face using my hands and having this brush has made the process much cleaner. Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> Top shelf brush thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Soft brush that works up a lather great. Has the quality of a much higher priced brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money on over priced brands or marketing. This is a simple, refined, and amazing brush for the man looking for a new wet shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I have been using it for about 3-4 weeks now. There is a little bit of &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; smell to it, but for the price I paid for it, I can live with the smell.</li>
            <li> GREAT brush and very soft.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another when/if this one ever falls apart.</li>
            <li> Small stiff brush sheds a bit out of the box</li>
            <li> 1. This brush stinks like an animal, i.e. literally smells bad&lt;br /&gt;2. Sheds like an animal. After every shave I collect the bristles stuck on the foam on my face&lt;br /&gt;3. Absorbs the lather rather than spreading it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is so horrible that I would suggest buying one with synthetic hair. Save badgers and shave better. I cannot understand why this product rated so highly, did I receive a counterfeit?</li>
            <li> As far as shaving goes, using a shaving brush is a huge upgrade from whatever aerosol gel you&#x27;re using. What I usually do is let it sit in my mug full of water to get those bristles wet. Then I dump out the water and shake off any excess to create my lather. It works wonders, especially once it&#x27;s broken in. While the bristles were a little stiff for my liking, it&#x27;s done my face nicely. Sure it sheds a little bit in the beginning, but I find all shaving brushes do that, and they usually stop after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re new to traditional wetshaving, or returning to it, this a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this brush.  It is soft, makes a nice lather, and is fairly easy to use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because after a few weeks of use, I still have hairs coming out of the brush on every use.  It&#x27;s not shedding horribly, but after the initial break-in period I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to lose so many hairs.  There are 2-4 every time I use it now.  So I really like the brush and I&#x27;m happy overall.  I hope the shedding thing stops and I will update this after a few more weeks.  With the price I paid, though, I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this brush.  There is still plenty of hair left so I hope it stays that way... :-)  Update: After 6 months of almost daily use, I still like this brush a lot and it gives a really good lather.  I bought a cheaper travel boars hair brush and it was a joke.  The lather was crap and nothing compared the excellent lather of the Escali brush.  (As far as badger brushes go, this is the only one I have but I am very happy with it.)  It still does lose an average 1-2 bristles per shave but there seems to be quite a bit left.  For the price I paid, I&#x27;m still very happy with this brush and I definitely recommend it as a starter brush or if cost is a consideration.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving brush I ever bought because I was tired of that junk in the can drying out my face and shaving with a plastic cheese grater. This brush creates a good lather quite fast and the bristles have not fallen out, so that&#x27;s pretty much what I wanted. I am happy with this product and I am happy I switched to stuff that won&#x27;t irritate and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. The merchant promptly sent out the order and everything went as expected. Would order from again.</li>
            <li> Be sure to let it sit in warm/hot water for a couple minutes to let it absorb water into the bristles. Also, mix the soap with enough water or you won&#x27;t get a good enough lather.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles do fall out each time I use it, but I expect that with a natural brush - each bristle can&#x27;t be exactly he same, so there can never be perfect tension to keep the bristles in place.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;professional shaver&amp;#34;, like some of the folks on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the brush feels great, very soft after a few uses, and it definitely makes shaving more enjoyable, rather than &amp;#34;utilitarian&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this rating after a year or so, when I know more about durability.</li>
            <li> Very soft feels. Great at creating lather. Not sure if the badger hair should be falling out each use. Only a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I have ever bought and I&#x27;m glad to choose Escali. Lathering feels great. After about eight or so uses, the brush has not diminished in quality. The appearance is elegant.</li>
            <li> A brush that gets the job done.  Smaller than I expected, so be sure to check the product listing for the dimensions.  Several hairs fall out every time I use it, even after 10+ shaves (although the frequency at which this occurs is declining over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: inexpensive and gets the job done, but I am not overly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> This product is worst thing I&#x27;ve ever tried. Poor quality, smells and doesn&#x27;t do the job at all. Avoid at all cost, its useless.</li>
            <li> It is a very well made brush.  The bristles are soft and produce a good lather.</li>
            <li> Only use a few times thus far but exactly as advertised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This brush does the job! It is my first brush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. There are a few bristles still coming out, but it does not bother me, or affect the performance. Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Works fine. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Ideal bristle dispersion, well-balanced: a fine shaving brush that will be used a lot.  We look forward to doing business with this company again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a brush, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose Escali. There&#x27;s nothing like using 100% pure badger hair to apply your favorite shave soap. The way it glides over your face, it feels like a the softest feather you&#x27;ve ever touched. This is a brush that I&#x27;ll continue to use for as long as I need to shave. Also, opt for the stand. It looks so sexy.</li>
            <li> Not a super expensive brush, so it&#x27;s great for beginners in DE shaving to get to start with.  Hairs falling out at first is normal, after a few uses, it stops happening.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Works great, makes a very smooth and thick lather.  Have used it a lot and no shedding.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! As far as the funky smell, it only lasted a few times and was gone. I highly recommend it to anybody for the price and quality. The shipping was also very fast and I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what it was advertised to be and it is of excellent quality and does what it is supposed to at very good price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first brush, and it gets the job done well. Loses bristles every now and then, but that&#x27;s probably just me breaking it in. Recommended from someone with no other experience!</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this brush a lot yet, so far I&#x27;m very happy with it&#x27;s quality. It&#x27;s also soft and works fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it almost daily.  there were a couple of shedding hairs at first, but none after that.  good quality</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my better purchases. Will never go back to using my hands again. Like everyone else says, smells for the first couple of days, but after that, goes away.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product at fair price.&lt;br /&gt;Get a stand if you don&#x27;t already have one so you can dry it properly.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving brush. Works well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Went to the Art of Shaving and they wanted about $60-$80 for a badger shave brush.  This was way more cost effective and works great as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Don&#x27;t know if there would be much of a difference if I paid 5 times as much!</li>
            <li> I think that, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this brush. I am new to the old school technique of shaving and this is the first brush that I have ever owned. Yeah, a few bristles fell out with the first couple uses. However, it has not changed the effectiveness of the brush what so ever. Get this brush as part of your starter set, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great value for an authentic natural shaving brush. Holds plenty of shaving cream and works just fine. Shipping timely and problem free.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the &amp;#34;Safety Razor&amp;#34; form of shaving, and didn&#x27;t want to spend $40-80 on a &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; brush until I knew I would like this shaving method.  The Escali brush seems to be of very good quality, especially for the price (about $13).  It absorbs warm water very well for pre-shave &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34;, lathers well in shave bowl, and does a nice job in exfoliating skin as you spread the later across your face (circular motions).  I doubt I will be buying a &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; brush any time soon since this brush more than meets my needs and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this brush will shed a little bit, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a terrific brush for the price, a great value.  Not sure what the $80 brushes can offer that would make them worth $67 more than this brush.  If you are new to this shaving method, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with these brushes because I am new to using them. However, it seems to give a good lather and it does what it is supposed to do. I find maybe 3 hairs that fall out each shave, but it isn&#x27;t really an issue--I think most of these lose a few each shave. I&#x27;ve had it for three months, use it 2-5 times a week, and I don&#x27;t foresee needing a new one for a while. For the price, I definitely say go for it.</li>
            <li> Good price, great brush.  Would buy again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks complain about the odor.  This is normal for a badger brush.  I lathered it up and let it sit out overnight and dry.  In the morning I rinsed it out, no smell.  Easy.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving brush.  Warm it up in some water and get at it with my shaving cream in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;recommended for anyone wanting to use a brush - or looking for another.</li>
            <li> The Brush is great... a little stiff at first but smoothed out wonderfully quick.  The brush was shipped fast and I am totally happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using a double edge again after many years away from one. I ordered the Escali shaving brush in the same order as the Old Bond Coconut shaving cream and have been very pleased with both purchases. The Coconut cream does not have an overpowering scent and lathers quickly. I use an oil pre-shave from Kiehls which helps my very sensitive skin. The brush dries quickly. There was some shedding the first couple of days, but that seems to have tapered off. After two weeks I&#x27;m very satisfied with my choices.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money.  It takes a week or so to break in but after using for several weeks the bristles all stay in tact and the slight badger butt smell is gone.</li>
            <li> This is my first Shaving Brush and well..... it gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not great. The hairs are not very soft, almost prickly. It seems to lose a lot of hairs in the beginning (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far), but I can deal with that. I just wish it were a little softer. It helps if you let it soak in warm - hot water for a few minutes while you prepare for the shave.</li>
            <li> Money wise this brush isn&#x27;t going to dent your wallet, but at the same time it&#x27;s not a great brush. 3 stars might be one too many, but I was feeling generous.</li>
            <li> Made of real badger hair just like my grandfather&#x27;s, not that cheap synthetic stuff. Nothing like having the real thing.</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get. It sheds every single time for me. The price was right for me, being a beginner. But let&#x27;s not be fooled, this is a cheap brush for a cheap price, and it deserves a lower review than 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the way I started shaving too many years ago, brush, DE Razor and a cream.  This brush is excellent, have not experienced any loss of hairs, dries quickly and feels great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hoping the shedding and odor stop after a few more uses, but otherwise excellent -- very easy to build up a good, even lather with minimal soap.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It is a nice combination of soft and firm; not too prickly, but enough so that it can work the shaving soap into my beard. The quality of manufacturing seems good and I expect it to last a long time. I&#x27;d buy this brush again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using a good brush with shaving soap rather than cream.  This brush fits the bill.  I would recommend people try it.</li>
            <li> Received the brush and have been using it for a week. It is well made and lathers well, however it is not as soft as I anticipated.  As mentioned by another reviewer, it is quite prickly. Maybe there is a break in period but at this point it is not as soft as my Omega Boar Brush. It has a good price point but the distinction between boar or badger is not evident with this brush at this time.</li>
            <li> Having used other brushes for DE shaving, was expecting &amp;#34;more of the same&amp;#34; from this product.  Am VERY happy to report, such was not the case.  From the first time this Escali brush met the soap puck, it&#x27;s been love at first shave!  The badger hair soaks up just the right amount of warm water to transform any of my shaving soaps into a decadent mound of shaving smoothness.  Highly recommend this product to my fellow DE and cut throat blade shavers!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price ... Lathers well and helps with a close shave .. A++++..a must have for everyday shaving</li>
            <li> This brush is very nice and inexpensive.  It works great, I&#x27;ve only had a couple of times where the needles have come out but that&#x27;s a MINOR issue, soft and very nice.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago, and am finally getting around to reviewing it...  I picked this up when I made the switch from my expensive Fusion razors to an old school safety razor.  I figured this brush was going to be junk, but wanted to see if I liked shaving this way.  Over two years later I&#x27;m still using the same brush.  It works well, and certainly lasted longer then expected.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit unfair for me to post a review since it is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a shaving brush, I have nothing to compare it to.  Still, this feels like a quality brush that gets the job done. My shaving soap is applied as needed and the brush does not irritate my skin. In fact, it&#x27;s a rather pleasant experience. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving brush that I have used so far, highly recommended. I would buy it again and will continue using it!</li>
            <li> Very soft, hairs are falling off after 15uses. Not a bad brush for the price but I would spend more money on a better brush. fast shipping</li>
            <li> This little brush is a great deal for the money. I am new to all the rage over wet-shaving with a single blade, and this shaving brush more than meets my requirements for value and performance. Shipping was fast, also. Thanks for a good product and the excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush! It seems to work pretty well lathering and getting soap everywhere evenly. The texture is good and not unpleasant. Seems to be quality badgers.</li>
            <li> It lost so much hair on every use. We bought this just because of the 4 star rating but my husband is not satisfied with the product. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it. He has super sensitive skin, but this brush gives him a close shave with no skin irritation,</li>
            <li> This brush has held up well and does what it is supposed to do. I leave it in my shaving mug, as opposed to the recommended hanging stand, and it holds its shape fine. I don&#x27;t expect to ever go back to canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the quality of this inexpensive brush. If you are thinking about using a shave brush, this is the best trial brush to use. The first week of use the brush shed its share of hair. After a week, the shedding slowed drastically and maintained a quality shave brush. Excellent starter brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got one of these already for myself, and liked it so much I gave one away as a gift to my brother who is just getting into wet shaving.  It gets the job done, holds together (a few hairs came out for the first week or so, but that&#x27;s fairly normal and it hasn&#x27;t had a shedding problem since)and doesn&#x27;t look so bad either. Like most real-badger hair brushes, there&#x27;s a bit of a funk to it right out of the package; give it a good hot water rinse, soap it up really well with the shave soap of your choice, and let it dry overnight.  A gentle rinse-out the next day and it should be good to go, (also helps get rid of loose hairs at this point instead of on your face!) if not then one more soap up should do it. The price is right, I&#x27;d recommend it for beginners, although I&#x27;m sure you could get some good mileage as your main brush as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit I&#x27;m just beginning to get used to this brush. At first it had such thick, abundant bristles, the shaving cream almost got lost in it. Now that I&#x27;m using a bit more water in working up a lather, I&#x27;m beginning to see that it&#x27;s really a very good brush. It&#x27;s not as soft as I expected, but I think that ultimately will change--and if it doesn&#x27;t, at least it will exfoliate my skin well. Good product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much different from the synthetic alternative. It might be a little softer, but it occasionally pokes you like the synthetic brush and has a very slight smell (unlike the synthetic). Bristles also fall out more often than the synthetic brush, which is annoying if it gets embedded in the shaving soap. Overall a good product, but I prefer synthetic.</li>
            <li> Once properly broken in, the brush is PHENOMENAL.  It gets tender and soft, but still maintains its bushy nature.  Definitely makes shaving a more pleasant experience!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this brush. I was hoping with all of the good reviews, this would have been a good purchase....I was wrong. First...I was unprepared for how small it would be. I realized, with such a low price, it would likely be smaller than the brush it was replacing. It is considerably smaller than the brush I got from this shaving kit here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Van-Hagen-Mens-Luxury-Shave/dp/B004L4EING/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1354139209&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;shaving+kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is something that I am willing to overlook...however, what I was not happy about is that the brush started losing a high number of bristles from day one. I followed the same practices that I was using with my old brush...but I felt like I probably lost more bristles out of this brush in the first three weeks than I did in about eight months with my old brush. With all the good reviews for this product, I&#x27;m not sure if I just happened to get a bad, individual brush or what...I was so disappointed with it, I went back to my old brush for now.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple of weeks now and every time I get 10-20 (no exageration) Hairs that come out in the bowl or on my face or both. I thought it would stop after a few uses but It&#x27;s still losing hair every use. At this rate it will be bald within a few months. I gave it 2 stars rather than one because it does whip up a good lather. But so do my other Badger, Boar, And horse hair brushes. If you have never used a horse hair brush you should try it. They are on amazon and not too expensive</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of brushes in my day and this is a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave straight razor and although you can get away with using a crappy brush a good brush with fine bristles I find&lt;br /&gt;helpful in getting lather all around the hair and ensuring a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tip I can give people who use a brush is to get some hair conditioner (any kind will do) and to use this on their brush after they clean off the soap. The reason for this is simple - it ensures that the brushes natural hair bristles don&#x27;t chip off or split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a five star product I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> first time using a shaving brush, in the begining it lost a few hair (to be expected) I am using it everyday and no problems. very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Well made and feels great</li>
            <li> It is about as expected for the price.  Decent badger hair brush.  Two things bumped it from 3 to 2 stars, however:&lt;br /&gt;1 - There was an odd smell when it was wet the first half dozen times it was used.  This was eventually replaced by the scent of my shave soap, or washed out possibly.  Even after the initial washing, it was still noticeable.  Not sure what the cause was, but this is the first brush (of several) I have purchased that had any sort of odor.&lt;br /&gt;2 - It sheds, in a bad way.  Again, not my first brush, but this one constantly has hair coming loose.  It has tapered off with use, and some is expected, but this was excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really worth the hassle to return/replace, and it is functional, but I will not be buying another.</li>
            <li> Good brush, it does have that badger smell a bit, but it is hardly noticeable. Not sure about the product for the money though</li>
            <li> Works as it should, but that is the best I can say about it. The brussels are hard and constantly fall off, even after a month of use. I kinda wish I had just spent more and went up to a nicer brush that does shed its brussels so much.</li>
            <li> Great quality item for the right price! Can&#x27;t go wrong here, so buy it today.  Three weeks of use and only a few hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Solid, basic brush.  Nothing fancy.  After a few weeks, it seems to be holding it&#x27;s shape pretty well, with only a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Holds water well and is soft.  Lots a few hairs after first use.  Make sure to soak and rinse prior to first use.  Also wash with small amount of soap.  Smells a little when first use; goes away quickly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The brush is of good quality, though I wish the brush was longer. When I first used the brush it lost a half dozen bristles but I expect this is normal. I have not had any problem with the brush and I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an entry point into &amp;#34;shaving like my grandfather&amp;#34; and while I am really sold on the new way of shaving this brush has shed every time I have used it.  When it runs out of bristles, which looks to be soon, I will replace with a more expensive and higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Works well but hairs fall out a lot more than I expected.  It&#x27;s kind of annoying having badger hair on your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have a wealth of hand-on knowledge of competing products, but I can say this product seems to be well-constructed in the month or so I&#x27;ve been using it.  It has not shed many bristles and has maintained its shape very well.  The metal ring hasn&#x27;t rusted.  The wooden handle has held up well without absorbing water and swelling.  It generates a solid lather and holds sufficient amounts of cream when used with a quality cream and the appropriate amount of water.  No real complaints.</li>
            <li> Really nice feel, bristles are firmly in place. Great product!</li>
            <li> It works....So there is that. Periodically loses a hair or so, but frankly, that is the point of shaving, innit?</li>
            <li> That little badger sure does lather me up.  Excellent little badger brush....better than than the squirrel brush I used to have</li>
            <li> When I first converted to DE Safety Razor shaving, I decided to go with this brush. It was cheap yet highly rated; I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive brush if I didn&#x27;t like the safety razor experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years, it&#x27;s still in tip-top shape. I can&#x27;t imagine buying a much more expensive brush. This has worked beautifully. I shave about 2-3 times a week (less than average) and it has lasted me 2 years and imagine it will last me several more years. You lose a bristle once in awhile, but there are enough to last years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product for the price. If you are making the switch to old-school shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush shed maybe 20 bristles on my first use, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance. Since then I probably lose 5 to 10 bristles each time. I always store it upside down to let the water drain out of the handle and I keep it on an open airy shelf. It&#x27;s a pity it won&#x27;t last long because the bristles spread very nicely on the face and work the soap into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous brush was one of the ones you buy off the shelf in Walmart, and this one does perform better. But next time I need a replacement I think I&#x27;ll have to try one of the more expensive brushes to see if it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Well made shaving brush.  The bristles are a little pokey to my sensitive face, but love the hot lather shave that results.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and quite honestly I wouldn&#x27;t know badger hair from cat hair. But this brush does as advertised and is quite handsome. Good price also! Why would anyone want to pay over $20.00 for a hair brush? Buy this brush!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how much water these bristles can hold and how easy it is to lather up and clean.  Great product.</li>
            <li> As a wet shave beginner, this seemed like an easy choice.  It had good recommendations and looked like a clear winner in regards to price.  A few bristles came out in the beginning, great brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the value.  Bristles are soft enough not to prickle your legs/face, but tough enough to hold soap and stand your hairs up.  I bought one and stored it rightside up (as the picture shows) for about a year, not realizing this is bad for the brush!  The bristles came off in one big bunch eventually.  I&#x27;ve had another one now for a year, storing it hanging upside down properly, and it&#x27;s lasting very well.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush but I like it. It shed a lot for the first 4-5 uses but now it only sheds 1 hair once and a while.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised, great entry level badger brush that I&#x27;ll continue to use. I would recommend to anyone getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Great feeling while lathering</li>
            <li> A fantastic product! The bristles are very soft and pliable and spread the shaving cream evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> I have just used the Escali brush for a few days after using another brush that came with my straight razor shaving kit a few months back. The quality and feel of the Ecali brush is excellent by comparison and it is losing few hairs. Looks like excellent quality so far.</li>
            <li> Decent quality&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Nice finish&lt;br /&gt;Product is as described&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs fall out, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> So far, brush seems to be of good quality. It&#x27;s held up well. When I use it, it seems to prep my skin for shaving.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this purchase as it was quite cheap. It lathers up a cream/soap quite nicely but is a bit prickly. After the first shave with it, I noticed that there was quite a few hairs falling out. I guess it will work for me until I buy something of a higher quality.</li>
            <li> No matter how gentle you are it looses entirely too much hair. After washing it prior to the first use I had to pull the drain trap under my sink to clear all the hair from it. Also this brush has a horrid &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; musky smell even after washing and conditioning several times. Just not worth buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s face is super soft after using this brush and actual shave cream. He&#x27;s never used one before, so make sure it&#x27;s wet beforehand, otherwise it&#x27;s a little too scratchy. I also got him Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream in grapefruit, his favorite scent, and it&#x27;s just a fun gift he would never have bought himself. Never hurts to have a little man-pampering from time to time.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money! Lathers up nice! Just the  right amount of exfoliating &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and still gentle on the face. Bristles lay up well for a lower priced badger brush. Definitely a great  brush for travel use or as a back up.</li>
            <li> Economical brush for those on a budget. It shed a few hairs at first but is breaking in nicely. Creates lather easily and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I had several loose bristles that fell off... but that&#x27;s to be expected with a new brush. Otherwise, no problems; I would definitely recommend this one to my family/friends.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  My husband uses it every day and has one here and at our winter home.  He is very satisfied with your product.  It is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush so I do not have a basis for comparison.  But, I use it with Proraso Shaving cream and it works well.  I can get a good thick lather in not time at all.  Enough for multiple shaves.  The brushes texture feels good against my skin and seems to work the cream in well.</li>
            <li> This brush has been great. It was my first &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; shaving accessory to use with my newly acquired shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it is true Badger hair because my dog went nuts sniffing it.</li>
            <li> I picked this brush based on the recommendation of others and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It comes for a great price, was shipped quickly, and the hairs are just the right stiffness for a great lather.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the bristles have begun falling out. Extremely disappointing as it was given as a gift and it had been so highly rated. I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was an aberration, but I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Escali shaving brush works great and is a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush performed its function alright, but the clear coating on the outside started to peel off within a few months. This might just be the nature of the beast with this kind of design, but in the future I would try for something with a more water-resilient handle.</li>
            <li> High quality badger shaving brush.  It&#x27;s super absorbent, very soft, and makes a great lather.  Definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this brush when I first got into shaving with a DE safety razor and didn&#x27;t want to drop big bucks on an expensive brush without knowing if I&#x27;d like it or not.  This brush has performed perfectly, it holds water nicely, builds a great lather, and it doesn&#x27;t smell.  I will say that the first couple times I used it that the brush was a little prickly but after 3-5 uses it has been broken in and is soft and works flawlessly.  I have lost a few bristles at first but they don&#x27;t seem to be coming out anymore. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone who is just starting out or anyone who just doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a brush.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but it seems to work very well.  It is very soft and appears to be a solid product.  I had a couple of hairs fall out initially, but I have not had anymore fall out since then.  Does its job.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you could beat this authentic badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses hair the first handful of times you use it and sometimes they end up stuck to your face (ha) but again, for the price, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to find a perfect brush. This brush is about economy and on that front, I think it succeeds fabulously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for someone on a budget or someone who wants to try out old timey shaving without investing a lot.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package;  I was a little bit disappointed: It was smaller than what I expected but the build/material quality was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use: It is already my favorite brush. It is soft; holds water and cream really well and doesn&#x27;t make me the itchy when an occasional strand falls out. Others complained about the smell but out of the box (and after heavy usage for 2 weeks) it still has a pleasant one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus is that even though I don&#x27;t hang it upside down; it really dries well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the brush was smaller especially compared to my older ones. If it will last for a reasonable amount of time; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush 5 months ago (January 2013), and have been delighted with it&#x27;s quality and function.  Yes, it&#x27;s an economical choice in comparison with many other brushes available on Amazon, however, don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking it lacks in quality...  IT DOESN&#x27;T.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend or relative, and were I to somehow loose this brush, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a couple of weeks, really like the lather it holds, and brushes up nicely under the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it so far; lathers up nicely using Proraso.  Lost a few bristles the first few shaves, but none since.  I&#x27;m not sure if the slight prickly feel is normal or not, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  Yes there was a little bit of a &#x27;wet animal&#x27; smell to it at first but it has gone away.  Rinses well, and just a slight squeeze to get the water out is all it needs before hanging it up.</li>
            <li> This brush is OK after a few weeks of using it, but the first times you get it wet it&#x27;s awful. It smells like you&#x27;ve got the bad end of the zoo under your nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know about longevity, but after the break-in period, so to speak, it hasn&#x27;t been losing too many hairs.</li>
            <li> I got the shave brush a day before my delivery estimate. It definitely had a badgery musk to it, but nothing terrible. It is a very nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. It does its work. It evenly and easy cover your face with shaving cream. It saves your shaving cream, because you put just a little bit of the cream on the brush, put on your face and the rest is easy... Cleaning the brush is very easy as well.</li>
            <li> This brush works well enough for an entry level brush but mine likes to shed hairs.  Clearly an entry level brush - you may be interested in looking for a better one once you really start shaving.  With that said I would recommend this product to people starting out.  You can&#x27;t beat the price:function ratio anywhere.</li>
            <li> This brush is so prickly that I almost feel like my skin is going to get punctured. Uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for a beginner like me. I got this because I wanted a badger brush instead of a boar brush and a badger brush is definitely better.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice lather and cleans very easily. Do pay attention to how you&#x27;re supposed to dry the brush to keep its form.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast but bristles shed a bit more than expected. I found it a bit disappointing considering Tweezerman model is same price. I was hoping to get a better product paying more. I was able to find a brush priced more competitive on Amazon than tweezerman and escali. I would recommend as it outperformed the two brands. You can search on amazon for Bellus 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush. Hope this review  was helpful.</li>
            <li> Great price and even better product (super soft).. Will certainly go back to escali again for all my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> After a long time using shaving gels and brushless creams, I decided to go the old-fashioned way and found the Escali shaving brush. It was delivered as promised on time per the description. I have been using it for a few weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The process of lathering prepares the skin for a very close shave and has also reduced the ingrown hair issue I intermittently had.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush without reservation.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father and he loves it. He says he can tell it&#x27;s much better than the camel hair brush he was previously using.</li>
            <li> My job requires me to travel 100%, and I have learned to pack lightly.  I never carry big cans of shaving cream, but I do carry a this high quality pure badger shaving brush, and a small bar of shaving soap.  The local retails store offered a similar shaving brush for more than three time the cost of this produce.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the brushes I had in the past. Feels great on your face. Dries rather quickly. Makes thick leather.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - satisfied completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a month now, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it. Initially there was a strong smell to the brush, but that went away. I&#x27;ve noticed the best way to get a nice lather is to just use the top half of the brush in rapid circular strokes - initially I found myself using a lot more pressure and mashing the whole thing into the bowl which wasn&#x27;t effective. Clean up is easy too. I do find a stray hair every now and then, but since this is my first brush, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if this was normal or not.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a fancy, dapper scientist and this brush covers all of my bases.  I&#x27;ve had issues in the past of brushes going sour because my pre-shave oil adheres to them too quickly and saturates the bristles; the treatment on these bristles has successfully kept them oil free.  Also, the copper ring seems like a decorative touch, but it should stop corrosion of the wood and bristles of the base by being a sacrificial element, much like the zinc plates on boats.  I expect this brush to last a long time in great service!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my husband, &amp; he is quite pleased with the Badger bristles. He has been using it for a few weeks now, &amp; likes it much better than his old brush. The shaving brush arrived within days of my ordering it!</li>
            <li> Boar bristle is a bit stiffer and makes thicker lather, but badger feels better and gives better control of the application of the lather.  These bristles are soft.  Both types of brush shed.  I can see now, why badger is more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> A little prickly the first few shaves but just fine after that. Loses a hair or two here or there but nothing unreasonable.</li>
            <li> Quality shaving brush, would buy again , highly recommended. Makes rich lather with little effort what more can you say about a shaving brush?</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for about 2 weeks.  It lost about 20 hairs the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but none since then.  It had a strong animal smell for the first few uses, but the smell is almost gone now.  I really like how it lathers, and how it feels on my face!  I like the wood handle. The price is so good, that for sure I will order again if this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I love my brush, it makes all the world&#x27;s difference when shaving. I purchased the shaving soap for Italy, and the brush was a must. It reminds me of my grandfather every time I use it. it can in right on time. Great job, I will be using this company in all my future needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PT</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.  Really helps to lather up for the wet shave.  A few hairs came out on first use, but none since</li>
            <li> After a short period of use, the brushes began to break away. Quality is bad. I don&#x27;t recommend! Thank you</li>
            <li> Very soft and full shaving brush that fits stands well, with wood that blends well with any type stand and razor.  Hard to go wrong with this classy  brush, which is also economically priced. Treat your face well; it deserves no less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Have been using it for more than a month now without any issues. The brush works just great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace a badger-hair shaving brush I&#x27;d bought from \\&quot;The Art of Shaving.\\&quot; This product is equivalent or (in handle design and quality) arguably better, for about a quarter of the price. Whether using store-bought aerosol lathers or shaving soaps/cremes, it does a nice job of ensuring better whisker coating, making my shaves more comfortable and closer. I will likely buy a couple more for my adults sons for their next birthdays.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived promptly and as advertised. I&#x27;m a bit concerned that the wood will begin to wear a bit when wet, but perhaps that will make a nice hand-worn patina.</li>
            <li> Hubby says its better than boars hair and puts cream on smoothly. I don&#x27;t know but as long as he likes it im happy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no lather to speak off. Avoid this brush. 5 times and nothing.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from disposable blades to safety razor and needed to get the necessary tools to shave.  Excellent shaving brush. Lathers up my shaving soap effortlessly and transfers the soap to my face smoothly. I had a flash back from when I was little kid and tried my Dad&#x27;s shaving brush, it felt so much like his, brought a smile to my face. So I&#x27;ll say this brush has ties to the way things were, when a man took the time to have a nice shave, using well made products. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> for about twice the cost of this brush, you can buy one that&#x27;s worth owning. The quality is decent but in this price range they use the worst hair from the badger and the bristles are outperformed by synthetics.</li>
            <li> This was my son&#x27;s description of using this brush, with some good quality shaving soap,on his very sensitive face. He really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it- with a good soap, it creates a fantastic lather, with no bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing it job perfectly. Not much else to say. Nice brush. Seems to be holding itself together nicley.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as a backup for when the brush I am using needs replacing. When I saw this brush though, I retired my first brush to the backup role, and am using this item as my primary shaving brush.  It is outstanding!</li>
            <li> It works just as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a month and have not had any shedding of bristles, but I also take care with the use, alternate brushes and comb it out when dry. It lathers nicely with creams, I have not used with hard soap (I use a Muhle synthetic for that), and I can get 3 to 4 passes, no sweat, without drying out. I received this brush quickly and it was package well, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed too much, or any more than I expect it to. It works beautifully, does not smell much. It&#x27;s great, and a great price.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, and I think it&#x27;s suitable for any beginner. A few things of note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - When it gets wet, it smells like an animal for the first couple uses (not surprising, given the brush&#x27;s badger hair origins). The smell dissipates after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt; - Quite a few hairs fell out during the first few uses, which was somewhat annoying, as they&#x27;d stick to my face when I&#x27;d lather my face up. After a few weeks, I&#x27;m getting one or two hairs falling out per use, but it still looks full.&lt;br /&gt; - Does a great job creating a lather quickly, and it feels pretty soft on the face when applying the leather.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price. Hairs will fall out for a few days but the it quit. It does fell nice on the face and drys quick. Not a bad buy...</li>
            <li> First shave resulted in bristles all over my face and soap cake. Brown color rinsed from the brush throughout the shave. Five shaves in and it still sheds bristles constantly. Also still a very prickly brush even though I let it soak in hot water for about 10 minutes before each use. Spend the extra $10 and don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
            <li> Initially (the first week of use) loose hairs kept coming out of the brush. Now that i have been using it for over a month the brush is excellant.</li>
            <li> After receiving the brush, I used it for a few days and it was very comfortable on my skin and worked up a great lather. I noticed a few loose hairs which is completely normal for the first few days. Overall I am very happy my new brush and my shave is better than ever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful shave brush even to a new user as me. Makes my new shave soap easy to use. Thanks I got the best.</li>
            <li> Generally pretty good brush, durable, does what it should do.  Would recommend for a low cost general brush, especially with shave soap</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he really likes it. Good product at a great price.  Update: my husband still likes it, but the bristles are starting to fall out. Not sure what&#x27;s causing it, but he said he&#x27;s probably going to have to throw it out soon. He only uses it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving brush for many years, but this is my first badger hair brush. I love it; they really bring up a lather. The quality of this one from Escali is all that could be desired.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is perfect. You can create a thick lather very easily without having to use much shaving cream. The hairs also retain their shape well. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than you think it would - it justifies any initial costs.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, lathers soap quickly, rinses out fast, holds shape . Not too much more to say about a shaving brush , if you need one this a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shave brush before or shaving soap that requires a brush. Anyway, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned and I bought it based on the reviews and price. I don&#x27;t have any to compare it to. The reviews and online tutorials all said to get a pure badger hair brush, so I looked for the best most reasonably priced one I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, and seems well constructed. I can whip up a good thick creamy foam without too much trial and error. The wood handle is nice and does not seem to be affected by being immersed in water. I soak it in hot water first then whip up the cream and apply it. The bristles are soft but strong and stiff enough to whip up the cream easily and hold more than enough for multiple shaves. The bristles are able to pull up the stubble and help prepare the face for a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it tends to lose more bristles/hairs than I think it should. I know any brush made from hair will lose some but it is a little more than should be acceptable. Thus, one star down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it was worth the money and it works well, I am not disapointed!</li>
            <li> I picked up this brush because it had solid reviews and a low price tag.  I had a synthetic brush from a big-box retailer and wanted to give real badger hair a try.  The price was right and quality seems to be about on par with other entry level brushes.  There was a strong animal and chemical smell for a few weeks, but now it just smells like my shave soap.  A few bristles have fallen out (several during the first few shaves), but that seems to have stopped now.  Make sure you get a stand like the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand.  You want to hang dry the brush to prevent early wear.  Definitely a solid purchase if you are getting into traditional wet-shaving.</li>
            <li> I decided try using a shaving brush with shaving soap. I really like the experience of using the brush but this particular brush sheds bristles at an unbelievable rate. Since I paid less than $14.00 I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my husbandand he appears to be very satisfied amd pronounces it as being quite effective developing the foam he wants for shaving.</li>
            <li> ... started noticing loose bristles falling off with very first use. I dismissed this as something normal with a brand new brush, but that is not the case. The brush works fine. It&#x27;s a little on the \\&quot;rough\\&quot; end of the spectrum. The brush seems to be more rigid that others I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s a matter of preference. It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also like for things I buy to last, and this did not start out well for this brush. I&#x27;ve had this brish for over 5 weeks, and every single time I see loose hair coming off the brush. Do not see this brush lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced this with Vulfix 22B and what a difference!!! Have not see even one loose hair yet.</li>
            <li> not bad but wished the handle was a little bit longer I have a big hand and it is just a little on the small side for me. works fine make sure you break it in and get the apoxy smell out of it before you start using it regular.</li>
            <li> Works great for being only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up nicely and seems like it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas... HE LOVES IT! He says it&#x27;s a much nicer brush than the one he started out with from Wal-mart. Fits nice with Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand too! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago. It is a pretty good brush, given the price (about $15 all told) and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it. It holds a good amount of mosture  and spreads your lather in a nice and even manner. That having been said, it&#x27;s certainly not top shelf quality; despite properly handling and storing it, I still get the occasional stray hair in my shaving cream. Overall I&#x27;d give it a 4/5, and say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush takes me back many years when shaving was an art and not just an inconvenience.  The Escali Badger brush is of a great quality and far better than the horsehair brushes I used in the 1970&#x27;s.  Perella&#x27;s shipped the item promptly and it arrived when they said it would.  I am very pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush five or six time so far. It works excellently. dries well even though I dont have a fancy holder for it. dries just fine laying down on its side. when matched with good shaving cream from bath and body works by co bigelow, I would have thought I was at an old world barber shop and my face feels great. Brush sheds minimally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my badger brush for a good few months now and it&#x27;s performed great. I had a few bristles fall out with the initial usage but since then it hasn&#x27;t lost but may be 1 or 2 while rinsing. This is 100% normal when you have any natural bristle brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple uses the bristles were nice and soft and dry wonderfully after each use. I would heartily recommend this brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price point!</li>
            <li> I had a boar bristle brush before buying this better badger bristle brush (whoa, what a mouthful!) The the difference between the two is pretty clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten a boar brush as a part of a cheap shaving package from Walmart (also available on Amazon, however) that included the brush, a bowl, and some shaving soap.  The boar bristle brush did not make a very thick lather (little did I realize at the time!) and left bristles all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as soon as I got THIS badger brush and tried it out on the same puck of shaving soap, I was amazed to find the lather just foaming off of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the brush is a pleasure every morning.  However, there was a noticeable odor for the first week that I used this brush that has since vanished.  The smell was only unpleasant while applying the lather, and didn&#x27;t stick around, and now it&#x27;s gone completely!  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend this shaving brush, even if you own a boar bristle brush, badger bristle brushes beat boar bristle brushes bar none!</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks into my time with this brush, I finally gave up on it. Every single day I&#x27;d end up with bristles falling out of the brush and ending up on my face buried in lather. Not a great experience.</li>
            <li> I wanted a high quality product that would not have to be replaced. I got exactly what I ordered.  It works very good and fits my hand well.  It works up a nice lather and rinses easily.  I have had no problems with the product.&lt;br /&gt;On a funny note.  I have Yorkshire terriers, a breed of dog bred known and bred for hunting down and killing rats and small rodents.  When I pulled the brush out of the box when it was new, I ran it across my face to see how it felt.  My 2yr old female yorkie saw it and must have seen the hair pattern or something.  She went ballistic.  Barking her brains out in full attack mode as if the brush were going to kill me.  So it must be real badger hair.  HaHa.&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, its all around a premium product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;Great shaving brush at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Works great and seems to be a high quality item.</li>
            <li> Been shaving for 20 plus years and always used the pre-canned stuff you can get at the store.  While I was on a trip I got a professional shave and the gal used a brush and actually whipped up the cream in a cup like in the old westerns.  I loved the way my skin felt afterwards and had to switch over to this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was order some popular stuff from amazon and quickly found out that the brush had a lot to do with the application.  I had purchased a plastic handled one on the first go around and it didn&#x27;t last a month or so before it was loose and needed replacing.  Not a problem with the Escali model, it&#x27;s got a nice wood handle and the bristles are rock solid in it.  I would add that this has a good sized handle for those of us with bigger than average hands.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Badger hair brush is excellent for applying shave cream and it is really well built.  Definitely a recommended item for someone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for shaving - bristles are soft enough not to irritate, but strong enough to provide a good lather.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel due to its compact size and good reviews. For the price it good, it sheds a little but my expectations aren&#x27;t dashed either. For 10 bucks and real badger with a good feel it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  It lathers easy and just stiff enough to lift hairs.  I like this brush more then my boars hair.</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles. No shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this. Not an expert, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product! Made to last forever!</li>
            <li> This brush costs the same as some boar&#x27;s hair brushes I have used, but is badger.  The difference is night and day in terms of comfort for me.  I am enjoying this using this brush, and the wood adds a nice touch to my counter.</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of a new/old school shaving kit for my husband who has everything....&lt;br /&gt;He loves it.  Attractive,  high quality, and a face foaming machine. Nothing like a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using shaving soap and a brush some years ago because I could never produce good, rich foam. I recently started shaving with a DE razor again and wanted the \\&quot;total experience.\\&quot;  I purchased an Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, and what a difference!  With this brush I can produce a big handfull of rich foam every time.  It&#x27;s ALMOST fun to shave!</li>
            <li> I have had the brush for about a month now -- enough time to make several comments.  (1) An earlier reviewer suggested hanging the brush upside down using neodynium magnets.  I purchased these magnets from Amazon with my brush order and glued one to the brush and another to the underside of a wooden shelf.  Shaking the brush of excess water before hanging it, I find it smells fine and works well.  (2)  As just noted, I have not been aware of a musty animal smell at all.  (3)  Over a month, the brush has perhaps shed six or seven brisitles -- not a major problem.  Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li> great brush for saving</li>
            <li> My husband loved it! Reminds him of his father shaving.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush for the money, great service made this a win all around.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  I love the way it feels on my face ( very soft ).  This brush picks up soap and turns it into a rich lather much faster than other brushes I have owned...This is a great bush to use daily or add to the daily rotation as some wet shavers are doing these days, ask me how I know...</li>
            <li> A good, basic brush that does the job. Nothing amazing or horrible about it.</li>
            <li> Given that shave shops will charge upwards of $50 on the low end for a real badger hair brush, I don&#x27;t have much to complain about here. When I first got it, there was a lot of shedding of the hairs, now it doesn&#x27;t do it as often. All in all, for the money, this was a solid buy.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush that works great. I had a small amount of shedding in the beginning, but nothing to worry about. Overall great value and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> When I first opened, it had a terrible smell! Washed it several times and used it any way. It did not create good foam out of the leather shaving cream (I use Old Spice). Sometimes shaving brushes need a few shaves. So I tried a few more times. The smell was less but it was still there. Then I got skin issues from the brush, which is when I fully stopped. Won&#x27;t recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> Looks awesome with our Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand!</li>
            <li> So I purchased this as a set with my new safety razer, at first i didn&#x27;t think i was going to use it as much and that I would just use some shaving cream. But, to be honest this is worth it. It&#x27;s nice having the soap the brush and everything. This brush is incredibly soft, creates a great lather, and it&#x27;s become a part of my daily shaving ritual.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a badger brush but it works good. Like I said I&#x27;m new so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.</li>
            <li> This brush is a gift for my brother for Christmas.  His dog chewed up his old one so I was really happy to find one of such good quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very good feeling on face excellent</li>
            <li> Despite following all recommendations, you will have bristles constantly shedding from this brush. Definitely a decent value to determine if you want to experiment with traditional shaving, but I will be upgrading</li>
            <li> Picked this shaving brush primarily for low price.&lt;br /&gt;Six months into using it, and it&#x27;s performing as well as the $50 dollar shaving brush I bought 20 years ago when it was new! Soft yet stiff enough to get a good lather going, and holds enough lather to go around the face completely in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s still performing well in another six months, I&#x27;ll bump my rating to a 5 out of 5...but every indication is that it&#x27;ll be doing just fine then.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth recommending a BUY on this one, as it does the job of a $100 brush and is well built.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than impressed with this brush. This is my first brush in my first foray into DE Razor shaving, but now, a few months into using this brush, it&#x27;s still shedding hairs. I expected a few to drop during the first few shaves while it worked itself out, but it&#x27;s becoming a bit unacceptable to continue having this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the super cheap &#x27;Van Der Hagen&#x27; set as well, and the Escali brush, while an improvement, is not a significant improvement over the plastic handled boar hair brush included in that set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, start with something extremely cheap, like the Van Der Hagen, and if you decide that Wet/DE/SE shaving is for you, get something good.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this brush is pleasant. Convenient and traditional. Gives my day a good start. That&#x27;s what I expected and got. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I purchased coming from a Boar I wanted to try a badger. It&#x27;s VERY small compared to my Omega. Almost uncomfortably small it&#x27;s hard to get a good whip going. It was also VERY smelly for a least 2 weeks. I like the badger hair and I may purchase another brush but for my this was a little small, a little stinky and just not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great brush for very nice price, bought two one for home and one for travel.</li>
            <li> Handle is wood and feels good but a little light for my taste. What bothers me about the brush is the amount of loose hair that comes out when shaving. Tried to get them out in the beginning but more continue to fall out. I&#x27;m sure at some point no further loose hairs will show up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about three weeks now so can&#x27;t really say much about the durability - but so far so good. Hold&#x27;s water/soap/cream well and whips up a good lather both in the cup and directly on my face. Had some shedding to start off with but that seems to have abated lately. 5 stars for price and function and if it lasts a year its a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so i don&#x27;t know what to expect but it seems to be doing the job.  There was some shedding the first week but not so much anymore.</li>
            <li> I got this brush about a month ago.  I shave pretty regularly (my head, rather than my beard) so I get a fair bit of use out of it.  I dry it with the bristles (handle on top) so that whatever it is that holds the bristles in doesn&#x27;t suffer any water damage.  I&#x27;m pretty gentle with it, but I bet it could take a bit more roughness than I give it and do fine.  It isn&#x27;t showing any signs of having issues and it seems like it&#x27;ll easily last for 5+ years more.</li>
            <li> I am updating my review of this brush.  It is now my travel brush and it still works but it is losing body in the middle of the brush.  When you get a good load of soap and start to lather, the brush falls flat.  I have since purchased a Van Der Hagen badger at Traget for $20 and it seems better so far.  I am getting ready to replace this one with an Omega boar bristle brush here on Amazon.  The reviews mentioned the boar bristle brushes typically have more body to them.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Compared to a silver tip badger price this product was extremely rough.  My best recommendation, spend the extra money on a  silver tip badger brush.  These actually last many years and will turn your shaving experience from chore to luxury.</li>
            <li> I got this brush to replace one that cost twice as much. While this is a small brush, it seems to be well made. After the first week, it stopped losing hair, and it&#x27;s been a great performer so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaving brush for a week now.  I get the BEST shave every day!</li>
            <li> This brush simply does as advertised. This is my first time shaving with means of a brush, but I have to say the way the soap and water work together with the help of the Escali shaving brush helps make this daily routine more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Other than losing a few bristles during the first couple of shaves, this is a very good brush.  And it fits nicely into my razor/shaving brush stand,</li>
            <li> The brush shed quite a few bristles at first but lately seems to have settled down. It&#x27;s scratchy but that&#x27;s typical of a lower-cost badger brush. For a softer texture, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this brush. It broke in really fast and no noticeable odor.</li>
            <li> Better than described!  Works great.  Shipping time much less than stated.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good for the price.  It was shipped quickly and packaged well.  Yes I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on whether or not to get a $50+ badger hair brush, but a friend of mine suggested this Escali brush.  I&#x27;m really glad I did because is has been great.  I also have an Escali stainless steel razor and brush stand.  Letting it air dry upside down helps keep it fresh and ready to go.  If you&#x27;re just getting into DE shaving, I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Good brush, quality is good but a few bristles do come out from time to time. Still worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like it but it shed bristles at first and Badger hair takes a few uses to properly soften into a comfortable brush.  This is normal and the brush will whip up a nice lather for shaving.  I like that I won&#x27;t be adding cans to the landfill and can produce and even better lather with a brush and shaving cake.</li>
            <li> Lathers soaps well and is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Got 3 brushes with this deal. They are exactly what I needed to lather for a shave. Good brush and good price.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to. But, It&#x27;s very soft to the touch, but a little prickly on my face the first time. I&#x27;d guess that it will probably get softer after a few uses. A few hairs fell out, maybe 10, while lathering up the soap. But, that&#x27;s probably to be expected. Seems to be good quality. I like it!</li>
            <li> This is my third brush and it is the only one that smells like a dead animal when it gets wet. I washed it with some antibacterial soap and its a little better, but still smells bad. It also lost about 20-30 bristles the first time I used it. Getting past that, it works ok--its very soft, softer than the other two I have used. I would not buy another one or recommend it to a friend. The $4 boar brush from Walmart is better. And I&#x27;m convinced this is in fact some animal other than badger....I am allergic to this brush. I get very red everywhere it touches and I have not had this problem with my other brushes. I would not be surprised if this was made of dog or cat hair. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Good quality brush and very affordable.  The handle is nice and comfortable, the brush gets a good lather.  Great value.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recently started to wet shave and did not want to spend a lot of money. The brush does the work, I do not have a point of comparison but I do not see what else can you expect from a brush. It retains a good amount of water. It is getting better, the more I use it. Only issue was with the smell out of the box, I washed the brush and made a solution of water and vinegar, let the brush in the solution for a couple of hours and smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller delivered brushed on time and product is as described. Was a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> The product exceeded my expectations, would do business with them in the future without hesitation. Great value for the money, vey satisfied</li>
            <li> Works well. The hairs come off a little bit, but the brush does an excellent job of lathering and getting under whiskers.</li>
            <li> no more cans of shaving cream. I am so impressed with this new/ old shaving I will never go back to cans. my wife even loves the way I look and smell after shaving. Great product, every man should return to this method.</li>
            <li> I have newly returned to the world of shaving with a safety razor. My initial purchase included a cheap brush, bowl and soap. The inferior brush shed constantly and so I purchased the Escali as a replacement. I cleaned the brush with shave soap and warm water and lathered up. I found the brush had a faint odor, but not to the point it was unusable. In subsequent shaves, the odor is gone. The Escali lathers up well, exfoliates well, does not shed and cleans up nicely. I have stored the brush with the bristles down in a brush holder, the shape is holding up perfectly after 2 months of every other day use. Would buy again and recommend this product to buyers who want a quality brush but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This Pure Badger Shaving brush was a great buy. This brush has been helping me get a closer shave with less irritation for a couple of months now! The only problem that I have had with it is that it can be difficult to clean depending on the type of shaving soap used.</li>
            <li> Works well, the hairs fall out slowly over time. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I have just started to shave as my father and his father did, and wow what a great shave I am getting. This brush is great, just a few hairs have come out which was expected. The brush is fantastic and works well to get plenty of creamy soap in cup , in hand, or on face. Looks great too in my shaving cup, love the light wood grain. Thanks for such a nice product at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is a great brush, took a while for all of the loose hairs to stop falling out but now that they have it lathers well and looks great on a stand.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and and has lost less than 5 bristles since I have owned it.  A great purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> In my efforts to switch over to safety razor shaving, I bought this shaving brush.  It&#x27;s cheap so I figured the damage would be minimal if it was terrible.  I&#x27;ve not tried a more expensive brush so I have nothing to compare this one to, but using this in conjunction with a good shaving cream I have been getting the closest shave of my life.  Properly using the safety razor has significantly cut down if not eliminated razor burn altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush builds a good lather, holds the cream in it very well, and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.  I see one hair from the brush on my face about every 3rd complete shave.  I&#x27;m lathering my face 3 times during the course of 1 complete shave with this shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be rubbish compared to the $50-$100 brushes, but at this price I think you should give it a shot and make up your own mind about it.  I personally love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Hold up well.  Is a pure pleasure to use.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Also love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure badger hair... funny thinking about that and makes me want to use it all the time besides what a great job it does.</li>
            <li> This brush was purchased as a gift for someone who wanted to try the older, traditional methods.  He absolutely loves using it, describing it as a facial massage.  It&#x27;s his favorite part of the entire gift!  There was, apparently, no issue with the brush being prickly.  So, based on his glowing reviews, I&#x27;d say it deserves five stars!</li>
            <li> Never had an old fashioned brush and safety razor. In the learning mode now. This feels nice on the face and works great. A few bristles have come loose but not a big deal as long as the rest of them stay put.  I also bought the Escali Stand for the razor and brush. Great combination.</li>
            <li> Great value. Received it on time.</li>
            <li> As others have seen from previous reviews, this item does smell. I&#x27;ve used it three times and the smell is starting to disappear and my shaving cream is starting to replace or mask the odor. I honestly don&#x27;t know what to compare the smell to but Elephant dung comes to mind. With that said and the smell dissipating the brush is really nice and does the job. I know it&#x27;s only been 3 shaves but as far now I do like the product and I&#x27;ll leave an updated review down the road after some more use.</li>
            <li> Too small of a brush head.  I RETURNED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.  It does the job of lathering the cream and spreading it like you&#x27;d expect.  Definitely not a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; model.  It loses a hair or two every time I use it.  Probably not bad for someone who wants to try it or for a travel brush.</li>
            <li> It does smell at first as people say, but that is what happens when you use dead animal hair on your face. The brush lost like ten or 15 hairs when I was first using it and now I barely see any. I would probably give this brush 5 stars as it is my first and it works great but the entire plume of badger hairs isn&#x27;t centered at all and that bothers me and my slight OCD.  I still use it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the buck. It&#x27;s not a high-end brush, and was losing bristles from the first use. The loss has stopped, so I am giving it 4 stars instead of 3.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> No problems.  Product as expected.  Nice soft hair.  No problem with sheading!!</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t fall apart like some of the cheap brands.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great service</li>
            <li> Probably 3.5 stars.  Very first time using a Shaving Brush.  The product itself is good quality.  Use with Arko shaving soap.  Have used 4 times and a few hairs/bristles have fallen out.  I did not have anything to compare to except using shaving cream applied by hand.  The bristles/hair are very pointy and somewhat irritating.  Takes some getting used to.  I don&#x27;t know if boar hair brush would be better.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to Badger hair.  Had to send it back.  It may be fine for someone without allergies though.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fair price. As advertised. Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and feels like good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for nearly 6 months and don&#x27;t have any complaints. Great value! I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this same brush again when the need arises to replace the one I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now so far so good.  Two or three bristles feel out first couple times using it none since. Would recommend to anyone. Good brush good price.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this brush on my skin, and it really seems to hold up for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to the canned shaving cream. Get a badger shaving brush as some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Useless shaving brush after 6 months of use.  The bristles are all matted once wet and stiff making the process of working up a rich lather very cumbersome.  Would not advise this brush at all; not sure if the problem is with badger hair, but get something softer and synthetic!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaving brush. When I first started using it, I rinsed it with hot water really well to get any loose hairs out. To my surprise it held up very well only losing a couple in the sink. The handle fits well in my hand, good ergonomic feel to it. The brush itself has a good deep lathering massage feel to it. Would highly recommend this shaving brush to others.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for the money. Our son is 16 and shaves regularly as he is part of the JROTC program at school, so he has to have a pretty good shave on inspection days in particular! We wanted to give him the chance to learn more about wet shaving - my husband has been using a safety razor and a brush for shaving for years now and definitely feels it&#x27;s the way to go. This brush is a great way for our son to experience a closer shave and learn how to use a brush for shaving cream. He doesn&#x27;t have any complaints about this brush - it is nice and soft and seems to be working well for him! I received this product in exchange for my honest review based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li> A great shaving brush. Heard many great things about it. Just recently started wet shaving and I&#x27;m hooked. This brush is the best of the best !</li>
            <li> Holds water fine, but the hairs are coming out after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Excellent Brush, great quality.  The hair doesn&#x27;t fall our like the cheaply made brush that I purchased at Meijer. Will buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> High quality affordable product, complete with instructions on cleaning and care that were lacking for other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased; I wish I had purchased this one first!</li>
            <li> My husband loved this brush that I got him as a gift, amazing price for the quality of this brush. Fast shipping, highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Well constructed.  Looks and works great.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Terrible animal smell to this brush and super stiff bristles that fall out. I&#x27;m glad it worked for so many others, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Good Brush.  Hubby seems to like it just fine :).  He soaks it in hot water while we shower and then uses it without issue.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  Does a fine job for a good price.  My only complaint is that my cats are unexplainably drawn to it and it&#x27;s their favorite thing to play with.  I spend a lot of time picking it up off the floor.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have owned. Yes Martha, they do where out. Funny how some can get a new cell phone every year for hundreds but cannot afford $13 to keep a fresh shaving brush. Oh, well, their Bubba beer coolers are full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that complain about some of the hair coming out of it need to learn to break it in. Nothing more, nothing less. When you get the brush take it out of the package, put it in your right and, stick you left index finger out, and then slap the brush 10 or 12 times up and down against that finger. Then...look at the brush and you will see some of the hair has raised up. Take you fingers and grab these strand and throw them in the trash. Then.....do it again, and repeat. Usually on the third time you will no longer get any loose strands. I know this is a bit of work....but I know you can do it Bubba....I know you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your shaving.</li>
            <li> Like most things in life you&#x27;re going to get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s not a terrible brush in terms of softness, but spending the extra $10 makes all the difference in quality.  The reason I gave it 3 stars wasn&#x27;t for the quality though.....it&#x27;s because the brush smells like a dead badger.  I see I&#x27;m not alone in noticing the smell....though I don&#x27;t know how a person couldn&#x27;t notice it considering the smell of decaying flesh is fairly overwhelming with this brush. Which brings up another point....some folks here are trying to describe the smell.  It&#x27;s the smell of a rotting animal....because it&#x27;s a rotting animal.  There is no other way to &amp;#34;describe&amp;#34; the smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft works great</li>
            <li> This has been one of the most comfortable brushes I have ever known. It is very soft and makes a nice foaming lather. I get a great shave.</li>
            <li> a quality product delivered quickly... NO worries and NO regrets... ACES!</li>
            <li> Uses it daily - great brush</li>
            <li> Fits the Colonel Conk stand nicely. Not too stiff or too floppy. Generates a nice lather. Good first brush. Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried using safety razors but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to them and they always made my neck red. I much prefer the Mach 3. But since I paired that Mach 3 with this Badger Brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream my life has changed. I mean when I&#x27;m walking down the street I actually stride faster because there&#x27;s less resistance from an otherwise stubbly face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price, so far no hairs have fallen out, and it has a medium firmness to it. It lathers me up like a professional barber and I love dipping it in hot water to really open the pores! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is everything I thought it would be, and works as expected. This is the first time I have used a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Just dabbing it into the cream gets enough to lather up with some water in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple rinse it out and flick it a few times into the shower and let air dry.</li>
            <li> Great brush for shaving. Extremely good for the price, would recommend. You cant go wrong with it. Unlike other posters I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell or had any hairs fall out. Been using it for a month. Perfect so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a very expensive shave brush. In fact, my only other brush is a Tweezerman, which is so similar to this that they may have been manufactured by the same company. Anyway, they both seem just fine to me. Both started out with that badgery smell, but it was easily taken care of. If there&#x27;s any difference at all, it may be that this one is still shedding a teeny bit, whereas the other I think was thoroughly worn in by now. Still, a very nice brush!</li>
            <li> I never thought that using a premium shaving brush would make such a big difference in the ease and comfort of shaving each morning.  The brush picks up just the right amount of shaving cream from the container with a light twirl then spreads it evenly across my face.  Cleaning it is a snap by simply running it under some warm water for a moment or two.  A big difference when using this type of premium brush is to make sure it has a place to dry properly which is why I bought Escali&#x27;s Razor and Brush stand.  Now I know that my brush will last a long, long time and looks great sitting in the stand on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The brush will get the job done but with inconveniences. I&#x27;ll explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected a bristle here and there to fall out with the first couple uses, however, after about 15 uses 5 to 6 bristles continue to fall out during use. This is annoying because the bristles will stick to your face under the soap causing problems when shaving. Furthermore, the bristles get stuck in the shaving soap forcing you to clean out each handful of bristles every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Nice, dense loft, good foam generation, solid construction.</li>
            <li> Did the job, Husband liked it, Bristles are medium density and not much shedding</li>
            <li> I do not understand how this brush got such great reviews. Mine sheds bristles terribly... really makes it rather unusable.</li>
            <li> I have to laugh at people who are disappointed that a brush sheds in the beginning of use, all brushes will shed for a time in spite of the quality.  This brush has worn in well and has become very soft and bristle fast.  My only real complaint is that the finish on the handle has peeled.  I&#x27;ll need to sand the end completely bare and coat the wood with some spar varnish or appropriate coating.  This is a nice brush, but not the one that will last in the long haul.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old brush because it started shedding bristles.  The bristles on this one are not soft, and it shed even worse than the old one.  Even worse, when wet it smells like what I can only assume a wet badger smells like -- not good.  I have it 3-4 tries, then it went into the trash and I dug the old one out.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I got this to accompany my merkur safety razor.  After having used it around ten times I post this review.  I am not sure if all badger hair does this or not, but when I use it, even when loaded with soap (Old Spice Swagger Bar Soap) it smells kind of funky.  Not like the soap, but something else that overpowers the soap.  I haven&#x27;t noticed smelling funky after I clean up, but during the shave I do.  Also, I have noticed some some shedding, not a ton and again this is probably normal but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is plenty soft and the quality seems good as well.  I guess it was just not as I expected. I know my Dad had a super old horse hair brush and it didn&#x27;t smell funny and actually worked up a better lather than the one I have.  I have tried two different types of bar soap.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice brush, shaving with the right tools changes it from a chore to a pleasure. It took me a second try getting a soap that makes a good lather. Got this brush on my second try too. Now everything is good.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a safety razor, shaving brush, etc.  So I may not be qualified for a review.  However, the Escali brush I have pricks a bit, but lathers very nicely.  The reason I gave it only three stars, and it maybe because of the way I take care of the brush, is that it is constantly shedding hairs.  I do not soak it in HOT water, but instead warm water.  I gently squeeze the soap and water from the brush then I shake it a bit.  Then I hang it on the brush stand.  I have only used six or seven times so far.  Is it me,, or the brush?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and it is hard to beat the price on this brush to get started. Now that I have been wet shaving for awhile I still have no complaints whatsoever! This brush is great. It holds lots of water, which helps while lathering. It is a great combination of firm and soft which gets my stubble ready for a close shave! Truly a great value!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Brush is great.</li>
            <li> i dont have any relatable with any other brush&#x27;s so i cant say if its one of the best but it works great</li>
            <li> Better quality that the Art of Shaving brush my wife gave me last year.  This one has a better feel, and the bristles have held together well.  It is also easier to clean than my prior brush.  I would purchase again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. I can&#x27;t believe the great price compared to others on Amazon. It was very quick shipping. I hear complaints about a lot of hair falling out. This is not true. A few strands come out the first couple times, but nothing that effects the product. Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> Its good!  Best badger hair I have ever rubbed on my face.  Cool company name printed on handle to remind you how hipster you are.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush! He hasn&#x27;t had a shave like this ever! He paired it with a mug soap. The brush smells pretty awful at first (hello badger fur) but airs out quickly. Product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month of shaving now and it&#x27;s still working just as well as it did the first day!  Great price on a badger brush with a nice wooden handle. It also fits my Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 stand perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have had the Escali brush for over two weeks now and it&#x27;s a solid product. It&#x27;s a smaller brush then others that I have used, but I like size as it&#x27;s not too small. I would recommend this as a good starter brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush, especially if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend dozens of dollars to get a decent brush that you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re going to use for more than a week. It works up a nice lather, and the hairs are holding together nicely so far.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  The brush is off quality construction, and it doesn&#x27;t get much manlier than rubbing your face with badger hairs.  The only drawback is that some of the bristles come out at first, but after a couple weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t had that problem anymore.  Be sure to store with the bristles down so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the handle and loosen the bristle glue.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was inexpensive and made of badger hair as opposed to boar, which is supposed to not be as high of a quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for almost a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. It will need replaced soon, but I imagine after a year, most brushes would. It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, in terms of bristles and although a strand or two of badger hair comes out periodically, it&#x27;s not enough to affect the quality of the shave or application of lather. If you&#x27;re looking to start using a brush, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> For the price its a good brush, does the job but it just doesn&#x27;t feel great.  Problem is I dont really want to ever spend $200+ for a brush! I guess I should go badger hunting if I want it cheap. This is good for like $10 though.</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used the shaving brush, it smelled like a wet dog - or maybe a wet badger.  It took several uses for that smell to go away, but now he&#x27;s quite happy with it.  All in all, a good value.</li>
            <li> When I received the brush it was great. Nice and soft ,it whips up well.It has a nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;I would order another.</li>
            <li> I had never used a brush like this before, but this is the neater way to get shaving done. the brush works great and very little shedding . it should be good for a long time</li>
            <li> Very afforadable badger brush option.  Don&#x27;t have any other brushes to compare it too, but it works well.  Holds lots of water and seems pretty durable.  A well made product.  One star off because when using the brush in circular motions it does have a prickly feel and also some bristles do fall out with each shave (only used a few times, so maybe this is normal and will stop eventually as the brush \\&quot;breaks in\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> This brush is 100% badger hair. I know because I smelled it every time I shaved. The first time, the smell lingered for a whole day. The second time, it was only half a day, and now after a month of wet-shaving, I have forgotten if there was any smell at all. There is very little hair loss from the brush and am satisfied with it.  The advantage of the badger hair is vs. others is, of course, its retention of moisture. Don&#x27;t know much about other brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price and works well! I see a lot of folks complaining about some hairs comming off of the brush! Every brand of brush i have ever owned has had some hairs come off, so get over it!!! The price is right on this one! Over all a good buy!</li>
            <li> This brush was my first brush trying DE shaving, and I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case I didn&#x27;t stick with it. The first few times that I soaked the brush, it really leaked color/paint, like a cheap, new cloth. I don&#x27;t see this phenomenon anymore, but the brush is still shedding quite a lot. It&#x27;s a bit too prickly for me, and the handle is too small for my taste. I would recommend investing slightly more for a better experience.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, does the job well.  As some previous buyers have noted, it is prone to losing some strands but that&#x27;s really not a big deal.  I think it&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Is it the best brush?  No!  But if you&#x27;re looking for a great shaving brush that gets the job done, at low cost, this is your badger.  Bristles are soft, and the smell of badger was only noticeable for the first shave or two.  After that, it just smells like your shave soap.</li>
            <li> The brush is top-quality. My husband raves about it&#x27;s consistency and the smoothness of the bristles.  It dries quickly and thoroughly</li>
            <li> Overall, I agree with the other previous comments. This thing feels a little prickly at first but it seemed to soften up. It shed a ton the first time I used it and still sheds a few hairs each time I use it now. But it is cheap and feels nice so definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> This brush does the job and it was reasonably priced.  I recommend it.  There is no reason to spend a fortune on a brush.</li>
            <li> perfect brush for the new or experienced wet shaver! The brush will shed a little a first then stops completely. It is made very well and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love this brush. It is very soft and supple! Perfect for me. There is not a lot of info or reviews for us ladies out there who want to try or are new to DE shaving. Do not hesitate to buy this brush! It is great!</li>
            <li> This is a totally usable brush, especially for the price. It&#x27;s a decent choice for someone new to wet shaving, though it does shed more than a brush should. Knowing what I know now, though, I wish I had paid only a little more to go with an Omega brush instead. Still, it&#x27;s a good brush for the price and I have not regrets.</li>
            <li> The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that the bristles/hairs fall off a bit when mixing the brush into the soap to lather up.  They seems to fall out too easily, but the performance is fine.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be the classiest looking thing on your bathroom counter but it works better than the boar brush I started with. Has a stinky smell when wet but it faded after about 3 weeks of shaving for me. It can build a nice lather and does a nice job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty okay brush; I&#x27;ve never used another shaving brush before so maybe this one&#x27;s above average or maybe it&#x27;s not but I think it does a decent job creating and holding a nice lather. The first time several hairs do fall out though, so don&#x27;t panic if you think your brush is falling apart, thereafter only one or two hairs fall out.  It does have a bit of a funky smell but it&#x27;s not a big deal since I usually shower after I shave, not that it would matter anyway since the aroma of the shaving soap overpowers the smell of the brush.  Also, some reviewers say that the brush feels a bit stiff and prickly at first but in my opinion, it felt nice and soft since its first use, maybe I have tougher skin or they just have more sensitive skin but that&#x27;s how I felt it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush, it picks up and retains the soap really well. It sheds a little when new, but eventually  it will stop that. Shipping was FAST !  Great company to deal with !</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush as part of a whole set up for my husband to try the double-edge razor shave and ditch the disposable razors.  He has loved the whole experience, in general, and this brush has worked great.  Soft bristles, nice heft to the handle but not too heavy.  We are happy with it.</li>
            <li> When it comes right down to it,  this is a solid product. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it does the job as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used it several times with great results. If there are people out there pickier than myself I can&#x27;t help them, but it&#x27;s a shaving brush that does it&#x27;s job for a fair price. What more could you be looking for?</li>
            <li> This brush sheds.  Its annoying to have badger hair clinging to tour face when you try and shave.  Thus brush leaves hair behind on your soap cake too.</li>
            <li> This product came to us when expected and was exactly what we expected. Would definitely buy from this site again.</li>
            <li> Great brush..sheds a little</li>
            <li> I stopped drooling as soon as I started using this brush.</li>
            <li> great product, good support. Shipping was prompt and arrived as promised. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price. There are far better brushes on the market, at a far higher price. I lost 5 or so hairs on my first use, a common complaint found on the reviews. Last three weeks I have not lost any hairs however.</li>
            <li> Upon first impression the brush looked nice, and well packaged. After having used it a few times, it has only shed a few hairs, all of which on the first use. It looks and feels like it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend/10</li>
            <li> Good for the money I guess.  After a year of use it doesn&#x27;t shed hairs much anymore.  Holds water well though and has a nice lather.  The base fell off after a few months so I just use the nub all the hair is attached to.</li>
            <li> Good brush,puts lather on my face. Beats the crap out of aerosol shaving cream and tyne product showed up on time.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush.  It seems to do the job and work up a nice lather. But be aware it sheds a lot of hair.  I am on my fifth time using it and it is still leaving hairs on my face and on my shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the time my brush took to arrive in the mail and it performs great the only downside I done is that it tends to shed and loose a couple of hairs after watch use but other than that it&#x27;s a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to it&#x27;s price but it came out great. The brush was soft, effective and only took a little bit of time to break in. The only problem is that it had hairs fall off but it wasent to much</li>
            <li> This brush arrived quickly and the package was quite easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 2 times since I received it and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;It creates lather very quickly and feels really great on my face.</li>
            <li> YES, SHALL IT CARESS MY FACE FOR MANY AS SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;ITS BRISTLES AS GENTLE AS AN ANGELIC UNICORN&lt;br /&gt;GALLOPING UPON MY FACE AS IF FROLICING IN A FIELD OF CLOUDS&lt;br /&gt;ALAS, MUST I AWAIT UNTIL NEXT SHAVE,&lt;br /&gt;TO FEEL THIS EUPHORIC MAGIC ONCE MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all seriousness. Good price, durable, and it does well for my shave routine. Be a man. A poetic man. And get women. You know what to do.</li>
            <li> Only used it once since I received it, but it produced a rich lather fairly quickly. I like the small size - it gives you greater control when building and applying the lather (at least for me; I use Geo F. Trumpers shave soap). The lather was in fact significantly thicker than what I could get with my first Art of Shaving brush, and I may still need to tinker with the water ratio. As this was its first use, some hairs did come lose in the lathering process, but the quality feels solid and I don&#x27;t expect that to be a lingering issue. The loose hairs is the only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars; I may come back and change it to 5 stars after continued use.</li>
            <li> During the first use, several hairs came out of the brush, but not so many as to create a noticeable difference in its thickness. It still loses one or two hairs upon each use, but has kept its overall shape and thickness. I would be upset about the loose hairs if I had paid more, but for the price, it really isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but no complaints here! If your looking for a low cost brush for traveling or a backup you can&#x27;t wrong here.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive badger hair brush.  Works great.  Not much more to say, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  Invest in a holder (bristles down to dry) and it should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This badger brush got here today and the first thing I notice , it is very small in my hand. It looks OK and the hair is very soft . for the money I paid for it , I have no complaints. It lathers up nice and covers my face well with the shave soap I used( proraso) . I am sure high end brushes are better but for my money , not bad .</li>
            <li> Great brush.  I use with medicated soap for my allergies, and get a great lather for shaving.  Sometimes, the old ways are best.</li>
            <li> I finally got around to using my brush tonight after my old fairly cheap badger brush broke. I let it soak in hot water before shaving  and immediately noticed a strong smell coming from it. These smells are pretty common with real animal hair brushes so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised, but the smell was definitely stronger than I anticipated, and very &#x27;farmy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After soaking it I gave it a quick rinse and then began to hand lather with TOBS soap. The brush held water well and helped give a quick lather, but I noticed that the lather started to go from a shiny white to off-white and eventually darker and darker. I wrung the lather out of the brush and saw that parts of it, presumably from the base around the knot, were a dirty brown. The hair must have not been cleaned properly prior to assembly and was leaving mud in my lather. I rinsed that lather down the drain and tried again after cleaning the brush a second time, and the same thing happened. It was also caked into my soap where I had loaded the brush, and left the same &#x27;farmy&#x27; smell from before in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually went ahead and shaved with it anyway, and noticed that the brush wasn&#x27;t as soft and gentle as it felt when dry. It felt like a few but not all of the hairs were quite sharp and fairly irritative, but I can&#x27;t complain from a $10 brush. There was also fairly few loose hairs in the first use, certainly fewer than other brushes I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think after the dirt in the brush is eventually washed away and the bristles soften up, it could be a very good brush for it&#x27;s price. But just a few extra precautions in the assembly process could have avoided it entirely.</li>
            <li> Works well and was very cheap. The only issue I have is that even after months of use, I still get hairs falling out of the brush almost every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for half a year or so now and it&#x27;s served me well.  It&#x27;s only lost a few bristles and does everything I need it to.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again if I needed to replace it.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for the money,had it a couple of weeks with no major issues, still sheds a little but I guess that&#x27;s normal. breaking it in was easy and it lather up nice. would recommend Google on how to break in a badger brush ,it really helped.</li>
            <li> Holds water like it is supposed to and it feels great. Happy with my purchase.Everything about this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little, but after 22 months, it came apart.  The clump of bristles just separated from the wooden base in a big chunk.  I was just shaking it off after a shave and it came apart.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as durable and as high of quality as the higher end brushes. The bristles bunch up when moistened but it still gets the job done. Doesn&#x27;t feel as good on your face as the higher end brushes, but is a great alternative to those who can&#x27;t afford the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner in shaving with the safety razors and using shaving brush, but as faw as I can tell - it&#x27;s a good starting product!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush that allows you to lather the cream really well.  I would recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Bristles were falling out day one and the plastic coating on the handle is flaking off. This brush does what it&#x27;s supposed too: spread cream across your face and prep your skin for shaving. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll do its job very long.</li>
            <li> Like the title reads. It was good when I initially started wet shaving, but I have moved on to better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;decent weight&lt;br /&gt;decent lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;sheds like a husky in the summer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money.  The bristles fall out. I will not buy another.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it does lose hairs fairly often.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for anyone looking to get into wet shaving and not wanting to spend a lot of money in case it&#x27;s not for them. My original Escali brush has handled everything I have thrown at it from Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat soap, to Taylor of Old Bond creams., it has performed well in bowl lathers as well as face lathering. However I recently ordered one for a relative of mine and have noticed that this brush is slightly different than my original from about a year ago. This newer one has a different finish on its handle, it is more of a sealant, similar to Semogue wood handles, than a varnish like on the older version. The handle also has a wider profile on its base, but overall the appearance remains about the same. All in all this is a great brush to get started with, and is capable of handling everything that is out there, in terms of shaving creams, soaps, and cream-soaps.</li>
            <li> A reasonable brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali 100% pure Badger brush for my FIL for fathers Day and he&#x27;s THRILLED!!! He had been looking locally for a replacement for his and wasn&#x27;t able to find one so I jumped on the opportunity to purchase one for him.</li>
            <li> Great brush, especially for the price. Been shaving my head on a daily basis, and had to replace my old brush. Glad I went with this. This was a bit bigger than my old one, and works the lather up very well. Happy with this purchase so far!</li>
            <li> Very nice and works great.</li>
            <li> The brush is great.&lt;br /&gt;I like the wood handle.&lt;br /&gt;If gives it a old school feel.</li>
            <li> It came quick and fast. I love using this badger shaving brush. Soaks in water good and lathers my face up when i use shaving soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m not very impressed.  Each shave leaves bristles in the lather.  The 3rd time I used the brush I counted over a dozen in the bowl.  It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as other badger hair brushes. I clean the brush after each use by rinsing and letting it sit in warm water.  Then I squeeze out the water and place it in the stand for the next days use.  The handle is nice and wooden.  It&#x27;s a great shape for the hand.  I&#x27;d like to see it be a little softer and not lose as many bristles.  Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good beginners brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry the knot will eventually fall off just get Gorilla Glue to set it back in. Smells awful too, but borax and laundry detergent fixed that. I rehydrated the bristles with my shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The brush doe the job except if it keeps &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;, at the rate it&#x27;s going it will not last long.&lt;br /&gt;I probably should have purchased a more expensive one!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved his new shave brush! The quality of the fur is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush. The price was right. At first a few bristles would come out when lathering up, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with it after  the first few uses. Smells very odd at first, but it seems to go away. Considering the price, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> bristles fell out of base after first use.  Super glued them back in and they have stayed since, but not very happy as now bristles are shedding.</li>
            <li> Pros: The brush is reasonably priced and it is very soft. Cons: The shaving brush stinks, the badger hair must be from his butt. The brush sheds a lot until you  get it broken in. I soaked it in Dawn detergent and water to get rid of the stink. I brushed the brush with a hair brush to get rid of loose hairs.</li>
            <li> No backbone, kinda scratchy. After just a two weeks ordered a new silvertip badger brush. I regret getting this brush.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the fanciest badger brush, but it suffices well enough to give one hell of a comfortable shave. The hairs do shed for the first few shavings, but after that there is very little shedding. I didn&#x27;t notice any odor as some other have complained, but then again I am not very sensitive to chemical odors in general. The hairs do lose some of their spring and shape over time, but they still perform fairly well. Given the price, I am relatively happy with this badger brush.</li>
            <li> Great Brush....lathers up soap very well</li>
            <li> i got it for my dad who was gonna stay with me for few months. did not get any complain.</li>
            <li> great price, great lather, durable. What more do you need.</li>
            <li> excellent quality in the workmanship!!d</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; if you were ever wonbering what a wet beaver smelt like you can sfop woundering after using this.</li>
            <li> Husband has had this brush for over year now, he says it&#x27;s his first badger brush so he can&#x27;t compare it to other badger brushes but &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a WHOLE LOT better than synthetic brushes&amp;#34; and for the price, it&#x27;s a really good brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price and everyone would enjoy it, unless you need a shaving brush made of silken unicorn hair or something.</li>
            <li> Wonderdful brush.  I use it for my How To Grow A Moustache chocolate bourbon shaving soap and it provides an awesome lather.  A true value.</li>
            <li> Very nice to use, easily spreads water across my face before I shave. Better than using my hands to get my face wet and able to cover more area in less time, overall I am happy with this brush..</li>
            <li> One great little shaving brush, it&#x27;s holding original form if needed will buy another down the road!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have for the past year or so - it has held up well and does what it is supposed to - no need to spend money on those other &amp;#34; high end &amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I decided to move from a Mach 3 razor that I&#x27;ve used the last 7-8 years over to a safety razor after constantly hearing how great it was.  I bought this brush which was &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; with the Merkur safety razor along with some proraso soap.  It had a lot of reviews so thats why I bought it.  I&#x27;ve never used a brush in all my years of shaving or had any other brush so I have nothing to compare it to.  The brush seemed to work as it intended.  I have no intention of going back to cartridge razors after just 1 shave with my new safety razor but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll continue making my own shaving lather.  I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face at all and I can just as easily shave with water. Makes no difference to me really and Razor burn is just not something I&#x27;ve ever had an issue with in all my years of shaving so a good shaving lather just really isn&#x27;t that important to me.  I just want a close shave, and need a sharp razor to do it and after just 3 shaves with a Mach 3, it can&#x27;t do that leading my to buy more which are just too dang expensive.  I just used the cheapest shaving creme that I could buy from the dollar store.  I used to shave daily when I was in the Military for 4 years, but now I shave 2, maybe 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users here mentions, this brush seems to lose a lot of hair with each use which is kind of an annoyance and I would use a pair of tweezers to pick the strands out of my soap. I read that some users said it wasn&#x27;t very soft on their face. Again, maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I thought it felt great on my face.  I certainly couldn&#x27;t justify spending any more on a brush though and I see there are some really expensive ones out there..  I&#x27;ll admit, I did enjoy making the lather and have since practiced making a lather on nights when I&#x27;m not even shaving just playing with things like thickness, adding more or less water etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a small hanger at walmart that holds my new razor and this brushwhich stays on my bathroom counter but for those mornings when I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll probably just grab my can of shaving cream as I always have though.  I&#x27;m knocking 1 star off for it losing the bristles but I liked it other than that.  Brushes just aren&#x27;t something for me.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush. Holds a good amount of water, lathers very well, rinses easily and after rinsing give is a shake or two and the brush is left barely damp. Feels a bit prickly but that could be me. I&#x27;ve never lathered with a brush so it&#x27;s a new experience to me. It does seem to be getting softer with use though. There is no smell, as I&#x27;ve read in some other reviews and I&#x27;ve lost maybe 3 or 4 hairs in about 4 weeks. I will buy again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described &amp; arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his brush, he looks forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> Does what it should :-) I wish the handle was heavier but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> and was not disappointing. It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing with it&#x27;s glossy wooden handle and never fails to deliver a good lather. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating would be that I have lost a few of the badger hairs after some light use (once a week). I would certainly try other products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: after using this brush maybe twice a week for a few months now I can say I&#x27;m a little let down by it&#x27;s performance and durability. I lather a mixture of hard glycerin based soaps and soft soaps and have lost quite a few hairs. It has only slightly lightened up (become less prickly) but is still too harsh to face lather (especially having now had experience with some Boars hair brushes that had been softer). The other issue with face lathering is that once it&#x27;s loaded up to a nice lather on the brush, the bristles spread out in all directions when applied to your face, leaving the middle to scrape along your dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this brush, and after some non-amazon related research, found that it is listed on a \\&quot;bad gear\\&quot; list on Reddit&#x27;s Wicked_Edge subreddit, and I believe it belongs there. I&#x27;d try another Badger brush but not another Escali.</li>
            <li> These people never should have requested me to write about there product since it came in two pieces and I just wrote it of as well that wont happen again maybe if they ever corrected this I would reconsider some times stuff just happens but if that was the case steps would be taken to make me a happy customer or not a customer.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Holds lather well.</li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t get much better than this, after 8 months of use, bristles are still solidly mounted and no weird smells.</li>
            <li> I got this at a stellar discounted price and for how much I got it for I would buy over and over again.  When working on the cream using a circular motion it creates a wonderful lather that feels amazing on your face.  It distributes the cream evenly and its easy to clean.  I have yet to cut out and of the bristles which is a wonderful and pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds like crazy and isn&#x27;t nearly as soft as other badger shaving brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Overall disappointed in its quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my travel kit.  I travel every week and stay at a hotel at least 3 nights a week.  I would recommend this brush for occasional use.  Other than initial shedding and needing a longer break-in period it has performed well.</li>
            <li> I previously was using a tweezerman in the same price range, and based on good reviews ordered this one. As others have said, it sheds horribly. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks, and it looks just as bad as my tweezerman did after a year of use. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Choose this brush as a entry to DE shaving.  Initially I was turned off by the brush due to copious shedding and an off odor.  After a few uses, the shedding has slowed and the odor is gone.  The brush is not very soft, but it does make a nice lather with a little work.  This is a fine brush to get started with the art of wet shaving, but now I am looking to upgrade to a nicer brush.</li>
            <li> It looks to be well-made and it feels great. It looks like it will last as long as Grandpop&#x27;s did - and that&#x27;s nearly a hundred years.</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it a 5 was the loss of hairs during the first couple of shaves...this situation appears to have gotten better with time...maybe that is a natural condition for all new brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - well crafted with real wood and real bristles. Fits nicely in my hand and makes application smooth.</li>
            <li> Solid build quality. Great value for the price. Frankly has the fit and finish of brushes 2x as expensive. Strong strong purchase reccomendation.</li>
            <li> Badger hair is great, not stickly like boar.  This brush is well assembled, and easily compares to the $25 brush I started with.  Brush lathering is the best and this is an inexpensive way to get started.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush, for what it is. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Smells a bit at first, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Works fine. My only concern is that it, at first, it lost a lot of bristles... now it loses roughly one-per-shave. It&#x27;s not a big deal given the price, but worth noting. It will eventually have to be replaced as it goes bald.</li>
            <li> I ordered this like 2 years ago and still does the job really well ... thinking about ordering a new one again</li>
            <li> Got it on sale, but very satisfied.  It holds water well, builds a great lather and feels good on the skin when applying lather.  I just hope it holds up over time, that will be the true test of its quality.</li>
            <li> This brush holds the lather, the price of the brush was less than in the stores , it was a great price too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes for the money.  I have owned some much more expensive brushes but this one does just as good and is much cheaper.  It it well made and doesn&#x27;t shed as some others do.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving brush at a great price.  You can spend a lot more on other brands but this one does the job perfectly.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months now and the bristles are staying put and the brush is holding up well.  I highly recommend buying this brush.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this brush it was the first shaving brush I had used.  I had nothing to compar it to.  Having used several other brushes at this point, I can say this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, better than the one that came with the kit.  Holds lather longer and easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value for beginners to the brush routine.  So far it has performed well with minor bristle shedding.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this brush is really smooth. it makes nice foam and holds up well to repeated use. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect shaving experience. I love this brush. I look forward to every shave. Great deal. Well worth the purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have only used this brush twice now, it seems to do the trick. This is my first time realy indulging in brushes, lathering, legit shaving soap. So my lathers have not been that great.  The brush seems pretty durable, the first couple uses so far I have had hairs shed from the brush into my lather but that is probably common for these types of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it is a great deal I&#x27;d say. Though eventually I do plan on steping it up to a nicer brush once i hone in my skills.</li>
            <li> They must make this from badger rectum hair. Because it&#x27;s the worst smelling brush I have ever used. It sheds a lot and is too small. I have the buyers remorse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so and like the handle and feel of the badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a boar shaving brush. This does a much better job at creating a lather! It seems like it will last a long time. The only downside is for my brush, more than several bristles have fallen out and still occasionally one comes out after a couple weeks of shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Great brush now that it&#x27;s broken in. It was a little smelly (Badger) at first, but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles may fall out at the beginning then stops. Lives up to all my expectations.</li>
            <li> So many hairs fell off within my husband&#x27;s first use. We immediately replaced it with the Body Shop&#x27;s brush, similar priced, much better quality. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My Husband had always shaved with the soap from the can and was recently complaining that he just couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. And THEN I remembered my Cuban (Barber) Daddy lathering his face up with his brush and shaving cup (with the shaving soap in it) . He&#x27;d shave with a straight razor. And one thing he stressed to me is&lt;br /&gt;( with his Ricky Ricardo accent ) was \\&quot;You hov to hov a guut BRrrrush to wark up a guut lauther!\\&quot; .I&#x27;d sit and watch him swirl that brush around on the soap and I never forgot that . I bought my Husband this brush AND: Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar - with Shea, Mango and Cocoa Butter - 4 Oz. - Rich, Moisturizing and Healing - Perfect for Smooth Shaving - Bay Rum, Orange and Clove Scent - Old Fashioned for a Luxurious Experience AND Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand&lt;br /&gt;Sold by Perella&#x27;s .He is now getting the same close shave my Daddy used to get with his straight razor and the soap I mentioned leaves his face softer(!) than mine, I may have to buy one of these brushes and the Barbershop Shave Soap Bar in a Jar with Orange and Clove Scent, Mango and Cocoa Butter - 4 Oz.(also sold on Amazon) myself!</li>
            <li> Great Item, excellent on time delivery. My husband is very happy with quality of the product :)</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, cheaper than the same brush with different name (TM), quick shipping.  Great company to tdeal with.</li>
            <li> My son has used a badger shaving brush for over a year, and my husband liked to borrow it when my son was home.  I decided to buy my husband his own brush.  This brush was not the same quality as my son&#x27;s brush.  This brush lost A LOT of bristles and had a funky smell.  After a few uses, the loss of bristles slowed down and the smell has faded some.  Bristles are not as soft as the brush my son bought.</li>
            <li> Does the job well but several bristles come out of it every time I use it, and get on my face/neck as I apply the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth the money.  Its cheap and it works great.  It holds moisture fairly well, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, expensive brush. I went with this based on the reviews... it&#x27;s a good choice. No problems. Works well. Bought a second one for a gift. Just keep it on a stand or hanging upside down somehow.</li>
            <li> This brush behaves like it should. This is the first brush that I bought after switching from multiblade cartridge razors to safety razor and I have no complaints. Great value and I would definitely recommend to friends and have so already.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a gift, and although I cannot speak for the actual functionality or durability of the brush, it did arrive in 2 business days via Amazon Prime, and appears to be built well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t care for the Escali inscription, but that is really &amp;#34;splitting hairs&amp;#34;. Handle seemed to be of nice quality, and after tugging at the hairs with some decent force, none came out, suggesting that the knot is also good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipient was happy with the brush, and is super excited to be a new member of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> With the rising cost of disposable blades for my Mach 3, I decided to purchase a safety razor and shaving brush. The Escali badger shaving brush for the money is excellent. It has served me well so far and does an excellent job of applying the shaving cream. The shaving brush retains it shape after drying. I do recommend some sort of stand to hang the brush in a downward position for drying and to keep the brush shape. I ordered my shaving brush from Perellas Marketplace on Amazon and their service in shipping my product was very fast.</li>
            <li> $13 for a workable, full-size badger hair shaving brush? That&#x27;s hard to beat. And as long as you&#x27;re drying it correctly, the bristles stay on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things you may want to know:&lt;br /&gt;- If you, like thousands of other shoppers on Amazon are considering buying the Colonel Conk Shaving Stand to hold this brush and your razor, you should know that the Escali brush handle is just a shade too thick to slide easily into the prongs. It fits, but you have to hold the stand with one hand and almost lodge the brush handle in between the prongs. On the flip side, it is a really secure hold :)&lt;br /&gt;- I agree with some of the other reviewers who recommend not leaving the wet brush sit on the handle. I can see how that would cause issues with the wood/bristles (for any brush really). I hang-dry the brush from the handle each time, and I can&#x27;t remember a single bristle trying to get away from the brush in the few months I&#x27;ve used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wish the bristles were softer, but knowing that I&#x27;d have to pay upwards of 2-3X more for that level of cuddly badgery softness, I&#x27;m quite happy with the Escali.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for several weeks now and it was replaced today by a Simpsons Colonel 2xl in best badger (Not recommended for starting out, it&#x27;s expensive). It&#x27;s floppy, the hairs in it are nonexistent in the middle, feels bad on my face, and it is terrible at applying lather. Do yourself a favor and buy an Omega S-Brush (not the Omega Syntex, they are an older variety) or an Omega Boar/Semogue Boar as a starting brush. Much better bang for your buck (Still around $10-15). I wish I had done better research before purchasing this brush. This brush is in the bad gear section of the sub-reddit I frequent about wet shaving for good reason. Don&#x27;t waste your money.    This brush is headed for the trash.    Edit: I did receive a replacement brush and it too went into the trash. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but it may have been worse than the original brush! Great customer service...terrible product.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised, and even if it breaks in two months the price was the selling point.  I wanted to try a less expensive brush before investing in a hand-made brush, which might be the exact same result I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for a few weeks, and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It&#x27;s a good brush for a great price.It shed a few hairs in the beginning, but I think all brushes do that. Especially at this price. It also arrived ahead of schedule from Perella&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You guys made my new Escali pure badger  brush hit right out of the park. I recommend it for everyone that want a great shave. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush,  great price.  Feels awesome on my face. Kinda weird know you are stroking your face with badger booty hair j/k. I bought two of them....</li>
            <li> Great product, great design, but the first use - I had 6 bristles just come out.  I am not sure if they are suppose to do that (as this is my first one), but I was kind of surprised :/</li>
            <li> This brush works well like any other, the packaging was fantastic, but like any other brush.... You must wash it once you get it to get rid of the &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; smell..... This process is called &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34;. But overall I really like this brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay to good.  It has lost a number of hairs and have used it five times so far ... perhaps three to four hairs per use.  I must say since this is my first brush I am not the most qualified to make accurate comments.  I was glad that the handle fits &amp;#34;perfectly&amp;#34; into the shave stand I bought.  ***Have used this now for a couple months.  I really like this brush.  It is fairly soft, has a good shape, makes creating lather easy with cream or even soap (Williams).  For the price it is quite good.  It has stopped losing hairs. I bet I would have to spend a fair bit more to do better.  The only thing I would change if I could would be for the brush to have a little more backbone.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to up their shave game.</li>
            <li> ok brush but not the highest quality, sheds and doesnt hold it&#x27;s shape quite as well as the more expensive ones . Taking all this in to concideration it is still good and fairly priced (8 USD)</li>
            <li> Great badger brush!! I had a $60 AOS badger before (last almost 3 years) which was really good and this badger has less bristles than it but still gave the same rich lather. It holds the water really well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad, he seemed to like it well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, compared to my brush, it was not very soft. I guess you get what you pay for in that regards.</li>
            <li> This badger brush was part of a gift for my husband for Christmas along with a razor,, stand and shaving cream.  he loved it ...no complaints just complements.</li>
            <li> god for the price, but the bristles always come out.</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of some of the other brushes on here, I was a bit skeptical. But it it has been a very good brush so far, has only shed a few hairs from what I can see, and does a great job of lathering. Will order this again when this one gives out. This was the first time I have ever bought or used a brush like this, so I&#x27;m a bit green and don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but so far I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Guys, don&#x27;t go with the &amp;#34;awesome brush&amp;#34; reviews here. I can&#x27;t understand how this kind of product receives such a high mark. This was my first brush, and here is what I got out of it:&lt;br /&gt;This brush loses a ton of fibers, as the knot is not well-made.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are harsh, and feel like they scratch your face when you lather.&lt;br /&gt;The wood is not good quality, and starts breaking down over time if you pre-soak your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of wasting money with this, look for a $8-15 boar brush from Omega, for example. There are many quality, affordable products out there.</li>
            <li> Great product,shipping was on time as promised.I would buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> Decent brush. Smells like, well a dead badger when wet.</li>
            <li> Great service and a very nice product.  Just as advertised at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. After years of applying shaving cream by hand,my husband is amazed at how much he loves using a shaving brush. For his work, he shaves every morning and sometimes twice a day. This is his second brush. The first one I bought was just on a whim so I didn&#x27;t take much time to research or read reviews. He is much happier with your brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with your company and how quickly I received the product. Thank you</li>
            <li> After browsing Amazon it was obvious I could spend anywhere from $5-150 dollars on a shaving brush. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve purchased and I thought it would be a good intro into the world of classy shaving without breaking the bank. The badger hair looks great and the handle is wood with Escali etched in it. Looks awesome.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this brush, i have one thing to say. This brush is awesome! I especially like the fact that i get a hot lather rather than the cold out of a can. Plus i don&#x27;t waste lots of extra shaving cream. The bristles are durable because they are real badger hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. Well-made and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and I&#x27;m very happy with the smoothness and quality that I thought was only possible with higher-cost brands. I really do wish I had gotten this Escali brush earlier, but at least I&#x27;m sure I will get another one when the time comes. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly with glycerin soap to produce a good lather for shaving. I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and brush. Have bought this brush each year and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Seems like more bristles than I would expect fall out every time I use it and stick to my face, maybe that will stop after a while.  I plan on getting one of those brush hangers for it to dry it in the proper position.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase. I bought this 100% pure badger shaving brush to go along with the Merkur stainless steel razor that I bought. The brush and handle a very nice quality and the brush feels good in the hand and is super easy to use, nice size brush length. Be sure to get a good quality shaving soap to go with the brush, it makes a big difference in the quality of the shave. Cleaning the brush is super easy, just run it under warm water and work the brush a few times with your fingers, then just shake it out once or twice, the brush comes out almost instantly dry. You will not be disappointed with your purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush. It initially seemed to shed excessively during the first few usues. It was a pain in the ass at first leaving bristles in my shave soap and on my face. The shedding diminished once the brush broke in luckily. Also, the brush had a musty animal smell which went away as it absorbed the scent of my shave soap. The brush felt a little scratchy but it seemed to do the job well enough though I don&#x27;t have prior experience to compare.</li>
            <li> The product does help make a nice lather, but the downside is there are always hairs falling off the brush.  It is an OK product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past month or so. It has worked very well with very few bristles lost and no smell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and very well made and feels good to the face when lathering which is mandatory for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It lathers well.  Initially lost some bristles but this stopped after a few shaves.  It does have a slight odor, not too bad though.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who is razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for more than a year and it still works great! The brush does shed a few hairs when you first get it but that stops after the first few uses. Make sure you hang this brush side down when storing it or the brush may get ruined.</li>
            <li> The brush works pretty well, but the base cracks very easily when exposed to water (which you have to as you are wet shaving) and the hair constantly comes out and stick to your face while you shave, which is quite itchy for me. After using for a few weeks, it stops losing hair very often. Pretty good considering the price, but altogether not a high quality product.</li>
            <li> The badger brush is stiff enough to whip the shaving soap up into a cream yet soft enough to go on your face. I was initially afraid that it would not be strong enough to hold its shape but it holds up perfectly, even after whipping up the hard soap surface. The brissels don&#x27;t fall out either. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect balance of softness and durability.</li>
            <li> Great product gave it to my husband as a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> First brush i ever owned. but works with my Art of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> i love the feel of it. can wait to shave. WOULD BUY IT AGAIN,</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. let&#x27;s see I bought the brush a few months ago and I love it. I am a real honest person so I don&#x27;t want to lie something and if you could afford to buy it, it is worth it and you can use it for a long time period. Good luck reviews help me so I wan to be honest.</li>
            <li> Good quality, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Feels great on the face and really makes the shaving process more enjoyable. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a quality brush and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid wood handle looks great and fits nicely in the hand. The badger hair is nice and thick, lathers the shaving soap and applies it without issue. I made my own stand to hang my brush up to dry (brushes should be stored upside down to dry) but you should easily find one that fits this brush.</li>
            <li> Really nice feeling. Way better than my last one. I would recommend it to anyone considering it. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Came on time, works well.  A few hairs have come off during use, but not too terrible.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for fathers day and he loved it. It gave him a pleasant shaving experience and he loved the bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy on the face, holds water well, and delivers the lather nicely, you&#x27;re able to easily spread the latherr easily, as it feels like it&#x27;s gliding over your face. It&#x27;s also easy to grip. I&#x27;d buy it again!.</li>
            <li> I noticed some coloring of my soap on first use so you need to wash out brush before using. Excellent brush ,othewrwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good brush for beginner wet shavers. As far as bang for the buck goes it&#x27;s pretty much a slam dunk.</li>
            <li> Great brush for lathering with shaving soap. It&#x27;s only flaw would be that some of the bristles tend to fall out. I can&#x27;t compare with others because this is the first one I ever owned.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for the price and it looks pretty damn good too</li>
            <li> So far, there is nothing I dislike about this product. My only word of warning is that if you are new to using a shaving brush like I was, spend some time on youtube or other websites to learn how to use it and what to look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have been using this for weeks now and I am very happy with it. It stays nice and stiff when wet and it loads up very easily. I do have some bristles come out every now and then but hopefully that&#x27;s just the weak ones being lost. The handle is nice and easy to hold and the bristles are very comfortable when in use.</li>
            <li> I resumed using a brush just a short time ago. I really like this brush. It is stiff enough to help lift the beard, but soft enough to feel good. It does the job ob placing the  cream on the face well. I gave it a 5 because the service was excellent and the brush is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great product to compliment you&#x27;re shaving experience, this is about as good as it will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came well packaged and free of any apparent damage.  The brush was quite full and the hair was of good quality.  Looking lower, the wooden handle had no damage and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush performs as well during use as it looks.  It&#x27;s easy to lather and apply and cleanup is easy.  My brush hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, so the quality is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking to start wet shaving or already are.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush and I could not be happier with the results. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve purchased having switched to using a safety razor.  While initially there were a few bristles that fell out of the brush, after a few uses the brush seems to have \\&quot;settled down\\&quot; a bit.  I store my brush in an appropriate stand, making sure to rinse it thoroughly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush itself, the bristles are high quality and soft, and do a wonderful job applying lather to the face.  As for mixing, the brush also handles perfectly as you lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for someone unsure if they want to use a shaving brush at all, this is a great first investment.  The brush I&#x27;m sure will also last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a bad brush but mine constant has hairs falling out every time I shave. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for about 2 months now and it occasionally sheds still.  Other than the occasional shedding it is of good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to using shaving cream instead of the normal shaving gel that most men use. Using this brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream helped reduce razor burn and skin irritation significantly for me. I have always dreaded shaving cause it would cause my face to turn red and break out almost every time. I now only get very minor reddening every once in awhile from shaving with these two products. Also they do not dry my skin out like shaving gel can due to its alcohol content.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  It&#x27;s a very nice shaving brush, and will be a great surprise for him. And it was priced well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> A pretty nice badger hair brush for the price.  Been using it for a couple of weeks now and I like it a lot  It shed a few hairs in the first couple uses, but not any more and it works great.  A great deal if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> Make a good lather and applies lather well.</li>
            <li> My son gave me shaving soap for Christmas.  I managed to find my brush, and then realized I&#x27;d bought it at least 40 years ago.  I decided to spring for a new one (and a mug).  Among the brushes featured on Amazon, I found this Escali brush at a reasonable price.  I have been shaving almost daily for six decades.  With the help of a YouTube tutorial on shaving with a brush, I am now getting the best shaves of my life.</li>
            <li> No surprises here, folks, a well-made product that, by all accounts, should last for several years to come. I bought a (separate) stainless steel stand so this and my Merkur razor can air dry and stay off the surface, hopefully prolonging their usefulness. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and find the price-value ratio to be quite high.</li>
            <li> This brush serves exactly what my needs are. It is great for any man who wants a soothing, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush for the price I paid.  The hairs seem strongly seated in the handle after about 10 shaves, with minimal shedding.  You may a fuller brush with a unit priced around $30, but if this brush is in your price range, you will likely be satisfied.  I use this as my traveling brush because it is small enough to fit in my shaving kit without being damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has an adequate weight, and is shaped for easy griping with wet hands.  I paid roughly $12 for this, and have no complaints at that price.</li>
            <li> Brush had a bad smell, and did not lather well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very soft, good lather.</li>
            <li> Got this at the request of my husband for cleaning his rifles (it&#x27;s an old Army thing).  Works fine for that!</li>
            <li> Not to bring down the sales to the shipper,because the delivery ways quick and customer service oriented.  But for people who are looking into buying a shaving brush, this is not the way to go.  I say that because I noticed pieces of the brush on my face and in my shaving soap dish almost immediately after using it.  A true badger shaving brush is never supposed to leave behind the bursh bristles on your face or soap.  I spoke with someone who has been straight razor shaving for 30 years and using a variety brushes,he completely agreed and said it should never fall apart. If you are looking into buying a good brush you are looking into paying a little more money and a price range of 30-70 dollars.  Silver Tip badger hair brushes is what you should be looking for, they are the best quality and will not fall apart like this.  I hope this helps you in making your choice of choosing badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> I had bought a starter wet shave kit that came with a standard synthetic shave brush. Now that I&#x27;ve used both, I can honestly say this one not only works up a better lather, it also has softer more flexible bristles. It arrived just when I expected it to and it does everything it says. I do occasionally lose badger bristles in my shave cup, but I guess that&#x27;s just par for the course.</li>
            <li> Works great, no complaints. I am new to wet shaving and purchased this brush based on all the reviews I saw here. The brush is soft and lathers very well. I highly recommend getting a stand for your safety razor and brush so when you are done shaving, the brush can dry upside down. I read on another review that mentioned this and I found this to be true. All in all it is a fantastic little brush at an exceptional price!</li>
            <li> The shaving brush was well packaged and arrived on time. The badger brush feels a little coarse but it does a great job of building a thick lather. When I first used it several of the hairs fell off, but that was expected. Overall, I say that this is a decent brush for anyone who wants to try one out without over spending.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Escali Badger shaving brush after reading the benefits of this brush indicating that this is a great brush, creating a rich lather, and very confortable.  Well, MY experience with this brush is very disappointing.  The brush is very prickly against my face even after soaking it in hot water and leather it up with soap.  I could feel the hair of the brush as being fine needles against my face.  Thinking that it might need \\&quot;breaking in\\&quot; I continued to use it for four days, soaking it for about 2 minutes in hot water and then using it,  even thought I could still feel it pricking my face.  On the fifth day, that morning, I noticed red spots all over my face where I had used the brush. I discontined to use this brush, went back to my old brush, and my face cleared up after a couple of days, and have had no further problems using my old brush.  I did not change soap, shaver, or the temperature of the water.  The only thing different was the Escali Badger hair brush.  Perhaps I am allergic to this brush, however I have had a badger brush in the past without any problems. It may also be my age..I am 71 and have been shaving with a brush for over 50 years. Maybe it was just this brush or this hair.  However I am not using it again and it is sitting in the drawer, in the plastic case that it came in.  If Escali makes a brush with a different hair, I would like to try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent feel and lathers efficiently.  Holds a fair amount of water.  Fits in standard holder with no issue.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Really can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Holds a ton of water and has a soft knot.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Very soft, have lost no strands.  Holds soap well.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush as part of my regular rotation for 4 months now with no issue.  It does what a badger brush is supposed to do, retaining a large amount of water and making great lather with both soaps and creams.  I recommend this brush to all wet shavers!  Good quality with a great price.</li>
            <li> This was my second Escali Badger Brush.  Fist one still working great.  For this brush three stars only because this one has a flaw.  Bristles in the middle seems to have either glued together or some sort of knot i.e. brush is not fully fluffy  when dry or wet, but still manages to produce lather for shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New bristles stink for the first few shaves, but smell goes down once in regular use.  I do hang wet brush upside down to dry and have no major loss of bristles after initial shedding for first few uses.</li>
            <li> Shreds (leaves hair) in the soap dish, seeming to get a little better after about 10 uses but still annoying to have to pick out the brush hair. Still not a bad brush</li>
            <li> Great brush .  Bought extras for friends.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Exactly as described.  I work in a very dusty environment.  I use this brush to dust delicate equipment.  It works great for that task.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price although after 5 uses there are some straggler hairs</li>
            <li> First off I like the handle on the brush and the hair of the brush is ok,  broke in quickly but after just a few shaves the knot started to shed and now after about 6 months there is a hole in the middle of the knot.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush. I&#x27;ve been using a Van Der Hagen boar bristle brush with plastic handle because that was the only thing available locally. Was looking for something different that I could use and place in a holder since I always left my other just sitting in my shaving mug. Found a holder on Amazon and this brush fit the holder so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the badger bristle, it starts off a little softer than the boar bristle but it generates a good lather and is nice on the skin when lathering up. I also like the wooden handle better than the plastic handle and this one feels good in the hand when using it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked an old Barbershop brand long handle brush I bought about thirty years ago and still have in my bathroom as a decoration but it&#x27;s not available anywhere but this guy comes in as close as possible to that brush as any I can find.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush. Good for its price.</li>
            <li> Worst shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used!  The first day I used it about 100 bristles fell out, making a huge mess.  I thought maybe that was a one-time deal so I gave it a good rinse and decided to try it again.  On the second day about the same number fell out.  Straight to the trash can.</li>
            <li> Item came in on time and in solid packaging. The brush works as advertised. The only thing that I thought was a bit weird was the initial smell of the bristles. The smell makes me think it is 100% badger because the bristles smell like real animal hair. As I continue to use the shaving brush I notice the smell going away.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it and love it!!! My shaving experience has never been better....</li>
            <li> Great Brush at an outstanding price - only lost a few bristles the first couple times used.  Would purchase again from same merchant</li>
            <li> This item is a great value for the price.  The quality of the item is comparable to much higher priced shaving brushes.  It appears well made and fits standard sized brush holders.  I purchased it to use with the SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Black.  I was a little concerned that it would look odd against a black brush stand, but I am actually quite pleased with the contrast.  The brush fits perfectly in the holder slot.</li>
            <li> This brush is not bad for the money, my wife uses this brush to shave her legs and its held out pretty well and she is abusive to brushes. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> works great. using for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and he loves the brush</li>
            <li> This is a good brush. I actually purchased this brush to clean my weapons (in the army) and couldn&#x27;t find a cheap one overseas. So I got this one and works great. It handles the daily dusting over my rifle and other weapons without falling apart. Works great and much better than ones I usually buy at few Meyers for just a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> A gift for my son, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Works good as it should. Those who say the hair comes out must store theirs upside down like in the picture. This softens the glue which will cause the bristles to fall out. Others say the badger hair smells and doesn&#x27;t feel good. Having lived in Montana and seen badgers up close, there is nothing that feels nor smells good about badgers. Your face has to be like a badger, otherwise use a bunny.</li>
            <li> Works well for cleaning firearms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for six months or so. I&#x27;ve used other artificial bristle brushes. (I still use a more animal-friendly artificial bristle brush from the Body Shop, which is fine but less luxurious.) I&#x27;ve had no issues with lost bristles. I may have lost one, despite nearly daily use. The price is perfect. Aside from robbing a poor badger of his or her bristles, it&#x27;s a fine little device.</li>
            <li> Well as other reviews suggested... it does go through a STANK phase after you use it a few times -- whoa I know it is Badger hair... It also sheds a bit.  After all the hassle it settles in to be a solid brush.  As others mentioned...you must be sure you rinse, then flick the water out -- then be sure it is stored bristles down.  It sounds fussy but you can drop $150 and it will rot just as fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving brush for myself and have used it daily for a couple of weeks now and really like it! I&#x27;m a lady who has always used either just water or soap to shave. This brush is a great applicator when used correctly. When I first went to use it I rinsed it out with warm water in the shower, then swirled it around twice in my container of sandalwood shaving cream by Taylor of old bond street, the in a circular motion applied to my leg. Upon first use just a few brush hairs came out of the brush but after that, none! After use I gently rinse the brush and hang from a stand so that bristles point downwards. I rated only four stars because it would have been nice if it came with a little stand - even a plastic one would do. To give a comparison, for my husband I bought the Edwin Jagger best badger brush. His brush lost about the same number of hairs, it does feel a very slight bit softer. Overall I would recommend this brush for him or her.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a brush for shaving, and I am very satisfied with the product. I like how the brush feels when I use it, and have had no major issues. One thing I dislike is that the brush sheds when you first use it. I didn&#x27;t expect that, but have since heard that is normal for any brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these 4 years ago and they have pretty much held together.  The brush itself did seperate from the wood handle after about 2 years or so.  With some gel super glue, the brush has managed to stay fairly attached since.  The one thing that I love about the brush is that the longer I have the softer and more effecient it becomes.  I only wish that it would stay in one peice on a more permanent basis.</li>
            <li> I Have been using it for about a week now; and yes like other reviewers have said it will shed a hair or 2 on you at times but that&#x27;s not to big of an issue. The biggest complaint i have is the presence of a distinct almost horse like odor to he brush that still clings strong to it. other wise it is a solid product that has a good medium stiffness and works up an excellent lather without much effort involved. For the price i am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  Builds plenty of lather.  In fact, I just started using a double edge razor and I realized I was using too much soap to load on the brush.  This brush will build plenty of lather with several swirls on the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and lost a ton of bristles.</li>
            <li> Badger bristles and well made.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> Really great brush especially for the price I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> The smell of the creature whose hair was used to make the brush still lingers. Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> nice brush, better than the synthetic one I was using before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, but this brush has made it an extremely enjoyable experience.  Going from a disposable blade and canned shaving cream applied directly to my face to this makes a daily chore into an enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li> Using this brush is much less annoying than rubbing shaving cream on by hand, does a better job, and it was cheap enough to give it a shot. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> First experience using a badger hair brush for shaving. Picked this up at the same time as my safety razor and will honestly never look back. Great product.</li>
            <li> The brush is great!  I used to have a boar brush, which I like for some reasons, but it cannot hold a candle to this brush&#x27;s ability to create a great soapy foam.  This is great value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> Compact, well made, and effective at whipping up a great foam of shaving cream! Recommended.</li>
            <li> A great brush at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Lather...  It does the job twice as good as most of the &#x27;cheaper&#x27; brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Stinky...  Smells like road kill until you&#x27;ve had it a while.  Badgers are nasty animals and their fur is a reflection of that lifestyle.  But if you can handle a little skunky smell until it gets broken in, you&#x27;ve found one of the better shave brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been using this Escali Badger Shaving Brush for three years. Holding lots of warm water and producing heavy lather.  Not any significant loss of bristle is noticed.</li>
            <li> I used a boar brush for years then switched to the Badger, wow what a difference.  First time using it was great, lost a few hairs but this is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly in my perfecto stand with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> I am a new user to shaving brushes so my feedback may be colored by that....  I do want to state that I am very happy with this product in how it functions.  It has totally changed the way I feel when shaving.... At first it was shedding some of its hairs, but I read it was expected and that it would just settle down after a few uses and it is good that it did as I kept picking long hairs off my face.  The brush holds a lot of water and when used with a good cream (not regular spray cream) it works wonders.  It maintains it shape very nicely time after time and so far (over a month) it has performed greatly.</li>
            <li> Great brush. &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; smell went away after a few shaves</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this brush for it&#x27;s price point and quality. Yes, it&#x27;s badger hair so it may give off a smell initially, but that quickly goes away. Also, a few of the bristles do become loose and fall off during the first couple uses, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, so I ran it under hot water with a bit of shaving cream and used the brush on the palm of my hand before shaving with it to get rid of a majority of the loose bristles. After that initial wash / prep, I only had 2-3 more bristles fall of during my shave. I would highly recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with wet shaving and don&#x27;t want to spend a substantial amount on a real badger brush.</li>
            <li> Couple of things: This is the first I&#x27;ve tried using shaving soap and a brush, and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m also a woman, my shaving needs are different from most of the reviewers. I will say that I love this kind of shaving. It is so much easier in the shower, the lather is great, and the shave soap is better for my skin that whatever is in feminine shaving products (first of all it&#x27;s not God Awful PINK!)  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I have other brushes to compare it to. It&#x27;s soft, lathers well, doesn&#x27;t fall out of my hand, and after a couple of months of using it hasn&#x27;t shed. For the price, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It soon became clear that this brush was a mistake.  The hairs just kept falling out.  I concluded that I had tried to get by too cheap.  I bought a better brush for considerably more money.  Very few hairs have come out.  I guess one gets what one pays for.   Buy cheap, get cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Better than the el-cheapo I had used as a started brush.  Seems to retain hairs well.  My only complaint is the odor.  It smells like a wet animal....(imagine that).  The smell seems to be dissipating the more I use it.</li>
            <li> Brush loses so many hairs, sheds profusely</li>
            <li> Really nice brush and holds the shape after shaving.  Have had it for a couple months and still looks like new.</li>
            <li> Great shaving accessory for those of us using a traditional blade razor.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 50 years and never used a brush and soap.  If I had known what a great shave using a brush provides, I never would have bothered with multi-blade and electric razors.  Without a doubt a brush this good, with a decent shaving cream or soap, is the only way to go!  Even cleaning the brush when done shaving is a snap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking for my husband time to get used to it, but he says that overall it&#x27;s better than the boar bristel brush he previously had. It&#x27;s softer than the boar brush, which is hard to adjust to, but it holds more water and shaving cream. Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a travel size brush and very nice.&lt;br /&gt; I paid at least three times the price i paid for this item from another brand , but i could not tell the difference in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Pity they do not have a bigger regular size. brush for sale.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot beat this shaving brush. It is soft and has less of a smell than the last brush I used. The hairs do come out sometimes, but it may also be an issue of my inexperience with the brushes. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over two months without any issues.  Some of the bristles will come out at first but then this won&#x27;t happen after awhile.  Easy maintenance and care and creates a decent lather.  Would buy another one in the future if the current fails but I imagine I will have this for atleast five years.  Price is great too.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! It is high quality and makes a great lather. I switched to a safety razor from using Gillette plastic crap for ages, and this brush makes it a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I purchased five products as a group after being less than enamored with the offerings from local stores, that included a high-dollar N-brand electric razor with goop that stopped being supported a year after purchase, and a gazillion-bladed KoRazor that cost as much for replacement blades that drag on your face like a boat anchor.  I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  So I looked to Amazon for the Heavyweight All Metal Chrome Trac II razor, Escali Pure Badger brush, a Buffalo Horn 3.5 in Palm Shave Bowl, and TOBS Sandalwood Hard Shaving Soap.  The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  The icing was finding 100-packs Personna TwinII for a third less than a 10-pack at my local grocery.  I can’t say enough good about the entire experience. It’s a great feeling to start the morning ablution with this group of excellent products.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Good service</li>
            <li> I use the brush with shaving cream in a bowl.  I don&#x27;t care for the shaving soap.  The brush applies the cream nicely and rinses well.  I hang it to dry and it is good to go the next day.  Would give the brush 5 stars but it occasionally sheds bristles.</li>
            <li> The hair is extremely thin and this prevents hairs from standing straight. It does help with lathering a little bit. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have not noticed any shedding</li>
            <li> The brush knotted it up the first time I used it.. Even though i soaked it for a while before using it.</li>
            <li> Works great! If you don&#x27;t have a stand for it make sure you put it in its side when letting it dry. No issues getting a good lather with this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was the cheapest one I could find (just wanted to try wet shaving), but also it had many favorable reviews. Some of the reviews however, suggested that the bristles fell out easily, that the handle broke off, or that the badger brush smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced none of these things. I have used the brush with Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood shaving cream for two weeks now (every other day) and it has worked great. The lather feels really nice, the brush is exfoliating, and the sandalwood smells great too. No bristles have fallen out that I can see, the brush has no noticeable scent, and it&#x27;s durable so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying out wet shaving for the first time and you&#x27;ve never used a brush to lather, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even recommend getting this brush and shaving cream soap if you don&#x27;t plan on using a safety razor. It&#x27;s been my experience that with a brush and old style soap you have a much nicer shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Very little shedding. does the job just right and I have purchased many as gifts</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good brush. A few hairs do occasionally fall off when lathering. But the hairs are nice and soft, and work great.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted ! I&#x27;m 67 years old and am now enjoying a proper shave the way it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;I remember my dad using a brush and shaving soap all of high life.&lt;br /&gt;What took me so long, I don&#x27;t know. But, I&#x27;m enjoying the shaves now.&lt;br /&gt;Too chicken to use a straight razor yet.</li>
            <li> Product was a great deal and of great quality for the price. Have been using it daily and it shows no signs of slowing down!</li>
            <li> Very nice component of my old fashioned shaving kit.  I will never go back.</li>
            <li> great brush for the money. great investment. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a double-edge razor four months ago.  I decided to get this inexpensive shaving brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like wet shaving and wanted to keep my initial costs down.  Right away there were many bristles coming out every time I used it.  I paint sometimes and even with good paint brushes you will see a few bristles come out the first couple of uses.  However, with this shaving brush the shedding never did stop.  There were bristles on my face and on the shaving soap nearly every time I used it.  Once it became clear I was going to stick with wet shaving I bought a mid-level Parker shaving brush.  I have never seen a single bristle come out, which is amazing to me.  It is now clear that the Escali brush was far from ideal and I used it for way too long.  It now sits in my drawer.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be, spreads the shaving cream nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband looked long and hard for a replacement for his very worn shaving brush.  This one is a winner, not too hard, not too soft.  Definitely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not the best brush I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Helps facilitate a wonderful shaving experience. Quality wood handle with nice contours. It looks nice, it feels nice, but chiefly it applies thick and even coats off shaving cream with ease. Good at creating a nice lather. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money , I use it every day , when it starts going bad I will get another one as they do not last forever.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and works as described. Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> It did the job. After a few shaves, the brush got softer, as expected.</li>
            <li> For under $13.00 this is an excellent shaving brush. Only a few hairs have come off in the first month. The tip of the bristles are a little prickly, and I imagine are not as soft or as a silver-tipped brush, but at this price, I don&#x27;t have any objections with it. The brush is just the right size for my face and it holds water and lathers up beautifully with the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn shaving soap that I use. Best bang for the buck! That being said, I wish they also offered it in a chrome or black handle.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made brush, whips up a very nice lather in a very short time.</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price.  No issues at all, I&#x27;ve had it for weeks.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for some months now and have greatly enjoyed it. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Good brush for new users. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 years, and it has shed a good bit, but it did its job admirably. For the price, it isn&#x27;t a bad place to start. You could also start off a silvertip badger from Whipped Dog for about $30. I would recommend that, but if you&#x27;re on a budget, it&#x27;ll do what you need it do.</li>
            <li> I just want to go ahead and say this is my first shaving brush that I ever bought. The first thing I like about it is the price. I got it when it was 10 dollars but you get what you pay for. I must have used the brush at least 40 times now and every single time I use it I loose about 2 or 3 bristles. I have read this seems to be a problem with the newer brushes so I would advise looking into another brush. But some people have had luck with this brush so if your willing to take the risk buy it but I think it would be better to spend the extra 4 bucks on a better brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works purphictly with Proraso cream</li>
            <li> seems to be working great so far!</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift and this thing will not stop shedding. I have had it for 3 months and every day when I use it, it loses 6-10 bristles. When they get caught in the shaving cream, you get irritation as they drag all over your face.</li>
            <li> It works pretty slick. It is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a high quality item at a reasonable price. I did lose a few of the bristles initially, but have had no loss in the last week. The bristles are soft and it is back in it&#x27;s normal shape each morning.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it...I would definitely recommend this brush, as we have been through 4 other brands that have fallen apart. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush so take my review with a little grain of salt.  I&#x27;ve been nothing but happy with this brush.  The cost was very reasonable and it does a great job of whipping up a nice shaving cream.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised.  I would recommend a shaving brush like this to anyone who really wants to get back to getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> I asked my wife to buy me a badger hair shaving brush, and she bought this one.  I was amazed she only paid $10 for it, as I paid $40 when I bought one ten years ago or so.  But you get what you pay for...  hairs are coming out of it from day one and it has a funny smell.  It works but hairs are coming out every time I shave, which is a bother, as I have to pick them off my face while shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is affordable, comfortable to use and clean without going through a difficult learning curve. Definitely recommend a stand to hang the brush to extend its life. Got the Escali stand which was very good, affordable and functional. Good looking and solid to boot too.</li>
            <li> Good brush great price</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price! Lots of hairs fell out in the beginning, but that stopped after two uses. It&#x27;s a bushy, soft brush that holds moisture very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap prickly bristle brush, does not soften up with use, suffering some bristle loss, I have pastry brushes that are softer.</li>
            <li> This is a Very nice shaving brush and a good value for money. The build quality is very good. This fits anyone who are looking for a good brush without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Great brush. The price is excellent and the performance is exceptional. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the one from the high end store visited. CD</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping and works just like it should. My third brush and this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nice. I have never used this type of shaving accessory before, but now I am converted.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t looking for a 50$ brush for 10$. Was looking for a good introductory brush for someone new to brush shaving. The Escali has been exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out, but nothing significant. It is soft and creates a good lather. I&#x27;m using The Art of Shaving (Sandlawood) lather. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I am truly pleased with the quality and price of this brush.  Best brush I have ever owned and I am old so I have had a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out pretty frequently, not the worst I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t think using this along with the shaving soap would make that big of a difference but it did.</li>
            <li> This little brush works wonders creating a nice lather for your face.    People have mentioned bristles falling out. That has not happened to me at all and I only recently went back to shaving with a non-electric razor.    Some things to note on keeping this product in good condition:    1) Do not let water leak into the handle  2) Do not be overly rough with it  3) Rinse the bristles thoroughly to get all foam out of them (I use a medium-hot water -- aka it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hand when you touch it)  4) When storing this product, make sure that it is pointing bristles-DOWN so that any remaining water will drip OUT of it    Now, #4 may seem like a hard task if you don&#x27;t have a brush holder. You may not want to even buy one. I know I didn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s where some DIY comes in.    Some people use a coat hanger to hang this product from somewhere in their bathroom. That works pretty well.    I on the other hand, did not have a coat hanger for some reason to spare. So what I did was -- I used the box it came in (a plastic, see-through container). This small, plastic box has a hole near the top that you often see on products so that they can hang from walls in stores. I attached a paper clip to this part and am now simply letting it hang from a spot in my bathroom. That&#x27;s even less work than using a coat hanger! If you do it this way, then you may want to poke a small hole or two in the plastic as well so that moisture can escape. Just some FYI for those who want to DIY! (was that as catchy as it sounded in my head? oh boy do I hope so!)    EDIT: I have added an image to the gallery that shows my &#x27;DIY&#x27;. As you can see, I have something in my bathroom that is perfect for hanging things with a paper clip. You can use other things though, such as string, Rubber Bands, etc. Hope it helps!    EDIT (11/21/2014): I bought this ages ago and it still works like a champ! However, the bristles now ARE falling out (every shave). There&#x27;s so many of them that it just doesn&#x27;t matter, but they do get in the sink and on your face. Not a big deal really (especially considering the price of this product).</li>
            <li> Nice inexpensive brush. Does shed a little so far, but hoping that will stop with continued use.</li>
            <li> Brush is excellent.  Soft, makes better lather than my previous synthetic low end brushes.  Much needed improvement for my shaves.  No shedding noticed as of yet.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Stiff but soft bristles make a nice lather and scrub the face well. Way better than my old wilkenson sword!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 starts. It might be a 5 star product, it might be a 1 star product, I don&#x27;t know. I think I used it wrong.</li>
            <li> Quality brush at an affordable price. I am so happy that I chose this this one over some of the others. Last brush I had from another company had a strange smell to it. Not the case with this Bad Boy!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my first time using a shaving brush, so i can&#x27;t compare the product to others in its category, but what i can say is that my shaving has improved immensely since i started using this brush.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Brush.  Excellent, fast service from this provider!</li>
            <li> The brush works perfectly as a shave brush.  It does have a slightly odd smell.  nothing to bad, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  This is by far the nicest brush I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush!  Very soft and fits my shave stand perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have used a few times...saw a few hairs come out...I expected that. Good stiff badger hair. Love it. Great price. have to see how it holds up. Fits perfect on stand I bought</li>
            <li> Update 2: Using this for a while. As the brush bloomed, a large empty spot has appeared in the center of the hairs. Not good, and I am taking this brush out of my rotation. Again, for the price, for beginners, this is an okay brush. But just okay.&lt;br /&gt;Update: My Escali has stopped losing bristles and is breaking in nicely-softening up. So I have upgraded the rating to four stars. For the price, this is an okay brush.&lt;br /&gt;The Escali is not my first badger brush. The reviews were so overwhelmingly good, I decided to check this inexpensive brush out. It arrived today. The results of my first shave: the brush is on the small side, but remember the low price. It lathered well and gave me a nice beginning to my shave. It feels a bit coarse. It also lost quite a few bristles. So why did I give it three stars? It provided the foundation for a very good shave but it shed a lot.. As I continue to use this brush, I will update the review. If the shedding stops I will raise my rating to a four. If it continues to shed, I will return it to Amazon and lower my rating to a two. Again, what should one expect for twelve bucks?</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush. Holds plenty of soap, and a quick dip in warm water will bring a frothy lather. Some bristles will fall out but that is a consequence of normal use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.  Replaced an over priced Art of Shaving badger brush. Like this brush better.  Will buy this brush again if it ever wears out.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> These reviews are either from inexperienced people just getting in to wet shaving or they&#x27;re fake. This is crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Small&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;SHEDS! Every shave i get at least ten hairs that I&#x27;m picking out of my bowl or face.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality control. Some people get brushes that hold up for a year and some that break after two uses.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely rough for a badger brush. The clipped hairs never really soften even after 8 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the buy. It does exactly what I expected it to do. It seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush.  It is super soft and lathers up really well.  I looked at brushes for up to $80 before buying this one, and can not imagine that I would have been more pleased with the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Loses hars, which then stick to the cake soap or your face as you apply shaving foam.  Not good. Two stars because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Had the badger smell initially but went off after a few uses. Remember to dry it upside down. Great lathering on face. Feels like the good old times. Now need to get a safety razor to go with it. Currently using the Gillette 5 blader!</li>
            <li> This brush never stops shedding.  If you don&#x27;t want to have badger bristles all of your face, get another one.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple of weeks now with no major issues. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I seem to lose fibers out of the brush each time I use it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. First lathers were very prickly. It&#x27;s getting softer as I go though, which is expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and some Proraso Italian shaving soap for my son. He says he&#x27;s now getting the best shaves of his life.</li>
            <li> My item came damaged--the bristle head had detached from the handle. I assumed that it was the poor packaging that Amazon had chosen. Something like this warrants a box instead of corrugated wrap. Other reviewers described their bristle head falling off after some use. Since I didn&#x27;t relish going through a return process for such an inexpensive item, I just broke out the epoxy and fixed it on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;It has been working fine for me, but I am an infrequent shaver (1-2wk) so I have yet to experience any of the bristle fallout that others have mentioned to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin and was bleeding always. He loves it!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Maybe I push too hard but it seems like a hair falls out about every 3rd shave and i have to pick it off my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple months now and it works great.  The soap lathers up nice and it is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Lathers and applies with a few quick brush strokes. No need to rinse and dry hands (as with tube and aerosol creams). I wish your site mentioned that brush should not be stored upright, I would have ordered a stand.</li>
            <li> It takes the soap well and I like the feel. Seems to lose one hair each time I&#x27;ve used it though which prevents me from marking it as a 5. Overall, it is a very good brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I am please with the product!!!</li>
            <li> have used the brush for about two or three weeks, after going back to basics in shaving, was sick of paying 35 bucks for 6-8 blades. found my old double edged razor ordered new blades,soap and this brush.&lt;br /&gt;this trio out performs the new high tech b.s at 5th the price</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush. Really, it gets the job done, but hairs have been falling out consistently. Save a few more bucks for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Builds a great lather. REAKS of badger, lol. The smell wears away (mostly), and the bristles are very soft. Overall, very happy with this brush. I own three brushes so far, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This brush came highly recommended and lived up to expectations. It&#x27;s a very nice addition to my morning routine and I look forward to using it every morning!</li>
            <li> This is my intro into wet shaving and badger hair holds more water and is denser than boar hair - it is just technically better for this purpose at any grade. Supposedly this is the lowest grade of badger hair (pure) given the price point. Appears that the price point is about 30 to 60 before you get anything rated best or silvertip and becomes exponential if name brand is involved. I have never tried shaving with another brush, but I attempted to do some research and went to a store to look and feel what a $120 brush buys you...There&#x27;s no question that it is a higher grade product, the bristles are softer and more consistent, the handle is made of &#x27;real&#x27; material, and there might be more hair inside the handle (the knot) so that is less likely to fall out over time. This brush lathers just fine and probably has a lower overall useful life than a more expensive one.  Based on the reviews and pricing, I had almost no expectations. I&#x27;m not losing to many hairs after first week of use and it lathers just fine.  Getting the smell out was a different story. This thing smells like an animal...not as bad as a boar brush (at least you know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real badger&amp;#34;). I tried dish soap, head &amp; shoulders, every shampoo I could find in the bathroom, and hot water. What really got the smell out quick was proraso. I would practice lather making with any strong scent shaving cream or soap a few times to get the smell down to an acceptable level before actual use.</li>
            <li> I wish it come with a stand so you can put a brush upside down. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very good brush. This product is NOT junk.</li>
            <li> works great.  a few hairs continue to fall out from time to time but this has not been a problem so far. Update after several months use. Continues to work great and i just ordered another for my dad to use when he travels.   He is very happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> An excellent replacement to his stub of an old brush that he tells me is perfect.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice thin layer and smooth shave. Like others state, bristles are pretty stiff at first but they do soften up some. Sort of helps keep you from slathering on too much soap!</li>
            <li> great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> Nice thick brush, quality handle. Terrific value.</li>
            <li> This badger brush is fantastic!  Retains heat and whips up a great lather. You cannot beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> Works well, very comfortable, great brush for the price. As others have noted the key to longevity is to hang it upside down to let it dry. I fashioned a hook in the shower from a coat hanger and it&#x27;s worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Decided to get a safety razor and bought this brush to go with my kit. Was not disappointed. Haven&#x27;t had any issues and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; excellent on-time service!</li>
            <li> It work ok but the hair falls out of the brush and you have to pick them off your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved a woman like I love this brush. The softest, purest badger hair is clearly on display and every morning it helps turn my shaving routine into an exciting activity that I enjoy instead of dread. It rinses easily, dries well, applies evenly, and is a joy to brush my face with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything after my shave is downhill, but I&#x27;m working on it....</li>
            <li> gift for my son----he likes it alot</li>
            <li> a quality product, soft not scratchy, lathers up a treat.</li>
            <li> Its a nice brush. The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I touched this brush to my neck I exploded into song; more specifically Africa by ToTo. After a quick underwear change I applied the remaining lather. This product has other uses. I put it in my pants so when I take a pee at the Moose Lodge the other guys think I have Don King Afro pubes. Also prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Tried it once so far. No complaints yet.</li>
            <li> I was never impressed with the brush when I first got it. The brush hair smelled horrible. After a few soaks/uses, the smell became tolerable, but never really went away in the first (and only) month that the brush was used. It also shed a lot. My soap bowl is covered in the brush hair that fell off. It seemed to do a decent enough job making lather. The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly soft or comfortable, although it felt fine and never bothered me. However, the reason for the 1 star rating is because, after slightly more than 1 month of use, the knot broke and the brush separated from the handle (it didn&#x27;t just fall out). Although this is a cheap brush, I&#x27;d certainly expect more than a month&#x27;s use out of it. I think I&#x27;m going to spend a bit more money and get something better than this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves using his new shaving brush with the shave bars I made him. The only real complaint we have is the bristles come out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Very soft and lathers great. I only gave this product 4 stars because if you do not dry it very well it smells mildewy. Make sure to dry it extra well and you will be very happy with the softness and amount of lather this brush produces. There is minimal bristle loss.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, just the right size to whip up a decent lather using [[ASIN:B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]] for a superb shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this combination daily for over a week now, with a Bic disposable 3-blade razor and I have to say this is giving me the closest shave I have ever had. In fact I am astounded by what a difference this makes compared to my previous use of Barbasol gel in a can with the same razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has lost a few bristles on use, but really the loss is quite minimal and I expect this to last if looked after well. I would recommend getting a stand though as badger brushes should be left upside down or on their side to dry out after shaving otherwise the bristles will fall out due to the wooden brush handle drying much more slowly that the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Amazingly close shave when used with [[ASIN:B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]], and a regular disposable razor; feels nice to handle and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: some bristle loss; a little bit of a longer shaving routine; brush is a little rough on the face till you get used to it, although perhaps this helps \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; (what do I know?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product so far.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the hairs on this because it just held too much water...and after a certain point the hairs would come off and stay on my face as I shaved....this would ruin the shave.....anyway....its great....and cheap.  .but I would try to get better quality .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, great first brush. nice and soft and the animal smell was easy to get rid of by letting some lather sit in it overnight...</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and it is a great improvement over my old brush. It&#x27;s soft and lathers well. It looks good and it works.</li>
            <li> This is the first badger-hair brush I&#x27;ve bought. One of the first things I noticed about it was its distinctive musk, which, while enjoyable, was unanticipated and only served to increase my appreciation for this brush even further. Additionally, it creates a much better lather than previous brushes I have owned. If you&#x27;re looking for something ornamental or elegant, this isn&#x27;t it--as you might have already found out from the picture, it has a plain, undistinguished wooden handle. What it is, however, is an excellent entry-level brush for anyone who is new to the brush-and-soap method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over 6 months now and don&#x27;t have many complaints. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brushes out, but I cannot complain about this one.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my dad, he loves it! The brush is soft and does not loose hairs or bristles.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts a long time. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the men in my family for Christmas. Bought another one for myself.</li>
            <li> Produces a much thicker lather than using your hands and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was needing a second brush for my weekends away from home but didn&#x27;t want to spend another $30 or more for another brush so I thought I&#x27;d try this Escali.  This brush is slightly smaller and is lighter than my primary brush but is perfect for my needs.  At the Amazon price it&#x27;s a great buy for someone who is wanting to try using brush/soap for shaving or, as in my situation, needs one at a second location for occasional use.</li>
            <li> wery fast delivery. exelent brush</li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat on this brush. It&#x27;s actually nice quality, works well. I&#x27;ve only lost a few bristles so far. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again if it wears out.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations</li>
            <li> I really like it. It&#x27;s my first brush and it performs well</li>
            <li> After using this brush for 2 months, it works really great with various brand of shaving creams and soaps. However, I found that after 20-30 used. this brush lose the backbone compare with the first used. On the other hand the hair feel softer too. So, you lose some gain some with this brush from time to time (in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;I gave this brush only 3 stars because I think I could find other shaving brush the cheaper and work better than this brush. If you not really a big fan with Badger brush, I recommend Omega 10048 Boar Bristle, Omega S brush (synthetic brush) and Semogue 1800 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush. All of the 3 brush that I recommended are in the price range between 10-20 $$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this help some of you guys who look for a good wet shaving brush</li>
            <li> After a year , still like new. Some bristles will fall out in the beginning,  but no big deal.  As good as the  $60 mall brushes</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is just as advertised.  Very soft and pliable giving a very even application of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good brush and a good price this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> This brush was surprisingly well made, very soft and works up a great lather. A very good value at twice the price.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Bought 2 stands.  Very well made and add a little class to the bathroom. You will not be disappointed with either product.</li>
            <li> Great product, and reasonably priced to boot</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price! Just got into DE shaving and it has served all my needs well. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget. Good quality, sturdy-not a lot of strands fell out either.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my brother. Any man should have a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Recently made the switch over from a synthetic bristle hair brush and let me tell you it makes a huge difference. before i would have some trouble creating a rich enough lather even with a quality soap but with the Escali lathering up is super easy. It has decent sized handle seems small at first but it works. i will say it does have an initial funky smell when wet but its gradually wearing off. I can&#x27;t yet comment on the durability but so far its holding up. overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the only shave brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I only chose it because it was cheaper than the rest.  But it works great and has held up well after a couple years of use.  The badger is much nicer on your face than boar&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a beater brush for shaving in the shower with an Arko stick. I haven&#x27;t used this in a scuttle or bowl with soap, but it&#x27;s great for what I do with it.</li>
            <li> First Badger brush... Floppy sloppy application.  Not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brushes in the past, some more expensive and some less. This, by far, is the best. More often than not, with the first few uses, you notice hairs bristles come out before it get settle (high end brushes). The cheaper ones you constantly see bristle hairs in the sink after every use. Not this one, I&#x27;ve yet to see any in the sink, on my face or anywhere. Quality product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush has very strong bristles. It is somewhat small and not as large as I had&lt;br /&gt;expected.  Still it does the job of serving as a useful implement in shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but it sheds everywhere. Since this is my first brush maybe it will stop with use, but I&#x27;m so far disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the history to compare and rate the quality of the brush, seems decent.  The company did get it to me on time and in good shape, so I would recommend them from that standpoint.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Took a few shaves for the hairs to stop falling out. Switched from boar hair to this. No regrets.</li>
            <li> Cheap, poor quality, the brush matted into a tangled, knotted mess every time I used it.  Wonderful dreads, horrible for shaving.</li>
            <li> Every thing they said it was</li>
            <li> Stiff sharp bristles/Hair&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t make a lather for crap. Has better luck making lather with a 5 dollar Walmart starter kit</li>
            <li> Works better than my old boar brush, but has a tendency to matte together with vigorous lathering in the cup and on your face.  Need to do a couple extra rinses and shake out the bristles that were smashed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  been a long time since I used a brush but i was about to buy one at Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and found this one on Amazon at half the price. I am using half the shaving cream and getting twice the lather with this brush! I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used shaving brushes since 1969. I admit that I have gone back and forth between the convenience of &amp;#34;canned foam&amp;#34; and brush and soap, and the brush has won. During those years I have used many brushes made of different materials. ( handle and bristles.) This is my first Escali brush, and, so far, I have an idea that Escali will be my only shaving brush. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate its longevity, but it is quite clearly a quality product that I expect will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Better than advertised,  feels great and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much experience to compare it to, but this brush is exactly what I was expecting.  I am happy with every shave.</li>
            <li> The five stars are for the quality of product at its price point, as well as the seller&#x27;s speed and accuracy. The brush is a good one, probably best in its price range, but there are better and more expensive ones out there. Seller processed and shipped the order same day.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It is a high quality brush, lathers well, and holds its shape.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush. Super soft. Nice wood base. Dries fast. In the original review I wrote, I mentioned a few hairs fell out of the brush with use. Pretty soon after I submitted it, I got an email from the seller apologizing for my experience and offering to replace the brush or refund my money. Wow! Great service and the seller really cares about happy customers. I replied back saying I&#x27;m happy with the brush and I didn&#x27;t need a replacement or a refund. A few hairs falling out of the brush is probably normal. I&#x27;m really happy with the product and would buy from this seller again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush but other reviews prompted me to purchase this one. Not much to say except it does what it&#x27;s supposed to... put lather on my face. it doesn&#x27;t smell like a wild animal like some others have said. I do need a stand for it so it&#x27;ll dry properly. great purchase. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> A decent brush for someone looking to try traditional wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine for about week before bristles began coming out of during use but, I&#x27;m glad I bought this first before investing in more expensive shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> The anxiously awaited badger hair brush arrived today.  On first use, it smelled remarkably like a wet badger. I trust the aroma will abate with use.</li>
            <li> Bought this right before Christmas, it&#x27;s still in great condition and used all the time.  Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush was thin and very stinky compared to my other brushes.  I understand that there should be some smell associated with a &amp;#34;badger haired&amp;#34; brush, but that faded on my other brushes.  I tried vinegar, shampoo, dish soap, etc.  The worst part was that the smell sticks to your face.  Nothing sucks more than going to work and smelling barnyard on your face all day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this one sheds terrible!  I would expect a little, but this seemed like it would probably fade to nothing if I had kept going!</li>
            <li> Product is just what I was looking for, solidly built, feels great in your hands which comes when such things are made with great quality, it&#x27;s also reasonably priced. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks, and am pretty pleased.  I see a few bristles falling out, I hope that stops soon.  It is very soft, and lathers the soap nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple reviews mentioned a smell - I noticed it the first couple times I used it, but it is going away.  I use a bit of aftershave which made it go away.</li>
            <li> I was not too happy with my shaving experience with a synthetic brush and began scouring the net in search for something better. I discovered the benefits of the badger hair brush and bought this particular based on the price point and reviews on amazon. I have to say I am not disappointed at all. The brush did shed a few hair the first couple of times I used it, but since then it has been good. Provides a good shave and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to check if the badger haired brushes are for them. Once you are satisfied maybe you can go for fancier ones.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it! The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> such a good deal I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second as backup</li>
            <li> Brush is really good. Mine had a strong animal musk sent when wet for the first few days but is fading significantly and i expect will be gone soon. Have only lost a few hairs and they appear to have stopped coming out. Very firm, but not unconfortable or rough. Builds up a great lather with the two soaps i have used so far. I will buy a replacement in the future if this holds up as well as i believe it will. I will update post with any relevant information as i get it.</li>
            <li> has held up well and is a good first brush but every now and then a hair or two will fall out.</li>
            <li> As described. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush of this kind. So far so good. I subtract one star only because the brush has shed some from use. Initially, there were multiple bristles a shave but it has slowed to one or two a shave. It might still be breaking in and loose bristles might be expected at first from manufacturing. I have used it for approximately 20 shaves, thus far. Seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot. At the beginning there were a few hairs that had come loose, so you may want to perform fairly vigorous early inspection of the brush to get those out of the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best badger brush I own!</li>
            <li> I bought two...one for Summer home, one for Winter home. Classy looking and works better than anticipated using a good quality soap.</li>
            <li> Its beautiful.  Paints the cream on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and on time.  Using the brush about three times a week since purchased.  Bristles are still firm and intact.</li>
            <li> Great value. Superior to my old one which was inherited.</li>
            <li> As I read before buying a brush that you want boar or badger and either is pretty much fine especially for a beginner learning what you like. Well I love it, it lathers good with my proraso soap and after the first few shaves no more hairs are coming out. Great product with a great price! I shave with a generic 3 blade safety razor from walgreens with it and it works great. I don&#x27;t see myself needing another of these for a long time unless something happens to this one. Perfect for intro to wet shaving brush (and maybe more?) but i definitely like wet shaving and this product has been perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several weeks now. It works very well and is a great value for the money. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone interested in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just a bit smelly at first. I&#x27;m guessing that most badger brushes are probably a little &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; at first. This is the best way that I have found to use it: Use hot water to make your foam in a cup. If you want the foam to be thick, use a little less water in the brush when working up the lather. Use short quick circular motions to apply the foam to the face. It does a nice job of applying the foam and lifting the whiskers. When you rinse it out, run water through it until it looks clean. Then, load it with water and &amp;#34;sling&amp;#34; the water out in the shower or tub (hold on to the handle and do a short fast throwing motion). If there&#x27;s any soap left in it it will show. Do it until there&#x27;s no more soap coming out.Form it with your hands to the right shape and hang it to dry. When it&#x27;s dry, if there are stray hairs sticking out at right angles to the main knot, just snip them off. Only cut the hairs that won&#x27;t conform with the others. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months and have grown to like it.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks and it broke already.  The brush came out of the handle.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my son &amp; he was very pleased with the brush.  He said it is very soft and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Lathers my skin well. It&#x27;s my first brush so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a normal occurrence, but every time I use it one or two of the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaving brush and with quite a bit to choose from finally decided on this one.  Other reviewers have said it is scratching but for me anyway, that is not the case.  No bad smell either.  I have noticed a very small brownish tint to my soap when I lather up but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know shaving could be so enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Brush works great. Bought as an upgrade from my brush that I got in a kit from a big box store. This one performs much better.</li>
            <li> Great Brush, lost a few hairs the first couple uses, but definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Badger hair began to fall out within a couple days.  The entire brush came out of the handle in only 3 months.  Clear coat on handle cracked and fell apart within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for nearly four months now and it continues to perform well. A stray bristle will occasionally fall out, but I would expect the same of any shaving brush. The brush seems to retain an appropriate amount of moisture while shaving and dries well between uses.</li>
            <li> My brush suffers from alopecia and hair is constantly falling off. After every shave, I have long badger hair in my blade that washes off easily but it&#x27;s annoying during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also has a strong odor of badger that overpowers my shaving cream. As soon as the brush is wet, it smells close to a wet dog but distinct enough to be (what I assume is) badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s cheap and will keep my face lathered until all the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful shed alittle in the begining but thwt is to be expected. But well worth the price. I would compare it to any brush on the market double its price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and has help up well</li>
            <li> this is a great buy I really like this,highly recommend</li>
            <li> Seems excellent, holds water much better than the boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with shaving brushes, other than with this one, however, it seems to work perfectly.  I don&#x27;t have any hairs that are falling out and I get a nice clean and even lather.  As far as I can tell, this brush works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Kinda small. Doesn&#x27;t really get in there.</li>
            <li> I use Colonel Conk&#x27;s Almond shaving soap. Before this i had a van der haagen brush from a gift set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this brush a couple times and it stinks very badly. it is almost unbearable for me to shave with it. it smells like a weird thick musky rubbery smell, as if the animal they got the hair off of was hideously unclean and they never bothered to clean it or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the musky smell of the almond soap certainly doesnt help. I wouldnt be surprised if this was horse hair or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is extremely small. it is slightly prickly, but thats ok. arguably that is its only redeeming quality. If the brush was bigger and less smelly it would be fine but this thing is tiny and smells awful. perhaps a different soap like proraso or some other menthol/eucalyptus soap would help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try washing it with dish soap to see if the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush really works well.  Some of the bristles are coming loose but overall great brush. Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> Brush does the job perfect! 100%. Better than walmart brushes!</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is the perfect size, heft and is quite soft making for a nice shaving experience. Great product store too.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality. A few hairs fall out when I use it but I suppose that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Nice thick well made brush that produces alot of lather. Was shipped quickly. A very good deal for the price. A+++++</li>
            <li> Item matches description. Good quality.</li>
            <li> The overall design of the brush is a bit small, which is great if you like to lather while holding with your finger tips. The bristles are firm but not scratchy. The big loss is that the hairs consistently fall out. I&#x27;ve been VERY gentle with the brush when lathering in the shaving cup; only the tips of the bristles touch. Regardless, be prepared to lose at least 3-5 hairs per shave. I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 2 months and the hairs keep falling out. Still, the price is very affordable and the handle design is solid.</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is what America used to be about; great craftsmanship and service.</li>
            <li> Works great. Don&#x27;t bother with the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a low price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and a half now. Overall it has been a very nice brush, but its the only one I&#x27;ve ever had so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to... The only thing I&#x27;ve had an issue with is that it lost a LOT of bristles in the first six months of use. I&#x27;m assuming I just got a bad one since most everyone else has not had this problem. From day one I have dried it out really well and hung it upside down after use, so I know that wasn&#x27;t the issue. That hasn&#x27;t affected the ability to create a good lather, so I haven&#x27;t felt the need to replace it. It still on average loses a hair or two every time I shave (which is 2 or 3 times a week). But again, overall, good brush and certainly good value.</li>
            <li> Built well. Works well. Hair is attached firmly and has not released after several uses. Seems like a quality product.</li>
            <li> The 4 stars is in the account of the initial funky smell of the brush and the initial loss of the fibers with each shaving. There is no instruction such as &amp;#34;soak it for so many hours before use&amp;#34;  which might be a good idea since even after washing it prior the first use it let a brown tinge in the lather</li>
            <li> I have both this Escali brush and the Escali stand.  I love them both.</li>
            <li> Came fast, looks great, and feels amazing! Looking forward to using it, but still waiting to make a stand so that it can dry properly.</li>
            <li> My first brush and I didn&#x27;t want to invest all the money that some of these sell for.  While the price is extremely reasonable for this brush, it is no &amp;#34;bargain product&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Never had a very high quality brush to compare this to but it&#x27;s a great brush and I much enjoy it</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, as described. Works and drys well, brissles stay intact.</li>
            <li> product great and delivery prompt</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a shaving brush I looked at this one several times before deciding to buy it. The reason was the price. Most badger hair brushes are considerable higher priced and I just figured at this price that it was a cheap imitation of a badger hair brush. I finally decided to take a chance on it and I was glad that I did. It shipped very fast and the quality was excellent. I have been very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend this to any one who wants a badger hair brush without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to read reviews that say the bristles never come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to read reviews that say the bristles came out from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second kind.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price.</li>
            <li> meh, its pretty small. not all that great. But its also pretty inexpensive. but it will be worth spending the money and getting a nice one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use a lotion type cream and the brush works wonders for a close shave.  Far closer than using standard shacking cream or the lotion w no brush.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very smooth and gentle brush.</li>
            <li> Had to revise this as of 2/1/2016.  Had this brush less than a year or so and it&#x27;s loosing a considerable amount of hair when shaving.  Picking hair off my face, around my mouth etc... didn&#x27;t expect this to happen so soon.  I think this is a good beginner brush which is what I was with this brush for a wet safety shave.  I will now search for a more quality brush.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it okay but will shed too much on you soon in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. Laughable to find it on the &amp;#34;Bad Gear List&amp;#34; http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/wiki/avoid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who make such lists are supposedly in revolt against Gillette, yet their pretentiousness rivals Big Shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine doesn&#x27;t smell, it doesn&#x27;t shed, and it feels the same as antiques I have that would sell for big money on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, the greatest quality is that which can be perceived by the fewest people. If you can&#x27;t tell the difference, don&#x27;t pay more for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days and it seems great and a super value.</li>
            <li> Awesome Brush! Evenly applies the lather and makes me feel like a fine gentleman from the days of yore instead of the hairy wildebeest that I actually am.</li>
            <li> This is my second time owning a shaving brush and I got to say that the Escali badger shaving brush is better than the one I have used. The bristles feels soft on your face.This is a very good brand of a shaving brush.I would recommend this type of shaving brush to any guys.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is extremely soft and feels wonderful on the skin.  There is nothing that compares to a warm shave in the morning starting of with this brush.</li>
            <li> Creates a very good lather, but I think I personally prefer a stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li> This is the second Escali 100% Badger Shaving Brush I have bought,  The first one of several years ago has lost no bristles so the new one is serving at present as a spare.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush and I like it a lot. It works great while lathering and makes the application process a breeze. You&#x27;ll have several hairs fall out in the beginning and it might smell a little, but I see this as a non-issue. After 5-7 uses it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Real nice brush, well made.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush does everything I need it to do. The bristles do not lose shape which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Works up a good lather&lt;br /&gt;Noticing some shedding but nothing too bad at the moment</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and it feels the same quality as in a barber shop. I have been using it like 1 month or more by now, it looks good.</li>
            <li> Excellent, fits stand perfectly as well</li>
            <li> I am a wet shave enthusiast and have been trying to convince my son to embrace wet shaving instead of scraping his face with expensive four blade razors.  However, to save some money, I bought him a boar bristle brush to begin with, and he has been on the fence about whether or not he enjoys wet shaving.  When I replaced his boar bristle brush with this Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, he could immediately tell the difference in how luxurious the lather was on his face and he is now a convert.  Plus, the transaction to purchase the brush was easy and smooth, and shipping was speedy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend it to others. Be sure not to let the brush dry standing upright. Use a stand or lay on it&#x27;s side as it will extend the life of the brush.</li>
            <li> High quality, wish a brush of this quality was available at my drug store</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for traveling. I have a more expensive Edwin Jagger that I use daily. Is there a difference? Yes, but that is to be expected given the price difference. The Escali is a nice brush...AND DOES THE JOB....for sure. I like it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 4 months now and absolutely love it! Only a few hairs have come loose and the coating on the wooden handle seems to stand up really well to continuous water exposure. Looks as good as new. Good quality, good price. Glad we spent the $$ on something that will last. Using it with the non-toxic charcoal based shaving soap bar sold on Amazon as well. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Has a solid wooden handle, 100% full and dense bristles, and it retains heat from the lather as long as any other badger brush. Seller ships fast and inexpensively. 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Good price for the brush. It was a little smaller than I thought but works just as we&#x27;ll on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rookie with shaving brushes, but I am very pleased with this brush.  After a good soaking for a couple of minutes, it hold a great amount of lather and is very comfortable on the skin.  I have only used it once, but it seems to me that this will last a good period of time if taken care of properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> My husband is a blade man in regards to shaving. I make him homemade shaving soap because well I am cheap and I have prefected a recipe he likes. But he was using just a very inexpensive brush so I got him this as an early Father&#x27;s day gift. He loves it. He said it helps the soap lather and feels wonderful on his skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> First brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it does exactly what I need. Great quality, unbelievable price from the research I did online, and overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. 10/10.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a fathers day gift. My Dad had a worn out brush, and being old school, only uses brush to lather before shaving. Dad called me and was overjoyed he could retire his old brush and loved the new badger brush replacement. Described it as nice and soft compared to his existing item but rigid enough to hold soap. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice and so is Dad...</li>
            <li> Loved the shaving brush. I got it on time. The quality of the brush exceeded my expectations. I WILL do business with Perella&#x27;s again!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal when it comes to badger hair shaving brushes</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of the swine! No more shall I bow down to any more boars and their whiskers for my shaving needs! I have now found badger to harass, hunt and steal hairs from... now I shave like a man, utmost grandiosity intact and Samurai honor prevailing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar brushes used to kick my arse to hell and back. There was no way to tell why they would do that, but the fault lies with me for not using the better brush. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, some people prefer using boar whisker brush - which is absolutely okay, but it is not for me - and definitely not for those who cannot handle the loose hair upon their manly faces. Just imagine, looking at yourself into the mirror, admiring the vessel that contains all that testosterone for hot love making and being the epitome of manhood. Imagine Henry Cavill staring back at you all Man O&#x27; Steel like, only to have the image twist unto Davy Jones and those loose boar spikes turning you into a monstrosity you don&#x27;t deserve to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the three stars? Three reasons;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not the best quality, then again... it&#x27;s not supposed to be. You get what you pay for. This is for those transitioning from boar to badger. Loose bristles on occasion therefore are an annoyance, but always remember to dry it (or hang it upside down after usage like I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rugged face surface hurts the brush. Now on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being The Thing and 1 being Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s lovely parts, I am a good solid 6. But on occasion the brush scrunches against my skin, unwilling the withstand the temerity of gallantry and awesomeness that is me (seriously, if you&#x27;re Santa and wish to look like Sean Connery, this brush will bend over backwards and go to extreme lengths for you, but there is no guarantee it&#x27;ll survive after pulling of &amp;#34;Saving Private Ryan&#x27; type feats of valor!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask not what the bristles do for the brush, but what the brush can do for the bristles. Seriously, mate... take good careof this brush. It will last you a few hundred shaves, enabling you to stand tall with the likes of Allan Quarterman and Captain John Blackthorne (yes, I know they sport beards... but I&#x27;m matching sheer awesomeness, not smooth faces). Finally you can upgrade to a better quality badger brush too, I look forward to that day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: No boars or badgers were harmed in the writing of this review.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. On par with the $80 one I have from The Art of Shaving. Package arrived on time and in great shape. I recommend the brush and the seller highly.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush drys quickly when shavings finished cant go wrong with this one</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush that lathers very well.  The bristles stay put and feel good to my face.  Thanks for the quick and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> My husband says, &amp;#34;Works fine, doesn&#x27;t shed bristles. Give it 5 stars.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as an extra for when I find myself sleeping over my girlfriend&#x27;s house. It&#x27;s stiff and picks up the soap well as a result. The lather I get from this is better than with the brush I paid more than double the amount for!</li>
            <li> This brus fits in the Escali brush/razor stand. It is a very soft brush on your face. One piece of advice, make sure you soak it in hot water and rinse repeatedly prior to the first use to get the excess dye out of it. You will notice the water turns brown when you first get this brush wet but don&#x27;t panic, it only happens on the first use.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush to replace an old one from another manufacturer that had been shedding for some time.  This Escali brush smells like they didn&#x27;t bother to de-musk or clean the hair, and it is really off-putting.  I hope that goes away soon, or I won&#x27;t be using this brush for long.  The bristles are weaker/floppier than my previous brush, and so it is harder to work up a good lather and apply.  Will give it a fair trial before retiring this one, but I don&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for the price. It does shed a bit during the first few uses, but lathers and holds soaps great. Definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the musty smell noted by others is accurate.  When wet, for the first week+, you will notice an somewhat unpleasant odor (similar to a wet dog).  It seems to be subsiding with daily use.  There have been minimal loss of hairs with use.</li>
            <li> a little badger whiskers on the face never hurt no one ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product is very nice.... works perfect for what it to be used for.....  would buy from the seller again also...</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this shaving brush for me after my present brush starting losing bristles.  I&#x27;m very happy with it as it lathers up well and holds water ensuring a smooth,  close shave.  I heartily recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price! I&#x27;ve experienced few loose bristles and it has a nice touch.  I have since bought this as a gift, after liking mine so much.</li>
            <li> This old fellow (68) just started to &amp;#34;Wet Shave&amp;#34;.... bought the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and very pleased with it..... Plus the price was great.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for - a low cost brush that wouldn&#x27;t feel cheap or fall apart. I&#x27;ve just gotten into shaving with a brush and better shaving cream and it&#x27;s made a world of difference, even with cartridge razors (I&#x27;m hoping to eventually switch to a double-edge). I have less irritation and razor burn, and it really doesn&#x27;t take me as long as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I couldn&#x27;t justify 5 stars is that the brush does lose a bristle or two from time to time, which means picking them off my face after I lather up. For the price, I expected so much, and it really isn&#x27;t a big enough problem to make me want a different brush any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the brush with [[ASIN:B0007M4SOA Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s Coconut Oil Shaving Cream Tube 75g]]. I soak the brush in warm water while I shower, then dump the water and shake the excess from the bristles. With about 1cm of cream from the tube, it makes a great lather. I also picked up a cheap stand ([[ASIN:B001613S8I Kingsley Clear Shave Brush Stand]]) as I understand that drying it with the bristles down is supposed to prevent them from falling out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush.  He had been using a different brush for years and left it in a hotel during a business trip.  The badger hair is soft and provides great lather - much better than the previous brush.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived on time and works great. Fair price point for a solid product. Will be ordering another one in the future for a Father&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple weeks ago as a starter brush.  Will def upgrade to a better brush later down the road, but for the price, it is a great starter brush. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Good price for a starter&lt;br /&gt;-Works really well. Bristles are a little rough, but it IS a Pure bristle, which means they use any part of the badger, not the softest bristles.&lt;br /&gt;-Holds a lot of lather and water&lt;br /&gt;-Badger smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t last forever. There are higher grade brushes that reek of badger when you first get them, from what some have told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Shed quite a bit first use, but that is acceptable from what I have seen. But it still sheds 2 or 3 every time I use it.</li>
            <li> After many shaves is still stiff and loosing pieces.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is strong ( no more loose badger hair creeping up the nose). Creates a rich lather with ease. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s 2nd brush and he loves it!  It works great with all shave creams and creates a smooth lather.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lathers pretty well and does its job. Only complaint is consistent with others that it loses a hair or two minimum per shave.</li>
            <li> Washed the brush lightly and the smell no longer bothers me. Only the second brush I own but well worth the price from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying this is the first and only shaving brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so perhaps all shaving brushes are like this:  I found that the bristles are too long. When wet and full of shaving cream, the brush works more like a paintbrush - It just smears the shaving cream on my face, which I can do with just my hand. To get the brush to do what I think it&#x27;s supposed to do - work into my whiskers and exfoliate a little, I have to grab the base of the bristles with my fingers to make them shorter and stiffer.  Also, be prepared for a musky smell, especially the first few times, presumably from this being badger hair. When rinsing the brush after shaving, the water would run brown. I guess the bristles aren&#x27;t washed very well before assembly.  The bristles rinse clean now, after a couple of weeks, but there&#x27;s still a musky smell.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the scent is there.</li>
            <li> Great affordable brush. It has great quality. I have purchased two. The first one I have had and used regularly for several years. (The other was purchased for a friend). I&#x27;m still using my original one for regular use.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush I&#x27;ve bought, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all getting a rich lather or applying it to my face.  I&#x27;m not sure if paying double or triple will make a difference because I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but if you want to try out a badger brush and don&#x27;t want to break bank I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Working very well so far for the few first shaves. Makes things so much easier when using a safety razor. One negative is that it has lost a few bristles on first few shaves but that could be normal....well see.  Otherwise a good brush.... Recommended</li>
            <li> The brush was a gift to my step-son. He was delighted to receive it as he has wanted a badger brush for&lt;br /&gt;sometime.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, exactly as described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brush. I have gone through many brushes over the year and even thrown one or two out while they were new. This brush has become the most used. I always have two brushes on the counter to rotate them every day. The brush is not too stiff or soft a great in between stiffness. I am finding myself using this brush almost everyday.    For those thinking of starting to use a brush take a lesson that I learned the hard way. A sale person remembered that I had bought the same brush a year earlier and asked why I needed another one. I told him it had starting to shed hairs. I told him how I used everyday and left it on the counter sitting on it&#x27;s base (as it is in this picture above.) He gave me a cheap plastic stand to have the fur/hair facing down after a good rinsing and said I should think about buying another brush to rotate if I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a really good brush however the first couple weeks there was a lot of oder it was very very musky it even got to the point that I washed it with some of my wife&#x27;s scented shampoo but the only thing that helped was time after a week of use it got better and then after two weeks it was almost gone there were a few stray bristles in the beginning however now the brush is wonderful I would give it 5 stars if the brush did not have such an overpowering smell at first but for the money it was a good buy</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, shipping was fast and quality is excellent for the price. Normally I don&#x27;t review things but as I am new to shaving with a safely razor I have decided to make a hobby of it. This brush is great at mixing up the lather to just the consistency that I prefer.</li>
            <li> very soft picks up water well, and lathers great with a good shaving soap like proraso, and the price is great for a badger brush.</li>
            <li> This is like by father&#x27;s old shaving brush.  It&#x27;s super soft and pliable with very good bristle retention.  It looks like  it  will last for a good long time.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Within two months of purchasing this brush the bristles started to fall out like a German Shepherd shedding it&#x27;s coat for the summer. It got so bad I was tempted to use it on my head in an effort to look like I was growing hair back on my bald head.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, and does the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to the wise; if you don&#x27;t know how to season a brush, jump online and find out. Then, make sure you do it, with this one. The water from the first wash on mine actually turned brown and murky, and the brush actually did smell like badger. Not a little, but more like I&#x27;d just shot one and thrown it in the back seat of my car. Three wash and rinse cycles later, and it&#x27;s down to acceptable levels, and it&#x27;s now sitting overnight with a full load of lather. These things are supposed to have a smell to them, at first, and I know this. I&#x27;m just saying that the dirt and funk on this one was noticeably high. Otherwise it seams like a good value.  Four stars.</li>
            <li> Just as I ordered &amp; he loves it!!!</li>
            <li> on time. good, real product. what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, exactly as advertised, reasonable price. I would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little too sharp for my skin. It&#x27;s an okay brush, but I have used better brushes,</li>
            <li> Great brush that is holding up nicely.  First time safety razor user and this one started me off right.  Fully recommended.</li>
            <li> OK, in the end I find that synthetic shaving brushes are actually softer and more effective.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Fantastic lather with very little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Sheds very little and is soft.</li>
            <li> Good performance for the price but did lose a lot of bristles initially even with careful handling.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for as a starter brush.  Not expensive, but it does the job.  There was a little minor shedding the first few days, but that has pretty much stopped.</li>
            <li> Good brush, natural badger hair.  It will make your shave cream last longer - generates a great lather from a small amount of your favorite shave cream.  Fast shipping from Perella&#x27;s and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Feels pretty darn wonderful.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as promised. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Having never used a badger brush in the past, I was expecting it to be initially softer.  The more you use it however, the softer it gets.  It&#x27;s also very durable as I have yet to see it lose any strands and I&#x27;m not gentle with it by any means.  No regrets, I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the product I will buy again</li>
            <li> Great brush, Great price</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I bought the badger shaving brush because I couldn&#x27;t find the beaver hair shaving brush my barber used to tell me about. I don&#x27;t know where he got it, but he used to always say he preferred rubbing beaver on his face than that darn badger brush. So far this one has shed a little, but not too bad. If it doesn&#x27;t last long I will come back and tell everyone they are horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving, and recently decided to dump the Gilette Mach $$$ and switch to a safety razor. Bought the Escali brush as I didn&#x27;t want to spend a huge amount of money initially on a brush, and it seemed like a good deal. And as it turned out, it was. Shipping was very prompt. Produces a good lather (using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream), and while it did lose 7 or 8 bristles upon first use (and a couple during each of the next few shaves), it no longer sheds. Very happy overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I originally wanted to purchase an inexpensive brush because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to stick to using it and I did not want to invest in a &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; expensive brush --I figured that if I stick to it, I&#x27;ll just purchase a better one later on. But let me tell you, I think I&#x27;ll buy this one again if, and when, my first one needs replacement. I&#x27;m a big believer in taking care of things no matter the price you paid, and with that said, if you take care of this &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; brush, there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t last you for years --like I said, it&#x27;s been 4 years since I&#x27;ve purchased mine, and it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great brush for the money.  A few hairs fell out on the first couple uses, but it stopped soon after that.  It&#x27;s soft and works well.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the money!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush. I&#x27;ve always heard good things about them but wasn&#x27;t about to buy one for cheap Gillette shave cream. So once I bought a better shave cream (kiss my face) i figure it was time to step up. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect with it being pretty inexpensive, but after reading all the great reviews I ordered it. Very glad I did. A couple of pumps from the shave cream and it completely lathers my face. I can run over my face with the electric razor once, and still able to re-apply several times if needed. A simple rinse under the sink and it&#x27;s clean and ready for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend getting a brush stand so it drys upside down to prevent the bristles from losing shape.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  It creates a very nice lather and applied a nice even coat of shaving soap/butter.  The bristles hold their shape and don&#x27;t fall out during use.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush with zero defects. Only problem which may be normal is that the hairs tend to come loose(only a few at a time) and stay on my face in the lather, possibly lessening the quality of the shave; requiring an additional pass or two. Still pleased with the output and performance of the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rambo</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Even though it&#x27;s very cheap for a Badger brush, don&#x27;t let the price fool you. The brush doesn&#x27;t shed horribly, and has actually done a good job so far.</li>
            <li> Well made brush that holds up well, lathers up the soap well, and is well made. Nice price point, too.</li>
            <li> I just started DE shaving so I wanted to get some decent equipment. This brush was highly recommended, so I tried it. The bristles fall out every time I use it and are all over the soap and your face. I would invest in something better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good item. Still getting used to it. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it all.</li>
            <li> Good size, fit and finish. It did shed a very slight amount and had a hint of a smell at first. Soaked it and used it and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> No surprises, seems like good quality</li>
            <li> Superb product at a very reasonable price. Application of shave creme is easy and thorough. I recommend it highly. As a result...shaving is quick and simple.</li>
            <li> A cheap badger brush. No badger funk whatsoever. This one is soft and fits in the hand comfortably. It is a bit of a hassle to clean at times. The hairs REALLY hold a lot of soap!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Looks and feels good, great cheap brush but the hair did start to fall out little by little after the first use.</li>
            <li> After breaking in this brush - involving about a week of picking loose badger hairs out of my shave mug - this brush settled down into regular use with no complaints. I would recommend this to friends as a good beginner brush if they&#x27;re new to shaving with traditional shave soaps and razor or straight edge. Pros - price (mine cost under 10 USD), real badger hair, compact size, dries well in down position. Cons - not as soft as some other badger hair or synthetic brushes, handle is light weight wood (would prefer a bit more heft), packaging is unremarkable for gifting purposes.</li>
            <li> Got this brush after using a large Omega boar brush.  The first thing that I noticed is that the brush is much smaller than my Omega 48.  The good news is that the brush fits into my stainless steel brush/razor stand and looks really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the brush is great.  It loads quickly, lathers well, and rarely loses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend as a first badger brush, or first brush in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to dry bristles-down with a stand or hanger!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for over a year now and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  Price is great, quality great, and service was great!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have used! Shipped very quickly. As described.</li>
            <li> The lather from the brush is amazing!  Shaving is no longer a chore.</li>
            <li> I had been using a synthetic shaving brush from the Art of Shaving for years, and when finally I lost it while traveling, I decided to try a badger-hair brush as a replacement. Unfortunately, the Escali brush has several downsides compared to my previous go-to: 1) it&#x27;s scratchy; 2) the hairs are already loosening after only a few uses; 3) most importantly, it smells like a badger. Seriously, when you soak the bristles in warm water, it&#x27;s impossible not to feel that you&#x27;re brushing your face with a bedraggled forest creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the ethical concerns about badger treatment, I have no hesitation saying: Go for synthetic.</li>
            <li> Works great, I am very pleased with how much lather this is able to create from so little cream. I am glad that I paid for this higher quality brush and would buy one again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item last July and my husband absolutely loves it. He has asked on more than one occasion if it was Honey Badger hair as that would make it that much cooler if it were.</li>
            <li> Soft, holds hot water longer. Feels good.</li>
            <li> Badger hair feels good on face. Did have some hair come out, but was expected.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than i was expecting but very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> As my first brush, i have nothing to compare it to. So far i love it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just transitioned to the wet shaving, and Escali brush definitely plays a big part in making it a positive experience.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Provides a wonderful lather (once I actually figured out the correct water-to-soap ratio) every time. Docked one star simply because the brush does tend to lose hairs in the soap cup, but for the price I don&#x27;t see how you could beat this quality.</li>
            <li> Comfortable handle, bristles make a great lather.  Bought another for travel use,</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, delivered when promised. Would definitely purchase another product from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Haveing not used a brush in many years,.I took a chance with the glowing review.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the brush did look the part,Lathering up showed it&#x27;s atributes, poor!!.&lt;br /&gt;As for silky smooth appication ,rough as wisk broom !!!&lt;br /&gt;Or hedghog.&lt;br /&gt;  Mr. Lou.</li>
            <li> Brush is holding up well. Bristles are a little rough. Over all happy.</li>
            <li> Just recently went back to the old double edge safety razor because the disposal razors are just way to expensive. Also started to using the old shaving soap and brush. I ordered the Escali brush as a back up brush to one I had already purchased and paid 3 times as much for. I was surprised on receipt of the brush finding it was as of good of quality as the first one.  I highly recommend the Escali for the price and quality..</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new Escali badger shaving brush.  It is not the first Escali brush, and I hope it will not be the last.  My old Escali brush provided many years of comfortable, efficient application of shaving soap.  Like my face, the old brush was beginning to show the effects of tempus fugit.  As long as I am able to shave, I plan to do so with an Escali bruch.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after a dozen uses. Thoroughly disappointed!</li>
            <li> It came on time, it is OK, has an animal odor I hope it will go away as I keep using it</li>
            <li> This shaving brush should last for quite some time. So far it&#x27;s holding up pretty good .</li>
            <li> What an incredible change in shaving.  My great grandfather used one daily, and I always wondered what it was like.  No more cans of shaving cream for me.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is quite as soft as the one I tried in The Art of Shaving store, but at 20% of the cost it is an excellent value.  It did have a bit of an &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; smell to it, but I guess that lets me know it&#x27;s genuine and the smell went away after a few shaves.  Seems to be very well made, only lost a few bristles.  Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Mine is great.  Some bristle loss at the beginning, but stopped after the third rinse.  I just leave a little shave-soap in mine, squeeze it into a point and leave it standing pointed up in the cup.  Feels good and makes a nice lather in the cup or on your face.</li>
            <li> Loses a lot of bristles early on, but after a few months of use, it is a rare occurrence. Holds moisture and shaving soap well.</li>
            <li> Great brush, very durable and it feels very nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with bristles falling off as some reviewers described. Maybe they got a defected product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this shaving brush.  I decided to rinse it before use, and couldn&#x27;t believe how dirty the rinse water was.  I had to wash and rinse it several times before it rinsed clean.  It sheds a lot too!  It leaves 3-4 bristles in my soap bowl and another 3-4 on my face with each use.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical or not, but it seems excessive to me.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> The ad stated that it creates great lather, this is totally incorrect I would not recommend this brush to anyone. I was very disaapointed as the brush and the ad do not do what they say they do.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush...I might might buy one or two more soon!</li>
            <li> Outstanding shaving brush.  Received as advertised and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Well made; no issues.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is of a very high quality and feels very nice when spreading the lather when I&#x27;m shaving. Got to my place of residence within a reasonable time and was very pleased with the package it came in. And even had instructions on how to properly take care of it. Like never leave standing up (which I used to). Overall a very good buy if you&#x27;re looking for a nice shaving brush. It&#x27;s badger fur, it&#x27;s going to be soft.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful brush.  I am having fun getting to know how to use it properly</li>
            <li> excellent product and the price was right!  Perfect for travel use.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for several weeks now and can attest to it&#x27;s quality. Great value and great product!&lt;br /&gt;No need to pay 5 times as much for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Great little badger brush. Shipped quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> If you have a boars hair shaving brush please good it on the garbage. Spend the $13 and get this brush!!! All badgers hair is very soft and supple, it feels like cashmere. It lathers superbly and its an ease to rinse. If you never owned a badgers hair shaving brush because of its high dollar price tag....start with this one!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is fine to get as a starter, but I lose about 10 hairs every shave. It&#x27;s a pain to pick them off of my face and out of the sink, and after a few more months there probably won&#x27;t be much of this brush left. It&#x27;s decently soft but maintains some prickliness, I just wish it would stay together. Maybe I just got a defective one? I&#x27;d like to try another one to see if mine is just defective, but I think I&#x27;ll just buy a slightly nicer brush instead.</li>
            <li> The brush works well for an even lather. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is hair coming out in the soap during the shave.</li>
            <li> You want to feel like a man, man? This will add 5,000 man points to your man bank. Everyone knows that badger hair is chuck full of anti-oxidants and testosterone. It will leave your skin feeling like Clint Eastwoods voice. I would have given it 6 but it&#x27;s not honey badger, but good luck killing one of those suckers.</li>
            <li> My fiance said it worked really well and helped reduce cuts from shaving.</li>
            <li> excellent. a bit smaller than I expected but nicely made and I am very satisfied with this purchase..</li>
            <li> Hello fellow wet shavers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush back in August when I chose to dive right into wet shaving. I use this brush along with a Merkur long handled DE razor. When I bought this brush it was only $10. Keep in mind that although this is a great starter brush it sheds like crazy! After almost half a year of use I am ready to upgrade to a better quality brush. In the end do not expect too much. It is great for the money but it has it&#x27;s drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> It keeps losing bristles every use.  I don&#x27;t like to find them in my soap when I lather up.</li>
            <li> To be honest the shaving cream I got with my razor does not appear to be the best product to try this brush out with. I can comment the brush is soft and seems elegant. I suggest buying a holder to hang it upside down. In the packaging it states to *not* stand it up as seen in the photo when wet.</li>
            <li> Super happy with the brush! I agree with others that there is a slightly offensive odor at first, but it fades after a few weeks of use.  Not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. For the price could not get a better brush.  Seller was fast and convient to deal with.</li>
            <li> No complaints; it is great for the money. It holds lather well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose many bristles. I imagine there are more luxurious ones out there, but this product was just as described.</li>
            <li> Soft, well put together, and generates a fair lather.</li>
            <li> This is a high-end product with low and affordable price. Very soft and easy on face.</li>
            <li> This was my first badger brush and I noticed right away that when rinsing it after shaving, the rinse water was brown colored.  Since this was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; badger brush, I was patient and eventually there was no more color loss when rinsing.  I then noticed that the brush was losing bristles with each use - on the order of a dozen or more at first, and now - after several months of use - it still drops 6-10 bristles per use.  I held the brush up and purposely plucked any bristles that were noticeably longer than the rest; wow, I gently removed over a dozen with very little effort.  I hope this is not a typical issue with badger brushes as I do enjoy using it - just don&#x27;t enjoy dealing with all the loose bristles and wondering what the results from my next shave will be.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some comments about how these brushes can smell out of the box, and yes, this one had a mild scent to it out of the packaging, however after the first use it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles, comfortable in the hand, the wood handle is a nice touch, bristles spread evenly, retains water (depending on how you view that, it could be a con) unless you shake / wring it out. It does hold lather very well once you get it built up. Very attractive design in my opinion. The finish on the handle is as shiny as the photo indicates, and the gold ring is a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Some of the hairs came out on the first use (~8-12), more on the second use (~5-8), basically none on the third and consequent uses (maybe one or two). The loss of hairs isn&#x27;t noticeable and does not impact the use of the brush. Takes a while to build a lather on the soaps I have. Again, this may be a reflection on MY SOAP not the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4/5 stars is just due to the fact that on the first use, a bunch of bristles came out which gave me a negative first impression. As stated, however, this stopped and my impression has since reversed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush was exactly what I was looking for at a cheaper price than I anticipated. The &#x27;cheaper&#x27; price, however does not reflect a cheaper quality. This will get the job done, and well too... just make sure you squeeze out the final rinse water, and try to sore it bristles down hanging from something. It does hold water well, and I&#x27;ve had to fluff the bristles out a bit to ensure it dries properly.</li>
            <li> Hairs fall out constantly on every use, doesn&#x27;t feel like it creates a good/thick lather.  Not that happy with this.  I know most are, but maybe it was the way mine was manufactured (I&#x27;m not ignorant, I know that can happen).</li>
            <li> It is kind of coarse at first but softens up quickly. great shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Disclaimers:  1. First time buying a shaving brush at all, so I&#x27;m not going off previous experience and basically chose this brand/company blindly; and 2. Wasn&#x27;t used to shave a man&#x27;s face but woman legs, so I might (somehow) be using it wrong or differently from what you&#x27;re gonna use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses a couple hairs each session but specifically a couple; it doesn&#x27;t appear to be falling apart as others have reported.  There&#x27;s at least one small knot of bristles that may have been from applying it too hard the first couple times, or I just didn&#x27;t notice when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, the packaging gives the impression that there&#x27;s a magical, wonderful City of God that sells high-quality badger brushes on endcaps like they&#x27;re potato chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed another reviewer&#x27;s tip and bought some velcro and applied one side to the bottom so it can dry brush-side down; through a couple uses since then and it hasn&#x27;t failed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied with the quality for the price--and definitely after looking at the price of others, will likely buy this kind again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. I will buy all my shaving supplies from this company. Good brush and good value for the money. Seems like it&#x27;s gonna last at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush.  It is very soft and creates a nice thick lather.  A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Soak in hot water for a few hours, then lather and leave for a few hours before rinsing and using.  This will tame the natural odor and soften before first use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I screwed a small eye hook into the butt of the handle and a small hook in the top of my linen closet so that it hangs brush down to dry properly.&lt;br /&gt;3.  To use, I use a small glass to soak the bristles in hot water while I shower.  Shake it once to clear the water, then use one pump of shaving cream into your palm and lather with the brush.  Rub over the area to be shaved, alternating circular and downward strokes to coat all sides of the hair.</li>
            <li> Its a great brush if you are just starting into DE shaving. It&#x27;s value for money. Expect it to last couple of years till you master lathering and shaving technique.</li>
            <li> I really love how this brush loads up. I really haven&#x27;t noticed any loss of bristles. Works as it should and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. A half dozen or so hairs fall out every time my boyfriend shaves with it... Also, most brushed result in using less shaving cream, but this brush actually requires more than normal. Yes, it is cheap...but still not worth $12.</li>
            <li> I really like this little brush. it feels comfortable and makes really great foaming action. I must say it did smell kinda funky the first couple of times i used it. I don&#x27;t know if its because its real badger hair or what. Maybe they could of cleaned them better haha. The smell went away after i washed it with warm water and soap. Another small thing was that the brush part fell of the handle. I was bummed out but then i just put super glue and left it over night. Sure fixed my problem</li>
            <li> It really sheds in the beginning... Hoping it will stop soon, will update after more use and broken in.</li>
            <li> Excellent product will order again when needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Vary nice and worth the money</li>
            <li> This shaving brush broke in very fast. As a new wet shaver, I do not have anything to compare it to, but it works very well with the 2 soaps that I use --- Arko and Pre-de-Provence --- lathers well in the can with minimum water, and holds sufficient lather for a 3 pass shave. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Well-made brush, perfect for making prepping the face for a really great shave!</li>
            <li> Ok, this was for my husband but according to him it is great.  He loves it !  No problems here !</li>
            <li> Q. Why did God create badgers?&lt;br /&gt;A. To grow the perfect fur for these shaving brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased four of these little beauties at a great price.  Used one for myself to replace a worn-out, drug-store brush.  The other three went into the Christmas stockings of the sons-in-law (&amp;#34;My Three Sons&amp;#34;).  They love them, and are now shaving in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are a bit on the prickly side for the first few shaves, then soften up just enough to be comfortable and work that lather into the beard.  Perfect size, holds up well (no loss of bristles), no odor.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush and I will definitely come back when I need a replacement</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush. I love it. Will most definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving, awesome valued brush. Minor shedding fairly standard with this quality of brush. As far as an beginer brush with quality and value couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brush.  My husband and sons are very happy with this brush; good quality at a good price which is hard to find these days!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush for the cost.  The bristles are soft and create a great lather with very little shaving cream.  I like to use the Proraso cream in a tube and only use a small dab, about the size of a nickel, and it goes a long way.  This brush is also a bit more forgiving with the amount of water used to make lather than the more expensive brushes I have used in the past.  The brush did smell a bit &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; when I first got it, but that wore off after a few shaves.  I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve owned but seems to be really high quality.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months.  No issues really.  It sheds hairs every once in a while, but not excessive.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Its a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft bristles, creates a great lather.  The badger fur is much better than the horse hair brush I had prior.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a funky smell, hoping that goes away with use.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush, and I can&#x27;t imagine what more could be offered by other brushes that cost twice as much or more. It feels great against my skin; not too rough, but not too soft, and it holds enough water to create a perfect lather. It sheds a bristle or two on occasion,  but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is about par for the course. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product, the price,  and the company in general!</li>
            <li> Brush is very comfortable to use and feels great on my face. I purchased two additional brushes to give out as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> We have purchased much more expensive brushes than this one. However, I will continue buying this one as it&#x27;s been just as good!</li>
            <li> I really thought i was going to get a crap product based on the price. but honestly its great. Lost a few hairs upon first few uses (to be expected). The brush has really softened up. Lost that badger smell (ha ha) after the first week or so. Love it. Truly a great value. Doesn&#x27;t look too bad either</li>
            <li> My husband uses this brush about every other day and has done so for 7+ months. It has held up great and is very good quality. He has experienced no coarseness or shedding. He recently bought one to include in a dirty santa gift because he loves it so much. He uses Taylor of Old Bond shave cream and a Merkur safety razor, and has a little metal stand to hold the brush and razor on when not in use. I think the stand makes a big difference in how long the brush lasts, as it allows the bristles to dry well and in a downward position so water drips off and doesn&#x27;t pool at the base.</li>
            <li> This was hard to fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving brush was hard to find so excited when I found this one.  Mu husband is very pleased, brush is soft, lathers well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, quite soft, great with creams, great price.</li>
            <li> Arrived as pictured and on time.</li>
            <li> Decent brush. Fits the Escali Deluxe Chrome Stand very well.&lt;br /&gt;This brush, however, is too soft for me. I prefer a bit firmer bristles.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that dealing with USA Vitamins was great. The brush I received had a defective coating on the wood. USA vitamins customer service was friendly and quick to send me a replacement brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works well. Very few lost hairs. Creates a rich lather. Very little smell that goes away quickly. I use it daily and have no complaints. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my hubby for Christmas.  He&#x27;d never shaved with a brush before..I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll ever go back. He loves his brush..great lather and feels great!</li>
            <li> Good quality and value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush a few times so far and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Brush has held up well and has not lost any bristles yet. [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product. Really good quality and very soft. It rinses easily and it does not shed</li>
            <li> A great price on a great product. My new go to.</li>
            <li> After recently switching to the big leagues of shaving, with natural shave soap/cream and a safety razor, I needed a good brush to complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I used a brush that was included in a package I bought from The Art of Shaving. That brush was rather frail, and lost it&#x27;s shape after only a week and a half, despite the fact that I would hang it upside down to dry, as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for this brush mostly on price, but I have been very, very pleasantly surprised so far. The bristles feel amazing as you lather, they&#x27;re both soft and invigorating. It works up a perfect lather, they key to a good shave. And when you finish with it and have rinsed it, it&#x27;s very easy to get it back to it&#x27;s original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a good badger brush for the right shave, look no further!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush that I purchased. On first use it shed a few hairs but other than that it was great. Extremely comfortable and created a great lather. I have never had a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush. It&#x27;s lost a few hairs but that&#x27;s to be expected so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me. It&#x27;s soft and helps to make a nice lather. I like the wood handle. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain for what I paid. The product is of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I will say it loses bristles a good bit but the price is right.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ever shaved with brush and regular razor before, but I love the feel of both and the low cost! This brush is great on my face, and arrived very fast. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Product ! By far the most luxurious shaving brush I have ever had... just a joy to use each morning.</li>
            <li> Minimal hair loss when i first started using this. (Just a couple hear and there) now its broke in and works great...lather up nice and feels good in my head and face.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed. I have sensitive skin, and this brush is just right; some brushes are too prickly. This one is soft, but stiff enough to give me a nice lather. It&#x27;s very well made, and on top of everything, it just looks classy.</li>
            <li> This is my very first badger brush as I delve into the world of shaving. I&#x27;ve switched over to my straight blades, shaving soaps, and this quality badger brush. I did not feel like paying top dollar for a \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand, as I was unable to discern quality, brand expense, marketing, etc. This brush provided the quality I was looking for, the smooth lather necessary to cut my not so shave-friendly facial hair, and the price that left it very financially viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely 5 star, and call me naive, but I cannot imagine what else you would look for in a badger brush that the Escali does not provide.</li>
            <li> Let me preface with the fact that most people&#x27;s complaints can be solved by running shaving soap through the brush 3 or 4 times prior to first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss - Lost 4-5 per use initially, but this slowed to a hair or two per use just like my last brush. I expect it will stop completely after a couple weeks of use, also like my last brush. You can easily see loose hairs that are protruding from the brush before you put it on your face - it&#x27;s nothing truly bothersome. Again, just wash it a few times pror to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Animal smell - No smell ever ends up on my face... besides, I use an aftershave (as you should). The brush itself had a tiny bit of a smell the first couple uses, but it washes away quickly (and is typical of affordable rushes). More expensive companies wash this smell out first. Personally, I&#x27;ll save $40 on a brush and just wash it out myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size - The same size as every brush I&#x27;ve ever owned and seen. Fits your generic brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture - very soft. If you get a coarse one, I recommend you return it for a replacement of the same brand. I did not have any coarseness issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability - I&#x27;ll have to report on this later, but please keep in mind there are a handful of steps to PROPERLY care for a brush. Most people who only get 6 months out of a brush are not properly handling it during use.</li>
            <li> Badger brushes have always been my favourites;  I decided to get one for my husband, who had last year gone from those god-awful shaving foams to real soap, but had only bought himself a cheapy brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I had to use it too &#x27;just to test it&#x27;.  &#x3D;D  It really creates a nice, smooth, foam and glides beautifully.  Time for my legs to get one as well!</li>
            <li> The picture of this shaving brush does not do it justice.  Once prepped and ready to use, the brush expands into a wonderful, full head that lathers beautifully in just a few swipes.  The full badger is a definite step up from the mixed bristle (boar) brushes you typically find around this price point.  It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Recently in New York I had my first straight razor shave.  It was amazing.  I didn&#x27;t have to shave for days.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun for years, and never realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a close shave, so I decided to give the safety razor a try. I read that Badger hair was the softest, so I bought this brush. I&#x27;m not really in a position to compare brushes, but this seems fine.  I like the grip and wooden handle.  It&#x27;s soft, but not as soft as I thought it would be. It makes a good soap lather. I always notice a few badger hairs in the soap or on my face, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace my Art of Shaving badger brush.  I was a little worried that the quality would not be the same since the product was relatively inexpensive, but it works great!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, good value. Would give 5 stars if I had long term experience with this product. It&#x27;s lost a few bristles in the 1/2 dozen first uses, but this may just be the initial break-in..</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve been using a brush and shave soap for at least a decade or so. Once you try it you won&#x27;t go back to a can and your hand. The brush I use is this cheap thing I bought at a pharmacy somewhere during my travels. Red and white base, light bristles, don&#x27;t know who made it. Always worked very well. I decided it was getting old so I figured I&#x27;d try a new one. Since I paid about 5 bucks for it, I figured I was safe going cheap again. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not at all keen on this Escali brush. It sheds like my old cat and it&#x27;s bristles are about as soft as her fur. It&#x27;s workable when using tube soap (like Proraso) even though it gets all spread out on your face if you bear down even a little bit. It&#x27;s almost useless if you are trying to work up a lather with a soap puck in a cup (Williams Mug, good stuff). Not only that, but even though it&#x27;s supposed to be pure badger, I swear it&#x27;s losing color as well as bristles. Maybe it&#x27;s pure &amp;#34;dyed&amp;#34; badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also got an Art of Shaving travel brush that I paid a few dollars more for. I like that one a lot - properly stiff, no shed and a good feel on the whiskers. Too small for daily use, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m going to give it to an artist friend of mine - maybe he can get some interesting textures out of it before it loses the rest of its bristles.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is great, very reasonably priced, quality Badger hair, which is always stiff before warming up in hot water.  This brush loads the shaving soap very easily. In fact I use less soap than before with previous brushes....I have been using Taylor of Old Bond St shaving cream, which is pricey,  this brush just needs a little tap and twist into the soap and it loads extremely well.  This brush is definitely one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used since my shaving history since 1972..</li>
            <li> Good not great brush. Hairs are not packed tightly as a higher end brush, but good value.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I wanted to get an affordable one to see if I like this style of shaving. So far, it&#x27;s been great! It seems to lose a couple hairs here and there, but I really like using a brush. I use Col Conk Almond Shaving soap with this, and I have enjoyed each shave. It seems to really prepare the facial hair way better than applying a gel or cream by hand.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but the clear coat on the base of the handle has chipped off.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little brush. Soft beaver hair bristle are perfect for my sensitive skins. Thank you to the beaver that donate his hair for this brush and to the company the makes it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush.  It&#x27;s badger hair.  Makes you think, do they actually have a &#x27;ranch&#x27; with a bunch of badgers on them.  Badgers are primarily solitary animals so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that there is some shedding of the hairs when I lather up, which I don&#x27;t know is normal or not.  Either way, I&#x27;m not paying $30 for a brush when I can get one much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Received a shaving cream (for brush only) as a gift so I decided to buy this brush based solely on price.  I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed!  The brush works well (go to youtube for instructions on how to properly use a shaving brush) and is fairly sturdy.  I&#x27;ve had minimal brush hairs detaching but that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m not gentle at all.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month and it still works/feels/looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting a stand for the brush since I read that this greatly expands their lifetime and utility.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to lazy shaving again.</li>
            <li> New to the fancy double edge shaving world, so I can&#x27;t tell if this is an excellent brush.  I can tell you that it gets the job done, and builds up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> A very fine product, a better way to shave. Take some time and enjoy!  A good investment in self, trust me you are worth it.</li>
            <li> Found this brush in a search of Amazon. After seeing other badger hair brushes at costs up to 80$ I decided to buy this one because it was much less in cost. I am a believer in &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, but I cant imagine that the quality of the more expensive brushes exceeds this one. I mean really how much different could their brushes be. Is it what they feed their badgers?</li>
            <li> I use this brush daily to lather soap for shaving. I got it as a gift about two years ago, and I really prefer this method over shaving cream now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but using a brush and shave soap is way better than getting shaving cream all over my hands every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; quite a bit after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brush for a very good price.  Pure badger and no loss of hairs - very good buy,</li>
            <li> this thing STINKS. literally smells like a dirty wet dog, and sheds like one too!</li>
            <li> Good value. I follow the guidelines of drying brush upside down to avoid hair loss. Provides good and thick lather</li>
            <li> Junk.  I used this brush a total of 3 times.  3.  Each time multiple hairs shed off the brush while lathering.  And on the 3rd and final use, the brush itself came apart while I was rinsing it off.  Looks like the glue gave up and just pulled off from the wood handle in one big piece.  Not sure why the glue didn&#x27;t last.  I stored the brush upside down so moisture wouldn&#x27;t build at the base and compromise the glue.  New home, garbage can.  I just bit the bullet and ordered a silver tip brush for more money.  Here&#x27;s hoping that works out a lot better.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Soft bristles, holds water and lather well. No animal scent like others have mentioned. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and have no complaints at all. Shipped quickly. Would look to this seller again should I need something they have. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After years of shawing with commercial brands of shawing cream, I decided to try a natural shawing cream and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I&#x27;ve noticed during my first use of the brush is an intense unpleasant chemical smell. After a dew days of staying away from the brush, and going back to my old shawing methods, I used it again, only this time noticing that the brush is the source of the smell. I do not feel comfortable with it nor looking forward to shawing with it ever again.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to my &amp;#34;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&amp;#34; but was quickly disappointed after first use.  The brush left badger hair on my face and as i washed the brush it started shedding very quickly in my sink.  The hair can be pulled out very easily.  The brush is not usable for shaving because of the fact it falls apart.  Very disappointing.  I guess I should of expected the poor quality from the price point.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Hasn&#x27;t shed much as yet. Makes great lather. Seems to make a better shave with my double edged razor. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Just fantastic. Exactly what I need to love me myself</li>
            <li> Received the brush quickly.  Great brush.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush, great price.</li>
            <li> After decades of bad and uncomfortable shaves I bit the bullet and went to shaving with a double edge blade. So I got a complete outfit, including this brush. This brush has been something of a let down in every way but the price. It sheds hairs, and a lot of them, every time I use it. This gives me the sense the I am not getting the best shave I should. As soon as I am able I will try a more expensive brush to see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Product delivered promptly and is a pleasure to use.  No hesitation recommending this company.  Only annoyance is that occasionally a hair will come loose in the foam, or on my face.  Is that usual?</li>
            <li> This is a replacement and is so far working very well. Some bristles lost in initial use, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Very soft bristles and creates good lather. Love having it out by the sink in the Escali stainless steel stand.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!  Fast shipping and great item.</li>
            <li> Quality product at an affordable price. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice starter brush!! Nice quality and very good price. It shedded at first but not since but thats too be expected.</li>
            <li> Really decent little brush at an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday (a whole shaving set) for his birthday and he loves it!  It&#x27;s a really good quality best brush that offers an excellent shave as well as some exfoliation :)</li>
            <li> The brush is great quality and none of the bristles are falling out despite many, many shavings with it. It shipped quickly after I ordered it and it arrived quickly. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to break in but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Works for me--I use it with shaving soap (Paraso), and it does the trick.  I use it with a wet / dry razor and it all works good.  I only put a little water in the soap, and then swirl the brush.  Not the other way around, so I get a good covering that&#x27;s not too thick / thin for the wet / dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of hairs will come out from time to time, but no big deal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Just as I would expect. Great brush. I recommend putting it in warm water before you use it just to warm it up.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Better size than the previous one was I was using from a start up package. Was surprised to learn not to store it standing up. That&#x27;s something it said on the packaging. Anyway, I&#x27;m new to this kind of shaving and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews stated... Bristles falling out from day one and the handle fell off after a very short time. All I could do was LOL and kick myself as it all was right here in the feedback.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great.  Shaving with brush, soap and double edged razor just destroys the multi-blade cartridge shave.  This one is inexpensive and does the trick very well.</li>
            <li> I switched to shaving soap from commercial shaving cream years ago due to skin allergies. I decided to try a really good brush and some high-quality soap instead of whatever was available at the local drug store. I&#x27;ll never use anything but a Pure Badger Shaving Brush again. Love Col. Konk&#x27;s World Famous Rum Shaving soap as well. Rich, thick lather and a luxurious close shave. Also costs a lot less than shaving cream...even the discount brands.</li>
            <li> The brush works great however the fur was not properly cleaned. I rinsed the brush off and ran it in hot water before use however it still changed my white shave soap brown. It also still had the smell of the wild. Rinsed off my soap and gave the brush a good cleaning and worked fine. If you buy be sure to clean the brush real good before first use.  The brush was also smaller than expected, my other brush is allot bigger than this one. I don&#x27;t know which one I prefer more at this time. This one here provides more lather but small in size.  *Update, change rating to one. This is not a good brush unless you want to smell like a badger. No way to get the wild musk out, will stick to my old brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! It does a great job of making an even coat of soap. Definitely need a stand to help it dry, but it is a great addition to my grooming rituals!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li> Brush seperated from the handle after 2nd use worthless product save your money</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this brush is great.  Plenty of stiff bristles to whip up a nice lather, and they are in there for good!</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush. Overall I feel like it does a good job, feels good against my skin, and leaves my face ready for a close shave. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for the money. Works great, builds a really good lather. I can&#x27;t imagine what the really expensive brushes are doing that I can&#x27;t accomplish with this brush.</li>
            <li> Loved it very nice and soft lather was applied with ease</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this brush, a dark gray dye ran out of the brush and made the shaving soap grey.&lt;br /&gt;Is the dye carcinogenic ?&lt;br /&gt;Dyeing the brush dark grey, indicates that the bristles may not be Badger.</li>
            <li> Soft, supple and TOTALLY retro!  I just love watching my husband use this sweet little tool to shave.</li>
            <li> Very good basic shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Works well, soft and nice. Gives rich lather. But some hairs did come off in beginning. Now only a few comes off. Probably it is normal.</li>
            <li> Works well, priced right.  Have a beard, only a neck shaver. This smaller brush is just the thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush a couple weeks now and it is breaking in nicly.  It does have a bit of the badger scent but after a few uses that starts to wane. There also is minor loss of lose hairs in the first dozen uses this is minor consisting of a few hairs not strands so it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  Rinse and 2 good shakes in the sink and the brush is close to dry and maintains softness for the next use.  It is a good brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with them. The brush makes plenty of lather and hold its shape while drying in the attractive stand. I know they are attractive because my wife hasn&#x27;t complained about them detracting from the bath decor. Great combination.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this brush when I first got into straight-shaving.  I didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money on some fancy pants silver tipped badger brush, not knowing if I would continue using a straight razor.  Over a year has passed and, while I don&#x27;t straight shave very often any more, I use this brush ever time I shave.    Reading other reviews I expected to see some bristles falling out the first couple times I used it, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The first maybe 10 times I lathered up, I would lose 2-3 bristles each time.  I also noticed the distinct \\&quot;animal\\&quot; smell some other users reported the first couple times I used it.  Honestly, this is not a huge deal.  I still got a wonderful lather with very little effort and the animal smell is long gone.  If the animal smell turns you off, don&#x27;t buy a product made from the hair of an animal.    The important thing to remember is that you have to care for this product correctly.  Rinse it out VERY well BEFORE you use it for the first time.  Also, if you put it away wet with soap still in it, the brush won&#x27;t last as long for you.  Rinse it out and flick the water out of it when you&#x27;re done and it will last.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year of daily use and I don&#x27;t have any intentions of getting another one because I simply don&#x27;t need to yet. Although at less than $15, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this same brush again when I have to.    Those that complain about this brush and say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; must be used to spending (wasting) a ton of money on an expensive, top-of-the-line silver tipped badger brush. I&#x27;m not knocking you if you have that kind of cash to throw around on frivolous luxuries, but if you&#x27;re a working class guy like me, with 3 kids and a mortgage, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this brush.  You&#x27;ll get a better, more comfortable shave lathering up with a brush than you do with that canned s*** foam and your hand.  This brush is priced similar to boar&#x27;s hair brushes, which are ALL crap, so don&#x27;t torture your skin by trying to save a few nickels by buying one of them.    To summarize, this brush is WELL worth the small investment.  With proper care it will last you quite some time, all while giving you a great shaving experience.  I would also recommend that, while you&#x27;re shopping for shaving gear on Amazon, grab some good quality shaving soap or cream.  It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6 months into DE shaving and a VDH boar was my starter brush. The Escali is a huge step up in foam generating speed. I generate lather in a bowl, so bristle softness (or lack thereof) is not relevant for me. With a dab of Proraso cream, I can whip up the most luxurious lather in 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is quite well made - I&#x27;ve not lost any fibers bar some initial shedding during the 1st week of use. There was a very strong odor out of the box, but 5 washes with shampoo, conditioner and shaving cream, followed by a thorough drying took care of it. I hang it upside down (under my sink) and it dries out very quickly (much faster than the boar brush used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush runs on the small side, but considering the amount of lather it can generate, I don&#x27;t see the need of purchasing anything bigger. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I started using a DE razon for about a year and had been using the shaving cream in the can. I decided to try the shaving bar soap and bought this Escali. It&#x27;s cheap and nice to use. The smell has mostly wore off and is a bit more noticable when wet. At first, I thought it would smell like \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; based on some reviews here. Not really that strong. A few hairs fell of the first time I used it. Now, maybe one hair falls out every 4-5 uses. I let it dry upside down at least 24 hours before each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a neat space saving tip for drying if you don&#x27;t want to buy a metal stand for the brush. Go buy a square of sticky velcro like this [[ASIN:B00006IC2K Velcro Sticky Back Pre-Cut Squares, White (90073)]]. Attach the hooks part under the brush and attach the loops (fuzzy side) to the bottom of your medicine cabinet shelf. When done using the brush, you can just hang it, like a bat in a cave.</li>
            <li> Great brush especially for the price. I have used the Escali brush with my Jagger DE Razor for several years now.</li>
            <li> My husband is delighted with this shaving brush! No more plastic razors and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Gets nice and soapy and spreads the soap well.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely but feels lite.  I usually like a little weight but it does the job and seems to get the hairs up.</li>
            <li> Great brush. As advertised. Very fast and secure shipping. I definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush on a budget.  I ordered another budget brush which annoyingly shed badger hairs all over my face when trying to shave.  I replaced that cheapo brush with this one and have been very happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li> Horrible, the hairs falling apart!! No quality check!! Returned!!</li>
            <li> First of all, if you don&#x27;t have a shaving brush, get one right now! Otherwise you are wasting you money on good shaving creams (get a good shaving cream too if you aren&#x27;t using one!) and not getting nearly as good of a shave as you could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is ok. Ok backbone, no smell, but pretty scratchy for my skin. Looking back, I wish that I had gone to WhippedDog and purchased a silvertip badger hair brush for $26 from the beginning and not wasted my money on this brush - just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself (along with the merkur long razor). I have been using this for a month and it&#x27;s been as promised.&lt;br /&gt;(best endorsement i can give is that i have bought 2 more as gifts to my dad and father-in-law)</li>
            <li> I recently made the jump to DE shaving, and I am VERY glad I did.  One of the things I hated about shaving was using shaving cream from cans.  This brush revolutionizes shaving for me, and feels fantastic.  It has a nice wood handle, and the bristles feel great on my skin.  I just dab this once or twice into my Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, and then lather up on the lid, and brush and dab on my face.  I also purchased a hanger/stand so the bristles can dry facing downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, and shipping was quick and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!  Great brush.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it has a horrible smell</li>
    </ol>
