    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but so happy!</li>
            <li>Catalyst smells great!</li>
            <li>I am the belle of the ball, because the oldies are the best kept secrets!!</li>
            <li>My favorite!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE the price!!!</li>
            <li>I received the item on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Not like any of the good reviews or descriptions I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li>But how do you describe the smell of a rose?</li>
            <li>the person I bought it for really liked it.</li>
            <li>It was no surprise, to me, that this would be something great, because I was already familiar with the original Halston by Halston.  </li>
            <li>This surely would give the woman the attention she deserves.</li>
            <li>No doubt this is top notch quality.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Absolutely lovely scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powdery without being overly sweet, and dries own to a finish much more refined than it&#x27;s start.  </li>
            <li>love this products, many years ago I bought this $40.00 I liked it so much</li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this scent because I love the regular Halston cologne</li>
            <li>I just recently received an order of this beautiful one, Catalyst by Halston.  </li>
            <li>It was a really good New Years gift for my co-worker</li>
            <li>it was only $10, so I think I&#x27;ll get over it  though it would be great if anyone knows a reliable source for this scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of EDTs and EDPs online,and this rarely happens, but I understand it is a risk you run when your order a discontinued perfume--shelf life will vary, depending on the way the item was stored</li>
            <li>The previously bottles I received were good, but I can no longer recommend this vendor for this perfume.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, my sister asked, &amp;</li>
            <li>Not like anything positive</li>
            <li>some else wants it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more for Christmas gifts for other Co-Workers</li>
            <li>I have such a great respect and admiration for the parfumes of the past; they understood what it took to produce REAL quality fragrances.</li>
            <li>I used the classic Halston in the tear drop bottle for years, but this is just yummy...</li>
            <li>This is vendor is selling fragrance that has gotten old.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to all young women who want to set the mood in the room.</li>
            <li>, how old it was, and whether it was exposed to extremes of temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I got in the mail was in a sealed wrapped box, and still smelled old, or... something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of this fragrance for years, but this particular bottle had already gone over, and unfortunately, I cannot return it as it is classified as a hazardous material.and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on a journey, trying out fragrances which have been established at least 25 years or more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give the scent in general  4 stars, it&#x27;s just this one pesky shipment.</li>

            <li> For a Eau De Toilette Spray is wears like a Eau De Parfum and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> its very soft just use a little and people will ask you what you are wearing</li>
            <li> It is such an interesting floral, like violets and  magnolia tied down to a dry woods base, maybe sandalwood and amber with vanilla.</li>

            <li> It smelled so bad, it made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I thought I might like this, however never smelling it before, I hate it and will end up sending it to Goodwill</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite!!! LOVE the price!!!</li>
            <li> Bought in error but so happy! Everything happens for a reason</li>
            <li> I thought I might like this, however never smelling it before, I hate it and will end up sending it to Goodwill</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this scent because I love the regular Halston cologne but this is a heavier scent that smells like a cross between shampoo and celery.</li>
            <li> very specific a scent. But how do you describe the smell of a rose? Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Awful. Not what I remembered it to be. Threw away.</li>
            <li> stank, does not smell like the one I have been wearing for years</li>
            <li> This is vendor is selling fragrance that has gotten old. I have worn this for years and have gotten a bad bottle recently. It smelled so bad, it made me feel sick. The previously bottles I received were good, but I can no longer recommend this vendor for this perfume.</li>
            <li> My lady co-worker loves this Catalyst perfume by Halston  it was a Birthday gift to her later I will buy more for Christmas gifts for other Co-Workers</li>
            <li> I used the classic Halston in the tear drop bottle for years, but this is just yummy...that is all I can say.  Folks always comment and ask me what I am wearing.  It is spicy and alluring...and who can believe it at this price.</li>
            <li> I received the item on time and in good condition.  Catalyst smells great! I would recommend it. It is not overpowering. For a Eau De Toilette Spray is wears like a Eau De Parfum and is long lasting. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to all young women who want to set the mood in the room. This surely would give the woman the attention she deserves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on a journey, trying out fragrances which have been established at least 25 years or more.  I just recently received an order of this beautiful one, Catalyst by Halston.  It was no surprise, to me, that this would be something great, because I was already familiar with the original Halston by Halston.  They both possess that depth, warmth, and floral sophistication!  The difference between the two, in my opinion, would be the herbal, mossy detection in Catalyst, versus the peachy, carnation blend in Halston.  No doubt this is top notch quality.  The first day I wore it, my sister asked, &amp;#34;What is that scent you have in your hair?  I love it!&amp;#34;  I have such a great respect and admiration for the parfumes of the past; they understood what it took to produce REAL quality fragrances. I am the belle of the ball, because the oldies are the best kept secrets!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this fragrance for years, but this particular bottle had already gone over, and unfortunately, I cannot return it as it is classified as a hazardous material.and can apparently only be shipped one way. I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of EDTs and EDPs online,and this rarely happens, but I understand it is a risk you run when your order a discontinued perfume--shelf life will vary, depending on the way the item was stored, how old it was, and whether it was exposed to extremes of temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was only $10, so I think I&#x27;ll get over it  though it would be great if anyone knows a reliable source for this scent.

I&#x27;d give the scent in general  4 stars, it&#x27;s just this one pesky shipment.</li>
            <li> the person I bought it for really liked it. It was a really good New Years gift for my co-worker</li>
            <li> love this products, many years ago I bought this $40.00 I liked it so much I search and found it at this price I got a couple, its very soft just use a little and people will ask you what you are wearing</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to go to a physical store and smell it there. What I got in the mail was in a sealed wrapped box, and still smelled old, or... something. My husband smelled it, said it was like a hospital smell. Not yummy. Not like anything positive I&#x27;d ever want to wear. Not like any of the good reviews or descriptions I&#x27;d read. Due to smell in bottle, I don&#x27;t want to try it on my body.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like my other bottle I had purchased a few years back. I will hold on to it just incase some else wants it.</li>
