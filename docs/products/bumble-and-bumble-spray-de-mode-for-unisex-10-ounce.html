            <li>OOOOH,,, I read sooo many great reviews before purchasing this hair spray and thought I was buying my holy grail hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky!</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product!  </li>
            <li>but I remember really loving the smell and the lightness of it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight on fine hair, great for setting &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;, and easy to brush hair after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>Have never been able to go to bed with hair spray in my hair because of the smell and itchiness until now.  </li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble is absolutely the best i have ever used and worth every penny of the cost.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE how it smells.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for over 4 years and love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>The perfect amount of control and yet freely allows hair to be natural.  </li>
            <li>Love this spray, lightweight and brush able but holds the shape you intend.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray</li>
            <li>I LOVE Amazon</li>
            <li>I have, however, read more and more reviews complaining about counterfeit products</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>I love this Bumble and Bumble hairspray.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair products - I have fine, oily hair and their products work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dont buy this if you are looking for a strong hold hairspray, or even a medium hold hairspray.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it would probably work for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it is just the right hold for my hairs.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this one for people with fine hair because it&#x27;s so light.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s free shipping)</li>
            <li>Light and not sticky but</li>
            <li>I have a really good hair stylist near me, but they do not carry Bumble and Bumble products.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for true hold but a touchable invisible finish, try the DIA spray instead.  </li>
            <li>It is a little heavier and much stickier than I remember but the smell is great and it is still lighter than many hairsprays I use.</li>
            <li>Very good hairspray that holds your hair in place all day but doesn&#x27;t make it hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>This hair spray does not mold my hair into place; it keeps my hair looking more natural but neater than without the spray.</li>
            <li>I would like a size smaller bottle because this is rather obnoxious to handle, but other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I like to use it right before heading out the door and gives my hair body.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I use a regular hairspray for the top of my hair (to hold the volume) and I spray this throughout the middle/ends.</li>
            <li>Would never use any other kind.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice little spray-gives hair hold,but it not super-duty like hold.  </li>
            <li>It controls fly-aways and really finishes off the look.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good, the only down side for me was the price.</li>
            <li>It really just makes your hair very soft and have some texture to it.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t believe the product is authentic, since it isn&#x27;t spraying right - it&#x27;s leaving white clumps in my hair - and isn&#x27;t lasting as long as it should.  </li>
            <li>I spray just a little of the DIA spray on top, underneath and in the middle and then use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling soft yet still controlled.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a frequent shopper.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>does it smell good, but once it has dried and a short amount of time goes by,  your hair feels very soft, but stays in play, unlike the old aqua net hairspray, your hair does not feel stiff or plastered to yourhead.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Unfortunately,,, I have fine (alot of it), straight hair and for some reason,,, this just did NOTHING for it....</li>
            <li>One star left off due to high price.  </li>
            <li>I dont find it bad or good</li>

            <li> Well, since I was a little short on cash and only wanted one (if you order 2 direct from B&amp;B</li>
            <li> but I usually order direct from B&amp;B.  </li>
            <li> Its not really meant to act as a hair spray that HOLDS your style in place.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble has other products for that.</li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon about two weeks ago and haven&#x27;t heard word one back yet.</li>
            <li> &quot; but you have to understand, this isnt your typical hair spray.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium in texture and slightly wavy</li>
            <li> It does hold a little bit and does have a slight sticky nature to it, but thats not what its meant for.</li>
            <li> I use it in my bangs to give them a little lift.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too stiff but holds the shape well.</li>
            <li> It has a flexible hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem was.  </li>
            <li> People have complained about the scent it has.  </li>
            <li> I hate to run out, because this is not easy to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> It arrived with the wrong size cap in a box where the cap had come off and 1/4 to 1/3 of the contents had discharged in the box.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the DIA spray as hairspray because it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> Nothing will come out.&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me,, ended up giving it away to my boyfriend&#x27;s mother who has curly hair.  </li>

            <li> The Bumble and Bumble Hairspray is some of th ebest I hve used.  Not onl does it smell good, but once it has dried and a short amount of time goes by,  your hair feels very soft, but stays in play, unlike the old aqua net hairspray, your hair does not feel stiff or plastered to yourhead.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, this hairspray!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OOOOH,,, I read sooo many great reviews before purchasing this hair spray and thought I was buying my holy grail hair spray.  Unfortunately,,, I have fine (alot of it), straight hair and for some reason,,, this just did NOTHING for it.... made it limper, didn&#x27;t hold the style,, and almost made it fuzzy.  I was so disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me,, ended up giving it away to my boyfriend&#x27;s mother who has curly hair.  She loves it though!!</li>
            <li> Have never been able to go to bed with hair spray in my hair because of the smell and itchiness until now.  Bumble and Bumble is absolutely the best i have ever used and worth every penny of the cost.  I am in my seventies so i have literally used almost every hair spray ever made.  Would never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, the only down side for me was the price.</li>
            <li> I know this is called \\&quot;hair spray\\&quot; but you have to understand, this isnt your typical hair spray. Its not really meant to act as a hair spray that HOLDS your style in place. It really just makes your hair very soft and have some texture to it. It does hold a little bit and does have a slight sticky nature to it, but thats not what its meant for. I use a regular hairspray for the top of my hair (to hold the volume) and I spray this throughout the middle/ends. It controls fly-aways and really finishes off the look.    Dont buy this if you are looking for a strong hold hairspray, or even a medium hold hairspray. Bumble and Bumble has other products for that. But not spray de mode.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in years but I remember really loving the smell and the lightness of it. It is a little heavier and much stickier than I remember but the smell is great and it is still lighter than many hairsprays I use.</li>
            <li> I am happy.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair products - I have fine, oily hair and their products work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I love it!!!! I have very fine hair, and it is just the right hold for my hairs.  Leaves it feeling soft yet still controlled.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products but this is the only spray I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s very light so you can just spray all over and I LOVE how it smells. I like to use it right before heading out the door and gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray on the market and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 4 years and love it, love it, love it.  Lightweight on fine hair, great for setting &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;, and easy to brush hair after using.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product!  I hate to run out, because this is not easy to find locally.  The perfect amount of control and yet freely allows hair to be natural.  I would like a size smaller bottle because this is rather obnoxious to handle, but other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this spray, lightweight and brush able but holds the shape you intend. One star left off due to high price.  Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice little spray-gives hair hold,but it not super-duty like hold.  People have complained about the scent it has.  I dont find it bad or good</li>
            <li> Lightweight hold that tames your hair withou making it look like it is molded together. I use it in my bangs to give them a little lift. When the wind hits my hair, my hair moves like hair should, not like a sheet of hair. Bangs look neatly wind-blown but still have the lift. I can spray this all over my hair and then brush my hair later and my hair still retains some hold. This hair spray does not mold my hair into place; it keeps my hair looking more natural but neater than without the spray.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray but I usually order direct from B&amp;B.  Well, since I was a little short on cash and only wanted one (if you order 2 direct from B&amp;B it&#x27;s free shipping) I decided to order from Amazon.  It arrived with the wrong size cap in a box where the cap had come off and 1/4 to 1/3 of the contents had discharged in the box.  Furthermore, I don&#x27;t believe the product is authentic, since it isn&#x27;t spraying right - it&#x27;s leaving white clumps in my hair - and isn&#x27;t lasting as long as it should.  I complained to Amazon about two weeks ago and haven&#x27;t heard word one back yet. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I LOVE Amazon and I&#x27;m a frequent shopper.  I have, however, read more and more reviews complaining about counterfeit products and I believe that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot for this and it plugged up after a short while.  I did everything I could to get it unplugged. Nothing will come out.&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointing.</li>
            <li> Seriously...it&#x27;s the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. Light and not sticky but at the same time it holds curls and styles.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent hold yet pliable. Received package on time. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> Moved from a city where my salon used Bumble and Bumble products.  I have a really good hair stylist near me, but they do not carry Bumble and Bumble products.  I was elated to find that I can have it shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too stiff but holds the shape well. Keeps hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I love this Bumble and Bumble hairspray. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 years and wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else. It has a flexible hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff. I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Very good hairspray that holds your hair in place all day but doesn&#x27;t make it hard and crunchy. This is the only hairspray will ever use! From now on!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Bumble and Bumble Does It All spray over this one.  This one has almost no hold at all.  I use the DIA spray before using the curling iron and my waves stay all day (with the addition of Nexxus Comb Thru hairspray before I head out the door).  I don&#x27;t use the DIA spray as hairspray because it&#x27;s so expensive and I&#x27;m conserving it by using it only for styling.  This hairspray did nothing for my hard-to-hold hair.  My hair is medium in texture and slightly wavy so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem was.  I recommend this one for people with fine hair because it&#x27;s so light.  It would never work for an updo because it has no grip.  I was so unimpressed, I returned it to Sephora and exchanged it for another DIA spray.  I spray just a little of the DIA spray on top, underneath and in the middle and then use the curling iron.  I get waves that last into the next day with no buildup.  If you&#x27;re looking for true hold but a touchable invisible finish, try the DIA spray instead.  This one was a loser for me.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with my hair type.  Like I said, it would probably work for fine hair.</li>
