            <li>I bought two of them and am very satisfied</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied by this product</li>
            <li>the guys who sell it are saint :)</li>
            <li>Now I have my favorite Wisdom tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>People, the medico-dental industry does NOT want you to be able to benefit from something like this.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to search for more toothbrushes like this one.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to purchasing many more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean again!</li>
            <li>root cavities develop easy as pie.</li>
            <li>They make your gums strong.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is hands down, the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>though shipping from the UK, they arrived so quickly!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the handle change, it&#x27;s the best toothbrush since Rite-Aid discontinued their 99-cent Firm brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes, they remove tea stains and people are noticing my smile</li>
            <li>Hence, this product isn&#x27;t available in US stores.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush for those who want a really firm one.</li>
            <li>so if you are smoker without any doubts buy it because it worth it!</li>
            <li>I tried to find a product that would help to clean it up, and found this one.</li>
            <li>Reviews are saying that this product helps to clean that type of the problems, so I decided to give a shot.</li>
            <li>This Toothbrush is fantastic furthermore it was delivered very fast from UK</li>
            <li>thank you Wisdom LTD for making my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They clean well and really make you teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>these are not possible to buy in USA, but they really do a much better job  than the wimpy ones available here.</li>
            <li>but wait was all worth it.</li>
            <li>They were exactly as advertise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky with my teeth!</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the brush, I&#x27;m referring the company to my friends.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope it lasts because I will only keep a toothbrush for about four months and then will buy more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>After using it for two weeks, I am finding that my teeth got very white, and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I think the people are right about us not being able to buy a firm toothbrush to keep us in the dentists&#x27; offices paying huge bills..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to feel the scrubbing action removing coffee stains and such.</li>
            <li>Further, this product is so cheap that it worth of trying.</li>
            <li>Honest to God, when used correctly (which isn&#x27;t hard at all), they are designed to clean teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>was looking for a good hard toothbrush, but this is too stiff and something about the bristle density didn&#x27;t do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>If this one wears out and gets soft, i will certainly buy more next time.</li>
            <li>The items were better than expected.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>is much brighter.  </li>
            <li>That is so fast.</li>
            <li>This is a product that is much needed by others as well as myself.</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I use it GENTLY at the gum line to floss.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, you can find almost everything on here.</li>
            <li>The seller is really fast on the shipping, too.</li>
            <li>Brushing up and down on my teeth and gums for over 75 years with a hard toothbrush has kept my teeth in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean like your last cleaning.  </li>
            <li>For those who have longed to find the good, old fashioned hard bristle item, this one is the real McCoy.  </li>
            <li>I just received it and the first use completely removed stains that have plagued my teeth for years and years.  </li>
            <li>Only soft bristled brushes seem to be available in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>Should have a little more brush to it</li>
            <li>I will order a few more again.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a few more to keep as spares, at work and for traveling.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably something else they tell you here to buy a new toothbrush in a month.</li>
            <li>It cleans the stains from my teeth, especially after eating certain foods.&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
            <li>If they have a soft bristle toothbrush, by all means, buy that!</li>
            <li>This is a Extra Hard Brush, says it right on the top of the package</li>
            <li>Very hard, watch your gums, it was too hard to me, but use it as a cleaning too, Lol!</li>
            <li>I bought it to aid in removing OLD rust from assorted items.</li>
            <li>Using the soft toothbrushes of today is like trying to brush with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Root exposed and the roots do not have enamel which is a tooth&#x27;s natural protection again decay.</li>
            <li>I try not to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I think the combination of the smokers tooth powder and the extra hard brush have made my mouth so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the old fashioned straight handle, but perfection is generally not within anyone&#x27;s reach.  </li>
            <li>I alternate it with my regular brush, and use this strong one perhaps every other day.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed,  I wanted a hard brush for a long time to really clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>If this was available to me my whole life, I guarantee I would have never experienced dental caries.  </li>
            <li>Compared to Reach&#x27;s hardest bristle brush, this baby will scrub your gums off if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Although it still holds the head at the same angle, the new handle is a bit &amp;#34;clunky&amp;#34; in my small hand whereas the old one was very streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last dental appointment, I am 37 years old, was last year and no cavities.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to clean a stubborn Molar that I have trouble brushing the scum that accumulates.  </li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed to clean a stubborn Molar that I have trouble brushing the scum that accumulates.  </li>
            <li> one toothbrush would really last a long time.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with the smaller ones, but loses its rigidity quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Pricey and a long wait (from England)</li>
            <li> A hard toothbrush is good for one thing, no two things only...cleaning dentures and the dirty grouting in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I finally found toothbrushes that actually function, unlike the limp facsimiles found in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I like extra hard bristles on my tooth brushes and this meets that criterion; I prefer it to the Lactona brand which I also purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s harder than what you are cleaning....</li>
            <li> Think of scrubbing a bar of soap with something harder than the soap...</li>
            <li> I went to my stomatologist half year ago, but recently found that one of my teeth is covering up with dark surface.</li>
            <li> Now your teeth are not as soft as soap but they ARE softer than hard toothbrush bristles, working together in a repetitive motion, back and forth...back and forth.</li>
            <li> All right so, I am not sure why firm or hard toothbrushes were taken off the market.</li>
            <li> It is not harder than other hard toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other &amp;#34;extra hard&amp;#34; toothbrushes; none of them compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a terrific toothbrush for folks who like genuinely hard bristles.  </li>
            <li> but recently I found out from my dentist that I shouldn&#x27;t use a hard brush on my teeth since it damages your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a hard toothbrush and haven&#x27;t seen one here in the states in over ten years</li>
            <li> Hard to find this type of &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; in regular stores.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;is not&amp;#34; a Firm brush, it is Hard, makes a Firm brush feel soft.</li>
            <li> have only ever used hard, firm or extra hard toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The brush is very hard and I am cautious about removing tooth enamel, so I only use it once every other day (in the morning after my tea), and using a medium brush other</li>
            <li> Firm toothbrushes are hard enough to find.  </li>
            <li> If you are having trouble finding a hard toothbrush at Wall-greens, Rite Aid or any of the regular places you once bought your &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34; toothbrush, this is it.</li>
            <li> Delivery slow, toothbrush less firm than I expected.</li>
            <li> I like it because the bristles are firm.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle that is not available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> No more dark surfaces.</li>
            <li> I wanted the really stiff brushes but can&#x27;t seem to find them online.</li>
            <li> I usually order mine online.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry if we&#x27;re not able to get them again...</li>
            <li> Just the FIRM I like!</li>
            <li> Bristlles are not spaced properly...and it is too hard.  </li>

            <li> THIS is the toothbrush for exercising your gums! (Use a softer toothbrush for your teeth if you fear wearing their enamel.) I have tried all the other &amp;#34;extra hard&amp;#34; toothbrushes; none of them compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to the wise: In the latest batch I received, Wisdom Addis has slightly changed the handle (which was perfect in every way). Although it still holds the head at the same angle, the new handle is a bit &amp;#34;clunky&amp;#34; in my small hand whereas the old one was very streamlined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the handle change, it&#x27;s the best toothbrush since Rite-Aid discontinued their 99-cent Firm brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Wish we could buy them in the USA</li>
            <li> Firm toothbrushes are hard enough to find.  I usually order mine online.  Now I found this, and never plan on looking any further.  Leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean like your last cleaning.  Well, almost.</li>
            <li> The items were better than expected. They were exactly as advertise.  The best yet and I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> An Excellent product and a good value...</li>
            <li> This is a Extra Hard Brush, says it right on the top of the package (if you cant read it). If you are having trouble finding a hard toothbrush at Wall-greens, Rite Aid or any of the regular places you once bought your &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34; toothbrush, this is it. It &amp;#34;is not&amp;#34; a Firm brush, it is Hard, makes a Firm brush feel soft. Great handle, good grip. My teeth feel clean again!</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes, they remove tea stains and people are noticing my smile is much brighter.  The brush is very hard and I am cautious about removing tooth enamel, so I only use it once every other day (in the morning after my tea), and using a medium brush other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though shipping from the UK, they arrived so quickly!  I am definitely impressed with the service and the product!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific toothbrush for folks who like genuinely hard bristles.  Only soft bristled brushes seem to be available in drug stores.  For those who have longed to find the good, old fashioned hard bristle item, this one is the real McCoy.  Those who prefer a &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; handle will be pleased with that also.  I prefer the old fashioned straight handle, but perfection is generally not within anyone&#x27;s reach.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I like it because the bristles are firm. Can feel the brush doing the job, in fact, ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It cleans well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to let everyone know I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my Wisdom Addis toothbrush!First off, it arrived from the UK just six days after I ordered it.That is so fast.Secondly,the toothbrush is excellent.I think the people are right about us not being able to buy a firm toothbrush to keep us in the dentists&#x27; offices paying huge bills..The plaque seemed to be removed and it is like flossing without flossing.Before my teeth would feel like I just used my finger to brush them.Thirdly,my teeth were noticeably whiter after three uses!I do smoke,drink  espresso and red wine!I want to order ten of them so I don&#x27;t have to worry if we&#x27;re not able to get them again...I get the feeling one toothbrush would really last a long time.That&#x27;s probably something else they tell you here to buy a new toothbrush in a month.I don&#x27;t think you will need to with this incredible Wisdom Addis!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed,  I wanted a hard brush for a long time to really clean my teeth. I chew tobacco and it definitely does the job especially where I want on the front bottom inside teeth. I&#x27;m really picky with my teeth!</li>
            <li> I loved to find this type of brush through Amazon.  I looked for this kind of tootbrush all over the stores, pharmacies, etc., It was great to find it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to clean a stubborn Molar that I have trouble brushing the scum that accumulates.  This is a product that is much needed by others as well as myself.</li>
            <li> I like extra hard bristles on my tooth brushes and this meets that criterion; I prefer it to the Lactona brand which I also purchased at the same time. I&#x27;m very happy with the Wisdom Addis Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very hard, watch your gums, it was too hard to me, but use it as a cleaning too, Lol!</li>
            <li> I wish these were the real hard ones. I wanted the really stiff brushes but can&#x27;t seem to find them online. These are good for most people however I am used to the ones they sell in Africa.</li>
            <li> these are not possible to buy in USA, but they really do a much better job  than the wimpy ones available here.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this to brush my teeth. I bought it to aid in removing OLD rust from assorted items. It helps a little with the smaller ones, but loses its rigidity quickly. It is not harder than other hard toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> Delivery slow, toothbrush less firm than I expected.</li>
            <li> Brushing up and down on my teeth and gums for over 75 years with a hard toothbrush has kept my teeth in excellent condition.  Using the soft toothbrushes of today is like trying to brush with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Pricey and a long wait (from England) but this is the real deal. Compared to Reach&#x27;s hardest bristle brush, this baby will scrub your gums off if you&#x27;re not careful. Hence, this product isn&#x27;t available in US stores. Not ADA approved. I use it GENTLY at the gum line to floss. It seems to have helped whiten my teeth a bit too.</li>
            <li> I finally found toothbrushes that actually function, unlike the limp facsimiles found in the pharmacy. They are great.</li>
            <li> This Toothbrush is fantastic furthermore it was delivered very fast from UK so if you are smoker without any doubts buy it because it worth it! I&#x27;m really satisfied by this product the guys who sell it are saint :)</li>
            <li> Bristlles are not spaced properly...and it is too hard.  Doesn&#x27;t do a good job for me.</li>
            <li> The tooth brushes (hard) met my requirements. I will order a few more again. I have been looking for someone in London to buy them. No one could help but when I searched Amazon, my problem was resolved. Now I have my favorite Wisdom tooth brushes. Thanks to Amazon, you can find almost everything on here.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush for those who want a really firm one. Be patient in getting it as it does come from England and takes awhile. I bought two of them and am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very hard bristles like I wanted to get the hard to reach plaque in between dentist visits, however came very late.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle that is not available anywhere.  I just received it and the first use completely removed stains that have plagued my teeth for years and years.  I think the combination of the smokers tooth powder and the extra hard brush have made my mouth so fresh and clean.  People, the medico-dental industry does NOT want you to be able to benefit from something like this.  If this was available to me my whole life, I guarantee I would have never experienced dental caries.  Wine, cigar, tea and coffee stains, gone !</li>
            <li> Theses are the hardest brushes  I have used. You cannot get them here, so you have to order them from the UK. They clean well and really make you teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth really good but recently I found out from my dentist that I shouldn&#x27;t use a hard brush on my teeth since it damages your teeth.</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these. They make your gums strong.</li>
            <li> About time that a toothbrush feels like it is cleaning your teeth.  Should have a little more brush to it but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is hands down, the best toothbrush I have ever used. I had been looking for a hard toothbrush and haven&#x27;t seen one here in the states in over ten years so I researched and found this brand in the U.K. Not only do I love the brush, I&#x27;m referring the company to my friends. Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> To do daily brushing of dentures. Removes stains that soaking will not remove with denture cleaners. If this one wears out and gets soft, i will certainly buy more next time.</li>
            <li> was looking for a good hard toothbrush, but this is too stiff and something about the bristle density didn&#x27;t do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> All right so, I am not sure why firm or hard toothbrushes were taken off the market. I do not believe that its because there is a concern for people to lose tooth enamel. I just think there was in fact a decline in people being seen by dentist and dentistry wasn&#x27;t doing well. Mind you dental coverage is extremely expensive, which is so sad. Almost nothing if fully covered and its so frustrating. I find people that tell me horror stories all the time about people losing teeth, decay and sometimes even their lives because of the fact that they can&#x27;t afford a dental visit or procedure.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 40 and have never in my life had a cavity, never! My last dental appointment, I am 37 years old, was last year and no cavities. The dentist told me my teeth were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I have only ever used hard, firm or extra hard toothbrushes. I have no tooth decay, cavities and no tooth enamel loss. I will continue to search for more toothbrushes like this one. This one was perfect used it this morning. Let&#x27;s hope it lasts because I will only keep a toothbrush for about four months and then will buy more. So, I purchased two (2). I am looking forward to purchasing many more thank you Wisdom LTD for making my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to feel the scrubbing action removing coffee stains and such. I alternate it with my regular brush, and use this strong one perhaps every other day. A friend told me about it and I&#x27;m so glad she did. The seller is really fast on the shipping, too. Good product! Thank you</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for. No store carries hard bristle toothbrushes anymore. I will be purchasing a few more to keep as spares, at work and for traveling.</li>
            <li> I do not own this toothbrush nor would I EVER recommend one like it. I don&#x27;t know where some of these reviewers get their information, but no one is hoping you don&#x27;t get a hold of this weapon so that you don&#x27;t get cavities, it&#x27;s because it can actually CAUSE cavities. And I&#x27;m not talking just tooth decay, I&#x27;m talking actual cavitations of the enamel and tooth structure. I am a dentist and have been practicing for 15 years. A hard toothbrush is good for one thing, no two things only...cleaning dentures and the dirty grouting in your bathroom. Why?..because it&#x27;s harder than what you are cleaning....your teeth. Think of scrubbing a bar of soap with something harder than the soap...what do you get?...lines. Now your teeth are not as soft as soap but they ARE softer than hard toothbrush bristles, working together in a repetitive motion, back and forth...back and forth. There is even a name for this condition and every person that comes out of dental school knows it: TOOTHBRUSH ABRASION! This is not to even mention what it does to the gums! They have NO chance. GONE. Root exposed and the roots do not have enamel which is a tooth&#x27;s natural protection again decay. So guess what?...root cavities develop easy as pie. So, please, PLEASE do NOT purchase a hard bristle toothbrush. Nothing against this brand or anything. If they have a soft bristle toothbrush, by all means, buy that! Honest to God, when used correctly (which isn&#x27;t hard at all), they are designed to clean teeth thoroughly. Not to preach here, it&#x27;s just that whomever wrote a review accusing the medical/dental profession of wanting you not to use these so that you GOT cavities couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It took longer to receive as it was mailed from UK..but wait was all worth it. I have one at home and one at work, using twice a day keeps my teeth bright and shiny...all that coffee that I drink all day.....</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Why are hard toothbrushes so difficult to find. It cleans the stains from my teeth, especially after eating certain foods.&lt;br /&gt;Great! Should come in packs of 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> Just the FIRM I like! Will buy again and again! Hard to find this type of &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; in regular stores.</li>
            <li> I went to my stomatologist half year ago, but recently found that one of my teeth is covering up with dark surface. I tried to find a product that would help to clean it up, and found this one. Reviews are saying that this product helps to clean that type of the problems, so I decided to give a shot. Further, this product is so cheap that it worth of trying. After using it for two weeks, I am finding that my teeth got very white, and looks healthy. No more dark surfaces. I try not to use it frequently.</li>
