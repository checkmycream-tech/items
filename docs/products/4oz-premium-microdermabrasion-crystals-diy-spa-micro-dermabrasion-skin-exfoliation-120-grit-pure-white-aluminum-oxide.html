            <li>this microdemabrasion its very good, for the price i pay,keeps your skin looking bright and reste, i would definitely recommended</li>
            <li>First time to try this product, and it works great.</li>
            <li>It does leave my face feeling very smooth and polished</li>
            <li>Product arrived as stated and after using one time, my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Best Dermabrasion stuff I have ever used, Saves $175 facial at spa.</li>
            <li>great thing about this is you control how much microdermabrasion your skin will receive by the amount of crystals you add.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better.</li>
            <li>These crystals are a much better purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>All soften my skin on different levels but this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.</li>
            <li>Wish there was instructions to let me know if it&#x27;s okay to mix with cleansers ahead of time -</li>
            <li>The crystals are more like a dust and thinner</li>
            <li>I can use a microdermabrasion face wash out of Rite Aid and get better results.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin does look more buffed than before, so I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase more of these when I need them.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these crystals.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my favorite exfoliater by boots no.7.</li>
            <li>It is wayyyy better.</li>
            <li>But it just makes my face so smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>It is better than a scrub.  </li>
            <li>if it get into your tear duct - it can cause more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this so much,please give it a go if you&#x27;re in my situation.</li>
            <li>(So, I&#x27;ve been told:-)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased any way what so ever with this product.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT -</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to chem peels in that it is more gentle</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>Very effective and gentle.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, they are very very fine, and they seem to be doing their job perfectly: exfoliate very well, my skin feels very soft after them.</li>
            <li>make up looks better and applies better on smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>This was not at all what I was expecting, it&#x27;s a fine powder, but I mixed it with a good cleanser and used a face brush to massage into the skin and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>They also rinse off easily and you won&#x27;t get crystals stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily &amp; leaves skin in silky condition.</li>
            <li>crystals may be too fine for some individuals.</li>
            <li>These crystals are too fine.</li>
            <li>They  great on pretty much every body.  </li>
            <li>the crystals are incredibly fine and leaves my skin SMOOTH</li>
            <li>Great to mix with daily cleanser for exfoliation...</li>
            <li>&quot; I can get a light or heavier abrasive quality.</li>
            <li>This assists in keeping my face smooth as I use exfoliant products which produce light flaking and this helps combat that.</li>
            <li>You will see a smooth shiny surface afterwards,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the C. Booth microdermabration green apple scrub and that stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>It leaves the face smooth and  glowing.</li>
            <li>Immediate results, my face was SO smooth just after one use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may not be good for dryskin or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The skin is getting very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I just add a pinch of the very fine crystals to my facial cleanser and make my own scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my skin will look in the long run.</li>
            <li>They are much more finely ground than the stuff in drugstore cleaning products, and will leave your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>so I see the jar lasting me a good while.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s chocked full of retinol &amp; NIA-144 for cellular repair.</li>
            <li>I like the company they seem cool.</li>
            <li>You can just pour some in your hand and mix in with a little water and you&#x27;re good, but you can use lotion, cleanser, whatever!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I will keep ordering this, It is always shipped quickly</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt smoother and after exfoliating, I find that my nightly skin cream is absorbed better and more deeply.</li>
            <li>(Garnier Nutritioniste has one, as well L&#x27;Oreal men&#x27;s scrub), but i like that with this, you can use as much or as little as you need, and with your own favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I use Cetaphil lotion to keep my skin moist &amp; if I&#x27;m going outside an amazing sunblock is a MUST.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t found many exfoliating cleansers or microdermabrasion scrubs that really feel like they&#x27;re doing much exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>This is a bargain and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Three fingers worth of granules is plenty.</li>
            <li>it looked like it had absorbed into the cleanser, but you have to mix it in well.  </li>
            <li>This product works great with a multitude of facial cleansers and really makes a huge difference when you use it with one of the facial scrubbing devices.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use as little or more as I need.</li>
            <li>Considering the quality this is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These crystals are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>If used daily, some dryness, so be sure to moisturize afterwards and wear sunscreen whenever you do peels and or exfoliation methods.</li>
            <li>Really like these!</li>
            <li>I have used many exfoliating products from different brands.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else that I have used all my entire life.</li>
            <li>These do exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My skin did feel soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>as of right now I do really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean and soft after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>These microdermabrasion crystals are perfect, you use as much or as little as you want - after i&#x27;ve wet my face, i dip in a damp finger and work it in circles all over my face then add on my foamy cleanser and rinse the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li>I either cleanse my skin and just use the crystals on their own or use with black soap or another cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft .My</li>
            <li>Okay, so I will say I tried an entirely new skincare routine when I began using these, so maybe the results aren&#x27;t totally attributable to the crystals.</li>
            <li>Works more effectively than an expensive dermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>And if you want to make an even more economical scrub, you can just use the crystals with regular soap, although I&#x27;d recommend a gentle facial soap like Dove or maybe Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it too much</li>
            <li>Actually makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Lots of product for the money and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The really held up under face wash and water not disentegrating at all.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPMENT,</li>
            <li>Used twice weekly, very efficiemt.  </li>
            <li>I like to give my face a good exfoliation at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I like this particular product because you can really control how much product you use.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a warming cleanser that really opens up your pores for a deep clean.)</li>
            <li>Product works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin test it first before using.</li>
            <li>I add this to a little liquid facial cleanser and create my own high quality, economical, and non-irritating body exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use as little or as much as I need with MY face wash.  </li>
            <li>These crystals will give a decent exfoliation when used alone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then you run the fine crystals on wrinkles or aged spots then rinse.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is any smoother than just using my normal body scrub and/or loofah, but</li>
            <li>I do feel that my face seemed smoother than the normal scrub I use on my face.</li>
            <li>When I first got it in the mail, I was worried I&#x27;d go through it very quickly because its so small.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin very soft and do not irritate.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive &amp; every week to 10 days my routine is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if they are as high quality as IQ Natural</li>
            <li>May want to purchase a higher end cream though if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>It takes such a small amount for amazing results.</li>
            <li>50% Peel Gel easily penetrates your skin to exfoliate layers of dead skin cells that dull your complexion to immediately expose a clear, softer, more radiant face.]]  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone with discoloration, large pores, or acne.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li>B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>My skin is sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>(It should be noted that I have sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li>A word of caution if you&#x27;re the sensitive skin type like me.</li>
            <li>but when i used it i was plesantly surprised by how scuffy those crystals are.</li>
            <li>I use with caution, because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But so far no problems.</li>
            <li>I use it aout 2-3 times a week and follow with a sensitive skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I just mix it with my face soap and you can feel your skin getting soft.</li>
            <li>-it EVENED out my skin tone and made my face sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I swab on either a Ph neutralizer or just a mix of baking soda &amp; water to neutralize any acid left on my skin &amp; then do a cool water flush &amp; pat dry.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can add this to the cleanser I use on my skin already to add a little extra deep cleaning a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>For years I have mixed corn meal with my facial cleansers to clean the makeup and dry skin off my face.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you don&#x27;t get in your mouth, AL is not good for you.)</li>
            <li>They are fine enough to exfoliate but aren&#x27;t harsh at all.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and could be added to my lotion or soap, and though it looks like a small bottle, it lasted me a very ling time.</li>
            <li>the product is pure granules and expected some what creamier.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I was surprised by how little the jar was</li>
            <li>These crystals are the same as the ones that are used for a professional microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by how tiny the jar was</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 years old, not 45 suffering from age spots , Im a teen</li>
            <li>I barely have to use any makeup to cover up.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used once!  </li>
            <li>I use it mixed with coconut oil to a soft paste, every three or four days.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit of this mixed in to whatever cleanser you already use and have on hand, and BOOM - new skin altogether.</li>
            <li>At least to me this product isn&#x27;t gritty enough to leave my face feeling smooth like I like.</li>
            <li>I have read some people spend over $100 to have someone due this one time when what you really need is this which you can do daily if you like.</li>
            <li>These are very fine, not super rough -- I like a little rough-ness in my scrub</li>
            <li>It has a fine powder texture which I didn&#x27;t mind, but the scubbing itself is what sucks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews and ordered this small quantity as it does last a long time.  </li>

            <li> Best Dermabrasion stuff I have ever used, Saves $175 facial at spa.</li>
            <li> great thing about this is you control how much microdermabrasion your skin will receive by the amount of crystals you add.  </li>
            <li> These are so much better.</li>
            <li> These crystals are a much better purchase.</li>

            <li> I like this much better.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product.</li>
            <li> Wish there was instructions to let me know if it&#x27;s okay to mix with cleansers ahead of time -</li>
            <li> The crystals are more like a dust and thinner</li>
            <li> I can use a microdermabrasion face wash out of Rite Aid and get better results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin does look more buffed than before, so I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase more of these when I need them.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these crystals.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite exfoliater by boots no.7.</li>
            <li> It is wayyyy better.</li>
            <li> But it just makes my face so smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> It is better than a scrub.  </li>
            <li> if it get into your tear duct - it can cause more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this so much,please give it a go if you&#x27;re in my situation.</li>
            <li> (So, I&#x27;ve been told:-)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased any way what so ever with this product.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT -</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to chem peels in that it is more gentle</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> Very effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, they are very very fine, and they seem to be doing their job perfectly: exfoliate very well, my skin feels very soft after them.</li>
            <li> make up looks better and applies better on smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> This was not at all what I was expecting, it&#x27;s a fine powder, but I mixed it with a good cleanser and used a face brush to massage into the skin and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> They also rinse off easily and you won&#x27;t get crystals stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Rinses off easily &amp; leaves skin in silky condition.</li>
            <li> crystals may be too fine for some individuals.</li>
            <li> These crystals are too fine.</li>
            <li> They  great on pretty much every body.  </li>
            <li> the crystals are incredibly fine and leaves my skin SMOOTH</li>
            <li> Great to mix with daily cleanser for exfoliation...</li>
            <li> &quot; I can get a light or heavier abrasive quality.</li>
            <li> This assists in keeping my face smooth as I use exfoliant products which produce light flaking and this helps combat that.</li>
            <li> You will see a smooth shiny surface afterwards,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the C. Booth microdermabration green apple scrub and that stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> It leaves the face smooth and  glowing.</li>
            <li> Immediate results, my face was SO smooth just after one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may not be good for dryskin or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The skin is getting very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I just add a pinch of the very fine crystals to my facial cleanser and make my own scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my skin will look in the long run.</li>
            <li> They are much more finely ground than the stuff in drugstore cleaning products, and will leave your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> so I see the jar lasting me a good while.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s chocked full of retinol &amp; NIA-144 for cellular repair.</li>
            <li> I like the company they seem cool.</li>
            <li> You can just pour some in your hand and mix in with a little water and you&#x27;re good, but you can use lotion, cleanser, whatever!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering this, It is always shipped quickly</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt smoother and after exfoliating, I find that my nightly skin cream is absorbed better and more deeply.</li>
            <li> (Garnier Nutritioniste has one, as well L&#x27;Oreal men&#x27;s scrub), but i like that with this, you can use as much or as little as you need, and with your own favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I use Cetaphil lotion to keep my skin moist &amp; if I&#x27;m going outside an amazing sunblock is a MUST.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t found many exfoliating cleansers or microdermabrasion scrubs that really feel like they&#x27;re doing much exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> This is a bargain and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Three fingers worth of granules is plenty.</li>
            <li> it looked like it had absorbed into the cleanser, but you have to mix it in well.  </li>
            <li> This product works great with a multitude of facial cleansers and really makes a huge difference when you use it with one of the facial scrubbing devices.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use as little or more as I need.</li>
            <li> Considering the quality this is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These crystals are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> If used daily, some dryness, so be sure to moisturize afterwards and wear sunscreen whenever you do peels and or exfoliation methods.</li>
            <li> Really like these!</li>
            <li> I have used many exfoliating products from different brands.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else that I have used all my entire life.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> as of right now I do really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean and soft after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> These microdermabrasion crystals are perfect, you use as much or as little as you want - after i&#x27;ve wet my face, i dip in a damp finger and work it in circles all over my face then add on my foamy cleanser and rinse the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li> I either cleanse my skin and just use the crystals on their own or use with black soap or another cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft .My</li>
            <li> Okay, so I will say I tried an entirely new skincare routine when I began using these, so maybe the results aren&#x27;t totally attributable to the crystals.</li>
            <li> Works more effectively than an expensive dermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li> And if you want to make an even more economical scrub, you can just use the crystals with regular soap, although I&#x27;d recommend a gentle facial soap like Dove or maybe Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it too much</li>
            <li> Actually makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Lots of product for the money and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The really held up under face wash and water not disentegrating at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPMENT,</li>
            <li> Used twice weekly, very efficiemt.  </li>
            <li> I like to give my face a good exfoliation at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I like this particular product because you can really control how much product you use.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a warming cleanser that really opens up your pores for a deep clean.)</li>
            <li> Product works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin test it first before using.</li>
            <li> I add this to a little liquid facial cleanser and create my own high quality, economical, and non-irritating body exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use as little or as much as I need with MY face wash.  </li>
            <li> These crystals will give a decent exfoliation when used alone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then you run the fine crystals on wrinkles or aged spots then rinse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is any smoother than just using my normal body scrub and/or loofah, but</li>
            <li> I do feel that my face seemed smoother than the normal scrub I use on my face.</li>
            <li> When I first got it in the mail, I was worried I&#x27;d go through it very quickly because its so small.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin very soft and do not irritate.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive &amp; every week to 10 days my routine is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if they are as high quality as IQ Natural</li>
            <li> May want to purchase a higher end cream though if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount for amazing results.</li>
            <li> 50% Peel Gel easily penetrates your skin to exfoliate layers of dead skin cells that dull your complexion to immediately expose a clear, softer, more radiant face.]]  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with discoloration, large pores, or acne.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> My skin is sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> (It should be noted that I have sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> A word of caution if you&#x27;re the sensitive skin type like me.</li>
            <li> but when i used it i was plesantly surprised by how scuffy those crystals are.</li>
            <li> I use with caution, because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But so far no problems.</li>
            <li> I use it aout 2-3 times a week and follow with a sensitive skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I just mix it with my face soap and you can feel your skin getting soft.</li>
            <li> -it EVENED out my skin tone and made my face sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I swab on either a Ph neutralizer or just a mix of baking soda &amp; water to neutralize any acid left on my skin &amp; then do a cool water flush &amp; pat dry.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can add this to the cleanser I use on my skin already to add a little extra deep cleaning a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> For years I have mixed corn meal with my facial cleansers to clean the makeup and dry skin off my face.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you don&#x27;t get in your mouth, AL is not good for you.)</li>
            <li> They are fine enough to exfoliate but aren&#x27;t harsh at all.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and could be added to my lotion or soap, and though it looks like a small bottle, it lasted me a very ling time.</li>
            <li> the product is pure granules and expected some what creamier.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was surprised by how little the jar was</li>
            <li> These crystals are the same as the ones that are used for a professional microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by how tiny the jar was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old, not 45 suffering from age spots , Im a teen</li>
            <li> I barely have to use any makeup to cover up.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used once!  </li>
            <li> I use it mixed with coconut oil to a soft paste, every three or four days.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this mixed in to whatever cleanser you already use and have on hand, and BOOM - new skin altogether.</li>
            <li> At least to me this product isn&#x27;t gritty enough to leave my face feeling smooth like I like.</li>
            <li> I have read some people spend over $100 to have someone due this one time when what you really need is this which you can do daily if you like.</li>
            <li> These are very fine, not super rough -- I like a little rough-ness in my scrub</li>
            <li> It has a fine powder texture which I didn&#x27;t mind, but the scubbing itself is what sucks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews and ordered this small quantity as it does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> jar is small but the crystals are mighty and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It does the job - add it to Cetaphil, learning how to mix it with cleanser without wasting too much of the product as it is a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using a quarter size dollop of cleanser, using a small baby spoon to shovel out the amount I needed and then accidentally going straight to my face when the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; fell off -</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long but seems that the pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing to mildly irritate your skin, but another to irritate your poor eyes.</li>
            <li> The crystals are very small and non-abrasive, something I was worried about at first since it never stated what grit it was.</li>
            <li> After rinsing &amp; patting dry, I put on a thin layer of 30% Glycolic Acid &amp; let it set for 3-5 minutes, I rinse off my face in cool water, using a cotton ball</li>
            <li> Depending on how much I use and how hard I \\&quot;scrub\\</li>
            <li> WOW it&#x27;s been less that a week and the exfoliating power of these crystals really really removed the dead skin from the surface resulting in less red/pink pigmentation in my acne marks and in addition</li>
            <li> container was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals, has improved skin appearence dramatically in less than 1 week!</li>
            <li> did not live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> I like it, but was surprised how small it was.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it dissolves completely but have been wanting to try that.  </li>
            <li> I mix a little with my normal cleanser a few times a week to remove my dry skin.</li>
            <li> use the aluminum oxide mixed with Boscia Detoxifying black cleanser</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The small container will definitely last a long time as I use only a little at a time.</li>
            <li> One thing to be careful of, BTW, when using the crystals is NOT to get them in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I soap up my face and then  just wet my two fingers dip it into the jar and rub it on my face in a circular motion...for about three minutes..</li>
            <li> I only bought this as an alternative to save a bit of money, and it turned out to be a waste.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;now be careful with this material, ... if it goes to your eyes, forget it.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell that it&#x27;s removing the dead skin leaving  the smoother canvas below.</li>
            <li> This product when applied as suggested leaves my skin exfoliated as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried several exfoliants, from drugstore to expensive - the cheap kinds often have harsh sharp ingredients like the apricot pit ones, and the expensive ones are either not intense enough or don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> A little does go a long way once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i found this was the ingredient in my Lancome and after researching, i found it in a couple of other scrubs</li>
            <li> I use it every other day with my Neutrogena Wave (the one that spins); I dampen the tip of my finger then dip it into the jar to pick up the crystals, which I then apply to the Wave pad.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about using this exfoliate</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I see crystals sold by other companies</li>
            <li> I cleanse, use a pumpkin enzyme peel after I shower and then use only a small amount of these crystals to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, but only a little is necessary.</li>
            <li> and they help soften the skin as well as diminish scars and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I mix these crystals with Image Vitamin C Cream Cleanser to buff-up my face at least once per week - whenever my skin feels dry or rough.</li>
            <li> mix them with IQ&#x27;s crushed Acai Berry Scrub, a few Aspirin tablets and a little water for a POW in your face exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It was grade for my oily skin and cleaned out even my black heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Aluminum crystals that are in a cream base and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This little 1.5 oz jar of aluminum oxide crystals solves my problem.  </li>
            <li> I mix a little of this with my face cleanser</li>
            <li> I pour a little into the palm of my hand and add cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this by putting a nickel sized amount of almond oil into the palm of my hand and then add a bit of this; rub in little circle and wash it off.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in September 2012 and this little jar lasted over 1-1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way with these.</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh for me...</li>
            <li> My aunt is a dermatologist, and I&#x27;ve learned a few things from her</li>
            <li> i have found something comparable to my way too expensive Lancome facial exfoliant!</li>
            <li> I have paid for microdermabrasion treatments in the past - never again![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was way too harsh for my face and caused a slight rash.</li>
            <li> And I have all the neutrogena power cleaners, face scrubbers, and other expensive</li>
            <li> No more cakey makeup for me!</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for anyone serious about exfoliation.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t as bad as having acne obviously</li>
            <li> The plain crystals are too rough with out a cream base.  </li>
            <li> or you can make your breakouts worse or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little bottle of abrasive crap.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to mix yourself.</li>
            <li> I think those plastic microbeads are junk, and they are bad for the environment.  </li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome Microdermabrasion.  This is definitley commercial grade. It was grade for my oily skin and cleaned out even my black heads.&lt;br /&gt;It may not be good for dryskin or sensitive skin.  But I was looking for something to replace the avon stuff they took off the market.  Best Dermabrasion stuff I have ever used, Saves $175 facial at spa.</li>
            <li> These crystals are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  They exfoliate well.  You get to choose how much to use and the best part is getting to mix it with your own cleanser, so it is all in one step!  I would definitely recommend this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> this microdemabrasion its very good, for the price i pay,keeps your skin looking bright and reste, i would definitely recommended</li>
            <li> I like to give my face a good exfoliation at least twice a week.  It leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean and soft after rinsing.  But I haven&#x27;t found many exfoliating cleansers or microdermabrasion scrubs that really feel like they&#x27;re doing much exfoliating.  This little 1.5 oz jar of aluminum oxide crystals solves my problem.  I just add a pinch of the very fine crystals to my facial cleanser and make my own scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this is you control how much microdermabrasion your skin will receive by the amount of crystals you add.  And if you want to make an even more economical scrub, you can just use the crystals with regular soap, although I&#x27;d recommend a gentle facial soap like Dove or maybe Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is small but the crystals are mighty and a little goes a long way so I see the jar lasting me a good while.  One thing to be careful of, BTW, when using the crystals is NOT to get them in your eyes. Aluminum oxide is an irritant.  It&#x27;s one thing to mildly irritate your skin, but another to irritate your poor eyes.</li>
            <li> AT LAST i have found something comparable to my way too expensive Lancome facial exfoliant! i just put a bit of cleanser on my finger, dip it in the container a couple of times, and whatever sticks to my finger is all i need to scrub my face! it works like a charm. the crystals are incredibly fine and leaves my skin SMOOTH and therefore my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found this was the ingredient in my Lancome and after researching, i found it in a couple of other scrubs (Garnier Nutritioniste has one, as well L&#x27;Oreal men&#x27;s scrub), but i like that with this, you can use as much or as little as you need, and with your own favorite cleanser. i can&#x27;t say enough about this product. i&#x27;m giving it to my friends for gifts!!!!</li>
            <li> works well. crystals may be too fine for some individuals. Great to mix with daily cleanser for exfoliation...I recommend using with aveeno, mixed with 30 to 70% glycolic acid, to help exfoliation. Use as needed. If used daily, some dryness, so be sure to moisturize afterwards and wear sunscreen whenever you do peels and or exfoliation methods.</li>
            <li> I have used Aluminum crystals that are in a cream base and it is easy to use.  The plain crystals are too rough with out a cream base.  Too difficult to mix yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love the feeling in my skin!!</li>
            <li> This is a bargain and well worth the price. Just don&#x27;t use it too much or you can make your breakouts worse or irritate your skin. Every couple weeks I use it and have wonderful results. Try it on your hands too! It&#x27;s like an instant manicure. I&#x27;ve mixed the crystals with a regular facial cleanser or shower gel and you can use it almost anywhere</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried several exfoliants, from drugstore to expensive - the cheap kinds often have harsh sharp ingredients like the apricot pit ones, and the expensive ones are either not intense enough or don&#x27;t last very long.  These microdermabrasion crystals are perfect, you use as much or as little as you want - after i&#x27;ve wet my face, i dip in a damp finger and work it in circles all over my face then add on my foamy cleanser and rinse the whole thing off.  It&#x27;s easy, effective and just what i&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> I mix a little of this with my face cleanser and it makes my skin velvety soft. A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these crystals! For years I have mixed corn meal with my facial cleansers to clean the makeup and dry skin off my face. These are so much better. I pour a little into the palm of my hand and add cleanser. Depending on how much I use and how hard I \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; I can get a light or heavier abrasive quality. Absolutely the best! I have paid for microdermabrasion treatments in the past - never again![[ASIN:B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> Great product! Actually makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I like that I can turn a regular face cleanser into a scrub!  My aunt is a dermatologist, and I&#x27;ve learned a few things from her so I think these crystals are effective at microdermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  I don&#x27;t like those plastic &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; that companies have been putting in their cleansers and calling them &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34;.  I think those plastic microbeads are junk, and they are bad for the environment.  These crystals are a much better purchase.</li>
            <li> I can mix it with any cleanser and the amount of abrasion I want.</li>
            <li> I use this by putting a nickel sized amount of almond oil into the palm of my hand and then add a bit of this; rub in little circle and wash it off. My skin is sooooo soft. And it&#x27;s inexpensive! I love this product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this works great..I soap up my face and then  just wet my two fingers dip it into the jar and rub it on my face in a circular motion...for about three minutes..then rinse seems to be doing well...</li>
            <li> These crystals are the same as the ones that are used for a professional microdermabrasion treatment. They leave your skin very soft and do not irritate. They also rinse off easily and you won&#x27;t get crystals stuck between your teeth. Considering the quality this is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Really like these! They are much more finely ground than the stuff in drugstore cleaning products, and will leave your skin smooth and soft. I use with my brush, but that&#x27;s strictly for not-so-sensitive skin. (Make sure you don&#x27;t get in your mouth, AL is not good for you.)</li>
            <li> I loved the feel during application. It takes such a small amount for amazing results. Will keep this in rotation.</li>
            <li> Very nice results. The skin is getting very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This assists in keeping my face smooth as I use exfoliant products which produce light flaking and this helps combat that.</li>
            <li> This product works great with a multitude of facial cleansers and really makes a huge difference when you use it with one of the facial scrubbing devices. You will see a smooth shiny surface afterwards,</li>
            <li> I have used many exfoliating products from different brands. All soften my skin on different levels but this is one of the best. It&#x27;s very small, but only a little is necessary. I often over use exfoliating products because they lack enough scrubbing power but this is solely the exfoliants without any liquid dilution so you can use it however you want. All I need for my face is to dip my index fingers in once and use the crystals stuck on my fingers. I either cleanse my skin and just use the crystals on their own or use with black soap or another cleanser. It leaves my skin so soft. i have keratosis pilaris so I&#x27;m always looking or good exfoliating products. My doctor recommended a Neutrogena product with seashells to exfoliate however I found that ineffective and made my eyes tear for several minutes after using. I like this much better. My skin is noticeably softer and seems firmer after.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in September 2012 and this little jar lasted over 1-1/2 years.  I use it every other day with my Neutrogena Wave (the one that spins); I dampen the tip of my finger then dip it into the jar to pick up the crystals, which I then apply to the Wave pad.  I use Coral Actives benzoyl peroxide daily, and this polishes off any flaky skin that it causes.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!  I love the fact that I can add this to the cleanser I use on my skin already to add a little extra deep cleaning a couple of times a week. My skin has never felt smoother and after exfoliating, I find that my nightly skin cream is absorbed better and more deeply. The next morning my skin always looks refreshed. Lots of product for the money and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of a similar product from another seller, and was already convinced of its efficacy. I like this particular product because you can really control how much product you use. I typically open the jar, pump whichever cleanser I am using into my hands, rub it around like lotion, use the wetness to pick up the granules using my finger tips and then rub all over my fact. Three fingers worth of granules is plenty. I have noticed a smoothing of over all complexion. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with discoloration, large pores, or acne.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else that I have used all my entire life. And I have all the neutrogena power cleaners, face scrubbers, and other expensive lines.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this product, very fine grit feels effective</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for anyone serious about exfoliation. Works great alone or you can mix it with any cleanser, because it&#x27;s aluminum it doesn&#x27;t dissolve so you can pre-mix if you so desire. My skin is very sensitive &amp; every week to 10 days my routine is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;I use the aluminum oxide mixed with Boscia Detoxifying black cleanser (it&#x27;s a warming cleanser that really opens up your pores for a deep clean.) After rinsing &amp; patting dry, I put on a thin layer of 30% Glycolic Acid &amp; let it set for 3-5 minutes, I rinse off my face in cool water, using a cotton ball I swab on either a Ph neutralizer or just a mix of baking soda &amp; water to neutralize any acid left on my skin &amp; then do a cool water flush &amp; pat dry. Afterwards I use Cetaphil lotion to keep my skin moist &amp; if I&#x27;m going outside an amazing sunblock is a MUST. I choose StriVectin AR it&#x27;s chocked full of retinol &amp; NIA-144 for cellular repair. This is my routine &amp; how I do an at home chemical peel for under $20 per peel.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what is described. They are fine enough to exfoliate but aren&#x27;t harsh at all. The grit is very similar to baking soda instead of sugar.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. Not as great as others make it out to be. It has a fine powder texture which I didn&#x27;t mind, but the scubbing itself is what sucks! At least to me this product isn&#x27;t gritty enough to leave my face feeling smooth like I like. I&#x27;ve used the C. Booth microdermabration green apple scrub and that stuff is awesome! I only bought this as an alternative to save a bit of money, and it turned out to be a waste. Will suck it up and use continue using it but I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great price, fabulous product. No need to buy another cosmetic product for your face and wait to see if it will make you break out or make your skin catch on fire. A tiny bit of this mixed in to whatever cleanser you already use and have on hand, and BOOM - new skin altogether. Turns any cleanser into an exfoliant. Brilliant idea. Excellent value. Just a touch of this will go a loooooooooong way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was way too harsh for my face and caused a slight rash. (It should be noted that I have sensitive skin.) I ended up using it instead for exfoliating my hands, arms, and back. A word of caution if you&#x27;re the sensitive skin type like me.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft .My make up looks better and applies better on smooth skin.  I will  repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I was expecting, it&#x27;s a fine powder, but I mixed it with a good cleanser and used a face brush to massage into the skin and was very pleased with the results.  Can&#x27;t beat the price too!</li>
            <li> I got it in a timely fashion and it makes my skin feel so good after I use it</li>
            <li> I was expecting a cream like I got with my machine but it is crystals and has no directions on how to use it. Do I add water or what? It might be great....if only I knew what to do with it.</li>
            <li> One of the best exfoliation products I have used. It leaves the face smooth and  glowing. Mix it in your cleanser or cream and use with a facial brush for one or two minutes. If you have sensitive skin test it first before using.</li>
            <li> I like it, but was surprised how small it was.  It does the job - add it to Cetaphil, learning how to mix it with cleanser without wasting too much of the product as it is a small amount.  I made the mistake of using a quarter size dollop of cleanser, using a small baby spoon to shovel out the amount I needed and then accidentally going straight to my face when the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; fell off - it looked like it had absorbed into the cleanser, but you have to mix it in well.  Wish there was instructions to let me know if it&#x27;s okay to mix with cleansers ahead of time - not sure if it dissolves completely but have been wanting to try that.  A little does go a long way once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Very effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> I got this to try with the brushes that I purchased to use with my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic unit. At first I was a bit skeptical about using this exfoliate but I decided to give it a try. I like it. The crystals are very small and non-abrasive, something I was worried about at first since it never stated what grit it was. The small container will definitely last a long time as I use only a little at a time. It does leave my face feeling very smooth and polished and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The crystals are more like a dust and thinner than I thought they.d be. I can use a microdermabrasion face wash out of Rite Aid and get better results. These crystals are too fine. But it was so inexpensive that I use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I got this last night and I was surprised by how tiny the jar was but when i used it i was plesantly surprised by how scuffy those crystals are. The really held up under face wash and water not disentegrating at all. I&#x27;m waiting for my 50% glycolic acid gel to mix with the crystals for a DIY spa treatment at home. I think the results will be awesome![[ASIN:B000VEG964 Glycolic Acid 50% Peel Gel easily penetrates your skin to exfoliate layers of dead skin cells that dull your complexion to immediately expose a clear, softer, more radiant face.]]  this is what i&#x27;ll be mixing together</li>
            <li> This work great. You wash your face then you run the fine crystals on wrinkles or aged spots then rinse. I have read some people spend over $100 to have someone due this one time when what you really need is this which you can do daily if you like.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as stated and after using one time, my skin felt very smooth.  I&#x27;m glad I read the other reviews and ordered this small quantity as it does last a long time.  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Exactly as described. Got what I paid for. May want to purchase a higher end cream though if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> These are very fine, not super rough -- I like a little rough-ness in my scrub so I mix these with my St. Ives Invigorating scrub, but they are good on their own too. You can just pour some in your hand and mix in with a little water and you&#x27;re good, but you can use lotion, cleanser, whatever! I have noticed that my skin does look more buffed than before, so I would probably buy again. I like the company they seem cool. I see crystals sold by other companies and I don&#x27;t know if they are as high quality as IQ Natural that&#x27;s why I bought from them.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use as little or as much as I need with MY face wash.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> It is what it is- powdered sandpaper! It&#x27;s a reasonable price and a little goes a long way. My skin did feel soft and smooth after use. I use with caution, because I have sensitive skin. But so far no problems.</li>
            <li> These crystals will give a decent exfoliation when used alone.&lt;br /&gt;I mix them with IQ&#x27;s crushed Acai Berry Scrub, a few Aspirin tablets and a little water for a POW in your face exfoliation. I&#x27;m going to purchase more of these when I need them.</li>
            <li> I mix these crystals with Image Vitamin C Cream Cleanser to buff-up my face at least once per week - whenever my skin feels dry or rough. Always follow-up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and could be added to my lotion or soap, and though it looks like a small bottle, it lasted me a very ling time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get the results that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love it and great quality.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use</li>
            <li> First time to try this product, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I will say I tried an entirely new skincare routine when I began using these, so maybe the results aren&#x27;t totally attributable to the crystals. But I think the crystals play a big part. I cleanse, use a pumpkin enzyme peel after I shower and then use only a small amount of these crystals to exfoliate. After, my skin looks and feels amazing. The price can&#x27;t be beat either. You really don&#x27;t need to use much. When I first got it in the mail, I was worried I&#x27;d go through it very quickly because its so small. Nope, I still have so much left.</li>
            <li> Love these crystals.  I have been using these for quite some time now and they help soften the skin as well as diminish scars and dark spots.  I use it aout 2-3 times a week and follow with a sensitive skin moisturizer.  They  great on pretty much every body.  Sometimes I use them alone or sometimes mix them with my face wash.</li>
            <li> These are great. You have to use them with a cream or something you wash your face with. You don&#x27;t need a lot, they are very very fine, and they seem to be doing their job perfectly: exfoliate very well, my skin feels very soft after them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I love it! It makes my skin feel soft. I use it just with water and I have been using it with aloe vera gel too both works great. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> did not live up to its expectations. I hated it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. plus it does not work.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully at exfoliation</li>
            <li> I received this item today and decided to test it out as well today.  I used it not only on my face but all over my body.  I feel it did a great job and made my skin smooth.  I don&#x27;t know if it is any smoother than just using my normal body scrub and/or loofah, but as of right now I do really like it a lot.  I do feel that my face seemed smoother than the normal scrub I use on my face.</li>
            <li> This works great! I mix a little with my normal cleanser a few times a week to remove my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I ran out of my favorite exfoliater by boots no.7. So I looked for something else on here. It is wayyyy better. I love that I can use as little or more as I need. But it just makes my face so smooth! No more cakey makeup for me! Please don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting. I add this to a little liquid facial cleanser and create my own high quality, economical, and non-irritating body exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long but seems that the pores are smaller. Mix some with regular cleanser and sometime use some on the washcloth.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It is better than a scrub.  I just mix it with my face soap and you can feel your skin getting soft.</li>
            <li> Ok. Product is a very effective exfoliating material - because it doesn&#x27;t degrade with water - because it is METAL !&lt;br /&gt;now be careful with this material, ... if it goes to your eyes, forget it. you will end up with inflammation, if it get stuck in the mucosal surface of eyelid. if it get into your tear duct - it can cause more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5 oz size is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, for the cautious users who can avoid this thing going in to eyes, it is one of the best microdermabrasion material.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. When I first got it, I was surprised by how little the jar was but you dont need to use a lot of it. A little goes a looong way with these. Very effective. Immediate results, my face was SO smooth just after one use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old, not 45 suffering from age spots , Im a teen like you probably are.Ok,let me start by saying that I use to have a lot of acne on my face that left red/pink marks on my face. they weren&#x27;t as bad as having acne obviously but they messed up my complexion and made my face look really red on the cheek area and it was all just not pleasing. I tried nadinola skin lightener with the hydroquinone-did NOT work to help fade the red/pink marks. I considered buying the PMD (personal microderm) machine thing that was like $120.00 but I figured that there is always a simpler and cheaper way to heal your skin from acne marks. I looked at these and decided to order them....WOW it&#x27;s been less that a week and the exfoliating power of these crystals really really removed the dead skin from the surface resulting in less red/pink pigmentation in my acne marks and in addition-it EVENED out my skin tone and made my face sooooooo soft. I barely have to use any makeup to cover up. It&#x27;s been a week,I&#x27;ve had wonderful results and the bottle is still full. I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my skin will look in the long run. Love this so much,please give it a go if you&#x27;re in my situation. Susan K.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering this, It is always shipped quickly and I look forward to using it. It works great</li>
            <li> I love this product! Easy to use, inexpensive &amp; makes my skin look radiant! (So, I&#x27;ve been told:-)</li>
            <li> Product works great and a little goes a long way. Noticed clearer complexion and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little bottle of abrasive crap. I wasn&#x27;t pleased any way what so ever with this product. Shouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.You can definitely tell that it&#x27;s removing the dead skin leaving  the smoother canvas below. I am deducting one star only because I think they should include directions.</li>
            <li> container was smaller than expected. the product is pure granules and expected some what creamier. I rather a cleanser with this product mixed.</li>
            <li> Just a finger dab combined with your facial soap refines skin, exfoiliates without irritation or drying. No harsh chemicals, has improved skin appearence dramatically in less than 1 week! A must have!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used once!  It is a little harsh for me...I must build a tolerance for it; I am sure it&#x27;ll be okay when I&#x27;m used to it!  Mrs. M (Caron)</li>
            <li> Perfect grit..easy to use.. does not irritate.  Try it out!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPMENT, AND I LOVE IT - I USE IT MYSELF AND I ALSO USE ON MY HUSBAND, HAS TAKEN OFF SOME OF OUR SUNSPOTS</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to chem peels in that it is more gentle and you don&#x27;t have to heal from it. This product when applied as suggested leaves my skin exfoliated as I expected.  I use it every 4 to 5 days along with my regular application of moisturizers and anti-aging creams that do work. Skin is an organ so I do my best to keep it looking healthy. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> really nice smooths my skin</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected. I have used mixed with cream as well as water. Works more effectively than an expensive dermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li> Product is satisfactory.  Used twice weekly, very efficiemt.  Rinses off easily &amp; leaves skin in silky condition.</li>
            <li> Lovely. I use it mixed with coconut oil to a soft paste, every three or four days. Works well.</li>
