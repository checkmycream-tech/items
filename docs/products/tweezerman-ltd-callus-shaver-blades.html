            <li>The blades are really cheap yet work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to buy high quality razor blades.</li>

            <li>Great product, does exactly what it says it was going to do.</li>
            <li>product - works fine - Made in Germany!</li>
            <li>I had difficulty finding replacement blades at a reasonable price and this helped greatly.</li>
            <li>Great price and much easier than trying to search at the drug store for these.</li>
            <li>perfect German craftsmanship!</li>
            <li>A reasonably priced replacement for the original and it works great too.</li>
            <li>Fit my product well</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t fit my callus shaver.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the right sized blade for my handle, but it was...</li>
            <li>Have used this callus shaver for a long time, and it&#x27;s great - but eventually one must replace the blades, even though they have 2 usable edges.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good idea to make sure you keep a sharp blade in the shaver to prevent any injury and keep the Tweezerman Shaver working at it</li>
            <li>Not much to say, they work great.</li>
            <li>Such a good price for these blades.</li>
            <li>Good quality blades for a terrific price.</li>
            <li>These blades are priced right and are specifically for the Tweezerman product - good enough for me!</li>
            <li>Refill fits Tweezerman Callus Shaver&lt;br /&gt;Works as expected and good delivery time</li>
            <li>I used one as soon as I got it today, and they work as good as expected from a Tweezerman product.</li>
            <li>They slice right through the calloused areas like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Great for several different shavers (I have a Tweezerman callus tool).</li>
            <li>best quality, sharp and efficient, just as expected , made in Germany</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but great price and value</li>
            <li>You get so many you won&#x27;t have to re order for a long time.</li>
            <li>Fit well in to my shaver of a different brand, nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Getting 20 for $5, and considering that each blade has two sides, means that I won&#x27;t need to be buying more for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The spa I attend used this to get my winter feet ready for Spring.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>The ones I received are just what I was looking for and they were very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>They are the same blades that come with the original product.</li>
            <li>They work as advertised and arrived in solid packaging with individually wrapped blades for safety - what more do you need?</li>
            <li>Sharp, effective, durable enough.</li>
            <li>I use each blade 4x (both sides, top and bottom) before I throw them away and the only way to do this is to keep them dry.</li>
            <li>Plan and simple these are the real deal!</li>
            <li>If you have a Tweezerman Callus Shaver it is definitely worth the few dollars it costs to keep these extra blades on hand.  </li>

            <li> Sharp, effective, durable enough.</li>
            <li> If you have a Tweezerman Callus Shaver it is definitely worth the few dollars it costs to keep these extra blades on hand.  For just a few dollars you get 20 replacement blades that are individually wrapped in a little piece of paper.  These 20 blades should last quite a while.  They are the same blades that come with the original product. It is definitely a good idea to make sure you keep a sharp blade in the shaver to prevent any injury and keep the Tweezerman Shaver working at it&#x27;s best. The blades are good quality and work great in conjunction with the Tweezerman Shaver.  Great for the price and to keep on hand if you have this Tweezerman tool.</li>
            <li> The spa I attend used this to get my winter feet ready for Spring.&lt;br /&gt;Came on time; really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my feet that, if I don&#x27;t take care of it, cracks and bleeds during the summer.  These are the only blades I have ever and will ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave these in the shower or they will rust within a day or two.  Take your shaver out, dry it and keep it away from moisture until you need to use it again.  I use each blade 4x (both sides, top and bottom) before I throw them away and the only way to do this is to keep them dry.</li>
            <li> Such a good price for these blades.</li>

            <li> Plan and simple these are the real deal!</li>
            <li> Too sharp-cut myself badly-threw them out</li>
            <li> great price. Fit my product well</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they work great.</li>
            <li> perfect, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> best quality, sharp and efficient, just as expected , made in Germany</li>
            <li> Fits well with my Tweezerman callus shaver. I used one as soon as I got it today, and they work as good as expected from a Tweezerman product. I got 2 boxes of these with 10 blades per box, total of 20 blades.</li>
            <li> These long-lasting blades are definitely a quality product. I have tried two other brands but nothing comes close in quality or shaves as close as these blades. Great for several different shavers (I have a Tweezerman callus tool).</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but great price and value</li>

            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> The blades are really cheap yet work great.  They slice right through the calloused areas like a hot knife through butter.  Getting 20 for $5, and considering that each blade has two sides, means that I won&#x27;t need to be buying more for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Fits into the callus shaver. Cuts. Be careful with how you use these things, it is possible to cut the #$%^* out of yourself if not careful.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere (I thought) trying to find replacement blades.  The ones I received are just what I was looking for and they were very inexpensive.  Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> You can never have enough of these.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Very sharp and they get the job done. I&#x27;m glad I got so many, because I use this all the time!</li>
            <li> Great price and much easier than trying to search at the drug store for these. You get so many you won&#x27;t have to re order for a long time.</li>

            <li> Good quality blade for a great price.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere. Good quality blades for a terrific price. I looked at different places and bought some at WalMart, but the package included a holder that I didn&#x27;t need. The WalMart blades were pretty bad and I threw them away after I tried these.</li>
            <li> I ordered these refills and they were just as expected. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the right sized blade for my handle, but it was... perfect German craftsmanship!</li>
            <li> as described. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it was going to do.</li>
            <li> They are razor blades. They work as advertised and arrived in solid packaging with individually wrapped blades for safety - what more do you need?</li>
            <li> Fit well in to my shaver of a different brand, nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> What can you say about razor blades? They do the job.&lt;br /&gt;They do the job/ They do the job.Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to buy high quality razor blades. Less breakage and cuts and they last longer. These are good quality blades!</li>
            <li> Hard to get locally&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product - works fine - Made in Germany!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Fits the tweezerman callus shaver and that&#x27;s it.  I uploaded the picture so people could see.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr ordered</li>
            <li> Great price. Great quality. Great speed.</li>
