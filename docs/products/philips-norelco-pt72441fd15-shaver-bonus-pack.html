            <li>My husband love it</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li>The Norelco feels flimsy and cheap by comparison.</li>
            <li>It is not as smooth as a razor</li>
            <li>been used it doen not do as good as my old one did</li>

            <li>The Braun 3-340s Wet &amp; Dry Shaver is definitely superior to this rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>The design of the Braun is also superior: it has a smaller, more compact charging base, it feels more solid in your hand, and the shaving element operates at a higher frequency which gives you a quicker shave.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR.</li>
            <li>Cost a little more than the replacement blades for my old wired one.</li>
            <li>And the green light will stay on for about thirty minutes and then go off to save the razors power.</li>
            <li>THAT IS NATURAL.)</li>
            <li>Earlier I ordered this razor, and being disabled, I selected the &amp;#34;Frustration-free Packaging,&amp;#34; so I could easily access it.</li>
            <li>When you shave with this razor the green light stays off, until the battery gets low than their will be two lights flashing, orange/green, to let you know that your razor has low power.</li>
            <li>Plastic body was a little disappointing,but the price is right.</li>
            <li>But my new one was the same model (different accessories in the box, however - first one had a hard case).</li>

            <li> Have been looking for a razor to shave legs for years, and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Earlier I ordered this razor, and being disabled, I selected the &amp;#34;Frustration-free Packaging,&amp;#34; so I could easily access it. My mistake, as it was the razor and cord, brush and cover only. I see just a price change was made; a more thorough explanation may be a better idea. This is the razor I wanted. My H8 head refills will work in it which is what I wanted. Thanks for the accommodation, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered this  Phillips Norelco Bonus Pack, it is the best razor I ever bought. The razor takes four hours to charge. And the green light will stay on for about thirty minutes and then go off to save the razors power. When you shave with this razor the green light stays off, until the battery gets low than their will be two lights flashing, orange/green, to let you know that your razor has low power. It also comes with a stand, and charging cord, and brushes. Your razor can be cleaned by holding it under the faucet. (BUT DON&#x27;T TURN IT ON BECAUSE SOME WATER MAY LEAK THROUGH THE RAZOE, THAT IS NATURAL.) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR. Jim in Ohio.</li>
            <li> Very good. I ENJOY VRRY MUCH.</li>
            <li> been used it doen not do as good as my old one did</li>
            <li> good shaver, works well, and very easy to clean, it&#x27;s also washable</li>

            <li> My husband love it❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Great item!  Great value!</li>
            <li> The Braun 3-340s Wet &amp; Dry Shaver is definitely superior to this rotary shaver. I compared the two and found the Braun gave a closer shave. The design of the Braun is also superior: it has a smaller, more compact charging base, it feels more solid in your hand, and the shaving element operates at a higher frequency which gives you a quicker shave. The Norelco feels flimsy and cheap by comparison.</li>
            <li> Good,inexpensive shaver. Plastic body was a little disappointing,but the price is right.Don&#x27;t care for the replacing of the heads after one year.I had previously used a 7000 series,and loved it. Next razor will be a step up,most likely next year.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, and good quality for the price. Easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> This is a good, inexpensive razor. It&#x27;s my second one of this model. Don&#x27;t know what happened to my other one - it just disappeared. But my new one was the same model (different accessories in the box, however - first one had a hard case).</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my legs and I find it does a very good job.  But my husband who has stated on several occasions that he would never use an electric shaver has taken it for himself.  Even uses it on his head. It&#x27;s his new favorite gadget and he finds it&#x27;s a time saver when getting ready for work in the mornings.  It is not as smooth as a razor but you have to actually rub your hand on his face to realize that, so it does a good job for both of us.</li>
            <li> The delivery time and packaging were great ! I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco shavers and this one is economical and works great.</li>
            <li> Grate shaver using for over 35 years.&lt;br /&gt;Good price good value!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Good shave and hold a charge. Cost a little more than the replacement blades for my old wired one.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product !</li>
            <li> I got it as a back up, on vacation, I have a better model which is much better;  Is good for a back up</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loved it</li>
