    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>me this is just a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This product is normally very good.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, when it&#x27;s not expired.</li>
            <li>The body lotion seems to do the trick, but the face lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle lotion, but it does give you a nice glow!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even produce a good tan.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>And it dries REALLY fast which is awesome.</li>
            <li>It gives me the nice glow that I want</li>
            <li>Now I know why it was so cheap!</li>
            <li>I use an additional moisturizer on top of this cream because I didn&#x27;t find it oily at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and used the product many times.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I do notice that the body moisturizer is working better than the face stuff b/c</li>
            <li>The formula has changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>Pros: easy to apply, you do notice some tan after a day..</li>
            <li>First off, i liked how it didnt make me orange.  </li>
            <li>The stuff with spf is great for outdoors but its definitely heavier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>First, and most problematic, then product no longer provides any color.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, light weight, absorbs easily, no break outs!  </li>
            <li>As far as the product itself, love it and have been using it for prob 10 yrs now.</li>
            <li>and i wanted something to be more natural looking.</li>
            <li>In fact I use it all over since I am so fair, and it gives me a subtle glow without looking orange like most self-tanners make me look.  </li>
            <li>Whatever smell I noticed went away right away.</li>
            <li>Pure liquid!</li>
            <li>you may want to try that if you desire a more obvious tan.</li>
            <li>I use the darker for better results as I find the medium does not add enough color</li>
            <li>In fact, the color didnt really show up the first day, which i didnt expect it to since its a gradual tanner.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was runny, smelled...odd, and had a very oily consistency to it.</li>
            <li>Bought both the body and the face Glow products from Jergens.. and they both seem to work really well.</li>
            <li>This is the much older version of this product.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light complected and use both this facial cream/tanner and the Jergens Natural Glow body moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>I buy the same products all the time for my face and although I do love the way it has such a natural look</li>
            <li>The face moisterizer leaves a nice subtle color.  </li>
            <li>It used to be that I could apply it 2 or 3 times and have a nice subtle glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very clear skin.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING like the exact same thing I buy in the store.</li>
            <li>how old it was, but either someone emptied it out and filled it up with something else or the ingedients liquified due to age.  </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive or oily skin do not try this!</li>
            <li>, my sensitive skin couldn&#x27;t handle it even though it was supposed to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the bottle I got was over 5 years old.</li>
            <li>I had blemishes under my eye, forehead, and even near my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you dont have sensitive skin, this may work for you.</li>
            <li>why would you send me a product that is 7 years old?</li>
            <li>the one I&#x27;m looking for has a soft chocolate color box just like this one .....</li>
            <li>the one  you sent is beige and old...........</li>
            <li>Normally I just go to the store to purchase my beauty products, but seeing as how I am on bedrest for pregnancy complications I am currently housebound</li>
            <li>My skin is a little sensitive and I rarely break out</li>
            <li>No tan is worth that mess.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle color change, for me just enough to make my bronzer pop and look believable as a tan &amp;</li>
            <li>others here have mentioned the smell - I have to say that for me personally, I barely noticed.</li>
            <li>B000E81FAM Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer for Medium Skin Tone, 2.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>but I did not get the facial moisturizer I wanted--it smelled and looked like the body natural glow.</li>
            <li>I used this product for almost a week until I could no longer bare it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning, so it has been thrown away.</li>
            <li>I remember the old tanners \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot;, and this is so different - no shades of orange.</li>
            <li>I love both of them, but if you expect to see a dramatic difference, especially in your face, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I now got used to using it regularly and a small tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> negative review is only because the product that the seller sent to me was obviously expired.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference in my face color when I stop using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The smell disappears as soon as it dries (which only takes a few minutes).</li>
            <li> When I actually dispensed some of the lotion into my hand to apply, there was no doubt that it was past</li>
            <li> Maybe it was expired like some other people mentioned.</li>
            <li> but this brought on many zits :(</li>
            <li> No one would suspect that it&#x27;s not natural, and there are no strong lines separating the parts where the lotion is used, and where it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of break outs I have also taken to using toner for sensitive skin every few days which I normally do in the summer anyway...</li>
            <li> Thirdly, the forumla is no longer a thick creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve tried to use it I have to tilt the bottle at an angle because the product is very thin and runny and drips straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> this is very watery imports out like water which I do find a little weird</li>
            <li> I used this product over the previous two winters to add color to my winter-white skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this new formula didn&#x27;t add any color at all, despite putting it on twice a day for 4 or 5 days.</li>
            <li> I saw little to no change in the color of my face.</li>
            <li> It is runny, smells like fake tanner, and most annoyingly does not have SPF 20 as Jergens&#x27; current , improved product does.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for over a week, and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> but then again my blemish(ing) days are well behind me, so this may be a consideration for younger users or those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve tried them and the product comes as thin as water, literally.</li>
            <li> Was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> I am quite pale and using the medium skin tone and it made no change at all to my skin color.</li>
            <li> like the fact that the facial tanner is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Usually just buy this in store, but decided to order it online this time.</li>
            <li> This year I was unable to find it in the local stores and ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Im very pale...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nasty and quite strong.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the new formula has a terrible \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this tanner would be a pain for you :(</li>
            <li> It was awful and super watery.</li>
            <li> It is unuseable due to the odor and texture, ineffective due to the lack of &#x27;tan&#x27; that it provides, and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience at all.  </li>
            <li> For years I shied away from products like this as I broke out terribly after the first time I used a sunless tanner on my face</li>
            <li> Instead it is thin and leaves a sticky feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> It eventually fades with time, or your nose adjusts, but it is harsh and unpleasant until that time.</li>
            <li> Horrible and old product, came expired for over 2 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this crap made my skin go crazy.</li>
            <li> And worst of all, its very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible, even after I washed my hands it would still linger.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the much older version of this product. It is runny, smells like fake tanner, and most annoyingly does not have SPF 20 as Jergens&#x27; current , improved product does. Every time I&#x27;ve tried to use it I have to tilt the bottle at an angle because the product is very thin and runny and drips straight out of the bottle. Now I know why it was so cheap! Lesson learned! Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This product made no difference in my skin color.  I used it everyday for over a week, and nothing happened.  The body lotion seems to do the trick, but the face lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff! It&#x27;s not a miracle lotion, but it does give you a nice glow! I definitely notice a difference in my face color when I stop using it for a few days. And it dries REALLY fast which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  In fact I use it all over since I am so fair, and it gives me a subtle glow without looking orange like most self-tanners make me look.  The smell disappears as soon as it dries (which only takes a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I am fairly light complected and use both this facial cream/tanner and the Jergens Natural Glow body moisturizer as well. I love both of them, but if you expect to see a dramatic difference, especially in your face, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the facial tanner is very subtle.  What it basically gives me is a lit bit of color - which is all that I want. No one would suspect that it&#x27;s not natural, and there are no strong lines separating the parts where the lotion is used, and where it&#x27;s not. I remember the old tanners \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot;, and this is so different - no shades of orange. No unevenness in the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some others here have mentioned the smell - I have to say that for me personally, I barely noticed. Whatever smell I noticed went away right away. Others have mentioned that they broke out in blemishes - that didn&#x27;t happen to me but then again my blemish(ing) days are well behind me, so this may be a consideration for younger users or those with oily skin. I use an additional moisturizer on top of this cream because I didn&#x27;t find it oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is just a wonderful product. I now got used to using it regularly and a small tube lasts a long time. Note that if you do use foundation or face powder, you will probably have to change your shade after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that this product also comes in a darker shade - you may want to try that if you desire a more obvious tan.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this stuff on two different occasions and immediately broke out on cystic acne. And this is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t break out like ever. I threw the bottle away. No tan is worth that mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used the product many times. It&#x27;s a staple in my bathroom but this seller is selling junk. This is the second time I&#x27;ve tried them and the product comes as thin as water, literally. Totally unusable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and absolutely love it. It gives me the nice glow that I want and I really like the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This negative review is only because the product that the seller sent to me was obviously expired. Normally I just go to the store to purchase my beauty products, but seeing as how I am on bedrest for pregnancy complications I am currently housebound and so I thought I&#x27;d just order it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the bottle of lotion I received had been taped shut with packing tape. I peeled it off and managed to get the bottle open but it was covered with sticky residue. When I actually dispensed some of the lotion into my hand to apply, there was no doubt that it was past it&#x27;s prime. It was runny, smelled...odd, and had a very oily consistency to it. After using this product daily for years, I recognized that this was not normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and sent my mom out to the store to get another bottle, and will have to throw this one away. The product itself is great, when it&#x27;s not expired.</li>
            <li> Bought both the body and the face Glow products from Jergens.. and they both seem to work really well. I do notice that the body moisturizer is working better than the face stuff b/c my body is a lot tanner now than my face. The face moisterizer leaves a nice subtle color.  &lt;br /&gt;The only reason i&#x27;m giving 4 stars is b/c of the horrid smell while the color is developing! Yuck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff!  For years I shied away from products like this as I broke out terribly after the first time I used a sunless tanner on my face, my sensitive skin couldn&#x27;t handle it even though it was supposed to be for sensitive skin. This stuff is great, light weight, absorbs easily, no break outs!  I use the darker for better results as I find the medium does not add enough color (go a shade darker than you think).  It is a subtle color change, for me just enough to make my bronzer pop and look believable as a tan &amp; so I don&#x27;t look like a zombie when I&#x27;m not wearing make up.  The stuff with spf is great for outdoors but its definitely heavier.  Note that bc I was afraid of break outs I have also taken to using toner for sensitive skin every few days which I normally do in the summer anyway...</li>
            <li> Horrible and old product, came expired for over 2 years! Do not buy from this seller. It was watery, had to throw away and actually just went and bought from cvs instead. As far as the product itself, love it and have been using it for prob 10 yrs now.</li>
            <li> Usually just buy this in store, but decided to order it online this time. Just received this is the mail... opened it, tried to use it, and the \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; streamed out of the container like water. It does NOT resemble lotion AT ALL! Pure liquid! NOTHING like the exact same thing I buy in the store. Terrible...will NEVER order lotion online again because of it. &gt;:( VERY disappointed! [[ASIN:B000E81FAM Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer for Medium Skin Tone, 2.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It was awful and super watery. It didn&#x27;t even produce a good tan. I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle I got was over 5 years old.</li>
            <li> Im very pale... and i wanted something to be more natural looking. i did my research and i decided on this one. First off, i liked how it didnt make me orange.  Sadly, this crap made my skin go crazy. I have never had problematic skin. I had blemishes under my eye, forehead, and even near my eyebrows. Within 6 hours of using this... i had blemishes.  I have very clear skin.  If you have sensitive skin this tanner would be a pain for you :( i wanted it to work... it didnt. point blank.  In fact, the color didnt really show up the first day, which i didnt expect it to since its a gradual tanner. I had to stop using it because of my skin. Maybe if you dont have sensitive skin, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> I used this product over the previous two winters to add color to my winter-white skin. This year I was unable to find it in the local stores and ordered it from Amazon. The formula has changed, and not for the better. First, and most problematic, then product no longer provides any color. It used to be that I could apply it 2 or 3 times and have a nice subtle glow to my skin. Unfortunately, this new formula didn&#x27;t add any color at all, despite putting it on twice a day for 4 or 5 days. I am quite pale and using the medium skin tone and it made no change at all to my skin color. Secondly, the new formula has a terrible \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; smell. It&#x27;s nasty and quite strong. It eventually fades with time, or your nose adjusts, but it is harsh and unpleasant until that time. Thirdly, the forumla is no longer a thick creamy lotion. Instead it is thin and leaves a sticky feel on your skin. It isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning, so it has been thrown away. It is unuseable due to the odor and texture, ineffective due to the lack of &#x27;tan&#x27; that it provides, and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Was expired date. Ran like water and could not use. Was a wasted purchase. Very disappointed. I purchase this from local retailer all the time so I know the difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they did it but I did not get the facial moisturizer I wanted--it smelled and looked like the body natural glow. Maybe it was expired like some other people mentioned.</li>
            <li> Pros: easy to apply, you do notice some tan after a day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: i do not like the smell of it, you do have to wait for results..</li>
            <li> I buy the same products all the time for my face and although I do love the way it has such a natural look this is very watery imports out like water which I do find a little weird however it does the trick if it wasn&#x27;t so watery I&#x27;d give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even lotion, but liquid &amp;#34;who knows what&amp;#34;.  I have no clue how old it was, but either someone emptied it out and filled it up with something else or the ingedients liquified due to age.  Not a good experience at all.  This product is normally very good.</li>
            <li> this product was made in 2006.....why would you send me a product that is 7 years old? and this packaging is the one I wanted ...............it is not the one you sent me...............this packaging  has the face in the upper left hand corner ..........what you sent does not....the one I&#x27;m looking for has a soft chocolate color box just like this one .....this is the one..............the one  you sent is beige and old...........I would appreciate your comment since I spent $43.00 on old products</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a week until I could no longer bare it. The smell is terrible, even after I washed my hands it would still linger. I saw little to no change in the color of my face. And worst of all, its very thick and greasy. So if you have sensitive or oily skin do not try this! My skin is a little sensitive and I rarely break out but this brought on many zits :( I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star rating because I did not realize this product would be watery, I thought this would be creamy. I will not be buying this product again</li>
