            <li>you own one</li>
            <li>you own a Sonicare</li>
            <li>I had never used this product before,it is great my mouth feels clean and refreshed after use and all day.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new set of brush heads and this was the best deal I found.</li>
            <li>great price &amp; works great for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Good price, easy shipping.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive, and these were the best brushes I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gums and this brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love that this item is so much more affordable on Amazon than in stores!</li>
            <li>They are very nice and feel great on those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Good price for genuine parts</li>
            <li>The best toothbrush for people that have sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li>For best results, I suggest pairing this head with a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with them, they are compact and soft , just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I liked the size of those better.</li>
            <li>HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum and I thought it was okay, but when I used it with these, it was amazing how polished my teeth seemed to be all day afterwards.  </li>
            <li>If your dentist recommends soft heads so you don&#x27;t beat yourself up (as I do), then these are perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>Best choice for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Excellent for sensitive teeth and receding gumline</li>
            <li>Perfect for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li>I just think it looks cool!!</li>
            <li>These strike just the right balance, and I am now so happy that I discovered these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These feel like very fine silk on your gums.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand,, very good price as well..</li>
            <li>I still get a really good clean.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare toothbrush is the best on the market and the sensitive brush heads make it a much better product.</li>
            <li>These are very gentle and great brushes for anybody with teeth issues.</li>
            <li>bristles are VERY gentle and do a great job of cleaning all of the plaque and calculus build-up.</li>
            <li>Works great, very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, teeth feel clean and according to my dentist they are clean.</li>
            <li>Philips is great about honoring their warranty and I will certainly turn to them again if this toothbrush ever dies.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves have soft bristles which are very good for my gums.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I do better with a regular electric spinning brush, or the Collins manual brushes that are superb.</li>
            <li>I think they recommend replacing more often than every six months, but that&#x27;s what I do.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got these.</li>
            <li>I have to use soft bristles and these fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are nice and soft and feel great.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to remember to order them as I enrolled in the automatic mail program for an even better price.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Love my sonicare &amp; these brushes.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Oral B</li>
            <li>but my wife likes the Oral B better.</li>
            <li>It makes teeth brushing a much better experience.</li>
            <li>What more can you say?</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says my teeth and gums are as healthy as ever.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>fit to Philips Sonicare HX6053/64,good!</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare.</li>
            <li>much better than stiffer brushes</li>
            <li>These are OK</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been cleaner and in better shape.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of our the Sonicares.</li>
            <li>So glad I found them online, and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Everywhere else charges more for one than 3 sometimes for 4.</li>
            <li>Maybe the softness makes the bristles move around more?  </li>
            <li>I was glad that it fit my Sonicare that was purchased from Costco, as that model number doesn&#x27;t seem to exist on the Sonicare website!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>guess I need to replace my brushes more often?</li>
            <li>I like these better than any Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare and love it</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Had a perfect check-up at last dental visit.</li>
            <li>So much better than the ;OFF; brand</li>
            <li>Satisfied with all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare :)</li>
            <li>I will buy more when these wear out.</li>
            <li>and you have many choices on strength of cleaning even having one speed to massage gums.  </li>
            <li>And at $30 a box they better be :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t brush too</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>and this is definitely top of</li>
            <li>So the softer the bristles the better for me, and these are FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I tried the copies, but they just don&#x27;t work as well - get the actual item, made for your brush, and get the best results.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price for these brushes was the best price I could find, including at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Makes the Sonicare even better than it was.</li>
            <li>Needed I say more?</li>
            <li>love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>My husband was able to forego his gum treatments because of Sonicare.</li>
            <li>get the brush with diferent function it work better.</li>
            <li>glad I got these.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I need them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and you get a great product for your favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
            <li>The brushheads are ok</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare System.</li>
            <li>But I think they have become my favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>I have the sonic and made sure each family member had a brush but needed a replacement head.</li>
            <li>I love thet</li>
            <li>I have to write 8 more words to get this review accepted.</li>
            <li>then,  FINALLY Sonicare comes out with the best!  </li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love the sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>my last checkup my Dentist said, &amp;#34;Your mouth is perfect!&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t have perfect teeth.</li>
            <li>We will order more of these for sure.</li>
            <li>The product quality is pretty good and very comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth to use it , it is pretty good</li>
            <li>They are soft but they clean teeth perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality and at a great price.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much more clean with these!</li>
            <li>ok sure, i get ultra-soft as one day i will too be elderly, but i pulled the trigger very quickly on this purchase without realizing the &amp;#34;ultra-&amp;#34; qualifier.</li>
            <li>make my teeth very, very clean...</li>
            <li>This was a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>This brush head is very soft and feels great on my gums.  </li>
            <li>These are great - very soft.</li>

            <li>great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>soft bristles are great for your gums.  </li>
            <li>GREAT FOR SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this brush for great cleaning, and to reduce my problem with receding, sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, it&#x27;s a great change of pace for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>These are the most comfortable brush heads I&#x27;ve found for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So far they are great.</li>
            <li>Great soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are better than the original.</li>
            <li>Plus, they must be packed in tighter because it feels like they clean more of the tooth surface.  </li>
            <li>The sonic care system is great, just make sure to buy generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Work very well with my Sonicare and the softness of the brushes is excellent for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>easy five stars.</li>
            <li>The shipment came in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Price makes it easy to change your toothbrush every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>These are great heads and they are very soft and got then for a great deal compared to the regular.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call gentle, but they are very appropriate for brushing.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sonicare Easy Clean after hearing how much my son-in-law loved his.  </li>
            <li>Soft but still give you a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Excellent and just as expected!!</li>
            <li>Love the Philips Sonicare Healthy White and these are excellent brush heads for those with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>They sent replacement heads immediately and they are fine.</li>
            <li>they arrived on time and worked fine.</li>
            <li>The brush head does not attach perfectly flush with the handle, but leans forward at a slight angle (see attached picture.)</li>
            <li>If the are on sale they are fine, but otherwise go with the diamond that is.</li>
            <li>Bought them because I needed the softer bristles and they have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t install the family-\\&quot;ID\\&quot; ring that can color code each head if you share a unit, but the brush fit perfectly on the stem, but with a slight gap for that ID ring.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush head and perfect for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>but the desccription was exact which made ordering very easy.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>These work and fit my Phillips Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These were a great price compared to buying them locally.</li>
            <li>The dentist recommended I use the softest bristles I could find and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li>No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>However, these brushes fit and work well.  </li>
            <li>so I will be ready as my own wears out.</li>
            <li>When I using this one, I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li>They seem like cheap knock offs and the bristles are already wearing after just a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t quite fit all the way on to my Sonicare, but are the ones recommended for it.</li>
            <li>I have always used Sensitive Soft toothbrushes and these were the perfect replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li>These are really good for ones with sensitive mouths.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully will be good for sensitive gum .</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to brush right over my receding gum and the nearby teeth.</li>
            <li>Be sure that you order the right head for your Sonicare.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are great - clean thoroughly but do not chew my gums up like the regular brush heads, IF I maintain a light touch.</li>
            <li>and they still clean fine and do not make my gums bleed.</li>
            <li>it is very useful</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit original toothbrush well.</li>
            <li>, it was so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>yet they still get my teeth smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>(which, to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t particularly care if it was the correct brush</li>
            <li>I had originally bought these bristles for gum health</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace the Pro Results brush head that originally came with my Sonicare EasyClean toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These bristles make my brushing with Sonic care fun!  </li>
            <li>It arrived early and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>These are not the brushes that came with my Diamondclean originally.  </li>
            <li>Softer than the original flex care brushes.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money!</li>
            <li>My teeth also keep clean all day and all night basically, with 2 brushings a day.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look really clean.</li>
            <li>Fits on my Diamond clean</li>
            <li>I was happy to have found these soft brushes, they much easier on my teeth</li>
            <li>THESE ALONG WITH THE SONICARE DIAMOND CLEAN ELECTRICE TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>TWO BRUSH HEADS CAME ALONG WITH THE DIAMOND CLEAN</li>
            <li>and you can UV clean them.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush but had tried the cheaper after market brush heads and did not find them to fit very well.</li>
            <li>Next, I need an electric brush that is not so loud (and this is the best of the bunch).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t switch to an electric tooth brush because I need to have a extra soft brush.this brush works perfectly.</li>
            <li>They also happen to be cheaper than the pro results and the diamond clean, so it seems like a no brainer.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t harm the gums but still clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft bristles!</li>
            <li>(I can see no difference in cleaning ability from the original brush), but they are so much more gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>Within a week of using the brush, I no longer needed special gum sensitivity toothpaste, and the receding gum situation began to reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly fine on my brush model, which is an HX6530 for those who might be interested.</li>
            <li>The ultra soft brush is perfect for sensitive teeth and works just as good as any of the other brushes.</li>
            <li>Great, just as expected</li>
            <li>Getting harder to find, but these brushes are great.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing, and this Brush Head is soft an comforatable on the gums.</li>
            <li>Mmmm, nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I appreciate so much having this product as I have used Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft, fits well.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with the Ultra Sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li>Were the same good quality as if bought in the stores but can&#x27;t seem to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to find these ultra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Good thing they last</li>
            <li>I really like the softness of these so much better.</li>
            <li>And because that is true, brushing for longer (when I want to) is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft on the gums.</li>
            <li>and I will buy them again instead paying full retail at the store for replacements.</li>
            <li>I use a good pair of package-opening shears and still, it was a pain to open this</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and these soft brushes are great for keeping my teeth clean and not creating any unwanted pain.  </li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare toothbrushes and these soft bristles are easy on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and gentle, but still do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the regular ProCare heads at a much lower price, but that is probably because so many more are sold.</li>
            <li>nice and last long for a great brushing</li>
            <li>And Amazon shipped them quickly.</li>
            <li>product as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly, and was just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I can now brush comfortably even on the most sensitive spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is mild to the teeth enamel and mouth gums cleaning well.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>Hence, you can actually brush better and more closely to the gumline.</li>
            <li>been looking for these everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find them this was super convenient to order online</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The brush heads fit relatively well, however the fit isn&#x27;t perfect and if you hold the toothbrush upside down while turned on to rinse it off after you&#x27;re done brushing your teeth the head slips almost all the way off</li>
            <li>I experienced a bit of gum loss with the original style which leads to sensitive teeth and potentially more problems on down the road.  </li>
            <li>As someone who&#x27;s terrified of the dentist, I find these are nice and soft, yet seem to clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>I love these brush heads as they are very soft.</li>
            <li>And I am certain that being able to brush without discomfort will encourage me to do it more consistently, and will help those sensitive areas to stay healthier.    </li>
            <li>This order arrived promptly and exactly as described and the correct size!  </li>
            <li>The ultra soft sensitive brush heads clean very well, and perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Unlike a hand toothbrush, where soft bristles don&#x27;t do a good job, the power toothbrushes with soft bristles clean fine--and most importantly, don&#x27;t make my gums feel like I&#x27;ve brushed with sandpaper.</li>
            <li>They clean really well too!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Sonicare brush head, very soft and gentle for people who tend to overdo it and/or have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy with these heads: soft and pliable, able to reach those hard areas without much force.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few sonicare heads and definitely find these to be the best fit for me.  </li>
            <li>They are much more comfortable to use than the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li>Love the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>These brushes last me about 6-8 weeks each and do a nice job shining up my 68 y/o teeth ..</li>
            <li>I love these ultra soft heads.  </li>
            <li>Much better brushes for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>They arrived in time and I love that I could find this one with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Love how soft they are and my teeth feel so fresh after using them.</li>
            <li>I like this model a lot better than the old e-series.</li>
            <li>Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.</li>
            <li>Love how soft they are</li>
            <li>Better for the gums if yours are sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also, in checking with my dentist, the soft brushes are better for your gums.</li>
            <li>Love the sensitive alternative.  </li>
            <li>The heads do last 3 months and the UV cleaner makes me more comfortable that they aren&#x27;t breeding bacteria.</li>
            <li>If you brush frequently they must be replaced more often.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with fresh breathe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they sell these ultra soft brush heads, so</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if they brush as good as the harder brush heads, but they seem to.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job of cleaning, yet are soft enough not to hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>i like the old ones a lot better.</li>
            <li>A rounder softer front end, like the Oral-B Sensitive, might work even better.</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>- I have gum recession and am sensitive in certain areas - this brush head feels comfortable and my teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as regular sonicare brushes but still better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But, when I contacted Philips, they sent me the right ones at no charge.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare gets it right every time.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the difference right off.</li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>and the price was right</li>
            <li>I just hope the claims are true and our teeth are better served using the Sonicare toothbrushes over traditional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and when I returned to these, it really was a world of difference in softness and how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>They are much softer than the diamond clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft, so it helps with getting used to this new way of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that came with the unit fit such that it could be put on the unit fairly easily, but these replacements could not be.  </li>
            <li>Dentist wants me to us the extra soft and these are great.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles, really feel great and last a while!  </li>
            <li>This product is as good if not better than the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine but it doesn&#x27;t fit all the way on to my Philips Sonicare electric toothbruse, the same as the brushes I received with my toothbrush when I purchased it about 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I own 2 Sonicare models and when I purchased a newer model, I noticed on Amazon that Phillips now makes the Soft Sensitive brush that I&#x27;ve always wanted and ordered them.</li>
            <li>They clean just as well as the regular brush heads but are more gentle.</li>
            <li>These are soft brushes which are good for sensitive teeth, but being as soft as they are they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes the whole thing more tolerable on sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as they did with the Oral B, and in a month&#x27;s steady use, have yet to experience any sore gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, the dentist says to use soft bristles but these are too soft to be really effective.</li>
            <li>Noticeably softer than regular pro-results brush heads, good for sensitive teeth or receding gums.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, work well.</li>
            <li>So far these brush heads are working fine.</li>
            <li>HX6311/02&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly fine for me and my 11 years old son.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;i normally use the regular head, but this is just as good.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had discovered them when I first bought the toothbrush</li>
            <li>These brush heads are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as marketed and on time.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of a problem when I first received these</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered the ultra soft sensitive instead of the regular, but they still work great.</li>
            <li>It took a replacement of the first three that were sent.</li>
            <li>The first heads started to fall apart--the filaments were coming off in our mouths.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the softer bristles than the regular brush heads.</li>
            <li>Exactly as posted.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare but found the bristles on the regular toothbrushes to be too abrasive for my teeth.</li>
            <li>These heads are much better than the regular.  </li>
            <li>Standard ultra soft, great if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>So happy to have SOFT heads again, my teeth were starting to get really sensitive</li>
            <li>I have particularly sensitive gums, and was routinely tearing up my gum-line with the softest brush head available for the Oral B electric</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add another observation as of 11/2/2013 -- I went for my regular dental check-up a couple of weeks ago, and my hygienist said my teeth \\&quot;look great.\\&quot;  :-)</li>
            <li>So glad I brought my electric brush back to life!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered the replacements head online</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes unfortunately cost an arm and a leg; this package had the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to be the same and perform as well as the ones I paid a lot more for on a national drugstore chains website.  </li>
            <li>Sure, there are only 4 in a pack.</li>
            <li>I should be able to tell by my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush, but I cannot use the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li>Many with inner ear disorders would like a quieter brush, please.  </li>
            <li>these feel way way way better on my teeth and actually conform to my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes were recommend by my dentist and they work very well for fighting my receding gumline!</li>
            <li>I wish Phillips would come out with a smaller head to get at the bottom and top front teeth...</li>
            <li>I appreciate that Sonicare has this ultra soft consistency of brush available.</li>
            <li>I am so confident the batteries will last for weeks on end.</li>
            <li>This is a better buy than the local store if you sign up for the recurring shipments.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s where trouble can start, even with flossing and brushing with a good electronic</li>
            <li>, all I can say is that after using these for a few months, they have easily become my FAVORITE brush head for the Philips device.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, and I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush head, but it really is better catered to people with sensitive teeth like mine, I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle on your gums and really seem to do a better job than the regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, they leave my teeth feeling just as clean.  </li>
            <li>The ultra soft sensitive brushes have become my favorite brush head.</li>
            <li>I use the standard ones, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll have a soft brush head when it&#x27;s my turn.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller, who was insightful enough to understand dental care, and shipped the package safely, securely, and before anticipated!  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are noticeably more gentle than the standard brush heads.  </li>
            <li>High quality, easy on sensitive gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had positive results with all of them.</li>
            <li>It makes my Sonicare much more comfortable to use, and I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular \\&quot;ProResults</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent of what comes with your sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>The sensitive brush heads are far superior to the regular ones.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles clean well and are gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>These clean my sensitive teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I like these better, teeth feel clean and not to harsh on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Super soft brush-heads.</li>
            <li>These soft bristles are great and the heads aren&#x27;t too bit for my small mouth.</li>
            <li>I got my first cavity free dental check up in my life last month!</li>
            <li>Also, the brush head is the large size.</li>
            <li>I need super gentle, soft brushes for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I did so, and these heads are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I really should change to another brush</li>
            <li>So I brushed as lightly as I could</li>
            <li>When a company stands behind their product you know it has to be great.</li>
            <li>Get these, the real deal.</li>
            <li>While this brush is gentle on the gums, it does not have the stiffness to scrub the teeth.  </li>
            <li>you will need to replace these very often...</li>
            <li>I much prefer this.</li>
            <li>can you really say?</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be re-ordering and hopefully the price will remain reasonable.</li>
            <li>I must say that  these are much softer and work just as well.</li>
            <li>but I really like the Phillips Sonicare</li>
            <li>Wish someone else made the Diamond Cut tooth brush at a much cheaper price point.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be much softer.  </li>
            <li>The lifespan of each brush head also varies by how much you use them.</li>
            <li>I have receding gums despite all my efforts to be gentle with them.  </li>
            <li>Much gentler on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of faith</li>
            <li>whole family uses them now.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal Sonic are replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two boxes of these at a much slower rate than the recommended replacement cycle</li>
            <li>are the only toothbrush heads that offer me a comfortable cleaning.</li>
            <li>I prefer these to the standard heads available.</li>
            <li>It is softer than I bought from mart before, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>They are mighty pricey for simple toothbrush heads, but these are priced along with the market.</li>
            <li>I had been using the brushes that came with the unit and these are way much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li>Will not be the last time I order these, although I have now heard they are available at Sam&#x27;s as well as Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>will thanks you.  </li>
            <li>Product is gentle on teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>much softer than the pro series</li>
            <li>These are so much better on my somewhat sensitive receded gums than the standard brushes.</li>
            <li>These are definitely for the more sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use the regular brush setting instead of the sensitive now and that&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li>I have a sonicare toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t able to use it much because the brush head was too rough for my gums.  </li>
            <li>This works much better for me as my teeth were too sensitive with the regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive teeth, so i am sure this is only helping with that issue.</li>
            <li>The brushes that come with the Sonicare when you originally buy it are NOT soft and are VERY VERY abrasive on the gums and can lead to dental recession.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>These are our first heads for our new toothbrush-</li>
            <li>Just right for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>must be the only person this has happened to since all of the other reviews are good.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth clean and is gentle at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Went back to the original, the brushes have a softer texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brush heads also seem to have the same life span of the original brushes.</li>
            <li>Also, the price on Amazon is so much better than other stores.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the original brush that came with the brush</li>
            <li>The Sonicare brushes clean teeth better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried outside of the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I love the ultra soft brushes, I have very sensitive teeth from over zealous brushing when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I tried the soft version of this brush head.</li>
            <li>The ultra soft is better than regular soft brush for me.</li>
            <li>I always brush with a compact soft head tooth brush and bought these when I purchased my first Sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li>My first time using soft brushes instead of the standards and for me it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are very expensive but do a great job!</li>
            <li>When ordering new Sonicare toothbrushes, this item is needed and a bargain!</li>
            <li>I saw these soft sensitive brush heads and thought it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>So the four-star rating has nothing to do with Philips but the incomplete inventory of Amazon.com and my poor planning in more advanced ordering.</li>
            <li>But as with all of the heads, there is a gap between the head and the main unit.</li>
            <li>These sensitive brushes still work really well, but are much easier on my gums.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>Got here fast enough, but some bristles started coming out right away</li>
            <li>one concern with this head design was that it would not be able to get into the tight corners of my teeth the way the tinier Oral B could.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will update this review in about 6 months but for now I highly recommend these to anyone having gum pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended from the Dentist.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend this sensitive toothbrush head over the original one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth without irritating my gums and leave my mouth feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>These soft brushes clean just as well as the standard ones, but do not irritate the gums.</li>
            <li>These are so much softer than the other bristles, and I was using the most expensive diamond bristles because of the superior cleaning claims.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Soft Sensitive brush head is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>It is not claimed that this head gets as much plaque off as the Diamond head, but I have to have a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really seem that soft...</li>
            <li>, they are soft, but they also wear out extremely fast..</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have not found that to be an issue, and seems capable of doing a thorough cleaning just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft bristles work very well with those like me who are losing gum tissue.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle on my mom&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Great tooth brush however too expensive</li>
            <li>They fit on my toothbrush, just as expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need sensitive</li>
            <li>Much softer on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush handle &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; is a couple of years or so old, and this is a repeat order of brushes which are very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>However, I really like these because they are soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li>But when I recalled the time when I bought them, I could not find any &amp;#34;Sonicare Normal Standard&amp;#34; brush heads in the Amazon.com sites.  </li>
            <li>They are extra soft and comfortable on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Bought these because they were out of the normal Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I briefly tried an off brand and quickly found that they were not worth the &amp;#34;savings.&amp;#34;  Pay a little more and get the genuine item.</li>
            <li>Received 3 brushed in an easy open carton.  </li>
            <li>After using the Ultra Soft Head for a couple months, my teeth are no longer sensitive and the head seems to clean as well as the Proresults standard head.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say if you see any changes, you can probably say it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.</li>
            <li>Purchased these here on Amazon in a three-pack for my newly acquired Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>Even though other brushes feel like they clean better, they are harsh on the enamel and gums.  </li>
            <li>The truth is I change the brush heads more often because the wear indicators show up after a few weeks requiring frequent changes.</li>
            <li>They are ultra soft - but still do a credible job of cleaning without being rough on the gums and abrasive on enamel.</li>
            <li>The dark blue reminder bristles (that tell you when replacement is needed) fade far faster than what I&#x27;d think is normal and the bristles fray very easily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Very soft heads.  </li>
            <li>and yet I notice signs of wear very early into the recommended &#x27;3 month&#x27; life span of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>They are very soft and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>They are VERY soft.</li>
            <li>I did not mean to get sensitive when I ordered.</li>
            <li>The first time I brushed with Sonicare it felt like I had just been to the dental hygienist</li>
            <li>otherwise it will get pretty gross</li>
            <li>They work exactly the same yet cost 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li>They have worked very well for the last couple of months and are worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, but they do the job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li>On an earlier brush where the bristles stuck out further I simply snipped them off with scissors and that worked somewhat better.</li>
            <li>ProTip: be sure to dry the area between the toothbrush head and the body, remove the brush head and dry there -</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare but the original brush heads were a little to harsh.</li>
            <li>They seem to be just firm enough to do a good job yet soft enough not to injure your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These sensitive brush heads are such an improvement over the standard heads - they feel so comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be it doesn&#x27;t really fit the handle as well as the original brush heads that come with the set.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the main reason I don&#x27;t change as often as I should is that these packages are so @#$&amp;^% hard to open.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using an electric toothbrush, and just about gave up until I switched to the &amp;#34;ultra soft sensitive&amp;#34; brushes.  </li>
            <li>than that, on the plus side they are much softer than the normal standard brushes if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a brush.</li>
            <li>The regular pro results brush heads that came with the new brush would hurt my gums if I angled the brush a certain way, but with these sensitive brush heads, I never get any pain.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these 3 soft sensitive brush heads to go along with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was cheap there for a little bit and got a package of off brand toothbrush heads for my sonicare</li>
            <li>These fit and work well, but they seem to wear out a little quicker than the originals.</li>
            <li>Hard bristles may clean better but they can also wear enamel and gums down.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the small round head on another brand in spite of it&#x27;s claim to clean better.</li>
            <li>Since I have gum issues, the sensitive brushes feel a little better than the standard brushes.  </li>
            <li>I brush too hard, so at the behest of my dentist, tried a Sonicare toothbrush and, just to be safe, bought these ultra soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>These ultra soft brush heads really do make a big difference regarding sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>For sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a sonicare because even with these sensitive brushes, this type of toothbrush hurts my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like the soft bristles for my gums.</li>
            <li>I prefer soft to protect my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>and these are wonderfully soft but just a touch, a hint, a smidgen too soft.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li>My dentist keeps giving me soft tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>So for my Philips Soncare, I thought the soft tooth brush would help my gums without hurting my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and these brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my teeth have gone through phases in which they have been incredibly sensitive to all of them.</li>
            <li>These bristles really are softer than the regular ones.  </li>
            <li>So soft on my gums.</li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended me the soft brushes.</li>
            <li>But these sensitive brush heads help a lot.</li>
            <li>and these brushes did not cause any sensitivity in conjunction with sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A friend who is a dentist told me soft brushes are the way to go.  </li>
            <li>Its shape facilitates the cleaning action.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Sonicare Ultra Soft Sensitive brush, coupled with the Sonicare non-abrasive system, seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Three heads cost as much as the entire brush.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and these heads do the trick.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li>They are not too soft either, but &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; says Momma Bear.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE OF MY SENSITIVE TEETH.</li>
            <li>EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ULTRA SOFT.</li>
            <li>It truly works, and does not bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft as advertised and works.</li>
            <li>They are so much gentler on my gums than the standard brush.  </li>
            <li>These are much softer than the regular heads, but don&#x27;t seem to have a shorter life span.</li>
            <li>After each brushing, I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Finally, soft brush heads that are recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li>They are indeed much softer and gentler than the head that comes standard with the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I found these soft heads, I was quite surprised, as I had never heard of their existence.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for a week so far</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OEM replacement heads and they replaced my worn out, spongy, old heads.  </li>
            <li>These ultra soft brushes lived up to the manufacturer&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li>Save your gums and your teeth and go with the ultra soft.</li>
            <li>They work in our old unit</li>
            <li>Have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>We use these to help combat recession and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My gum is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I like the soft brush heads.</li>
            <li>I like and need soft brush heads.</li>
            <li>they are much softer that the regular.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and these work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Soft, do the job,</li>
            <li>They stay soft longer.</li>
            <li>Way too soft.</li>
            <li>This soft brush was recommended to me by a dental expert in gum care.  </li>
            <li>FYI, I also use the sensitive setting on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>As these are for sensitive gums, note that it may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not too big by any means - as an adult female with a smallish mouth and teeth, the size of this feels just right.</li>
            <li>The blue bristles near the top fade over time, usually my guide to replacing them.  </li>
            <li>All the Sonicare toothbrushes come with the standard brush heads, but I&#x27;d highly recommend getting the sensitive (this one) when it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>
            <li>Fit very tightly with the flexcare.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be more subtle.</li>
            <li>my local store would charge 30-35 for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>use a soft (not hard, not medium, and not ultra-soft) regular head.</li>
            <li>The regular one hurts the gum a little (even though I feel better and cleaner using the regular ones from costco).</li>
            <li>These are very soft bristles, softer than a regular soft brush, I would say.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a day older or an extra 5 minutes to open a package of new ones?</li>
            <li>The good news is these fit my brush, the bad news is, these are like wiping a wet cloth on your teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentists have always told me to use soft toothbrushes (and it seems like that&#x27;s what the general consensus is).</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, as its name stated is for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Functional, exactly as billed, and works as expected.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the bristles wear out quicker than the bristles on the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush head; therefore, you may need to replace more often.</li>
            <li>brush head is soft but not too soft and still feels like it is properly cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I switched from the Proresults standard head that came with the toothbrush to the Ultra Soft Head after my teeth became sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This model is much softer than the regular ones by the same company, including the kids model.</li>
            <li>Now if Phillips would only make sensitive brush heads in the compact size!</li>
            <li>They are difficult to find in stores, so I am glad Amazon carries tham!</li>
            <li>I was using the regular heads and my teeth had become extremely sensitive!  </li>
            <li>Extra soft and my teeth and mouth are thankful for that!  </li>
            <li>I have a tendency to brush too hard instead of holding the brush lightly and guiding it along like you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time putting the tips on the brush securely and removing them.</li>
            <li>but I recommend them for general teeth-feeling-cleanness.</li>
            <li>As the Dentist always says, &amp;#34; Only use soft brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This has a very different feel (milder) than the Diamond on Sensitive or Gum-Care.  </li>
            <li>After a deep cleaning and scaling a soft brush was recommended by my dental hygienist to mitigate sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipment was fast and as expected, I do recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush Heads are softer and slightly larger.</li>
            <li>The sensitive ones seem a bit easier on the gums than the regular Sonicare brushes without any loss of plaque removal.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the regular brush heads and this sensitive brush head.</li>
            <li>Big fan of the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush (which I completely recommend)</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer the soft bristles from this brush on my gums.  </li>
            <li>If you are gentle on your gums and have standard usage I don&#x27;t see why these wouldn&#x27;t last you an entire year.  </li>
            <li>The regular Sonicare brush heads often irritated my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>I felt the regular bristle brushes were not for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>After YEARS of pain just brushing my teeth, finally, I meet this Sensitive Brush.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the soft brush head.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has had sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make sensitive brushes specific for the diamondclean sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Made a big difference when i changed out an old head.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using the standard brush heads that came with the electric brush and decided to switch to the sensitive.</li>
            <li>Here is the only place I can find the sensitive brush style</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hard brusher nor a long brusher</li>
            <li>Sonicare recommend replacement of their brushes every three months but based on the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; on my brush and how quickly the dark blue ones fade to white, I&#x27;d say they</li>
            <li>Although they are much softer and gentler on your teeth and gums, these brushes just don&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li>It was not the right replacement brush it will not fit on my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The original brushes that came with the toothbrush were way too stiff and were too hard on my gums, these are just right.</li>
            <li>I have tried other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; tooth brushes before and never found much improvement in pain or irritation.</li>
            <li>Due to chronic illness, all the tissue in my mouth burns and just hurts so much.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to use an electric toothbrush until just this past year because of this brand that let me ramp things up slowly to get used to using it gently.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something not as rough as the standard intense bristles this may be for you.</li>
            <li>however, i was pleasantly surprised to find that these heads were not much different especially after a week</li>
            <li>I can tell a big difference from their regular soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I ran into these soft Philips brush heads by accident--I had been using the standard brush heads for years--when I was looking to find a set of replacements at a local store.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m surprised the blue indicator bristles almost fully disappear after a month&#x27;s use of regular brushing (2x a day, 2 minutes per</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this cleans my teeth worse or better than the standard, so I&#x27;m going with the softest option.</li>
            <li>the ultra soft sensitive allow me to thoroughly brush teeth and gums without any pain, bleeding, or other malady.  </li>
            <li>They are much less expensive than the other varieties at this price, and feel great on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>a little bit soft compare to normal one</li>
            <li>I only charge my batteries when they run low (a leftover response to the old NiCads which short out if left on the charger all the time).  </li>
            <li>These do work well for my sensitive teeth, however, they do not seem to last as long as the others.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what I needed, the regular heads are just too harsh for my gums</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have very sensitive gums, get harder or stiffer ones.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little softer, shaped a little differently and equally strong in sonicare cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The standard are pretty stiff for a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34; like me.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried several of the different heads due to the original style being too firm.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads are fine, but the blister pack is completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>After my brush head has been due for a replacement, I decided to try something &#x27;new&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I was hating the hard bristles and didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference these ultra soft bristles would make.</li>
            <li>I had to use the previously standard Sonicare stiff bristles, then, finally Sonicare realized that the recommended care of the teeth and gingiva is a soft brush with soft brushing!  </li>

            <li> It is amazing what a difference these brush heads make.</li>
            <li> They work great and are genuine sonicare not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Nice to have spares.</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t really a problem, just somewhat bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great toothbrush heads otherwise!</li>
            <li> you own one</li>
            <li> you own a Sonicare</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before,it is great my mouth feels clean and refreshed after use and all day.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new set of brush heads and this was the best deal I found.</li>
            <li> great price &amp; works great for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Good price, easy shipping.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive, and these were the best brushes I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums and this brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love that this item is so much more affordable on Amazon than in stores!</li>
            <li> They are very nice and feel great on those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Good price for genuine parts</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush for people that have sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li> For best results, I suggest pairing this head with a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with them, they are compact and soft , just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I liked the size of those better.</li>
            <li> HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum and I thought it was okay, but when I used it with these, it was amazing how polished my teeth seemed to be all day afterwards.  </li>
            <li> If your dentist recommends soft heads so you don&#x27;t beat yourself up (as I do), then these are perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> Best choice for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive teeth and receding gumline</li>
            <li> Perfect for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li> I just think it looks cool!!</li>
            <li> These strike just the right balance, and I am now so happy that I discovered these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These feel like very fine silk on your gums.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand,, very good price as well..</li>
            <li> I still get a really good clean.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is the best on the market and the sensitive brush heads make it a much better product.</li>
            <li> These are very gentle and great brushes for anybody with teeth issues.</li>
            <li> bristles are VERY gentle and do a great job of cleaning all of the plaque and calculus build-up.</li>
            <li> Works great, very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, teeth feel clean and according to my dentist they are clean.</li>
            <li> Philips is great about honoring their warranty and I will certainly turn to them again if this toothbrush ever dies.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves have soft bristles which are very good for my gums.  </li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I do better with a regular electric spinning brush, or the Collins manual brushes that are superb.</li>
            <li> I think they recommend replacing more often than every six months, but that&#x27;s what I do.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got these.</li>
            <li> I have to use soft bristles and these fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are nice and soft and feel great.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to remember to order them as I enrolled in the automatic mail program for an even better price.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Love my sonicare &amp; these brushes.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Oral B</li>
            <li> but my wife likes the Oral B better.</li>
            <li> It makes teeth brushing a much better experience.</li>
            <li> What more can you say?</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says my teeth and gums are as healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> fit to Philips Sonicare HX6053/64,good!</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare.</li>
            <li> much better than stiffer brushes</li>
            <li> These are OK</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner and in better shape.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of our the Sonicares.</li>
            <li> So glad I found them online, and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Everywhere else charges more for one than 3 sometimes for 4.</li>
            <li> Maybe the softness makes the bristles move around more?  </li>
            <li> I was glad that it fit my Sonicare that was purchased from Costco, as that model number doesn&#x27;t seem to exist on the Sonicare website!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> guess I need to replace my brushes more often?</li>
            <li> I like these better than any Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare and love it</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Had a perfect check-up at last dental visit.</li>
            <li> So much better than the ;OFF; brand</li>
            <li> Satisfied with all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare :)</li>
            <li> I will buy more when these wear out.</li>
            <li> and you have many choices on strength of cleaning even having one speed to massage gums.  </li>
            <li> And at $30 a box they better be :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t brush too</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> and this is definitely top of</li>
            <li> So the softer the bristles the better for me, and these are FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I tried the copies, but they just don&#x27;t work as well - get the actual item, made for your brush, and get the best results.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon price for these brushes was the best price I could find, including at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Makes the Sonicare even better than it was.</li>
            <li> Needed I say more?</li>
            <li> love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> My husband was able to forego his gum treatments because of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> get the brush with diferent function it work better.</li>
            <li> glad I got these.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I need them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and you get a great product for your favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
            <li> The brushheads are ok</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare System.</li>
            <li> But I think they have become my favorite brush.  </li>

            <li> I love thet</li>

            <li> These are great - very soft.</li>
            <li> I am so happy tohave found these soft bristle brush heads!  </li>
            <li> Authentic philips heads and arrived very fast!!</li>
            <li> great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> soft bristles are great for your gums.  </li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush for great cleaning, and to reduce my problem with receding, sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, it&#x27;s a great change of pace for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> These are the most comfortable brush heads I&#x27;ve found for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far they are great.</li>
            <li> Great soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are better than the original.</li>
            <li> Plus, they must be packed in tighter because it feels like they clean more of the tooth surface.  </li>
            <li> The sonic care system is great, just make sure to buy generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Work very well with my Sonicare and the softness of the brushes is excellent for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> easy five stars.</li>
            <li> The shipment came in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Price makes it easy to change your toothbrush every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are great heads and they are very soft and got then for a great deal compared to the regular.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call gentle, but they are very appropriate for brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare Easy Clean after hearing how much my son-in-law loved his.  </li>
            <li> Soft but still give you a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent and just as expected!!</li>
            <li> Love the Philips Sonicare Healthy White and these are excellent brush heads for those with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> They sent replacement heads immediately and they are fine.</li>
            <li> they arrived on time and worked fine.</li>
            <li> The brush head does not attach perfectly flush with the handle, but leans forward at a slight angle (see attached picture.)</li>
            <li> If the are on sale they are fine, but otherwise go with the diamond that is.</li>
            <li> Bought them because I needed the softer bristles and they have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t install the family-\\&quot;ID\\&quot; ring that can color code each head if you share a unit, but the brush fit perfectly on the stem, but with a slight gap for that ID ring.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush head and perfect for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> but the desccription was exact which made ordering very easy.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> These work and fit my Phillips Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These were a great price compared to buying them locally.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended I use the softest bristles I could find and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> However, these brushes fit and work well.  </li>
            <li> so I will be ready as my own wears out.</li>
            <li> When I using this one, I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li> They seem like cheap knock offs and the bristles are already wearing after just a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t quite fit all the way on to my Sonicare, but are the ones recommended for it.</li>
            <li> I have always used Sensitive Soft toothbrushes and these were the perfect replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li> These are really good for ones with sensitive mouths.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully will be good for sensitive gum .</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to brush right over my receding gum and the nearby teeth.</li>
            <li> Be sure that you order the right head for your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great - clean thoroughly but do not chew my gums up like the regular brush heads, IF I maintain a light touch.</li>
            <li> and they still clean fine and do not make my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> it is very useful</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit original toothbrush well.</li>
            <li> , it was so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> yet they still get my teeth smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> (which, to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t particularly care if it was the correct brush</li>
            <li> I had originally bought these bristles for gum health</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the Pro Results brush head that originally came with my Sonicare EasyClean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These bristles make my brushing with Sonic care fun!  </li>
            <li> It arrived early and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are not the brushes that came with my Diamondclean originally.  </li>
            <li> Softer than the original flex care brushes.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money!</li>
            <li> My teeth also keep clean all day and all night basically, with 2 brushings a day.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look really clean.</li>
            <li> Fits on my Diamond clean</li>
            <li> I was happy to have found these soft brushes, they much easier on my teeth</li>
            <li> THESE ALONG WITH THE SONICARE DIAMOND CLEAN ELECTRICE TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> TWO BRUSH HEADS CAME ALONG WITH THE DIAMOND CLEAN</li>
            <li> and you can UV clean them.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush but had tried the cheaper after market brush heads and did not find them to fit very well.</li>
            <li> Next, I need an electric brush that is not so loud (and this is the best of the bunch).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t switch to an electric tooth brush because I need to have a extra soft brush.this brush works perfectly.</li>
            <li> They also happen to be cheaper than the pro results and the diamond clean, so it seems like a no brainer.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t harm the gums but still clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles!</li>
            <li> (I can see no difference in cleaning ability from the original brush), but they are so much more gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using the brush, I no longer needed special gum sensitivity toothpaste, and the receding gum situation began to reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly fine on my brush model, which is an HX6530 for those who might be interested.</li>
            <li> The ultra soft brush is perfect for sensitive teeth and works just as good as any of the other brushes.</li>
            <li> Great, just as expected</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find, but these brushes are great.</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing, and this Brush Head is soft an comforatable on the gums.</li>
            <li> Mmmm, nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I appreciate so much having this product as I have used Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and soft, fits well.  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with the Ultra Sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> Were the same good quality as if bought in the stores but can&#x27;t seem to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> So I was thrilled to find these ultra soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Good thing they last</li>
            <li> I really like the softness of these so much better.</li>
            <li> And because that is true, brushing for longer (when I want to) is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on the gums.</li>
            <li> and I will buy them again instead paying full retail at the store for replacements.</li>
            <li> I use a good pair of package-opening shears and still, it was a pain to open this</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and these soft brushes are great for keeping my teeth clean and not creating any unwanted pain.  </li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes and these soft bristles are easy on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and gentle, but still do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the regular ProCare heads at a much lower price, but that is probably because so many more are sold.</li>
            <li> nice and last long for a great brushing</li>
            <li> And Amazon shipped them quickly.</li>
            <li> product as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly, and was just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I can now brush comfortably even on the most sensitive spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is mild to the teeth enamel and mouth gums cleaning well.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> Hence, you can actually brush better and more closely to the gumline.</li>
            <li> been looking for these everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find them this was super convenient to order online</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit relatively well, however the fit isn&#x27;t perfect and if you hold the toothbrush upside down while turned on to rinse it off after you&#x27;re done brushing your teeth the head slips almost all the way off</li>
            <li> I experienced a bit of gum loss with the original style which leads to sensitive teeth and potentially more problems on down the road.  </li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s terrified of the dentist, I find these are nice and soft, yet seem to clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> I love these brush heads as they are very soft.</li>
            <li> And I am certain that being able to brush without discomfort will encourage me to do it more consistently, and will help those sensitive areas to stay healthier.    </li>
            <li> This order arrived promptly and exactly as described and the correct size!  </li>
            <li> The ultra soft sensitive brush heads clean very well, and perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Unlike a hand toothbrush, where soft bristles don&#x27;t do a good job, the power toothbrushes with soft bristles clean fine--and most importantly, don&#x27;t make my gums feel like I&#x27;ve brushed with sandpaper.</li>
            <li> They clean really well too!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Sonicare brush head, very soft and gentle for people who tend to overdo it and/or have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with these heads: soft and pliable, able to reach those hard areas without much force.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few sonicare heads and definitely find these to be the best fit for me.  </li>
            <li> They are much more comfortable to use than the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> These brushes last me about 6-8 weeks each and do a nice job shining up my 68 y/o teeth ..</li>
            <li> I love these ultra soft heads.  </li>
            <li> Much better brushes for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> They arrived in time and I love that I could find this one with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Love how soft they are and my teeth feel so fresh after using them.</li>
            <li> I like this model a lot better than the old e-series.</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.</li>
            <li> Love how soft they are</li>
            <li> Better for the gums if yours are sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also, in checking with my dentist, the soft brushes are better for your gums.</li>
            <li> Love the sensitive alternative.  </li>
            <li> The heads do last 3 months and the UV cleaner makes me more comfortable that they aren&#x27;t breeding bacteria.</li>
            <li> If you brush frequently they must be replaced more often.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with fresh breathe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they sell these ultra soft brush heads, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if they brush as good as the harder brush heads, but they seem to.  </li>
            <li> They do a great job of cleaning, yet are soft enough not to hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> i like the old ones a lot better.</li>
            <li> A rounder softer front end, like the Oral-B Sensitive, might work even better.</li>
            <li> Worth every</li>
            <li> - I have gum recession and am sensitive in certain areas - this brush head feels comfortable and my teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as regular sonicare brushes but still better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But, when I contacted Philips, they sent me the right ones at no charge.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare gets it right every time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference right off.</li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> and the price was right</li>
            <li> I just hope the claims are true and our teeth are better served using the Sonicare toothbrushes over traditional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and when I returned to these, it really was a world of difference in softness and how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> They are much softer than the diamond clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice and soft, so it helps with getting used to this new way of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that came with the unit fit such that it could be put on the unit fairly easily, but these replacements could not be.  </li>
            <li> Dentist wants me to us the extra soft and these are great.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles, really feel great and last a while!  </li>
            <li> This product is as good if not better than the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but it doesn&#x27;t fit all the way on to my Philips Sonicare electric toothbruse, the same as the brushes I received with my toothbrush when I purchased it about 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I own 2 Sonicare models and when I purchased a newer model, I noticed on Amazon that Phillips now makes the Soft Sensitive brush that I&#x27;ve always wanted and ordered them.</li>
            <li> They clean just as well as the regular brush heads but are more gentle.</li>
            <li> These are soft brushes which are good for sensitive teeth, but being as soft as they are they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes the whole thing more tolerable on sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as they did with the Oral B, and in a month&#x27;s steady use, have yet to experience any sore gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the dentist says to use soft bristles but these are too soft to be really effective.</li>
            <li> Noticeably softer than regular pro-results brush heads, good for sensitive teeth or receding gums.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, work well.</li>
            <li> So far these brush heads are working fine.</li>
            <li> HX6311/02&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly fine for me and my 11 years old son.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;i normally use the regular head, but this is just as good.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered them when I first bought the toothbrush</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as marketed and on time.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of a problem when I first received these</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the ultra soft sensitive instead of the regular, but they still work great.</li>
            <li> It took a replacement of the first three that were sent.</li>
            <li> The first heads started to fall apart--the filaments were coming off in our mouths.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the softer bristles than the regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly as posted.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare but found the bristles on the regular toothbrushes to be too abrasive for my teeth.</li>
            <li> These heads are much better than the regular.  </li>
            <li> Standard ultra soft, great if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> So happy to have SOFT heads again, my teeth were starting to get really sensitive</li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive gums, and was routinely tearing up my gum-line with the softest brush head available for the Oral B electric</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add another observation as of 11/2/2013 -- I went for my regular dental check-up a couple of weeks ago, and my hygienist said my teeth \\&quot;look great.\\&quot;  :-)</li>
            <li> So glad I brought my electric brush back to life!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered the replacements head online</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes unfortunately cost an arm and a leg; this package had the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to be the same and perform as well as the ones I paid a lot more for on a national drugstore chains website.  </li>
            <li> Sure, there are only 4 in a pack.</li>
            <li> I should be able to tell by my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, but I cannot use the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li> Many with inner ear disorders would like a quieter brush, please.  </li>
            <li> these feel way way way better on my teeth and actually conform to my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes were recommend by my dentist and they work very well for fighting my receding gumline!</li>
            <li> I wish Phillips would come out with a smaller head to get at the bottom and top front teeth...</li>
            <li> I appreciate that Sonicare has this ultra soft consistency of brush available.</li>
            <li> I am so confident the batteries will last for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> This is a better buy than the local store if you sign up for the recurring shipments.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s where trouble can start, even with flossing and brushing with a good electronic</li>
            <li> , all I can say is that after using these for a few months, they have easily become my FAVORITE brush head for the Philips device.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, and I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush head, but it really is better catered to people with sensitive teeth like mine, I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> They are very gentle on your gums and really seem to do a better job than the regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, they leave my teeth feeling just as clean.  </li>
            <li> The ultra soft sensitive brushes have become my favorite brush head.</li>
            <li> I use the standard ones, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll have a soft brush head when it&#x27;s my turn.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller, who was insightful enough to understand dental care, and shipped the package safely, securely, and before anticipated!  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are noticeably more gentle than the standard brush heads.  </li>
            <li> High quality, easy on sensitive gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had positive results with all of them.</li>
            <li> It makes my Sonicare much more comfortable to use, and I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular \\&quot;ProResults</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent of what comes with your sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush heads are far superior to the regular ones.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles clean well and are gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> These clean my sensitive teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I like these better, teeth feel clean and not to harsh on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush-heads.</li>
            <li> These soft bristles are great and the heads aren&#x27;t too bit for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> I got my first cavity free dental check up in my life last month!</li>
            <li> Also, the brush head is the large size.</li>
            <li> I need super gentle, soft brushes for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I did so, and these heads are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I really should change to another brush</li>
            <li> So I brushed as lightly as I could</li>
            <li> When a company stands behind their product you know it has to be great.</li>
            <li> Get these, the real deal.</li>
            <li> While this brush is gentle on the gums, it does not have the stiffness to scrub the teeth.  </li>
            <li> you will need to replace these very often...</li>
            <li> I much prefer this.</li>
            <li> can you really say?</li>
            <li> They work very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be re-ordering and hopefully the price will remain reasonable.</li>
            <li> I must say that  these are much softer and work just as well.</li>
            <li> but I really like the Phillips Sonicare</li>
            <li> Wish someone else made the Diamond Cut tooth brush at a much cheaper price point.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be much softer.  </li>
            <li> The lifespan of each brush head also varies by how much you use them.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums despite all my efforts to be gentle with them.  </li>
            <li> Much gentler on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of faith</li>
            <li> whole family uses them now.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal Sonic are replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two boxes of these at a much slower rate than the recommended replacement cycle</li>
            <li> are the only toothbrush heads that offer me a comfortable cleaning.</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the standard heads available.</li>
            <li> It is softer than I bought from mart before, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> They are mighty pricey for simple toothbrush heads, but these are priced along with the market.</li>
            <li> I had been using the brushes that came with the unit and these are way much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> Will not be the last time I order these, although I have now heard they are available at Sam&#x27;s as well as Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> will thanks you.  </li>
            <li> Product is gentle on teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> much softer than the pro series</li>
            <li> These are so much better on my somewhat sensitive receded gums than the standard brushes.</li>
            <li> These are definitely for the more sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use the regular brush setting instead of the sensitive now and that&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have a sonicare toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t able to use it much because the brush head was too rough for my gums.  </li>
            <li> This works much better for me as my teeth were too sensitive with the regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> i have sensitive teeth, so i am sure this is only helping with that issue.</li>
            <li> The brushes that come with the Sonicare when you originally buy it are NOT soft and are VERY VERY abrasive on the gums and can lead to dental recession.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> These are our first heads for our new toothbrush-</li>
            <li> Just right for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> must be the only person this has happened to since all of the other reviews are good.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth clean and is gentle at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Went back to the original, the brushes have a softer texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brush heads also seem to have the same life span of the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, the price on Amazon is so much better than other stores.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the original brush that came with the brush</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brushes clean teeth better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried outside of the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I love the ultra soft brushes, I have very sensitive teeth from over zealous brushing when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried the soft version of this brush head.</li>
            <li> The ultra soft is better than regular soft brush for me.</li>
            <li> I always brush with a compact soft head tooth brush and bought these when I purchased my first Sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> My first time using soft brushes instead of the standards and for me it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very expensive but do a great job!</li>
            <li> When ordering new Sonicare toothbrushes, this item is needed and a bargain!</li>
            <li> I saw these soft sensitive brush heads and thought it might be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> So the four-star rating has nothing to do with Philips but the incomplete inventory of Amazon.com and my poor planning in more advanced ordering.</li>
            <li> But as with all of the heads, there is a gap between the head and the main unit.</li>
            <li> These sensitive brushes still work really well, but are much easier on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> Got here fast enough, but some bristles started coming out right away</li>
            <li> one concern with this head design was that it would not be able to get into the tight corners of my teeth the way the tinier Oral B could.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I will update this review in about 6 months but for now I highly recommend these to anyone having gum pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended from the Dentist.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this sensitive toothbrush head over the original one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth without irritating my gums and leave my mouth feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> These soft brushes clean just as well as the standard ones, but do not irritate the gums.</li>
            <li> These are so much softer than the other bristles, and I was using the most expensive diamond bristles because of the superior cleaning claims.</li>
            <li> The Ultra Soft Sensitive brush head is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li> It is not claimed that this head gets as much plaque off as the Diamond head, but I have to have a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really seem that soft...</li>
            <li> , they are soft, but they also wear out extremely fast..</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have not found that to be an issue, and seems capable of doing a thorough cleaning just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft bristles work very well with those like me who are losing gum tissue.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle on my mom&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush however too expensive</li>
            <li> They fit on my toothbrush, just as expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need sensitive</li>
            <li> Much softer on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; is a couple of years or so old, and this is a repeat order of brushes which are very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> However, I really like these because they are soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li> But when I recalled the time when I bought them, I could not find any &amp;#34;Sonicare Normal Standard&amp;#34; brush heads in the Amazon.com sites.  </li>
            <li> They are extra soft and comfortable on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Bought these because they were out of the normal Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I briefly tried an off brand and quickly found that they were not worth the &amp;#34;savings.&amp;#34;  Pay a little more and get the genuine item.</li>
            <li> Received 3 brushed in an easy open carton.  </li>
            <li> After using the Ultra Soft Head for a couple months, my teeth are no longer sensitive and the head seems to clean as well as the Proresults standard head.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say if you see any changes, you can probably say it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.</li>
            <li> Purchased these here on Amazon in a three-pack for my newly acquired Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> Even though other brushes feel like they clean better, they are harsh on the enamel and gums.  </li>
            <li> The truth is I change the brush heads more often because the wear indicators show up after a few weeks requiring frequent changes.</li>
            <li> They are ultra soft - but still do a credible job of cleaning without being rough on the gums and abrasive on enamel.</li>
            <li> The dark blue reminder bristles (that tell you when replacement is needed) fade far faster than what I&#x27;d think is normal and the bristles fray very easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Very soft heads.  </li>
            <li> and yet I notice signs of wear very early into the recommended &#x27;3 month&#x27; life span of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> They are very soft and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> They are VERY soft.</li>
            <li> I did not mean to get sensitive when I ordered.</li>
            <li> The first time I brushed with Sonicare it felt like I had just been to the dental hygienist</li>
            <li> otherwise it will get pretty gross</li>
            <li> They work exactly the same yet cost 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li> They have worked very well for the last couple of months and are worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, but they do the job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li> On an earlier brush where the bristles stuck out further I simply snipped them off with scissors and that worked somewhat better.</li>
            <li> ProTip: be sure to dry the area between the toothbrush head and the body, remove the brush head and dry there -</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare but the original brush heads were a little to harsh.</li>
            <li> They seem to be just firm enough to do a good job yet soft enough not to injure your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These sensitive brush heads are such an improvement over the standard heads - they feel so comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be it doesn&#x27;t really fit the handle as well as the original brush heads that come with the set.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the main reason I don&#x27;t change as often as I should is that these packages are so @#$&amp;^% hard to open.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using an electric toothbrush, and just about gave up until I switched to the &amp;#34;ultra soft sensitive&amp;#34; brushes.  </li>
            <li> than that, on the plus side they are much softer than the normal standard brushes if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a brush.</li>
            <li> The regular pro results brush heads that came with the new brush would hurt my gums if I angled the brush a certain way, but with these sensitive brush heads, I never get any pain.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these 3 soft sensitive brush heads to go along with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was cheap there for a little bit and got a package of off brand toothbrush heads for my sonicare</li>
            <li> These fit and work well, but they seem to wear out a little quicker than the originals.</li>
            <li> Hard bristles may clean better but they can also wear enamel and gums down.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the small round head on another brand in spite of it&#x27;s claim to clean better.</li>
            <li> Since I have gum issues, the sensitive brushes feel a little better than the standard brushes.  </li>
            <li> I brush too hard, so at the behest of my dentist, tried a Sonicare toothbrush and, just to be safe, bought these ultra soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> These ultra soft brush heads really do make a big difference regarding sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> For sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a sonicare because even with these sensitive brushes, this type of toothbrush hurts my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I like the soft bristles for my gums.</li>
            <li> I prefer soft to protect my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> and these are wonderfully soft but just a touch, a hint, a smidgen too soft.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li> My dentist keeps giving me soft tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> So for my Philips Soncare, I thought the soft tooth brush would help my gums without hurting my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums and these brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my teeth have gone through phases in which they have been incredibly sensitive to all of them.</li>
            <li> These bristles really are softer than the regular ones.  </li>
            <li> So soft on my gums.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended me the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> But these sensitive brush heads help a lot.</li>
            <li> and these brushes did not cause any sensitivity in conjunction with sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A friend who is a dentist told me soft brushes are the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Its shape facilitates the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Sonicare Ultra Soft Sensitive brush, coupled with the Sonicare non-abrasive system, seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Three heads cost as much as the entire brush.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums and these heads do the trick.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> They are not too soft either, but &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; says Momma Bear.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE OF MY SENSITIVE TEETH.</li>
            <li> EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ULTRA SOFT.</li>
            <li> It truly works, and does not bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft as advertised and works.</li>
            <li> They are so much gentler on my gums than the standard brush.  </li>
            <li> These are much softer than the regular heads, but don&#x27;t seem to have a shorter life span.</li>
            <li> After each brushing, I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Finally, soft brush heads that are recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li> They are indeed much softer and gentler than the head that comes standard with the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I found these soft heads, I was quite surprised, as I had never heard of their existence.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a week so far</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OEM replacement heads and they replaced my worn out, spongy, old heads.  </li>
            <li> These ultra soft brushes lived up to the manufacturer&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li> Save your gums and your teeth and go with the ultra soft.</li>
            <li> They work in our old unit</li>
            <li> Have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> We use these to help combat recession and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My gum is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like the soft brush heads.</li>
            <li> I like and need soft brush heads.</li>
            <li> they are much softer that the regular.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and these work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Soft, do the job,</li>
            <li> They stay soft longer.</li>
            <li> Way too soft.</li>
            <li> This soft brush was recommended to me by a dental expert in gum care.  </li>
            <li> FYI, I also use the sensitive setting on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As these are for sensitive gums, note that it may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too big by any means - as an adult female with a smallish mouth and teeth, the size of this feels just right.</li>
            <li> The blue bristles near the top fade over time, usually my guide to replacing them.  </li>
            <li> All the Sonicare toothbrushes come with the standard brush heads, but I&#x27;d highly recommend getting the sensitive (this one) when it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>
            <li> Fit very tightly with the flexcare.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be more subtle.</li>
            <li> my local store would charge 30-35 for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> use a soft (not hard, not medium, and not ultra-soft) regular head.</li>
            <li> The regular one hurts the gum a little (even though I feel better and cleaner using the regular ones from costco).</li>
            <li> These are very soft bristles, softer than a regular soft brush, I would say.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a day older or an extra 5 minutes to open a package of new ones?</li>
            <li> The good news is these fit my brush, the bad news is, these are like wiping a wet cloth on your teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentists have always told me to use soft toothbrushes (and it seems like that&#x27;s what the general consensus is).</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, as its name stated is for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> Functional, exactly as billed, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the bristles wear out quicker than the bristles on the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush head; therefore, you may need to replace more often.</li>
            <li> brush head is soft but not too soft and still feels like it is properly cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I switched from the Proresults standard head that came with the toothbrush to the Ultra Soft Head after my teeth became sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This model is much softer than the regular ones by the same company, including the kids model.</li>
            <li> Now if Phillips would only make sensitive brush heads in the compact size!</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find in stores, so I am glad Amazon carries tham!</li>
            <li> I was using the regular heads and my teeth had become extremely sensitive!  </li>
            <li> Extra soft and my teeth and mouth are thankful for that!  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush too hard instead of holding the brush lightly and guiding it along like you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time putting the tips on the brush securely and removing them.</li>
            <li> but I recommend them for general teeth-feeling-cleanness.</li>
            <li> As the Dentist always says, &amp;#34; Only use soft brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This has a very different feel (milder) than the Diamond on Sensitive or Gum-Care.  </li>
            <li> After a deep cleaning and scaling a soft brush was recommended by my dental hygienist to mitigate sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipment was fast and as expected, I do recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush Heads are softer and slightly larger.</li>
            <li> The sensitive ones seem a bit easier on the gums than the regular Sonicare brushes without any loss of plaque removal.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the regular brush heads and this sensitive brush head.</li>
            <li> Big fan of the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush (which I completely recommend)</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer the soft bristles from this brush on my gums.  </li>
            <li> If you are gentle on your gums and have standard usage I don&#x27;t see why these wouldn&#x27;t last you an entire year.  </li>
            <li> The regular Sonicare brush heads often irritated my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I felt the regular bristle brushes were not for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> After YEARS of pain just brushing my teeth, finally, I meet this Sensitive Brush.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the soft brush head.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has had sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make sensitive brushes specific for the diamondclean sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Made a big difference when i changed out an old head.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the standard brush heads that came with the electric brush and decided to switch to the sensitive.</li>
            <li> Here is the only place I can find the sensitive brush style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hard brusher nor a long brusher</li>
            <li> Sonicare recommend replacement of their brushes every three months but based on the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; on my brush and how quickly the dark blue ones fade to white, I&#x27;d say they</li>
            <li> Although they are much softer and gentler on your teeth and gums, these brushes just don&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> It was not the right replacement brush it will not fit on my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The original brushes that came with the toothbrush were way too stiff and were too hard on my gums, these are just right.</li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; tooth brushes before and never found much improvement in pain or irritation.</li>
            <li> Due to chronic illness, all the tissue in my mouth burns and just hurts so much.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to use an electric toothbrush until just this past year because of this brand that let me ramp things up slowly to get used to using it gently.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something not as rough as the standard intense bristles this may be for you.</li>
            <li> however, i was pleasantly surprised to find that these heads were not much different especially after a week</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference from their regular soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I ran into these soft Philips brush heads by accident--I had been using the standard brush heads for years--when I was looking to find a set of replacements at a local store.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m surprised the blue indicator bristles almost fully disappear after a month&#x27;s use of regular brushing (2x a day, 2 minutes per</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this cleans my teeth worse or better than the standard, so I&#x27;m going with the softest option.</li>
            <li> the ultra soft sensitive allow me to thoroughly brush teeth and gums without any pain, bleeding, or other malady.  </li>
            <li> They are much less expensive than the other varieties at this price, and feel great on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> a little bit soft compare to normal one</li>
            <li> I only charge my batteries when they run low (a leftover response to the old NiCads which short out if left on the charger all the time).  </li>
            <li> These do work well for my sensitive teeth, however, they do not seem to last as long as the others.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I needed, the regular heads are just too harsh for my gums</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have very sensitive gums, get harder or stiffer ones.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little softer, shaped a little differently and equally strong in sonicare cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The standard are pretty stiff for a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34; like me.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several of the different heads due to the original style being too firm.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads are fine, but the blister pack is completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> After my brush head has been due for a replacement, I decided to try something &#x27;new&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I was hating the hard bristles and didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference these ultra soft bristles would make.</li>
            <li> I had to use the previously standard Sonicare stiff bristles, then, finally Sonicare realized that the recommended care of the teeth and gingiva is a soft brush with soft brushing!  </li>
            <li> I hope the other two brushes are at least free from defect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as others ---- due their soft brush.</li>
            <li> They do not last quite as long as the traditional set that come with the brush initially.  </li>
            <li> I decided the money on new toothbrush heads is far less than any other dental care</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is the dark blue indicator that tells you when to change heads doesn&#x27;t fade as much as the other heads I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They last that long, and are starting to show some bristle bending about that time.  </li>
            <li> main concern with using an electric toothbrush is that the brushing could be too harsh for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Diamond tip Philips Sonicare brush heads, and for the first time in using my Philips device after years, I found I could not use it because the Diamond Head design was much, much to hard.</li>
            <li> I found the standard brushes too stiff and irritating to my gums, even with very light pressure.  </li>
            <li> These are softer bristles than the usual ProCare heads for the Sonicare toothbrush, and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Probably as result of this, these brushes don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the originals.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be lasting a long time without distorting or falling apart.  </li>
            <li> I only wish i didn&#x27;t wait as long to purchase these.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find soft sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> At least I can use the hard bristle models to clean the grout in my bathroom shower or to remove the finish on an old dresser.</li>
            <li> I found these soft and preferable to the slightly stiffer brush that came packaged with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> One brush which I am currently using has some bristles coming out making it difficult to brush smoothly.  </li>
            <li> so I tried the Ultra Soft head with much less gum irritation.</li>
            <li> I have slightly receding gums so my gums can be really sensitive</li>
            <li> and I got these sensitive heads because the regular ones were just a bit too harsh on my gums.</li>
            <li> After using these I would never go back to the harder brushed type....</li>
            <li> Not many people need an extra soft head for their electric toothbrush, but if you do, this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> They are not rough on the gums like the other Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to brush too hard with other styles of brushes which can eat your enamel right off your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I once had a Sonicare Elite model which had very rough bristles and only one type of head choice.</li>
            <li> I expect the shaft is just too long.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know just how long the bristles will hold up</li>
            <li> And, I do have to ask: what took so long to think of this?  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the become stained only after a few uses, which is not all that pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Man I wish I had tried these a long time ago...</li>
            <li> (long term wear)</li>
            <li> They are not perfectly straight or brilliantly white.</li>
            <li> What comes standard is way too rough for tender mouths.</li>
            <li> I had noticed gum irritation and recession and finally, both seem to have calmed down with using these, even though it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The area i very sensitive to hot and cold, and was starting to hurt from brushing.</li>
            <li> These batteries last for months between charges (it seems), longer that any other brush, ever.  </li>
            <li> SInce I was needed a brush head urgently, I was forced to order &amp;#34;Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The regular brush heads are to stiff but last longer.</li>
            <li> Will have to see if they last as long as the previous ones.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped, making an electric toothbrush pretty expensive to use over a lifetime</li>
            <li> Even sensitive toothpaste wasn&#x27;t helping and it usually does.  </li>
            <li> The ones that come with the brush are a little too hard at first.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B electric toothbrush for about 20 years, but the last 5 years or so been unhappy with the results; my teeth did not feel really clean even after a thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> Once the white gets to about 1/3 of the way down</li>
            <li> These ultra sensitive heads are difficult to find but are highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> No irritation with abrasion as per previous years with the regular Sonicare replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than the previous solution which was to soak a regular head before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Sonicare for several years now and have always bought the regular small head brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are a little softer than the standard ones, though.</li>
            <li> When using regular brush head,gum will bleeding a little.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because these brush heads are a little softer than I thought they would be when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> but they fit very poorly on the toothbrush, there is a half inch gap where crud collects.</li>
            <li> and they are just too hard for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so hard to find these Ultra Soft brushes in stores</li>
            <li> soft on the gums and hard on the plaque.</li>
            <li> Diamond heads are too hard as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The recipient has always used soft toothbrushes and severely dislikes &#x27;medium&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27; toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the softer ones, I think I&#x27;ll stick to the regular ones next time, which are not that hard anyway.</li>
            <li> I started to press harder on the toothbrush to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads perform as expected.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my toothbrush and could not send back because I had to break the packing to try it out.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;A&#x27; list.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li> I did not really need to buy three at one time but for the price I could not pass it up.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to write.  </li>
            <li> i was missing some crevices with the standard head and already has some discussion with my dentist about reducing my gum recession.</li>
            <li> sonicare brusheads lasts several months at a time.. while these lasted no more than 1 month.</li>
            <li> I do wish that they came in the small size though as some of us have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> I was using the &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; heads, which I thought I would like but actually seemed too small.</li>
            <li> The other one keep your teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> It must be remembered that ANY brush head is to be replaced after three months, and there has been no evidence that I have seen that these wear out any faster than the other stiffness brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> other than that...</li>
            <li> It can be done - it&#x27;s not hard, but for someone whose hands are weak for whatever reason these were a bit tight.  </li>
            <li> I use these heads for myself as well as my children (since kids tend to brush too hard I&#x27;d recommend these over the regular ones).</li>
            <li> The regular Sonicare brush heads were too hard on my gums</li>
            <li> It is the same size as the Diamond, so I still have trouble getting my inside front teeth in my small mouth.  </li>
            <li> At least they didn&#x27;t have to peel me off the ceiling last dentist visit.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive teeth, and they have gotten worse since I&#x27;ve had braces.</li>
            <li> Then he quieted down.  </li>
            <li> The small head takes way too long to brush my teeth!  </li>
            <li> My gums are receding and I know I am to blame because I&#x27;ve always brushed a little too hard.</li>
            <li> And because of my recent experience with the overly hard Diamond style, I now wondered if these soft bristles would be bad in the opposite end of the spectrum, something like puting a wet mop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am hoping they striate my teeth less.</li>
            <li> I pay less attention to the indicator bristle color than to the way the brush feels.</li>
            <li> Rougher vibration than any previous replacements.</li>
            <li> The other heads are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Hot, cold, pressure, sweets, acids, you name it...</li>
            <li> the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I saved a little money buying them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A little pricy and</li>
            <li> Or perhaps they were manufactured a little off...?</li>
            <li> Hygienist said no significant plaque.</li>
            <li> This little wonder lets me drinking coffee to my heart’s content, yet, not upset my dentist.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I reorder when we get down to one!  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the packaging is hard to get into.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the product except these were too soft for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper knockoffs.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with a receeding gum on one of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Product does not fit and company will not refund or return item.</li>
            <li> It was not the toothbrush head pictured and does not fit my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work well and aren&#x27;t too harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> now I use my sonicare everyday.  </li>
            <li> These are way too soft, it feels like you aren&#x27;t brushing with anything, weird.</li>
            <li> I was buying brush heads at Costco, and thought the bristles were a little too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Then they started selling the newest brush heads which are really stiff.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff bristles will cause gum erosion.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy I had to use the normal Sonicare brushes for my toothbrush for years, the stiff bristles did indeed damage my anterior gingiva, but, I changed routines............</li>
            <li> It also whitened my teeth a few shades - not sure if it is the sonic or just brushing longer.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a generic (so much less expensive) and was not pleased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting a little hard to find them in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Was brushing with a firm brush which is hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I get between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> if you are sharing the base, then these aren&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the replacement heads yet, but like the small head on the brush.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums and these brush heads make brushing my teeth so much less painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The anti-pilfering packaging is completely unnecessary as every drugstore in our area keeps these behind lock and key, and who can reach through the monitor to steal these from Amazon?</li>
            <li> My dentist is always telling me I brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> ..what is the trick to getting into the hard plastic package?.</li>
            <li> and my dentist told me I was brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Any dentist, I am not a DDS, but, an MD........will tell you NOT to brush with hard brushes or to brush to hard, period.  </li>
            <li> I do not brush hard and the bristles are already turning outward.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse hard bristles with cleaning performance.  </li>
            <li> At least I have three in store.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean?</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;lingual\\&quot; side is hard to brush!</li>
            <li> Buy the regular version or prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are so hard I am afraid they will take what little enamel I have off my roots!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small space, a millimeter or two wide, between the plastic base of the Sonicare and the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I wish I looked at these in a store to see how it compared to the heads that game with my sonic care brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about that)</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with them; just turned out not to work with my toothbrush model.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Try them, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have even skipped brushings on occasion, because my teeth were bothering me and brushing was an uncomfortable experience.</li>
            <li> I hated the intercare that came with my sonicare toothbrush which was too rough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Just rubs me the wrong way I guess.</li>
            <li> For another wrong replacement, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>
            <li> It works, but awfully expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The three brushes come in one of those nasty clamshell packs that require careful cutting, laser-drilling followed by hooking up a winch and a come-along to extract them from the package.</li>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t bleed like crazy.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately i cannot help on that decision :(</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was actually painful to brush my teeth with.</li>
            <li> Crud doesn&#x27;t build up under the head base nor under the handle base.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible, I know.    </li>
            <li> you still can get a nasty cut on your finger as you struggle to extract these from the packaging.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fit perfect and do the job</li>
            <li> The ultra soft sensitive brushes have become my favorite brush head.</li>
            <li> These are so much softer than the other bristles, and I was using the most expensive diamond bristles because of the superior cleaning claims. I had noticed gum irritation and recession and finally, both seem to have calmed down with using these, even though it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks. I wish I had discovered them when I first bought the toothbrush (I have the Flex Plus version.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering trying these, go for it. They are much less expensive than the other varieties at this price, and feel great on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I found these soft and preferable to the slightly stiffer brush that came packaged with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly as advertised.  High quality, easy on sensitive gums and teeth.  And Amazon shipped them quickly. I briefly tried an off brand and quickly found that they were not worth the &amp;#34;savings.&amp;#34;  Pay a little more and get the genuine item.</li>
            <li> As the Dentist always says, &amp;#34; Only use soft brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love these. Soft but still give you a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Good price for genuine parts</li>
            <li> a little bit soft compare to normal one but good to use!</li>
            <li> I have some grooves worn in my teeth from over-aggressive brushing. These ultra-sensitive heads make all the difference in comfort for me.</li>
            <li> Replaceable heads to Sonicare electric toothbrush.  My son uses it every day and would recommend to others to use it.</li>
            <li> For sensitive teeth. You can&#x27;t beat the price here on Amazon either! I use these heads for myself as well as my children (since kids tend to brush too hard I&#x27;d recommend these over the regular ones).</li>
            <li> the ultra soft sensitive allow me to thoroughly brush teeth and gums without any pain, bleeding, or other malady.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare owner since they came on the market. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to use a regular tooth brush and I take mine everywhere I go. I own 2 Sonicare models and when I purchased a newer model, I noticed on Amazon that Phillips now makes the Soft Sensitive brush that I&#x27;ve always wanted and ordered them. The softer brush is wonderful and a great addition to the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> These were great!  My teeth are very sensitive, and these were the best brushes I have ever had.</li>
            <li> just what I needed was a refill and I got it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a sonicare because even with these sensitive brushes, this type of toothbrush hurts my teeth.  But my father uses sonicare, and he finds these excellent.  So for anyone who uses a sonicare, I recommend them.  I do better with a regular electric spinning brush, or the Collins manual brushes that are superb.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the product except these were too soft for me.  I started to press harder on the toothbrush to get the job done.  Probably as result of this, these brushes don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the originals.</li>
            <li> Teeth do not hurt using these brushes....great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, perfect shipping!</li>
            <li> Great just like the are suppose to be</li>
            <li> product as described and shipped quickly.  excellent price</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B electric toothbrush for about 20 years, but the last 5 years or so been unhappy with the results; my teeth did not feel really clean even after a thorough brushing. The first time I brushed with Sonicare it felt like I had just been to the dental hygienist, it was so clean and smooth. My teeth also keep clean all day and all night basically, with 2 brushings a day. My teeth feel and look really clean. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> These are very soft bristles, softer than a regular soft brush, I would say.  Big difference from the Diamond brush head!  The part  I don&#x27;t like is that the pattern of the wave is different from that of the Diamond head.  I&#x27;m not sure I get between my teeth as well.  It is the same size as the Diamond, so I still have trouble getting my inside front teeth in my small mouth.  The small head takes way too long to brush my teeth!  This has a very different feel (milder) than the Diamond on Sensitive or Gum-Care.  It is not claimed that this head gets as much plaque off as the Diamond head, but I have to have a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Great price and works</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested getting a Sonicare to brush.  I did so, and these heads are reasonably priced.  I think they recommend replacing more often than every six months, but that&#x27;s what I do.  They last that long, and are starting to show some bristle bending about that time.  Teeth should last a lifetime, but they require a bit of help.  Glad I got these.</li>
            <li> Mmmm, nice and soft. I have to use soft bristles and these fit the bill perfectly. I have been using the regular ones that come with it and they are just too hard for my sensitive gums.  These are nice and soft and feel great.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I needed. Very soft brush head and perfect for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Best prices I can find for Philips Sonicare are on Amazon.com.  I just hope the claims are true and our teeth are better served using the Sonicare toothbrushes over traditional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF !! NO PROBLEMS !!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great - clean thoroughly but do not chew my gums up like the regular brush heads, IF I maintain a light touch.</li>
            <li> This is a toothbrush head. It does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush.  I like the soft bristles for my gums. I wish the rings were permanently attached to make it easier to keep up with the extra brushes not in use.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for our two sonic are toothbrushes!  I reorder when we get down to one!  Color changes when they are worn out!</li>
            <li> I ordered these 3 soft sensitive brush heads to go along with my new Sonicare toothbrush.  The product was delivered quickly, and was just what I ordered.  The brushes themselves have soft bristles which are very good for my gums.  I appreciate so much having this product as I have used Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> It is sold as a 3 pack of brushes but there are only 2 brushes in package.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as marketed and on time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and I like the feel of these brushes. However, the Dental Hygienists keep asking me if I change the brush heads every three months because of the plaque and tartar built up on my teeth. The truth is I change the brush heads more often because the wear indicators show up after a few weeks requiring frequent changes. The regular brush heads are to stiff but last longer. I really should change to another brush but I like the shape of this model. I don&#x27;t care for the small round head on another brand in spite of it&#x27;s claim to clean better.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles clean well and are gentle on the gums.  &#x27;Need to be replaced about every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love the Philips Sonicare Healthy White and these are excellent brush heads for those with sensitive gums. They are much more comfortable to use than the standard brush heads. Now if Phillips would only make sensitive brush heads in the compact size!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with them; just turned out not to work with my toothbrush model.  But, when I contacted Philips, they sent me the right ones at no charge.  Gotta love doing business with a company like that!</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush-heads.</li>
            <li> i bought it without discount，unhappy</li>
            <li> I prefer soft to protect my teeth and gums.  Hard bristles may clean better but they can also wear enamel and gums down.  These soft bristles are great and the heads aren&#x27;t too bit for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. Generics are as good for a fifth of the cost.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and these soft brushes are great for keeping my teeth clean and not creating any unwanted pain.  The price is awesome and I don&#x27;t have to remember to order them as I enrolled in the automatic mail program for an even better price.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good price with the convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this cleans my teeth worse or better than the standard, so I&#x27;m going with the softest option. The only negative is that the bristles wear out quicker than the bristles on the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush head; therefore, you may need to replace more often.</li>
            <li> My dentist is always telling me I brush too hard.  So I brushed as lightly as I could and then he says I&#x27;m not brushing well enough.  Frustrating.  I saw these soft sensitive brush heads and thought it might be worth a try.  I love them.  I can brush without scratching up my gums in the process and yet they still get my teeth smooth and clean.  They are soft but they clean teeth perfectly.  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says on my next visit this summer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really seem that soft...</li>
            <li> I had a bit of a problem when I first received these but when I brought it to the company&#x27;s attention they made everything just perfect and I could not be happier. This product is as good if not better than the original manufacturer. When a company stands behind their product you know it has to be great. I highly recommend this brand,, very good price as well.. Go for it!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads for your Sonicare.  They do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I bought these Philips Sonicare toothbrushes to replace the one I had that was in need of replacement.  I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper knockoffs. Get these, the real deal. They last forever.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! I accidentally ordered the ultra soft sensitive instead of the regular, but they still work great.</li>
            <li> It took a replacement of the first three that were sent. The first heads started to fall apart--the filaments were coming off in our mouths.  They sent replacement heads immediately and they are fine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and these are wonderfully soft but just a touch, a hint, a smidgen too soft. ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried the soft version of this brush head. I won&#x27;t go back to the regular ones. My mouth feels so much more clean with these!</li>
            <li> Love the soft bristles. Fits on my Diamond clean</li>
            <li> make my teeth very, very clean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> The ultra soft is better than regular soft brush for me.</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle. Love it!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product? I needed replacement brushes for my Philips Sonicare. I ordered them and I received them. It isn&#x27;t as if I had any choice in manufacturer, unless someone knows something I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> These brushes last me about 6-8 weeks each and do a nice job shining up my 68 y/o teeth ..Problem..what is the trick to getting into the hard plastic package?. sometimes I cut myself trying to cut the package with scissors.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace the old ones. Nice to have spares.</li>
            <li> PPP&#x3D;Perfectly pleasing purchase</li>
            <li> No gum irritation with these heads.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for the Philips Sonicare.  My dentist keeps giving me soft tooth brush.  So for my Philips Soncare, I thought the soft tooth brush would help my gums without hurting my mouth.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love these ultra soft heads.  Dentist wants me to us the extra soft and these are great.  Try them, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare &amp; these brushes. I alternate between the one&#x27;s that came with my Sonicare &amp; these. They attach perfectly &amp; are softer than the one that came with my set.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit original toothbrush well. if you are sharing the base, then these aren&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and soft, fits well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are great heads and they are very soft and got then for a great deal compared to the regular. They are very similar to the regular heads. I would just buy which ever one is cheaper but do not buy the knock off ones because you will be wasting your money buying something that doesn&#x27;t work. I got these for $20!</li>
            <li> These ultra soft brush heads really do make a big difference regarding sensitivity.  After a deep cleaning and scaling a soft brush was recommended by my dental hygienist to mitigate sensitivity issues.  These work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are so much better on my somewhat sensitive receded gums than the standard brushes. I only wish I had found these sooner since I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads as they are very soft. They clean just as well as the regular brush heads but are more gentle. They do wear out faster than the regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good power, cleaning. Just what I hoped for. I like it better than the Oral B but my wife likes the Oral B better. The Sonicare tickles her gums.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, really feel great and last a while!  The blue bristles near the top fade over time, usually my guide to replacing them.  Once the white gets to about 1/3 of the way down it&#x27;s time for a change.  ProTip: be sure to dry the area between the toothbrush head and the body, remove the brush head and dry there - otherwise it will get pretty gross pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast and as expected, I do recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> They were for my kids toothbrush.  They haven&#x27;t complain, so it good for me.  I also have the sonicare one and they both feels same too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> it is very useful&lt;br /&gt;i need this</li>
            <li> Loved the price and timeliness of this product.</li>
            <li> Affordable replacement heads</li>
            <li> I really like my Sonicare Toothbrush, but was not a fan of the rather firm, compact brush head that it came with. Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush Heads are softer and slightly larger. It makes my Sonicare much more comfortable to use, and I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular \\&quot;ProResults Compact\\&quot; brush heads again.</li>
            <li> I was cheap there for a little bit and got a package of off brand toothbrush heads for my sonicare and when I returned to these, it really was a world of difference in softness and how clean my teeth felt. I believe these are about $5 cheaper than in store too!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed according to my dentist.  Been using this product ever since.  I have sensitive teeth and gums and these brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know of any merchant that carries them locally so really am happy to be able to get them online.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are better than the original. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Much better brushes for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Good price - will purchase again</li>
            <li> They arrived in time and I love that I could find this one with soft bristles. It makes teeth brushing a much better experience.</li>
            <li> What more can you say? The sensitive ones seem a bit easier on the gums than the regular Sonicare brushes without any loss of plaque removal. My dental hygienist says my teeth and gums are as healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> they arrived on time and worked fine.</li>
            <li> Love the softer bristles than the regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love how soft they are and my teeth feel so fresh after using them.</li>
            <li> I like this model a lot better than the old e-series. Crud doesn&#x27;t build up under the head base nor under the handle base. And it brushes my teeth just as effectively!</li>
            <li> Exactly as posted. Authentic philips heads and arrived very fast!!</li>
            <li> Service was prompt and good.  One brush which I am currently using has some bristles coming out making it difficult to brush smoothly.  This is not the fault in delivery but in manufacturing.  I hope the other two brushes are at least free from defect.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. I finally went ahead and ordered these from Amazon because no one sold them in stores. I have been having trouble with a receeding gum on one of my teeth. The area i very sensitive to hot and cold, and was starting to hurt from brushing. I decided the money on new toothbrush heads is far less than any other dental care so I should give these a try. I have tried other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; tooth brushes before and never found much improvement in pain or irritation. These are different. These feel like very fine silk on your gums. I&#x27;m able to brush right over my receding gum and the nearby teeth. I will update this review in about 6 months but for now I highly recommend these to anyone having gum pain.</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit relatively well, however the fit isn&#x27;t perfect and if you hold the toothbrush upside down while turned on to rinse it off after you&#x27;re done brushing your teeth the head slips almost all the way off and you have to push it back on. Yes, I double checked I have the matching model and brush so this isn&#x27;t the issue.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush for people that have sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive teeth, and they have gotten worse since I&#x27;ve had braces. Hot, cold, pressure, sweets, acids, you name it... my teeth have gone through phases in which they have been incredibly sensitive to all of them. I have even skipped brushings on occasion, because my teeth were bothering me and brushing was an uncomfortable experience. Terrible, I know.    I found these Sonicare heads when I was searching for a replacement for the standard head that my toothbrush came with. I thought, why not give it a shot.    It is amazing what a difference these brush heads make. They are definitely softer than the standard version. I can now brush comfortably even on the most sensitive spots on my teeth. And I am certain that being able to brush without discomfort will encourage me to do it more consistently, and will help those sensitive areas to stay healthier.    They fit perfectly fine on my brush model, which is an HX6530 for those who might be interested. The brush head does not attach perfectly flush with the handle, but leans forward at a slight angle (see attached picture.) This does not seem to affect functionality whatsoever.    For best results, I suggest pairing this head with a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Sensodyne ProNamel has worked well for me.    The only complaint I have about this product is that the packaging is hard to get into.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush head for the last month or so and I love it.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to the regular bristles.  These bristles really are softer than the regular ones.  Plus, they must be packed in tighter because it feels like they clean more of the tooth surface.  I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare but found the bristles on the regular toothbrushes to be too abrasive for my teeth. I am so thrilled with the Ultra Sensitive brushes. They are great for people with recessed gums.</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.</li>
            <li> I always buy my refills on Amazon</li>
            <li> No biggie. Replacement brushes</li>
            <li> fit to Philips Sonicare HX6053/64,good!</li>
            <li> These heads are much better than the regular.  The regular seem like sandpaper to me.  These aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call gentle, but they are very appropriate for brushing.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush and brushes ever!&lt;br /&gt;It is so hard to find these Ultra Soft brushes in stores&lt;br /&gt;But I can always depend upon Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivery service is very good. Item is quite good.</li>
            <li> I appreciate getting the brushes I need. Had difficulty finding them.</li>
            <li> The ultra soft brush is perfect for sensitive teeth and works just as good as any of the other brushes.</li>
            <li> I need super gentle, soft brushes for my Sonicare. These do the trick nicely!</li>
            <li> Great product and my husband loves this. He does not have to worry about not having brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> While this brush is gentle on the gums, it does not have the stiffness to scrub the teeth.  It leaves my teeth feeling like they have a film on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have very sensitive gums, get harder or stiffer ones.</li>
            <li> These are soft brushes which are good for sensitive teeth, but being as soft as they are they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Wish I found this before. So soft on my gums. No irritation with abrasion as per previous years with the regular Sonicare replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It was not the right replacement brush it will not fit on my sonicare.  What should I do.</li>
            <li> Great, just as expected</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I needed, the regular heads are just too harsh for my gums so I needed something a bit softer.</li>
            <li> Brush heads perform as expected. I have no complaints. I wish they came in packs of 4. Be sure that you order the right head for your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Love how soft they are</li>
            <li> Standard ultra soft, great if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth. My hygienist recommended me the soft brushes. I would never go back to the regular ones. These are very gentle and great brushes for anybody with teeth issues.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find these cheaper. They don&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped, making an electric toothbrush pretty expensive to use over a lifetime</li>
            <li> So happy to have SOFT heads again, my teeth were starting to get really sensitive</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare. These replacement heads are standard for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My gums are receding and I know I am to blame because I&#x27;ve always brushed a little too hard. But these sensitive brush heads help a lot.</li>
            <li> These are great if you have receding gums or want to protect your gum line. The Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush that my dental hygienist recommended. Philips is great about honoring their warranty and I will certainly turn to them again if this toothbrush ever dies.</li>
            <li> perfect replacement brushes</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and quality product.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing the tooth brush replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are everything I ever dreamed about.</li>
            <li> much better than stiffer brushes</li>
            <li> These are OK but I prefer the gum health brushes instead. Sonicare stuff is pricey. zoz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using an electric toothbrush, and just about gave up until I switched to the &amp;#34;ultra soft sensitive&amp;#34; brushes.  Makes the whole thing more tolerable on sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find, but these brushes are great. soft on the gums and hard on the plaque. My teeth have never been cleaner and in better shape.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have very sensitive teeth and these brushes did not cause any sensitivity in conjunction with sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I always brush with a compact soft head tooth brush and bought these when I purchased my first Sonicare toothbrush system.  I am very happy with them, they are compact and soft , just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> you will need to replace these very often...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, they are soft, but they also wear out extremely fast.. a bit too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular sonicare brusheads lasts several months at a time.. while these lasted no more than 1 month.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought these softer brush heads for my wife who had just undergone some dental work.  I use the standard ones, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll have a soft brush head when it&#x27;s my turn.  And I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of our the Sonicares.</li>
            <li> A friend who is a dentist told me soft brushes are the way to go.  Even though other brushes feel like they clean better, they are harsh on the enamel and gums.  This are perfect and clean just as well!</li>
            <li> This is the goods I want, I like it. Amazon&#x27;s service is very good</li>
            <li> I have tried both the regular brush heads and this sensitive brush head. I much prefer this. It seems to do a great job of cleaning and protecting my gums.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but it doesn&#x27;t fit all the way on to my Philips Sonicare electric toothbruse, the same as the brushes I received with my toothbrush when I purchased it about 6 weeks ago. It has actually fallen off several times during use. I expect the shaft is just too long.</li>
            <li> These are the only brush heads I will purchase. Will never go back to traditional toothbrush. I got my family hooked on Sonicare!</li>
            <li> This is the best Sonicare head brush. It is mild to the teeth enamel and mouth gums cleaning well. Its shape facilitates the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toothbrush heads....&lt;br /&gt;What can you really say?</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for the Sonicare...easy on your gums.</li>
            <li> So glad I found them online, and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Works for me. I started buying these when I got my Sonicare years ago. Everywhere else charges more for one than 3 sometimes for 4.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads came in a Philips casing. The product quality is pretty good and very comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li> soft bristles are great for your gums.  I don&#x27;t like the size of the head.  I wish I looked at these in a store to see how it compared to the heads that game with my sonic care brush.  I liked the size of those better.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum and I thought it was okay, but when I used it with these, it was amazing how polished my teeth seemed to be all day afterwards.  Maybe the softness makes the bristles move around more?  I had originally bought these bristles for gum health but I recommend them for general teeth-feeling-cleanness.</li>
            <li> These ultra sensitive heads are difficult to find but are highly recommended by my dentist.  They work very well.  I highly recommend them as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these toothbrush heads. I do have sensitive teeth and I appreciate a good product like this. I have never been able to use an electric toothbrush until just this past year because of this brand that let me ramp things up slowly to get used to using it gently. Now I am used to it. I got my first cavity free dental check up in my life last month!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth to use it , it is pretty good</li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive gums, and was routinely tearing up my gum-line with the softest brush head available for the Oral B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare Ultra Soft Sensitive brush, coupled with the Sonicare non-abrasive system, seems to do the trick.  My teeth feel as clean as they did with the Oral B, and in a month&#x27;s steady use, have yet to experience any sore gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one concern with this head design was that it would not be able to get into the tight corners of my teeth the way the tinier Oral B could.  Thus far, I have not found that to be an issue, and seems capable of doing a thorough cleaning just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add another observation as of 11/2/2013 -- I went for my regular dental check-up a couple of weeks ago, and my hygienist said my teeth \\&quot;look great.\\&quot;  :-)</li>
            <li> I was buying brush heads at Costco, and thought the bristles were a little too stiff.  Then they started selling the newest brush heads which are really stiff.  I was happy to have found these soft brushes, they much easier on my teeth and I will continue to order these.</li>
            <li> I should have given a five star.  But when I recalled the time when I bought them, I could not find any &amp;#34;Sonicare Normal Standard&amp;#34; brush heads in the Amazon.com sites.  SInce I was needed a brush head urgently, I was forced to order &amp;#34;Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads.  So the four-star rating has nothing to do with Philips but the incomplete inventory of Amazon.com and my poor planning in more advanced ordering.</li>
            <li> These do work well for my sensitive teeth, however, they do not seem to last as long as the others.</li>
            <li> This brush head is very soft and feels great on my gums.  I was glad that it fit my Sonicare that was purchased from Costco, as that model number doesn&#x27;t seem to exist on the Sonicare website!  I will buy these again when we need them.</li>
            <li> Its Sonicare... enough said</li>
            <li> Wish these had tapered bristles</li>
            <li> Three heads cost as much as the entire brush. Maybe they figured out the razor to blade math and used it here.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed.</li>
            <li> Sonicare gets it right every time.  I have sensitive teeth and gums and these heads do the trick.  They&#x27;re a little softer, shaped a little differently and equally strong in sonicare cleaning.  I do recommend and have already repurchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just the type I needed.  Was brushing with a firm brush which is hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> These clean my sensitive teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Sonicare brush head, very soft and gentle for people who tend to overdo it and/or have sensitive gums. I love it. I hated the intercare that came with my sonicare toothbrush which was too rough. This has saved my gums.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles work very well with those like me who are losing gum tissue.</li>
            <li> Philips should be ashamed of themselves for what they charge for toothbrush heads. There are finally manufactures out there making generic heads. The sonic care system is great, just make sure to buy generic replacement heads. They work exactly the same yet cost 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li> The regular Sonicare brush heads were too hard on my gums so I tried the Ultra Soft head with much less gum irritation. They are not too soft either, but &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; says Momma Bear.</li>
            <li> Great product and nice deal too.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SENSITIVE TEETH&lt;br /&gt;ORDERED THESE ALONG WITH THE SONICARE DIAMOND CLEAN ELECTRICE TOOTHBRUSH. TWO BRUSH HEADS CAME ALONG WITH THE DIAMOND CLEAN BUT I NEEDED ONE LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF MY SENSITIVE TEETH. READ THE REVIEWS AND TOOK A CHANCE. I LOVE IT. DOES A GREAT JOB OF CLEANING FOR ME EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ULTRA SOFT.</li>
            <li> These worked great but I still think they are overpriced everywhere. I saved a little money buying them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not many people need an extra soft head for their electric toothbrush, but if you do, this is the only one I&#x27;ve seen.  It lasts longer than the previous solution which was to soak a regular head before using.</li>
            <li> The stores don&#x27;t seem to have these. Better for the gums if yours are sensitive. Diamond heads are too hard as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush for great cleaning, and to reduce my problem with receding, sensitive gums.  Within a week of using the brush, I no longer needed special gum sensitivity toothpaste, and the receding gum situation began to reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel as if they&#x27;ve had an actual dental office cleaning every day!  LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Sonicare.  Great for sensitivity - I have gum recession and am sensitive in certain areas - this brush head feels comfortable and my teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Straight from Phillips (packaging) and fits/operates perfectly. Also, in checking with my dentist, the soft brushes are better for your gums. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering and hopefully the price will remain reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the Pro Results brush head that originally came with my Sonicare EasyClean toothbrush. I must say that  these are much softer and work just as well.</li>
            <li> The good news is these fit my brush, the bad news is, these are like wiping a wet cloth on your teeth. Yes, the dentist says to use soft bristles but these are too soft to be really effective. Buy the regular version or prepare to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A good price, make a sonic toothbrush much better. Even got  a $4 coupon from Amazon</li>
            <li> Product does not fit and company will not refund or return item.</li>
            <li> Big fan of the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush (which I completely recommend); happy to have found replacement brush heads here on prime - seems I forget to pick them up when I&#x27;m in the store lol.  The ultra soft sensitive brush heads clean very well, and perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Love the sensitive alternative.  But as with all of the heads, there is a gap between the head and the main unit.</li>
            <li> It truly works, and does not bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads are fine, but the blister pack is completely unnecessary.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to go downstairs to the kitchen to get a tool just to change toothbrush heads.  Honestly, the main reason I don&#x27;t change as often as I should is that these packages are so @#$&amp;^% hard to open.  Would you rather spend 2 minutes brushing with a head that&#x27;s a day older or an extra 5 minutes to open a package of new ones?</li>
            <li> They are toothbrushes what can I say? These work and fit my Phillips Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I need to replace my brushes more often? Teeth are cleaner now</li>
            <li> Very soft heads.  If your dentist recommends soft heads so you don&#x27;t beat yourself up (as I do), then these are perfect for you.  They are difficult to find in stores, so I am glad Amazon carries tham!</li>
            <li> I like these better than any Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Have not needed to use them yet but I really like the Phillips Sonicare</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare and love it but that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m here. I just like seeing the 5 Stars lit up all yellow in all the reviews so I&#x27;m doing the same. I just think it looks cool!! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like seeing the 4 Star reviews too but it&#x27;s lacking. You know what I mean? I don&#x27;t like seeing that fifth star that&#x27;s different from the rest. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s saying  &amp;#34;Look at me!!! I&#x27;m different!!&amp;#34;. Just rubs me the wrong way I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few sonicare heads and definitely find these to be the best fit for me.  I have a tendency to brush too hard with other styles of brushes which can eat your enamel right off your teeth.  These will be my go-to brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> A little pricy and the fact that they do not last three months justifies the rating. One month at best. Wish someone else made the Diamond Cut tooth brush at a much cheaper price point.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a parent with arthritic hands.  The toothbrush head (one!) that came with the unit fit such that it could be put on the unit fairly easily, but these replacements could not be.  I didn&#x27;t see the difference in the heads, but...    It can be done - it&#x27;s not hard, but for someone whose hands are weak for whatever reason these were a bit tight.  Or perhaps they were manufactured a little off...? Don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Had earlier model brushes before. I like these better, teeth feel clean and not to harsh on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Work very well with my Sonicare and the softness of the brushes is excellent for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had tried a generic (so much less expensive) and was not pleased.  Went back to the original, the brushes have a softer texture.</li>
            <li> Like these a lot. Dentist recommended them to save our already damaged tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Works great and like the time off feature</li>
            <li> For the price, there should have been four.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be much softer.  They are a little softer than the standard ones, though.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the replacement heads yet, but like the small head on the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  The heads do last 3 months and the UV cleaner makes me more comfortable that they aren&#x27;t breeding bacteria.</li>
            <li> Hard to find soft sensitive heads. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They are much softer than the diamond clean.  I am hoping they striate my teeth less.</li>
            <li> The product works well, cleans my teeth thoroughly and is quiet. The price of the Somic Care Toothbrush on line was Twenty dollars cheaper than I found at several stores I checked.</li>
            <li> How does one describe a toothbrush head? It&#x27;s soft as advertised and works. Had a perfect check-up at last dental visit. Hygienist said no significant plaque.</li>
            <li> The brushes were perfect.</li>
            <li> Best choice for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> These are excellent replacement brush heads for my sonicare toothbrush. I cannot seem to find them in stores, so I am happy to be able to order them on amazon. They seem to be just firm enough to do a good job yet soft enough not to injure your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I do replace mine every two months instead of three as suggested by the manufacturer. I pay less attention to the indicator bristle color than to the way the brush feels. I can tell when it needs to be replaced by how it feels while brushing.  The lifespan of each brush head also varies by how much you use them. If you brush frequently they must be replaced more often.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of these, but I really liked the diamond version. I&#x27;d go with it instead.  If the are on sale they are fine, but otherwise go with the diamond that is.</li>
            <li> These were a great price compared to buying them locally. Bought two packs so I had 3 sets of two.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes and these soft bristles are easy on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Nice brush heads. Soft and gentle on my mom&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought they were too &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but my dental hygienist said &amp;#34;soft is better&amp;#34; so what do I know???</li>
            <li> So much better than the ;OFF; brand</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles! The dentist recommended I use the softest bristles I could find and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Noticeably softer than regular pro-results brush heads, good for sensitive teeth or receding gums. Package includes color indicators for multiple users.</li>
            <li> These are great - very soft. I do wish that they came in the small size though as some of us have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> I used to get the standard toothbrush heads, but I&#x27;m definitely switching to these all the time.  I have very sensitive teeth, and I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush head, but it really is better catered to people with sensitive teeth like mine, I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with all.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again,</li>
            <li> Did not fit my toothbrush and could not send back because I had to break the packing to try it out.</li>
            <li> I love that this item is so much more affordable on Amazon than in stores! I love my Sonicare :)</li>
            <li> The package I received only included 2 brush heads.  Did I just pay for 3 brush heads when the package only has 2 !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The best. Ask the dentist</li>
            <li> They are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fits my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean perfectly.  I definitely prefer the soft bristles from this brush on my gums.  Each head has been lasting me about 3 months each so a good price for 3 of them.</li>
            <li> So glad I brought my electric brush back to life! These are OEM so there is no question of quality. Don&#x27;t bother with the knock-offs!</li>
            <li> This order arrived promptly and exactly as described and the correct size!  This was the first time I ordered the replacements head online but the desccription was exact which made ordering very easy.  I will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brushes clean teeth better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried outside of the dentist.  The replacement brushes unfortunately cost an arm and a leg; this package had the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Fits my Sonnicare toothbrush as advertised. I will buy more when these wear out. Product shipped quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to be the same and perform as well as the ones I paid a lot more for on a national drugstore chains website.  I&#x27;ll probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are great!  They also seem to be lasting a long time without distorting or falling apart.  I found the standard brushes too stiff and irritating to my gums, even with very light pressure.  These sensitive brushes still work really well, but are much easier on my gums.  I almost think that these should be standard issue because they are still perfectly enough for making my teeth feel dentist-clean.</li>
            <li> So far these brush heads are working fine. Will have to see if they last as long as the previous ones.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and you have many choices on strength of cleaning even having one speed to massage gums.  Good unit.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are so much gentler on my gums than the standard brush.  Sure, there are only 4 in a pack. However, realistically you probably only have to change the bristles when they get bent out of shape. If you are gentle on your gums and have standard usage I don&#x27;t see why these wouldn&#x27;t last you an entire year.  People spend way more money on random junk in a year that has nothing to do with healthcare. These bristles make my brushing with Sonic care fun!  My gums don&#x27;t bleed like crazy.  I still get a really good clean.  I wake up in the morning with fresh breathe. I love it!</li>
            <li> These are definitely for the more sensitive mouth. Ordered this by accident. I did not mean to get sensitive when I ordered. So the best I can say.  If your looking for something not as rough as the standard intense bristles this may be for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive teeth and receding gumline</li>
            <li> These heads fit my sonicare perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> everytime you go to the dentist what do they say? use a soft (not hard, not medium, and not ultra-soft) regular head. so why then does anybody sell anything else; especially in the sonicare product-range? ok sure, i get ultra-soft as one day i will too be elderly, but i pulled the trigger very quickly on this purchase without realizing the &amp;#34;ultra-&amp;#34; qualifier. however, i was pleasantly surprised to find that these heads were not much different especially after a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so either sonicare is doing something _truly_ amazing or stay away from these if you&#x27;re a senior/elderly! unfortunately i cannot help on that decision :(</li>
            <li> nice and last long for a great brushing</li>
            <li> These are our first heads for our new toothbrush- and they&#x27;re great for us.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it arrived promptly and correctly. The con is the price. In my opinion these replacement heads are over priced, but I like the softer bristles so I buy them.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is soft but not too soft and still feels like it is properly cleaning my teeth.  Also, the brush head is the large size.</li>
            <li> Were the same good quality as if bought in the stores but can&#x27;t seem to find in the stores. Also they came the next day. Perfect!</li>
            <li> The ONLY brush I will use for my Sonicare. I am a dentist and recommend this brush/bristle to ALL of my patients. The brushes that come with the Sonicare when you originally buy it are NOT soft and are VERY VERY abrasive on the gums and can lead to dental recession.&lt;br /&gt;This bristles are VERY gentle and do a great job of cleaning all of the plaque and calculus build-up. This is the ONLY brush head I will use and recommend to my patients.</li>
            <li> Great product prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a three pack but they last a while. I bought mine a month ago and the bristles are still in good condition. And at $30 a box they better be :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> The regular Sonicare brush heads often irritated my sensitive gums.  I am so happy tohave found these soft bristle brush heads!  They clean my teeth without irritating my gums and leave my mouth feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> These are much softer than the regular heads, but don&#x27;t seem to have a shorter life span. They work great and are genuine sonicare not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush and I got these sensitive heads because the regular ones were just a bit too harsh on my gums. I&#x27;m able to use the regular brush setting instead of the sensitive now and that&#x27;s what I needed. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the brush heads I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve had them for a number of months now. The only thing I will say is the dark blue indicator that tells you when to change heads doesn&#x27;t fade as much as the other heads I&#x27;ve used. This one seems to be more subtle. So I&#x27;d say if you see any changes, you can probably say it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.</li>
            <li> Super duper awesome, would recommend anyone to purchase a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d done some research and this is definitely top of the &#x27;A&#x27; list.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery and as expected.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare!  I have receding gums despite all my efforts to be gentle with them.  So I was thrilled to find these ultra soft brush heads.  I love them!  My dentist and hygienist tell me it&#x27;s not about getting the bristles in areas you need to work on, but the ultrasonic vibration that does the work.  So the softer the bristles the better for me, and these are FANTASTIC!  I can tell a big difference from their regular soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality. I use it on a sonicare for kids HX6311/02&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly fine for me and my 11 years old son.</li>
            <li> Much gentler on my teeth. I felt the regular bristle brushes were not for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I tried the copies, but they just don&#x27;t work as well - get the actual item, made for your brush, and get the best results.  The off-brand ones eventually start sliding off every time you use them, from a lack of proper connection with the brush.</li>
            <li> I really like these - I get them on subscribe &amp; save.  As someone who&#x27;s terrified of the dentist, I find these are nice and soft, yet seem to clean my teeth very well.  At least they didn&#x27;t have to peel me off the ceiling last dentist visit.</li>
            <li> 1. This was not the Philips brand toothbrush head. It&#x27;s the generic Target brand. (which, to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t particularly care if it was the correct brush head)&lt;br /&gt;2. It was not the toothbrush head pictured and does not fit my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;3. When I returned it, I was told I would get a replacement instead of a refund. I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of faith the the replacement will be the correct toothbrush and I&#x27;ll have to... what? Return it again? For another wrong replacement, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must be the only person this has happened to since all of the other reviews are good. Hopefully they&#x27;ll replace with the correct toothbrush. I&#x27;m a bit irritated that the description says \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; brand when it&#x27;s actually not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to re-package up the brush heads and go find a UPS store to drop it off to return it. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new set of brush heads and this was the best deal I found. Good thing they last and you can UV clean them.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find these brush heads locally. I had the best cleaning ever because of this brush, which my dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> My dentist had been after me for years to switch to a sonic toothbrush.  I thought it was like an electric pencil sharpener - overkill. Finally he said I was starting to have gum issues and needed to do it so I did - bought this Phillips sonic toothbrush and some extra brushes.  Amazon was about $10 cheaper than Walmart so I got them here.  It took some getting used to, but I like it.  It also whitened my teeth a few shades - not sure if it is the sonic or just brushing longer.  The sonic runs for 2 minutes, I probably used my manual brush for only 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These sensitive brush heads are such an improvement over the standard heads - they feel so comfortable and soft. Will buy again !</li>
            <li> Ah yes.  These brushes work so well.  Priced to change every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family uses them now.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare but the original brush heads were a little to harsh. My dentist recommended these and they work great.</li>
            <li> I believe Sonicare should make this their standard Brush Head. The difference is amazing, and this Brush Head is soft an comforatable on the gums. I noticed the difference right off. If you have sensitive teeth, it&#x27;s a great change of pace for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare Easy Clean after hearing how much my son-in-law loved his.  After each brushing, I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning.  Since I have gum issues, the sensitive brushes feel a little better than the standard brushes.  The Amazon price for these brushes was the best price I could find, including at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Okay. They fit my toothbrush so I am happy with that.</li>
            <li> good property and good service</li>
            <li> These soft brushes clean just as well as the standard ones, but do not irritate the gums. Hence, you can actually brush better and more closely to the gumline. Makes the Sonicare even better than it was.</li>
            <li> Works great, very gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and this is all I use.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal Sonic are replacement brushes. Needed I say more? If you are a Sonic are user these willndobthe job.</li>
            <li> love my Sonicare.  fewer trips to the dentist and white teeth!  My husband was able to forego his gum treatments because of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Purchased these here on Amazon in a three-pack for my newly acquired Phillips Sonicare.  I have always used Sensitive Soft toothbrushes and these were the perfect replacement brushes for it.</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Work well and aren&#x27;t too harsh on your gums.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and was perfect.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are the most comfortable brush heads I&#x27;ve found for this toothbrush. I was using the &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; heads, which I thought I would like but actually seemed too small. I really like the softness of these so much better. They&#x27;re not too big by any means - as an adult female with a smallish mouth and teeth, the size of this feels just right.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good buy. I did not really need to buy three at one time but for the price I could not pass it up.</li>
            <li> Great to have replacement brush heads for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Finally, soft brush heads that are recommended by dentists. The other heads are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Although they are much softer and gentler on your teeth and gums, these brushes just don&#x27;t last very long at all. The dark blue reminder bristles (that tell you when replacement is needed) fade far faster than what I&#x27;d think is normal and the bristles fray very easily. Sonicare recommend replacement of their brushes every three months but based on the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; on my brush and how quickly the dark blue ones fade to white, I&#x27;d say they I need to replace them more like every month!! I&#x27;m not a hard brusher nor a long brusher and yet I notice signs of wear very early into the recommended &#x27;3 month&#x27; life span of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, on the plus side they are much softer than the normal standard brushes if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and helps a lot with gengivitis.  get the brush with diferent function it work better.</li>
            <li> glad I got these. love my philips and happy with these brushes and recommend them to others. good price too</li>
            <li> I had to use the previously standard Sonicare stiff bristles, then, finally Sonicare realized that the recommended care of the teeth and gingiva is a soft brush with soft brushing!  Love it!  Finally!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush but had tried the cheaper after market brush heads and did not find them to fit very well. I think I got them at Target or somewhere else but after use they kept coming off in my mouth in the middle of brushing. I switched back to these name brand ones and have not had one come off accidentally yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two boxes of these at a much slower rate than the recommended replacement cycle and I&#x27;ve had positive results with all of them. I will buy more when I need them.</li>
            <li> I have a sonicare toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t able to use it much because the brush head was too rough for my gums.  I&#x27;m glad they sell these ultra soft brush heads, so now I use my sonicare everyday.  I have slightly receding gums so my gums can be really sensitive and my dentist told me I was brushing too hard. I have been using these brush heads for over a month now and I am very pleased.  I can&#x27;t tell if they brush as good as the harder brush heads, but they seem to.  I should be able to tell by my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> The Brush Heads are very good. Nice service.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Just right for my sensitive teeth. Wish I would have ordered these sooner.</li>
            <li> Works great, Teeth feel cleaner and headsfit perfectly on my diamond clean unit.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush however too expensive</li>
            <li> These are really good for ones with sensitive mouths. I suffer from Sjogrens &amp; these are the only toothbrush heads that offer me a comfortable cleaning. Good product!</li>
            <li> Often buy, very good use</li>
            <li> The Ultra Soft Sensitive brush head is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I was using the regular heads and my teeth had become extremely sensitive!  Even sensitive toothpaste wasn&#x27;t helping and it usually does.  I have a tendency to brush too hard instead of holding the brush lightly and guiding it along like you are supposed to.  My sensitivity is going away with the use of these though!  They are very soft and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I brush too hard, so at the behest of my dentist, tried a Sonicare toothbrush and, just to be safe, bought these ultra soft brushes.  They are indeed much softer and gentler than the head that comes standard with the Sonicare toothbrush.  They have worked very well for the last couple of months and are worth the extra cost.  Product is as described and advertised.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the softer ones, I think I&#x27;ll stick to the regular ones next time, which are not that hard anyway.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this is for that!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and you get a great product for your favorite toothbrush. They clean really well too! I prefer these to the standard heads available.</li>
            <li> It is softer than I bought from mart before, the price is reasonable. I will come to buy next time.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, but I cannot use the standard brush heads. They hurt my gums, and these are great replacements. It&#x27;s getting a little hard to find them in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh. Relief at last. After YEARS of pain just brushing my teeth, finally, I meet this Sensitive Brush.  Due to chronic illness, all the tissue in my mouth burns and just hurts so much.  Brushing has been sheer torture UNTIL I found this.  Now, I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks now so don&#x27;t know just how long the bristles will hold up but so far, so good.  And, I do have to ask: what took so long to think of this?  Whatever woke up those brain cells, keep &#x27;em going.  Next, I need an electric brush that is not so loud (and this is the best of the bunch).  Many with inner ear disorders would like a quieter brush, please.  No bells. No whistles. No beeps.  But also just a quieter motor.  Please?</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is the best on the market and the sensitive brush heads make it a much better product. I will continue to buy these unless they discontinue them. good work sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you find no problem with the standard one, don&#x27;t change to this. The other one keep your teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I ran into these soft Philips brush heads by accident--I had been using the standard brush heads for years--when I was looking to find a set of replacements at a local store. I purchased the Diamond tip Philips Sonicare brush heads, and for the first time in using my Philips device after years, I found I could not use it because the Diamond Head design was much, much to hard. This brush head left my gums so sore that I had to stop using the brush. I returned them and started looking again for my standard brush heads that I had always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found these soft heads, I was quite surprised, as I had never heard of their existence. And because of my recent experience with the overly hard Diamond style, I now wondered if these soft bristles would be bad in the opposite end of the spectrum, something like puting a wet mop in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, all I can say is that after using these for a few months, they have easily become my FAVORITE brush head for the Philips device. The brush cleans exceptionally well (I can see no difference in cleaning ability from the original brush), but they are so much more gentle on the gums. And because that is true, brushing for longer (when I want to) is not a problem. These strike just the right balance, and I am now so happy that I discovered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads also seem to have the same life span of the original brushes. It must be remembered that ANY brush head is to be replaced after three months, and there has been no evidence that I have seen that these wear out any faster than the other stiffness brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An easy five stars.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on the gums. The original brushes that came with the toothbrush were way too stiff and were too hard on my gums, these are just right.</li>
            <li> These fit and work well, but they seem to wear out a little quicker than the originals. Do not be fooled by generics that fit poorly.</li>
            <li> great price &amp; works great for my sensitive teeth.  My only complaint would be it doesn&#x27;t really fit the handle as well as the original brush heads that come with the set.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. The toothbrush heads work great. They fit on my toothbrush, just as expected. I will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described at a great price and is great quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and at a great price. I definitely recommend the soft brush head. The standard are pretty stiff for a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34; like me.</li>
            <li> been looking for these everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find them this was super convenient to order online and the price was right</li>
            <li> These work great and I will buy them again instead paying full retail at the store for replacements. I have been using them for a week so far and they work great on my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Got here fast enough, but some bristles started coming out right away&lt;br /&gt;(so I&#x27;m not happy about that) words, words</li>
            <li> These are softer bristles than the usual ProCare heads for the Sonicare toothbrush, and they work very well. They are mighty pricey for simple toothbrush heads, but these are priced along with the market. I was able to get the regular ProCare heads at a much lower price, but that is probably because so many more are sold.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I once had a Sonicare Elite model which had very rough bristles and only one type of head choice. The toothbrush was actually painful to brush my teeth with. Upon finding these, I switched over to the Sonicare Easyclean model and bought myself a 3-pack of these to go along with it. So far they are great. The bristles are very soft and gentle, but still do a good job cleaning. They are not rough on the gums like the other Sonicare heads. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has had sensitive gums like me.</li>
            <li> do what they are supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The shipment came in very quickly.  They fit perfectly.  Thanks for the great customer service. What else can you say about replacement toothbrush heads?</li>
            <li> I have the Philips Sonicare Diamondclean.  These are not the brushes that came with my Diamondclean originally.  They don&#x27;t make sensitive brushes specific for the diamondclean sonicare.  I wish they would, because I prefer to have all matching gear and I loved the shape and color of the brushes that came with the kit.  However, these brushes fit and work well.  They are extra soft and comfortable on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> still using them. good.</li>
            <li> good, prefect for my 6730</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to write.  They&#x27;re OEM replacement heads and they replaced my worn out, spongy, old heads.  Good price, easy shipping.  It&#x27;s the Amazon way.</li>
            <li> I only wish i didn&#x27;t wait as long to purchase these.  Made a big difference when i changed out an old head.</li>
            <li> These ultra soft brushes lived up to the manufacturer&#x27;s description.  They are ultra soft - but still do a credible job of cleaning without being rough on the gums and abrasive on enamel.</li>
            <li> Fake product. The brush heads are not a Philips product. Poor quality. Avoid.</li>
            <li> The brushheads are ok i guess but they fit very poorly on the toothbrush, there is a half inch gap where crud collects. Also the bristles only vibrate not doing a thorough job of cleaning teeth, they should rotate.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, teeth feel clean and according to my dentist they are clean.</li>
            <li> Good replacements! It&#x27;s a good deal considering I don&#x27;t have to purchase one by one. At least I have three in store.</li>
            <li> good as a toothbrush can be  Ha Ha</li>
            <li> Fits and works properly on my sonicare toothbrush. The only complaint I have is that the become stained only after a few uses, which is not all that pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Bought these because they were out of the normal Sonicare brush heads.  These work just as good as the others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need sensitive but I guess I missed that in the description. Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as regular sonicare brushes but still better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These fit, but not quite perfectly and they&#x27;re a bugger to remove!</li>
            <li> Great, would buy them again!</li>
            <li> After using these I would never go back to the harder brushed type....these feel way way way better on my teeth and actually conform to my teeth, etc. Man I wish I had tried these a long time ago...I was hating the hard bristles and didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference these ultra soft bristles would make. Save your gums and your teeth and go with the ultra soft. At least I can use the hard bristle models to clean the grout in my bathroom shower or to remove the finish on an old dresser.</li>
            <li> I love the ultra soft brushes, I have very sensitive teeth from over zealous brushing when I was younger.  This is the perfect toothbrush for me, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have it set up as a subscription so that my replacement heads arrive on time to maintain proper hygiene for myself and my family.  Terrific investment in health!</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes were recommend by my dentist and they work very well for fighting my receding gumline! They are soft, but they do the job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li> This works much better for me as my teeth were too sensitive with the regular brushes.  I wish Phillips would come out with a smaller head to get at the bottom and top front teeth... other than that... good product.</li>
            <li> When ordering new Sonicare toothbrushes, this item is needed and a bargain! I order all replacement heads online for savings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Sonicare for several years now and have always bought the regular small head brushes.  I accidentally ordered these and they are great.  They are very gentle on your gums and really seem to do a better job than the regular brushes.  I will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> They work in our old unit</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my slim series Sonicare toothbrush. Package came with three heads and three spacers which I think are designed to prevent stuff from getting in between the handle and the head ie water, toothpaste, bacteria, insects. Ew.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts longer than the last one.  For the price it should last longer than two years.</li>
            <li> no problem, very good</li>
            <li> Received 3 brushed in an easy open carton.  Fit very tightly with the flexcare. Softer than the original flex care brushes. Hopefully will be good for sensitive gum .</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums and this brush is perfect.  It gets my teeth clean and is gentle at the same time.  I love the Sonicare System.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Philips Sonicare perfectly. I didn&#x27;t install the family-\\&quot;ID\\&quot; ring that can color code each head if you share a unit, but the brush fit perfectly on the stem, but with a slight gap for that ID ring. The bristle head part is longer than the standard ones that came with my unit, and softer. I like these a lot! I can get way into the back, and inside the gumline on the lingual side (buccal is cheek-side, lingual is tongue-side with respect to your teeth. The \\&quot;lingual\\&quot; side is hard to brush! But that&#x27;s where trouble can start, even with flossing and brushing with a good electronic toothbrush.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three brushes come in one of those nasty clamshell packs that require careful cutting, laser-drilling followed by hooking up a winch and a come-along to extract them from the package. And yet, even with these precautions (mesh gloves, eye protective helmet) you still can get a nasty cut on your finger as you struggle to extract these from the packaging. I use a good pair of package-opening shears and still, it was a pain to open this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-pilfering packaging is completely unnecessary as every drugstore in our area keeps these behind lock and key, and who can reach through the monitor to steal these from Amazon? I wish they were packaged in a humane manner. Hello, Philips! Anyone listening? Have a easy-open option for people who order online, eh?</li>
            <li> I bought these for chemotherapy when I had a tender, sore mouth.  But I think they have become my favorite brush.  They do a great job of cleaning, yet are soft enough not to hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums and these brush heads make brushing my teeth so much less painful.  I appreciate that Sonicare has this ultra soft consistency of brush available.</li>
            <li> Much softer on my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Sonicare... the only way to brush your teeth (or tooth)!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the standard brush heads that came with the electric brush and decided to switch to the sensitive. i like the old ones a lot better.</li>
            <li> He fussed about getting his replacement toothbrushes until they arrived.  Then he quieted down.  After using this system, a manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t switch to an electric tooth brush because I need to have a extra soft brush.this brush works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for protecting gum. The regular one hurts the gum a little (even though I feel better and cleaner using the regular ones from costco).</li>
            <li> I have the sonic and made sure each family member had a brush but needed a replacement head. This comes with two so I will be ready as my own wears out. Great price.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a sonicare after using oral-b toothbrushes for years.  The regular pro results brush heads that came with the new brush would hurt my gums if I angled the brush a certain way, but with these sensitive brush heads, I never get any pain.  As far as I can tell, they leave my teeth feeling just as clean.  They also happen to be cheaper than the pro results and the diamond clean, so it seems like a no brainer.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner, my dental tech said so.  I have difficulty reaching the inside upper and lower front teeth without hurting my gums. The front edge of the brush is sharp-ish and to reach in requires a vertical approach: ouch.  I don&#x27;t know how to make it gentler.  On an earlier brush where the bristles stuck out further I simply snipped them off with scissors and that worked somewhat better. A rounder softer front end, like the Oral-B Sensitive, might work even better. That said, the Sonicare is the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I only charge my batteries when they run low (a leftover response to the old NiCads which short out if left on the charger all the time).  These batteries last for months between charges (it seems), longer that any other brush, ever.  If I travel I leave my charger at home I am so confident the batteries will last for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> These are so hard I am afraid they will take what little enamel I have off my roots! I should have returned them. Generic!</li>
            <li> It works, but awfully expensive.  Can&#x27;t blame merchant tho, best price I could find.  Wonder if anybody manufacturers a non-Philips replacement.</li>
            <li> Bought them because I needed the softer bristles and they have worked just fine.  Have sensitive teeth and they still clean fine and do not make my gums bleed.</li>
            <li> Great soft brush heads.  We use these to help combat recession and sensitive teeth. They do not last quite as long as the traditional set that come with the brush initially.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> My gum is a bit sensitive.When using regular brush head,gum will bleeding a little. When I using this one, I feel comfortable.I like the soft brush heads.</li>
            <li> For me these brushes are perfect.  I had been using the brushes that came with the unit and these are way much easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent and just as expected!!</li>
            <li> Great heads. They fit perfectly. Very gentle, work well.</li>
            <li> I like and need soft brush heads. These are perfect for me. As I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else, I am delighted that Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this sensitive toothbrush head over the original one that came with the toothbrush. This is a better buy than the local store if you sign up for the recurring shipments. All in all it comes out to between 20-25 dollars and my local store would charge 30-35 for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> Here is the only place I can find the sensitive brush style so I have been buying them for a while now. I love thet they are much softer that the regular. Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift with the [[ASIN:B004M1BO3U Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. The recipient has always used soft toothbrushes and severely dislikes &#x27;medium&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27; toothbrushes. She never even tried the regular head and uses these every day. So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent of what comes with your sonicare brush. I have to write 8 more words to get this review accepted. done.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy I had to use the normal Sonicare brushes for my toothbrush for years, the stiff bristles did indeed damage my anterior gingiva, but, I changed routines............then,  FINALLY Sonicare comes out with the best!  Any dentist, I am not a DDS, but, an MD........will tell you NOT to brush with hard brushes or to brush to hard, period.  Now, Sonicare as stepped up to the task, and I appreciate it!  Will not be the last time I order these, although I have now heard they are available at Sam&#x27;s as well as Walgreens.  Thanks to the seller, who was insightful enough to understand dental care, and shipped the package safely, securely, and before anticipated!  5/5 all around!</li>
            <li> These are definitely not OEM products. They seem like cheap knock offs and the bristles are already wearing after just a couple weeks of use. Won&#x27;t use these again.</li>
            <li> My dentists have always told me to use soft toothbrushes (and it seems like that&#x27;s what the general consensus is). All the Sonicare toothbrushes come with the standard brush heads, but I&#x27;d highly recommend getting the sensitive (this one) when it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are noticeably more gentle than the standard brush heads.  I have sensitive teeth, and these work for me.</li>
            <li> This little wonder lets me drinking coffee to my heart’s content, yet, not upset my dentist. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel S. Cruz, Attorney in SW Florida.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft. Everyone should try it. I have sensitive teeth. It works like clouds. Love it and will buy it again. Forget the standard brush.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t quite fit all the way on to my Sonicare, but are the ones recommended for it. There&#x27;s a small space, a millimeter or two wide, between the plastic base of the Sonicare and the toothbrush head. It isn&#x27;t really a problem, just somewhat bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great toothbrush heads otherwise! Soft, do the job,</li>
            <li> Rougher vibration than any previous replacements.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and replace the heads every 3 months as recommended. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, so it helps with getting used to this new way of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with using an electric toothbrush is that the brushing could be too harsh for my teeth. (long term wear) These brushes help to avoid that problem.</li>
            <li> very good as recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before,it is great my mouth feels clean and refreshed after use and all day.It also makes my teeth shine and sparkle</li>
            <li> As explained above so that, well</li>
            <li> These are way too soft, it feels like you aren&#x27;t brushing with anything, weird.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time putting the tips on the brush securely and removing them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare brush. It came highly recommended from the Dentist. You can feel the difference after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush heads are far superior to the regular ones. They stay soft longer. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare cordless rechargeable toothbrush since December 1997. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it. If you own one then you know how great they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my last checkup my Dentist said, &amp;#34;Your mouth is perfect!&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t have perfect teeth. They are not perfectly straight or brilliantly white. They are, however, very healthy! Gums too. I attribute this to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own one then you know that you need to replace the brush head every 3 months. Ordering from Amazon is convenient and the price is competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own a Sonicare then don&#x27;t give it another thought – order these replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;i normally use the regular head, but this is just as good.  i have sensitive teeth, so i am sure this is only helping with that issue.</li>
            <li> Are your teeth in need of a spa day?  When you brush your teeth with this brush head your teeth will thanks you.  They are very nice and feel great on those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because these brush heads are a little softer than I thought they would be when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> I tried a generic brand and they just came off after a couple of weeks.  These are worth the money!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; is a couple of years or so old, and this is a repeat order of brushes which are very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I switched from the Proresults standard head that came with the toothbrush to the Ultra Soft Head after my teeth became sensitive.  After using the Ultra Soft Head for a couple months, my teeth are no longer sensitive and the head seems to clean as well as the Proresults standard head.</li>
            <li> Functional, exactly as billed, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Very pleased with purchase.  Will purchase again.  Price makes it easy to change your toothbrush every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> My first time using soft brushes instead of the standards and for me it&#x27;s a winner. Unlike a hand toothbrush, where soft bristles don&#x27;t do a good job, the power toothbrushes with soft bristles clean fine--and most importantly, don&#x27;t make my gums feel like I&#x27;ve brushed with sandpaper. Hope this helped</li>
            <li> Just received my new Sonicare brushes.  Love Sonicare!!!!</li>
            <li> i was missing some crevices with the standard head and already has some discussion with my dentist about reducing my gum recession. i&#x27;m very happy with these heads: soft and pliable, able to reach those hard areas without much force. i&#x27;m surprised the blue indicator bristles almost fully disappear after a month&#x27;s use of regular brushing (2x a day, 2 minutes per cleaning)...i thought they&#x27;d last around 3 months, which is the recommended changing interval.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because Amazon was out of the regular brush heads.  However, I really like these because they are soft on the gums.  I will probably continue to order these in the future.  Also, the price on Amazon is so much better than other stores.</li>
            <li> Way too soft. I do not brush hard and the bristles are already turning outward.</li>
            <li> Product is gentle on teeth and gums.  Takes a little getting used to but you can tell a difference from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This soft brush was recommended to me by a dental expert in gum care.  I appreciate its cleansing qualities while protecting my gums.</li>
            <li> I have the sonicare elect tooth brush. The replacement heads are very expensive but do a great job! This price was great!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several of the different heads due to the original style being too firm.  I experienced a bit of gum loss with the original style which leads to sensitive teeth and potentially more problems on down the road.  These don&#x27;t harm the gums but still clean the teeth.  FYI, I also use the sensitive setting on the toothbrush.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> They work nicely and get a good &amp;#34;Clean teeth&amp;#34; feeling</li>
            <li> These ease the change from manual brushing to the Philips Sonicare. The ones that come with the brush are a little too hard at first.</li>
            <li> much softer than the pro series</li>
            <li> Extra soft and my teeth and mouth are thankful for that!  Don&#x27;t confuse hard bristles with cleaning performance.  The sonicare does the job with it&#x27;s sonic performance.  Too stiff bristles will cause gum erosion.</li>
            <li> This model is much softer than the regular ones by the same company, including the kids model. We will order more of these for sure.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive brush heads, as its name stated is for people with sensitive gums.  After my brush head has been due for a replacement, I decided to try something &#x27;new&#x27;.  As these are for sensitive gums, note that it may not be for you.  I personally prefer the original brush that came with the brush so I will be going back once these go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package does come with three ID rings and three brush head.  They are VERY soft.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as others ---- due their soft brush. Would probably buy regular bristle in the future.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  What comes standard is way too rough for tender mouths.</li>
