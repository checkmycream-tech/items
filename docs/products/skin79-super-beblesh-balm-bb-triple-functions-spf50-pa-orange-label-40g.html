            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite BBs from Skin79!</li>
            <li>Kind of oily to me, and makes me to have blemish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice nice fantastic really nice nice nice nice yess yapppp</li>
            <li>79 skin has many types of BB CREAM is especially summer use for my combination skin because love is brand has excellent quality and leave a beautiful finish on the skin</li>
            <li>This is SO fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I recommend mixing this with a darker shade of your regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was excellent.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage</li>
            <li>I love the way the product makes the skin look even after hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>It does end up looking more greasy towards the end of my 12 hour shift, but holds up well.</li>
            <li>One more word of advise, apply with stippling brush or a blending sponge.  </li>
            <li>it never showed up.&lt;br /&gt;they said February 13 at the latest its June 3</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a makeup remover to remove this bb cream.</li>
            <li>and this one does have slightly more coverage,</li>
            <li>If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell.</li>
            <li>This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>I never use it alone either, I mix it with my favorite brand of foundation because I find it looks better on me that way.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love how it blends on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I guess Korean girls must be a lot whiter than Taiwanese :) ( I&#x27;m Taiwanese )</li>
            <li>Made my make up look much better.</li>
            <li>The red bottle was perfect.</li>
            <li>People loved it on me so much that I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>One star off for the oiliness, but overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>and i break out easy</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t that strong but the spf50 sold me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i used a little bronze and matched my skintone perfect.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt say it has a medium coverage, to me is light coverage...</li>
            <li>Color is light and this blends well with my freckled skin and covers the freckles well.</li>
            <li>I think the one I ordered is just a bit light for my complexion</li>
            <li>It if u do not want light skin-</li>
            <li>It is for light skin tone.</li>
            <li>I had to give this one away because it was too light.</li>
            <li>We have bought several bottles of this and just love it!!  </li>
            <li>Probably would be great for someone with dry to normal skin who is super fair.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is actually pretty good for a BB cream, a decent medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>I use a toner to clean my face and  shrink pores.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it&#x27;s great for oily or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, it look so natural and stay for many hrs</li>
            <li>It has a medium to full coverage,</li>
            <li>I add a little blush or bronzer and I am good to go!</li>
            <li>, covers all scar and under eyes but not thick like liquid foundation, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I am quite oily and this has a SUPER DEWEY finish.  </li>
            <li>However, I love the coverage and the high SPF and the shininess is not a problem if you use a mattifying moisturizer or primer and powder.</li>
            <li>really appreciate the SPF 50 since my face burns really easy</li>
            <li>It smells like oranges, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>Everything seems authentic, will use this seller again, the powder and foundation of super bb plys skin 79  leaves your face so fresh looking and soft</li>
            <li>I also like the fact it stays on very well and its light.</li>
            <li>and I rarely break out now.</li>
            <li>Alas, I am not blessed with perfect skin</li>
            <li>sure your seller is direct from Korea and that you get the Korean brand and not some knock off.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good product</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>Color just right for my skin</li>
            <li>The dispenser allows you to get just the right amount</li>
            <li>I have not worn make-up before this, but now I wear it daily, because it is easy to apply, makes my skin look phenomenal, and really does fade spots, etc.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes.</li>
            <li>Great for my son&#x27;s small hoop.</li>
            <li>This product is great for everyday sun protection and medium coverage!</li>
            <li>Some are a little darker so make sure to go to the SKIN79 website for more information on this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB product and I&#x27;ve re-purchased it several times.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many american bb cream n</li>
            <li>It claims to be semi-matte, but I actually find it to be sheer, which I love more than matte.</li>
            <li>I love this product, even though I&#x27;ve only used it three days now.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and have spent years looking for a foundation that covers without looking caked on and that will last the day.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect!</li>
            <li>will absolutely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li>It really whitens with each application!</li>
            <li>only problem you may have is that it&#x27;s super super light so unless you have light skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>(I have a rather fair complexion, normally using ivory coverage in other make up.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several BB creams from this brand on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t anymore, because most of the times, the pumps break after a certain point</li>
            <li>It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave that visible line you sometimes get from other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 pump is more than enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li>I have tried Gold, Pink, Green and Purple BB creams from Skin79 and this Orange one has the best coverage.  </li>
            <li>It covers great, it covers while it treats dark spots at the same time.</li>
            <li>it made my skin very pretty, but it was a little too white for me, even though I do have fair skin myself.</li>
            <li>The colour is rather pale, which is great for me and it is long lasting :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;&#x27;ve also had a few girlfriends tell me my skin looks amazing .</li>
            <li>That is the downside of these BB creams-most only come in light.  </li>
            <li>The shade has a yellow undertone and is light.</li>
            <li>What i really like about this bb cream is the spf 50, i can use it when i dun wanna put a lot of makeup in a sunny day....</li>
            <li>and it did very well in the sun.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t darken at all thanks to the SPF 50++ in it.</li>
            <li>Covers really well</li>
            <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t need a lot and it still covers everything.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t blend as well and was really patchy.</li>
            <li>It has a more powdery finish than the other bb creams.</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch and easy to apply, this really beats out all the domestic and self-claimed BB creams.</li>
            <li>However, the coverage is good and it lasts relatively long compared to other bb creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I will still use it for the summer because of the high SPF content.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the color swatches online made it seem.</li>
            <li>Color is grayish though - mixes well with my normal foundation to achieve the desired color so I can use as a one step process.</li>
            <li>I ran out of this in two weeks and it normally lasts me for three or four months.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination skin, but I am dry in the morning, and this is moisturizing for me in the morning, but does a great job in controlling oil towards the afternoon and late mornings.</li>
            <li>Plus the sunscreen protection is out of this world, we live in Gulf Coast area and our face is always protected.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that there is only one skin tone, so if you&#x27;re not on the fair side,  bronzer is a must.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extraordinarily white ;)</li>
            <li>I have tried other bb creams of the same brand but this color fits me the most.</li>
            <li>This stuff comes out a little on the light side</li>
            <li>The sun protection seems good and the coverage is a little heavy for me</li>
            <li>and this does not break out or bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!!</li>
            <li>The color was very dense and extremely white for Mediterranean skin...</li>
            <li>I wish I could come in a few different tints so I can pick one that match better.</li>
            <li>This particular one has a semi-matte finish and is terrific for me in the heat of summer, as it never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>high SPF and one pump of product covers the entire face.  </li>
            <li>Wont work for golden to medium or dark skin tone.</li>
            <li>But I myself, can live with that over the actual results!</li>
            <li>You really only need one small pump since it is not as thick as the other ones and it evens out skin tone wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the korean formula, but all my domestic foundations work fine with my oil makeup removers.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look smooth, and it&#x27;s not too thick or noticeable.</li>
            <li>This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey.</li>
            <li>very light color with slightly less grey undertone than other BB creams.</li>
            <li>I will warn you the product at first seems like it sits heavy on your face when spreading.</li>

            <li> sure your seller is direct from Korea and that you get the Korean brand and not some knock off.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good product</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> Color just right for my skin</li>
            <li> The dispenser allows you to get just the right amount</li>
            <li> I have not worn make-up before this, but now I wear it daily, because it is easy to apply, makes my skin look phenomenal, and really does fade spots, etc.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes.</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s small hoop.</li>
            <li> This product is great for everyday sun protection and medium coverage!</li>
            <li> Some are a little darker so make sure to go to the SKIN79 website for more information on this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB product and I&#x27;ve re-purchased it several times.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many american bb cream n</li>
            <li> It claims to be semi-matte, but I actually find it to be sheer, which I love more than matte.</li>
            <li> I love this product, even though I&#x27;ve only used it three days now.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and have spent years looking for a foundation that covers without looking caked on and that will last the day.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect!</li>
            <li> will absolutely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> It really whitens with each application!</li>
            <li> only problem you may have is that it&#x27;s super super light so unless you have light skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> (I have a rather fair complexion, normally using ivory coverage in other make up.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several BB creams from this brand on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t anymore, because most of the times, the pumps break after a certain point</li>
            <li> It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave that visible line you sometimes get from other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 1/2 to 1 pump is more than enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li> I have tried Gold, Pink, Green and Purple BB creams from Skin79 and this Orange one has the best coverage.  </li>
            <li> It covers great, it covers while it treats dark spots at the same time.</li>
            <li> it made my skin very pretty, but it was a little too white for me, even though I do have fair skin myself.</li>
            <li> The colour is rather pale, which is great for me and it is long lasting :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;ve also had a few girlfriends tell me my skin looks amazing .</li>
            <li> That is the downside of these BB creams-most only come in light.  </li>
            <li> The shade has a yellow undertone and is light.</li>
            <li> What i really like about this bb cream is the spf 50, i can use it when i dun wanna put a lot of makeup in a sunny day....</li>
            <li> and it did very well in the sun.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t darken at all thanks to the SPF 50++ in it.</li>
            <li> Covers really well</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t need a lot and it still covers everything.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t blend as well and was really patchy.</li>
            <li> It has a more powdery finish than the other bb creams.</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch and easy to apply, this really beats out all the domestic and self-claimed BB creams.</li>
            <li> However, the coverage is good and it lasts relatively long compared to other bb creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I will still use it for the summer because of the high SPF content.  </li>
            <li> I love it, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the color swatches online made it seem.</li>
            <li> Color is grayish though - mixes well with my normal foundation to achieve the desired color so I can use as a one step process.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this in two weeks and it normally lasts me for three or four months.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin, but I am dry in the morning, and this is moisturizing for me in the morning, but does a great job in controlling oil towards the afternoon and late mornings.</li>
            <li> Plus the sunscreen protection is out of this world, we live in Gulf Coast area and our face is always protected.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that there is only one skin tone, so if you&#x27;re not on the fair side,  bronzer is a must.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extraordinarily white ;)</li>
            <li> I have tried other bb creams of the same brand but this color fits me the most.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes out a little on the light side</li>
            <li> The sun protection seems good and the coverage is a little heavy for me</li>
            <li> and this does not break out or bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!!</li>
            <li> The color was very dense and extremely white for Mediterranean skin...</li>
            <li> I wish I could come in a few different tints so I can pick one that match better.</li>
            <li> This particular one has a semi-matte finish and is terrific for me in the heat of summer, as it never feels greasy.</li>
            <li> high SPF and one pump of product covers the entire face.  </li>
            <li> Wont work for golden to medium or dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> But I myself, can live with that over the actual results!</li>
            <li> You really only need one small pump since it is not as thick as the other ones and it evens out skin tone wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the korean formula, but all my domestic foundations work fine with my oil makeup removers.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look smooth, and it&#x27;s not too thick or noticeable.</li>
            <li> This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey.</li>
            <li> very light color with slightly less grey undertone than other BB creams.</li>
            <li> I will warn you the product at first seems like it sits heavy on your face when spreading.</li>
            <li> I am extremely oily so if I wear this alone, it starts to slip by early afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear Mac nc30 and it is much lighter than my skin.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and takes me from 7 in the morning to 7 at night.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this BB Cream for a very long time now and am almost done with my second one.</li>
            <li> This blends well with my medium yellowish tone and allows it to be a little lighter naturally.</li>
            <li> Again, no makeup stays on me no matter how long wearing it promises to.  </li>
            <li> a 60 yr old ( a little dry for me</li>
            <li> so i only need a half pea size to cover my entire face and blend with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is definitely for people who have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which the t-zone is oily and the rest can be dry.</li>
            <li> Which really sucks, because I did like the high SPF</li>
            <li> what i dun like is that i have to use it always with loose powder</li>
            <li> The color is less grey than some of the other asian products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But first off, the pink skin 79 makes me looks weird and washed out white.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> so i have to use sunblock &amp; be careful w the sun..</li>
            <li> I only use this in the winter when I am pale.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I can mix it with any number of other products to get it</li>
            <li> I knew this product was drier than the other BB creams, and lighter.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It is however a little dry so moisturize before putting it on.</li>
            <li> because we find these BB creams to be very light in color for Caucasian--usually use a porcelain base.</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin, I strongly do not recommend you to buy this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it sticks in your pores even after  </li>
            <li> I have some acne scarring and imperfections on my face that this product seems to make less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So my solution has been applying less of it.</li>
            <li> It does oxidize a little bit</li>
            <li> Since summer i got a little sun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy when put on</li>
            <li> The text how its not oily n messy</li>
            <li> wasted 15 dollars&lt;</li>
            <li> It blends in however after it is on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> However, this product is quite pale in color for me and I am a NW15 in MAC.  </li>
            <li> I usually use oil makeup removers, but this just wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> No more acne problem since I start use this BB.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> It dries you skin by the end of the day and it is also extremely hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to switch to another brand because their dispensing mechanism sucks.</li>
            <li> Using it under my makeup, it holds up to 7 pm, although need to touch up by late afternoon.  </li>
            <li> so please don&#x27;t be a sucker like me.</li>
            <li> I know it was at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick</li>
            <li> Lays on thick, so don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency and can leave you looking a bit shiny which could be problematic if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Does require extra cleaning because of the cream base</li>
            <li> Compared to the gold and pink bottles, I just hated the formula of this BB cream.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> me encanto esta bb tambien tengo la de missha!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this BB cream was really good. it made my skin very pretty, but it was a little too white for me, even though I do have fair skin myself.</li>
            <li> Kind of oily to me, and makes me to have blemish. I threw it away after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> This is SO fantastic!  It has a medium to full coverage, high SPF and one pump of product covers the entire face.  It only comes in one color-light!  It does oxidize a little bit but if you are darker than an ivory-fair-porcelain, forget it.  That is the downside of these BB creams-most only come in light.  Some are a little darker so make sure to go to the SKIN79 website for more information on this. This particular one has a semi-matte finish and is terrific for me in the heat of summer, as it never feels greasy. LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB product and I&#x27;ve re-purchased it several times.  The sun protection seems good and the coverage is a little heavy for me but I can mix it with any number of other products to get it just right.  The color is less grey than some of the other asian products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I knew this product was drier than the other BB creams, and lighter. It works for oily skin. My skin looks matte now and I rarely break out now. The coverage isn&#x27;t that strong but the spf50 sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem you may have is that it&#x27;s super super light so unless you have light skin with a yellow undertone. I recommend mixing this with a darker shade of your regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was excellent. I got my package by the week estimated for arrival and the shipping was only $2. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product from them again.</li>
            <li> Great bb cream. I have tried many american bb cream n they just don&#x27;t seem to do the same job... Love the coverage n the price... The text how its not oily n messy</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream! The shade has a yellow undertone and is light. Great formula and natural-looking. It will even out your skin tone and cover some freckles, but you will have to go over with a concealer for your blemishes. Soft to the touch and easy to apply, this really beats out all the domestic and self-claimed BB creams. I have oily combination skin, but I am dry in the morning, and this is moisturizing for me in the morning, but does a great job in controlling oil towards the afternoon and late mornings. It claims to be semi-matte, but I actually find it to be sheer, which I love more than matte. Sheer, but not luminous. I usually use oil makeup removers, but this just wouldn&#x27;t come off. In fact, my face was just slathered in oil and I was just pushing the BB cream around my face. It would not come off. So I just resorted to using a facial cleanser and that did the trick. Not sure if it&#x27;s the korean formula, but all my domestic foundations work fine with my oil makeup removers.</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s small hoop.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product makes the skin look even after hours of wear.  It does end up looking more greasy towards the end of my 12 hour shift, but holds up well. The only down side is that there is only one skin tone, so if you&#x27;re not on the fair side,  bronzer is a must. People loved it on me so much that I ordered 3 more. One more word of advise, apply with stippling brush or a blending sponge.  A little goes a long way.  1/2 to 1 pump is more than enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say it has a medium coverage, to me is light coverage... What i really like about this bb cream is the spf 50, i can use it when i dun wanna put a lot of makeup in a sunny day.... what i dun like is that i have to use it always with loose powder otherwise it feels like sticky and is a bit lighter than my skin tone (medium)</li>
            <li> We have bought several bottles of this and just love it!!  It works great on a teenager and a 60 yr old ( a little dry for me but I just use my moisturizer with it)  Plus the sunscreen protection is out of this world, we live in Gulf Coast area and our face is always protected.  Does require extra cleaning because of the cream base but it has great coverage.  This is the second level of darkness tint because we find these BB creams to be very light in color for Caucasian--usually use a porcelain base.</li>
            <li> I love this product, even though I&#x27;ve only used it three days now. (I have a rather fair complexion, normally using ivory coverage in other make up.) This stuff comes out a little on the light side BUT when it spreads and settles, it looks much better and leaving my skin looking VERY healthy! I add a little blush or bronzer and I am good to go! I have some acne scarring and imperfections on my face that this product seems to make less noticeable. It has improved my complexion and texture of my face already! I will warn you the product at first seems like it sits heavy on your face when spreading. But I myself, can live with that over the actual results! Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Color is grayish though - mixes well with my normal foundation to achieve the desired color so I can use as a one step process.</li>
            <li> Im using my dads account. But first off, the pink skin 79 makes me looks weird and washed out white. This blends well with my medium yellowish tone and allows it to be a little lighter naturally. It is however a little dry so moisturize before putting it on. I brought this with me to the tropics and it did very well in the sun. My face didn&#x27;t darken at all thanks to the SPF 50++ in it. Highly recommend. I don&#x27;t break out either so it&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy when put on so i only need a half pea size to cover my entire face and blend with my fingers. Covers really well and i break out easy and this does not break out or bother my sensitive skin. Color is light and this blends well with my freckled skin and covers the freckles well. Since summer i got a little sun i used a little bronze and matched my skintone perfect. I&#x27;&#x27;ve also had a few girlfriends tell me my skin looks amazing . O and it covers blemishes too. My only complaint is it sticks in your pores even after  I wash  my face. I use a toner to clean my face and  shrink pores. Then put on the .bb cream my skin looks awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several BB creams from this brand on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t anymore, because most of the times, the pumps break after a certain point and I couldn&#x27;t use the cream in the rest of the bottle. I&#x27;ve had to switch to another brand because their dispensing mechanism sucks.</li>
            <li> 79 skin has many types of BB CREAM is especially summer use for my combination skin because love is brand has excellent quality and leave a beautiful finish on the skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years as a sunblock under my makeup.  Alas, I am not blessed with perfect skin so I cannot use this alone.  Under makeup, it provides added coverage and acts as my face primer for my foundation.  It is excellent for those purpose.  Long lasting and takes me from 7 in the morning to 7 at night.  I am extremely oily so if I wear this alone, it starts to slip by early afternoon.  Using it under my makeup, it holds up to 7 pm, although need to touch up by late afternoon.  Again, no makeup stays on me no matter how long wearing it promises to.  However, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; oily skin would probably not have the same issues.  Excellent product and must have if you are into sun protection!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!, I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it&#x27;s great for oily or dry skin. The colour is rather pale, which is great for me and it is long lasting :)</li>
            <li> IF I could rate it 0 stars i would. it never showed up.&lt;br /&gt;they said February 13 at the latest its June 3&lt;br /&gt;they will never reply to my messages i sent 2.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted 15 dollars&lt;br /&gt;i know thats not a allot but that 15 dollars is gone.&lt;br /&gt;its ridiculous. so please don&#x27;t be a sucker like me.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! I am 44 years old and have spent years looking for a foundation that covers without looking caked on and that will last the day.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect! It goes on thick so be careful. A little goes a very long way. It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave that visible line you sometimes get from other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> I love it, my only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t as light as the color swatches online made it seem.</li>
            <li> your the best yesss i real love it yappp it&#x27;s nice nice fantastic really nice nice nice nice yess yapppp</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin, I strongly do not recommend you to buy this product. It dries you skin by the end of the day and it is also extremely hard to wash off. Make sure to use a makeup remover to remove this bb cream. However, the coverage is good and it lasts relatively long compared to other bb creams I have ever used. P.S It does not have any  whitening effect if that is what you are looking for</li>
            <li> This cream has an additional SPF50 included in it which makes it great for outdoors.  It covers blemishes well...I think the one I ordered is just a bit light for my complexion but I make it work.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like what I want</li>
            <li> The only bb cream I use! It has an incredible-buildable coverage!! It if u do not want light skin- DO NOT USE IT. It really whitens with each application! N it&#x27;s extraordinarily white ;)</li>
            <li> Lays on thick, so don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;Very very light color with slightly less grey undertone than other BB creams. Not recommended for tanned or darker skin. If you have medium skin, like me, don&#x27;t use a lot and put foundation on top.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the SPF 50 since my face burns really easy and I&#x27;m trying to undergo a whitening regime!</li>
            <li> Very good product! Color just right for my skin, covers all scar and under eyes but not thick like liquid foundation, it&#x27;s very light. No more acne problem since I start use this BB. I am vet happy with this product and recommend!</li>
            <li> This is really great BB cream . It has just enough coverage for those with redness. you really don&#x27;t need a lot and it still covers everything. Personally this one is my favourite out of all the Skin 79 because of its collagen and whitening effect. The ingredients are all good. The colour is perfect. Smell is deliciousss.. I recommend it!~~&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your seller is direct from Korea and that you get the Korean brand and not some knock off. I recommend zinopark</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to Beblesh Balm.  I have not worn make-up before this, but now I wear it daily, because it is easy to apply, makes my skin look phenomenal, and really does fade spots, etc.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 bb creams. 1 is the Skin79 VIP gold collection bb cream and this one does have slightly more coverage, but it&#x27;s still medium like the VIP. However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!! That is the only reason why I am giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes. I know it was at least 5 minutes. If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell. This is definitely for people who have extremely oily skin. I have combination skin, which the t-zone is oily and the rest can be dry. This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey. And my t-zone was the oily opposite. So this is just not for me. Which really sucks, because I did like the high SPF and I thought I might use this for the summer. This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred. Another thing, this smells really great. If you like citrusy scents, this will be great. It smells like oranges, clean and crisp. It&#x27;s not overwhelming either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;m sticking to the VIP gold.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I only use this in the winter when I am pale. I never use it alone either, I mix it with my favorite brand of foundation because I find it looks better on me that way. I always get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to the gold and pink bottles, I just hated the formula of this BB cream. It didn&#x27;t blend as well and was really patchy.</li>
            <li> I love it, it look so natural and stay for many hrs</li>
            <li> This has good coverage. It has a more powdery finish than the other bb creams. It is also very fair. I usually wear Mac nc30 and it is much lighter than my skin. It blends in however after it is on for a few minutes. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The best BB I have ever taste!</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li> I use this BB cream every day. It makes my skin look smooth, and it&#x27;s not too thick or noticeable.</li>
            <li> work work work good work work review it comes good the item working good I give it 5 stars product work good</li>
            <li> I love it! It covers great, it covers while it treats dark spots at the same time. I have Lupus so i have to use sunblock &amp; be careful w the sun.. Well with skin 79 orange color I don&#x27;t have to worry! P.s. I&#x27;m on my 5th one</li>
            <li> This product is great for everyday sun protection and medium coverage! I have been using this BB Cream for a very long time now and am almost done with my second one. It has a thick consistency and can leave you looking a bit shiny which could be problematic if you have oily skin. However, I love the coverage and the high SPF and the shininess is not a problem if you use a mattifying moisturizer or primer and powder. One of my favorite BBs from Skin79! One star off for the oiliness, but overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried Gold, Pink, Green and Purple BB creams from Skin79 and this Orange one has the best coverage.  Highly recommend it.  You really only need one small pump since it is not as thick as the other ones and it evens out skin tone wonderfully. It is for light skin tone. Wont work for golden to medium or dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> Bottle came half-empty! I ran out of this in two weeks and it normally lasts me for three or four months. Other than that, good product</li>
            <li> I love how it blends on my skin. I have tried other bb creams of the same brand but this color fits me the most.</li>
            <li> This BB just didn&#x27;t cut it for me.  I am quite oily and this has a SUPER DEWEY finish.  I will still use it for the summer because of the high SPF content.  The coverage is actually pretty good for a BB cream, a decent medium coverage.  However, this product is quite pale in color for me and I am a NW15 in MAC.  Probably would be great for someone with dry to normal skin who is super fair.  Just not for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall very happy with this product. It provides great protection as a sun screen. Unlike the neutrogena sunscreen I used before this bbcream will keep your skin from getting darker in the sun. I like the consistency of it. It is easy to apply. The dispenser allows you to get just the right amount so you don&#x27;t waste any. Little goes a long way. I dab on my face and use fingers to blend. I also like the fact it stays on very well and its light. It doesn&#x27;t feels like it clog the pores at all. No breakouts and skin feel hydrated all day without greasiness. Some friends comment that it gives my face a pearly glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it  and therefore 4 stars instead of 5 is the tint. It doesn&#x27;t match my skin. It&#x27;s too white or ashy. Even after 10 min it still looks like it doesn&#x27;t quite blend. So my solution has been applying less of it. I wish I could come in a few different tints so I can pick one that match better. I guess Korean girls must be a lot whiter than Taiwanese :) ( I&#x27;m Taiwanese )</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!!!!!!! Very impressed.. Everything seems authentic, will use this seller again, the powder and foundation of super bb plys skin 79  leaves your face so fresh looking and soft</li>
            <li> The color was very dense and extremely white for Mediterranean skin... Did not work for me although it could be great for lighter skins.</li>
            <li> Made my make up look much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one in the orange bottle and the one in the red bottle. I had to give this one away because it was too light. The red bottle was perfect. I have medium skin.</li>
