    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think for some kids it would be a great way for them to brush-- you can open/close your mouth to change the pitch!</li>
            <li>After using the Oral-B for about 3 weeks I am very happy that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I had been watching prices to get the best deal when I saw this and ordered it.</li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>This item was a perfect gift, because the brush does all of the work, and his teeth are getting cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li>As I shopped around for this item, I found the best price here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush I bought a year ago.</li>
            <li>Very impressive lifespan on this one</li>
            <li>Great service!</li>
            <li>Its awesome.  </li>

            <li>This one is very good.</li>
            <li>I bought a Vitality Sonic to give it a try; what a beautiful piece of garbage made in Germany.</li>

            <li>and it still works great.    </li>
            <li>Anyway, the S-200 is a great value and performer and don&#x27;t let a lack of a storage tower be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with this product.</li>

            <li>and I feel I got a good deal on this model for $79.99.</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Pros:  - superior teeth cleaning  - 2-minute and</li>
            <li>Great brush so buy one much more bang for buck than Sonicare.</li>

            <li>My husband and I both have one and love it!</li>

            <li>Love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use and the timer is great.  </li>
            <li>You will notice whiter teeth within days, your teeth feel cleaner, gums feel tougher, and battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li>that would have been a nice accessory.</li>
            <li>The timer that this toothbrush has is really nice.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ve read the reviews about how this is a great toothbrush that does the job and your teeth will be clean.  </li>
            <li>They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Very happy with Sonic Complete Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and i liked it better.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that is priced well, and well worth the purchase.    </li>
            <li>It is quite strong and you must get used to the strong vibration inside your mouth, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, does a great job cleaning, and should be fairly easy to find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I really believe it feels just as good as getting my teeth cleaned!</li>
            <li>This was highly rated by Consumer Reports, Amazon.com had the best price by far, so my pearly whites are happy</li>
            <li>good - cleans pretty well, though not as good as the radius toothbrush (this is an angled brush with a huge head and a lot of bristles).  </li>
            <li>The price is great, the brush is simple and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the handle, it is slim and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>and this is way better.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.    </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this</li>
            <li>Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush cleans okay, but I wanted to store the brush-head inside the tower.</li>
            <li>(Well, okay...</li>
            <li>the charger is simple and perfect.  </li>
            <li>simple and perfect.   </li>
            <li>just because something is electric doesn&#x27;t make it better, just like</li>
            <li>- the sonicare screw on top was forever getting a buildup of stuff on it</li>
            <li>Sure you can replace the heads every 3 months or so</li>
            <li>If anything it&#x27;s nice to see a product available from somewhere else besides China.</li>
            <li>and it was only $79.99 which is the best price for a rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I now feel so invested in my teeth and keeping my mouth healthy that I will go get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Leave the illustration in the manual, where you have the space to include the appropriate warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose I could try my luck with another brand, but as the saying goes, it&#x27;s better to go with \\&quot;the devil</li>
            <li>her teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It has also helped me brush longer and more thuroughly.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite feature is the built in timer that pulses the toothbrush every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>I expect more than a hundred uses from an item made by a respectable manufacturer.</li>
            <li>#34;he must have used it a lot more than he thinks he did?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it does a good job in keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have adequate counter space, you will have to be a bit creative or flexible (or both) to make this work, but my folks are very pleased with how their teeth feel after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>, it does a good job and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase, a must have for anyone that is particular about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>to use, comfortable to handle, gentle but VERY effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush will clean your teeth much better then the battery powered Oral B tooth brushes and so much better</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush but the batteries are not replaceable so you need to replace the whole unit when they won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li>it just seemed faster to me and possibly a better clean, though i didn&#x27;t care for the liquid toothpaste thing.  </li>
            <li>stalk easily removes/pops out from the body for easy rinsing and storage</li>
            <li>I find the timer buzz convenient and easy to ignore if you chose so.</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>ever got them, and felt more like they do right after coming from the dentist for a cleaning!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it</li>
            <li>I have no idea why people are still buying Sonicare while this S-200 is so perfect and cost so little.</li>
            <li>; I had considered the Sonicare product but decided on this because of the huge price difference.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t bother with those really cheap ones they have now (like the spinbrush, etc.)    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fast and highly effective.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth as glass</li>
            <li>Two to three light brushings in the afternoon to evening.</li>
            <li>These are no longer available</li>
            <li>It has a great battery life and two different speeds.  </li>
            <li>2.5 years later and this thing is still working great.  </li>
            <li>My husband is not keen on the sound however.</li>
            <li>This sonic  oral B is by far superior.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for such a great deal!</li>
            <li>as far as electric toothbrushes go, this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The German really did a wonderful engineering job.</li>
            <li>Be sure you order right brushes.</li>
            <li>- toothbrush head holder in charging station can be pulled out easily for routine cleaning*  - drainage holes in the bottom of each toothbrush head slot (no nasty buildup) and good ventilation allows heads to dry</li>
            <li>, both are very powerful.    </li>
            <li>Its performance is similarly as good  as the Sonicare models but it has them beat by far both in cost and ease of keeping clean.</li>
            <li>After using the brush, my teeth feel smooth &amp; clean, like after going to a dentist.</li>
            <li>When I go for my annual cleaning to the dentist they always comment on how clean and tarter free my teeth are.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s something to smile about!</li>
            <li>Interestingly, when my girlfriend first started using it</li>
            <li>If you brush your teeth in four quadrants for 30 seconds each and stop at exactly 2 minutes, then you&#x27;ll love this brush</li>
            <li>I have already gotten more battery life out of this one, than my first one</li>
            <li>When I first bought the Sonic I emailed Braun asking if it was sealed from moisture (it sure appeared to be) because the manual recommended rinsing the brushhead but just wiping clean the handle/body.</li>
            <li>i tried a friend&#x27;s new sonicare (the kind that squeezes out crest liquid toothpaste through the brush)</li>
            <li>my teeth  are almost to a point of \\&quot;dental hygienist\\&quot; clean.  </li>
            <li>Has the feel of the instrument the dentist uses to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Has many of the same features and the timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Pros are that it seems to be as efficient as the Sonicare, easier to keep clean, and is lighter.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the clean feeling and the brushing so much, that I find myself brushing more often and for longer than 2 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li>the on/off button is easier to press, 3) easier clean up with the braun</li>
            <li>It leaves the teeth feeling clean and is not too bulky to hold.</li>
            <li>like having your dentist clean your teeth every day.</li>
            <li>They make your teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that my teeth felt much cleaner, very smooth.</li>
            <li>Its not as powerful a a Sonicare but still works fine.  </li>
            <li>This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way.</li>
            <li>and while I gave up on the gleaming white smile, I&#x27;m still very happy to have made it this far without any dental problems.</li>
            <li>A second push on the power button when running goes into \\&quot;slow\\&quot; vibration mode - good for brushing your tongue without feeling like you&#x27;re going to gag    </li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase, my teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>Overall, a really good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 years I think and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li>Full two minutes with the electric toothbrush as soon as I get out of bed.</li>
            <li>Worked well for awhile, then just stopped, even after full charge.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago and have really liked it so far.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t always use this, it has helped me to brush for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a better toothbrush that wants a cleaner mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I think Ni-Cd batteries are happier if you put them through full charge/discharge cycles, a full charge lasts a week.</li>
            <li>I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a great product.  </li>
            <li>and when it came on super sale at Amazon, I bought it.</li>
            <li>But it gets the job done well, and the timer ensures that you&#x27;ll give each quadrant of your mouth adequate cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just another example of a clever and ambiguous attempt to exploit the ignorance of people, to make more money.</li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brush takes up little room on my bathroom counter, and the toothbrush was a great price.</li>
            <li>I also find that it is fun to use</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>-powerful   </li>
            <li>It is indeed as powerful as Sonicare as you see in the video.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the amount of $$.</li>
            <li>and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums, so I was worried the more powerful vibrations of the brush would cause some damage but on the contrary, my gums feel healthier and stronger now.</li>
            <li>the Oral B S-200 but it was definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>And honestly, who reads manuals, especially for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the seller pays such close attention to consumer feedback.</li>
            <li>fancy version of a toothbrush but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well, after the VERY first time I used the Oral B S-200, my teeth felt more clean than my regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>Overall  Good product, works well, seems to be standing up to normal use.</li>
            <li>teeth are really squeaky clean after you use this toothbrush</li>
            <li>It was effortless to clean my teeth since the toothbrush did all the real work.</li>
            <li>It was a very unusual sensation--almost tickled--and made me laugh, but I soon got used to it after about a week.</li>
            <li>My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is helping the kids brush for a full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>My son actually LOVES how it sounds and wants his own...</li>
            <li>I am a brusher and flosser, but the results are very real.  </li>
            <li>New smile!</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush</li>
            <li>This is my first sonic toothbrush and I am please with its performance.     </li>
            <li>but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.</li>
            <li>Hopelessly, my attention went to Oral-B. First</li>
            <li>I also wonder why Oral-B still bother to make garbage like the Vitality Sonic for $20 while this one only cost $20 more than that.</li>
            <li>ONLINE UTUBE FOUND SEVERAL VIDEOS ON HOW TO CHANGE THE BATTERY, AND I WAS ABLE TO DO IT</li>
            <li>The sensations of this toothbrush are weirdly satisfying especially if you have never used a sonic toothbrush before.</li>
            <li>it seems to be pretty well sealed</li>
            <li>When I first started using the toothbrush, it took a while to get used to the sonic vibrations in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much better than the Oral-B Crossaction Power that I used earlier.</li>
            <li>It died after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch from a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My Mom got me my first oral B electric</li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t with my first one</li>
            <li>The timing mechanism is extra good, because it makes you really take the two minutes twice a day that you need to keep those pearly whites, well, pearly white!</li>
            <li>Also, the location of the on/off button is such that (for the way I use it) it is easy to change the setting on the brush or shut it off.</li>
            <li>Only lacks the travel case which you can easily rig one up but</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked the sonic complete toothbrush, would buy it again, and highly recommend everyone use a sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take a chance and ever submerge the brush/body/motor unit under water</li>
            <li>It certainly helps me to brush longer.  </li>
            <li>The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new.</li>
            <li>I just lightly rinse the top end of the body/handle and wipe the entire unit dry after each use.</li>
            <li>In my case, it woks fine only 3 months, after that this have an erratic perfomance.</li>
            <li>After hearing that this discomfort was due to brushing I  started using the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting and things returned to normal, and this lower setting still effectively cleaned my teeth.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product by Oral B, this model are not too soft, doing its work to brush every single teeth and gum, i like to use 2nd level to massage gum.</li>
            <li>went to see how much refills were at Wal-Mart and they were $7.97.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my teeth feel</li>
            <li>just like I had a real cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a no-nonsense toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.</li>
            <li>it does not require much pressure to brush.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the light on the charger is quite bright</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be much of a review.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe an electric toothbrush would make that much difference, but it has.</li>
            <li>So why have an illustration of this readily seen on the charger?</li>
            <li>I really feel that my mouth feels cleaner after I brush with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really fault the tooth brush</li>
            <li>Also, this really shouldn&#x27;t matter but this toothbrush is made in Germany.</li>
            <li>The good news is: It has been used at least twice a day since October 17, 2007.</li>
            <li>The head is nice and small and gets into hard to reach areas, the brush stand has no exposed metal (it&#x27;s really cool from an engineering standpoint, they seem to be using a magnetic field to charge the battery), so it&#x27;s pretty safe to leave by the sink.    </li>
            <li>Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.   </li>
            <li>; IT ORAL-B JUST WANTS YOU TO BUY A NEW TOOTHBRUSH..</li>
            <li>We owned an older model Braun power brush</li>
            <li>quickly realized that I could not put the parts back into the brush.</li>
            <li>$8 every three months is a bit more espensive than a regular brush (that I usually get free from Target when they have the tooth paste / tooth brush packages).</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t need the extra toothbrush compartment which is pretty much the difference between the two models.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this TB.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended</li>
            <li>There is a high and low setting that was useful for the kids.</li>
            <li>After using this sonic TB she wants to take it home and leave the old one at my house.  </li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than the old mechanical electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use.</li>
            <li>She normally uses the one that rotates by Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Initially, my mother said her gums bled a bit, but after a few days, that has stopped, indicating better gingival health!  </li>
            <li>THAT, THERE REMEDY WAS A $10.00 COUPON TOWARDS A NEW ONE...</li>
            <li>THEN YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A NEW ONE...</li>
            <li>when the color is halfway gone, you buy new brushes.  </li>
            <li>Refills are cheap enough ($5 dollar range) unlike some toothbrushes - low cost of ownership  3)</li>
            <li>The design is so much better in that the small brushhead  </li>
            <li>There appeared to be an o-ring at the top of the body where the small metal rod that the brushhead attaches to comes out of, and Braun support told me the unit was water-sealed.</li>
            <li>I follow a pretty basic mouth cleaning process of:</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.</li>
            <li>In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!</li>
            <li>the sonic care people did not to fix my old toothbrush, instead they wanted me to buy a new one..</li>
            <li>I owned an older model Braun with the round brush and never really liked it, but this Sonic Toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li>It took a few days to get use to the brush but after that, easy.  </li>
            <li>If I had the option, I would specifically rate this a 4.9, less than a perfect score, solely because of the questionable color plastics chosen for this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but in the meanwhile when (not if)  gunk and moisture finds its way into the many hard to get at places in the unit</li>
            <li>The seller didn&#x27;t include an invoice with my purchase but was extremely responsive and sent me a copy of the invoice quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one.  </li>
            <li>I thought it tickled my gums, but very shortly I realize how much the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of the toothbrush is working on cleaning your teeth</li>
            <li>So far it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It does need a spot to sit that is near an outlet for recharging.  </li>
            <li>you shouldn&#x27;t need sensitive unless you&#x27;re brushing your tongue.  </li>
            <li>if you dont frequent a dentist as often.</li>
            <li>so I ended up buying a Braun Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 kit at Target.</li>
            <li>Much improved from just using a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have owned and used the Oral B Sonic Complete model S-200 for nearly three years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the son of a dentist, so I was taught at an early age the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I told him I was using the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>My sensitive teeth much prefer it to the non-sonic Oral-B electric that I was previously using, and my teeth are very much whiter than before as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 2 minute timer - 30 seconds for each part of the quadrant (upper right, upper left, bottom right, bottom left of the mouth).</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s not so little...</li>
            <li>30-second timers  - does not automatically turn off after two minutes like some other electronic toothbrushes  - long-lasting charge (took it on several two-week vacations and it still had more charge left when I returned home)  - storage for three additional heads in charging station</li>
            <li>The other reviews all cover most of the basics, but one thing that keeps this from being a great toothbrush is the incredibly annoying \\&quot;timer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Cons:  -difficult to complete a full brushing without tapping the power button (first tap cycles to low speed, then off, then full power)  -30</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants clean teeth and can&#x27;t decide between the color green or blue.</li>
            <li>At least 250 full charge/discharge cycles is what I expect out of Ni-Cd&#x27;s, charging once every week gives me about 250 weeks (little more than 4.5 years).</li>
            <li>, heads stay on    Cons:  - no replacement battery (dead battery &#x3D; bulky manual toothbrush)  - no carrying case (apparently the S-320 model does)  - very long &amp; bulky (it was hard to fit into my toiletries travel case)  - no PDF/digital owner&#x27;s manual (OK, so this might be nit-picking, but keeping the printed manuals for every electronics gadget is a pain!)    </li>
            <li>you can set it to two different modes (normal, soft brushing)</li>
            <li>I have previously used two Sonicare models, the Advance and the Elite, and while they worked fine they were both frustratingly hard to keep clean</li>
            <li>-long handle makes it easy to reach into tight places   </li>
            <li>I consider myself a fairly simple man and will be trying to find a new model with the features this one has.</li>
            <li>So, when I bought some new heads it was time to bring the unit back to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>As reviews here say the Sonic Complete is as powerful as Sonicare and replacing the battery is possible, so I decided to give it a try when I saw the S-200 for less than 50 dollars shipped with 30-day return offered.    </li>
            <li>One thing I noticed that was not advertised was that in addition to the 2-minute timer (three long pauses), the brush also indicates 30-second intervals (one short pause), which I found very helpful for timing even brushing around all my teeth.     </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one, I&#x27;ve tried professional however</li>
            <li>I purchased replacement heads at regular intervals, and would recommend the soft heads.</li>
            <li>Apparently this was its death cry.</li>
            <li>I am tired of the hefty dentist bills and wanted to try something to get the kids to do a better job brushing their teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually think I&#x27;ll have the toothbrush that long, but the point is that I think the battery should be fine if you don&#x27;t charge it everyday.    </li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference from other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My dentist informed me that this was due to gum recession (when the gums are pushed back from the tooth, exposing the more delicate and HIGHLY sensitive roots of the tooth) caused by vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too professional, I only need a basic reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>only 2 settings - regular and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>electric razors are not necessarily any better, and often much worse, than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The Vitality barely moves, totally garbage.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, this is a very solid product that is held back by the fact that it looks like a hodgepodge of different color plastics, none of which come anywhere near matching or aethsetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, it took a few seconds to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>If you are someone with the same problems, a regular brusher who can&#x27;t seem to ever keep the build-up of plaque behind the front teeth, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>if need be, and the body can be gently rinsed under the tap and wiped down-</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I think for some kids it would be a great way for them to brush-- you can open/close your mouth to change the pitch!</li>

            <li> and I feel I got a good deal on this model for $79.99.</li>
            <li> so I was delighted to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - superior teeth cleaning  - 2-minute and</li>
            <li> Great brush so buy one much more bang for buck than Sonicare.</li>

            <li> My husband and I both have one and love it!</li>

            <li> Love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and the timer is great.  </li>
            <li> You will notice whiter teeth within days, your teeth feel cleaner, gums feel tougher, and battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li> that would have been a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> The timer that this toothbrush has is really nice.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ve read the reviews about how this is a great toothbrush that does the job and your teeth will be clean.  </li>
            <li> They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Sonic Complete Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and i liked it better.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that is priced well, and well worth the purchase.    </li>
            <li> It is quite strong and you must get used to the strong vibration inside your mouth, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, does a great job cleaning, and should be fairly easy to find replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I really believe it feels just as good as getting my teeth cleaned!</li>
            <li> This was highly rated by Consumer Reports, Amazon.com had the best price by far, so my pearly whites are happy</li>
            <li> good - cleans pretty well, though not as good as the radius toothbrush (this is an angled brush with a huge head and a lot of bristles).  </li>
            <li> The price is great, the brush is simple and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the handle, it is slim and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> and this is way better.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.    </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this</li>
            <li> Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleans okay, but I wanted to store the brush-head inside the tower.</li>
            <li> (Well, okay...</li>
            <li> the charger is simple and perfect.  </li>
            <li> simple and perfect.   </li>
            <li> just because something is electric doesn&#x27;t make it better, just like</li>
            <li> - the sonicare screw on top was forever getting a buildup of stuff on it</li>
            <li> Sure you can replace the heads every 3 months or so</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s nice to see a product available from somewhere else besides China.</li>
            <li> and it was only $79.99 which is the best price for a rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I now feel so invested in my teeth and keeping my mouth healthy that I will go get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Leave the illustration in the manual, where you have the space to include the appropriate warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose I could try my luck with another brand, but as the saying goes, it&#x27;s better to go with \\&quot;the devil</li>
            <li> her teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li> It has also helped me brush longer and more thuroughly.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite feature is the built in timer that pulses the toothbrush every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I expect more than a hundred uses from an item made by a respectable manufacturer.</li>
            <li> #34;he must have used it a lot more than he thinks he did?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does a good job in keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have adequate counter space, you will have to be a bit creative or flexible (or both) to make this work, but my folks are very pleased with how their teeth feel after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> , it does a good job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase, a must have for anyone that is particular about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> to use, comfortable to handle, gentle but VERY effective cleaning.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush will clean your teeth much better then the battery powered Oral B tooth brushes and so much better</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but the batteries are not replaceable so you need to replace the whole unit when they won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li> it just seemed faster to me and possibly a better clean, though i didn&#x27;t care for the liquid toothpaste thing.  </li>
            <li> stalk easily removes/pops out from the body for easy rinsing and storage</li>
            <li> I find the timer buzz convenient and easy to ignore if you chose so.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> ever got them, and felt more like they do right after coming from the dentist for a cleaning!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people are still buying Sonicare while this S-200 is so perfect and cost so little.</li>
            <li> ; I had considered the Sonicare product but decided on this because of the huge price difference.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bother with those really cheap ones they have now (like the spinbrush, etc.)    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fast and highly effective.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth as glass</li>
            <li> Two to three light brushings in the afternoon to evening.</li>
            <li> These are no longer available</li>
            <li> It has a great battery life and two different speeds.  </li>
            <li> 2.5 years later and this thing is still working great.  </li>
            <li> My husband is not keen on the sound however.</li>
            <li> This sonic  oral B is by far superior.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon, for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> as far as electric toothbrushes go, this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The German really did a wonderful engineering job.</li>
            <li> Be sure you order right brushes.</li>
            <li> - toothbrush head holder in charging station can be pulled out easily for routine cleaning*  - drainage holes in the bottom of each toothbrush head slot (no nasty buildup) and good ventilation allows heads to dry</li>
            <li> , both are very powerful.    </li>
            <li> Its performance is similarly as good  as the Sonicare models but it has them beat by far both in cost and ease of keeping clean.</li>
            <li> After using the brush, my teeth feel smooth &amp; clean, like after going to a dentist.</li>
            <li> When I go for my annual cleaning to the dentist they always comment on how clean and tarter free my teeth are.</li>
            <li> So far I have been very pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s something to smile about!</li>
            <li> Interestingly, when my girlfriend first started using it</li>
            <li> If you brush your teeth in four quadrants for 30 seconds each and stop at exactly 2 minutes, then you&#x27;ll love this brush</li>
            <li> I have already gotten more battery life out of this one, than my first one</li>
            <li> When I first bought the Sonic I emailed Braun asking if it was sealed from moisture (it sure appeared to be) because the manual recommended rinsing the brushhead but just wiping clean the handle/body.</li>
            <li> i tried a friend&#x27;s new sonicare (the kind that squeezes out crest liquid toothpaste through the brush)</li>
            <li> my teeth  are almost to a point of \\&quot;dental hygienist\\&quot; clean.  </li>
            <li> Has the feel of the instrument the dentist uses to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Has many of the same features and the timer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Pros are that it seems to be as efficient as the Sonicare, easier to keep clean, and is lighter.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the clean feeling and the brushing so much, that I find myself brushing more often and for longer than 2 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> the on/off button is easier to press, 3) easier clean up with the braun</li>
            <li> It leaves the teeth feeling clean and is not too bulky to hold.</li>
            <li> like having your dentist clean your teeth every day.</li>
            <li> They make your teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my teeth felt much cleaner, very smooth.</li>
            <li> Its not as powerful a a Sonicare but still works fine.  </li>
            <li> This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way.</li>
            <li> and while I gave up on the gleaming white smile, I&#x27;m still very happy to have made it this far without any dental problems.</li>
            <li> A second push on the power button when running goes into \\&quot;slow\\&quot; vibration mode - good for brushing your tongue without feeling like you&#x27;re going to gag    </li>
            <li> I am glad I made the purchase, my teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> Overall, a really good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 years I think and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> Full two minutes with the electric toothbrush as soon as I get out of bed.</li>
            <li> Worked well for awhile, then just stopped, even after full charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and have really liked it so far.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t always use this, it has helped me to brush for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a better toothbrush that wants a cleaner mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I think Ni-Cd batteries are happier if you put them through full charge/discharge cycles, a full charge lasts a week.</li>
            <li> I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a great product.  </li>
            <li> and when it came on super sale at Amazon, I bought it.</li>
            <li> But it gets the job done well, and the timer ensures that you&#x27;ll give each quadrant of your mouth adequate cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just another example of a clever and ambiguous attempt to exploit the ignorance of people, to make more money.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush takes up little room on my bathroom counter, and the toothbrush was a great price.</li>
            <li> I also find that it is fun to use</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> -powerful   </li>
            <li> It is indeed as powerful as Sonicare as you see in the video.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the amount of $$.</li>
            <li> and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, so I was worried the more powerful vibrations of the brush would cause some damage but on the contrary, my gums feel healthier and stronger now.</li>
            <li> the Oral B S-200 but it was definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> And honestly, who reads manuals, especially for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the seller pays such close attention to consumer feedback.</li>
            <li> fancy version of a toothbrush but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well, after the VERY first time I used the Oral B S-200, my teeth felt more clean than my regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Overall  Good product, works well, seems to be standing up to normal use.</li>
            <li> teeth are really squeaky clean after you use this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It was effortless to clean my teeth since the toothbrush did all the real work.</li>
            <li> It was a very unusual sensation--almost tickled--and made me laugh, but I soon got used to it after about a week.</li>
            <li> My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is helping the kids brush for a full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> My son actually LOVES how it sounds and wants his own...</li>
            <li> I am a brusher and flosser, but the results are very real.  </li>
            <li> New smile!</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush and I am please with its performance.     </li>
            <li> but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.</li>
            <li> Hopelessly, my attention went to Oral-B. First</li>
            <li> I also wonder why Oral-B still bother to make garbage like the Vitality Sonic for $20 while this one only cost $20 more than that.</li>
            <li> ONLINE UTUBE FOUND SEVERAL VIDEOS ON HOW TO CHANGE THE BATTERY, AND I WAS ABLE TO DO IT</li>
            <li> The sensations of this toothbrush are weirdly satisfying especially if you have never used a sonic toothbrush before.</li>
            <li> it seems to be pretty well sealed</li>
            <li> When I first started using the toothbrush, it took a while to get used to the sonic vibrations in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than the Oral-B Crossaction Power that I used earlier.</li>
            <li> It died after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch from a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Mom got me my first oral B electric</li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t with my first one</li>
            <li> The timing mechanism is extra good, because it makes you really take the two minutes twice a day that you need to keep those pearly whites, well, pearly white!</li>
            <li> Also, the location of the on/off button is such that (for the way I use it) it is easy to change the setting on the brush or shut it off.</li>
            <li> Only lacks the travel case which you can easily rig one up but</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked the sonic complete toothbrush, would buy it again, and highly recommend everyone use a sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take a chance and ever submerge the brush/body/motor unit under water</li>
            <li> It certainly helps me to brush longer.  </li>
            <li> The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new.</li>
            <li> I just lightly rinse the top end of the body/handle and wipe the entire unit dry after each use.</li>
            <li> In my case, it woks fine only 3 months, after that this have an erratic perfomance.</li>
            <li> After hearing that this discomfort was due to brushing I  started using the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting and things returned to normal, and this lower setting still effectively cleaned my teeth.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product by Oral B, this model are not too soft, doing its work to brush every single teeth and gum, i like to use 2nd level to massage gum.</li>
            <li> went to see how much refills were at Wal-Mart and they were $7.97.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my teeth feel</li>
            <li> just like I had a real cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a no-nonsense toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.</li>
            <li> it does not require much pressure to brush.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the light on the charger is quite bright</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be much of a review.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe an electric toothbrush would make that much difference, but it has.</li>
            <li> So why have an illustration of this readily seen on the charger?</li>
            <li> I really feel that my mouth feels cleaner after I brush with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really fault the tooth brush</li>
            <li> Also, this really shouldn&#x27;t matter but this toothbrush is made in Germany.</li>
            <li> The good news is: It has been used at least twice a day since October 17, 2007.</li>
            <li> The head is nice and small and gets into hard to reach areas, the brush stand has no exposed metal (it&#x27;s really cool from an engineering standpoint, they seem to be using a magnetic field to charge the battery), so it&#x27;s pretty safe to leave by the sink.    </li>
            <li> Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.   </li>
            <li> ; IT ORAL-B JUST WANTS YOU TO BUY A NEW TOOTHBRUSH..</li>
            <li> We owned an older model Braun power brush</li>
            <li> quickly realized that I could not put the parts back into the brush.</li>
            <li> $8 every three months is a bit more espensive than a regular brush (that I usually get free from Target when they have the tooth paste / tooth brush packages).</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t need the extra toothbrush compartment which is pretty much the difference between the two models.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this TB.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended</li>
            <li> There is a high and low setting that was useful for the kids.</li>
            <li> After using this sonic TB she wants to take it home and leave the old one at my house.  </li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than the old mechanical electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use.</li>
            <li> She normally uses the one that rotates by Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Initially, my mother said her gums bled a bit, but after a few days, that has stopped, indicating better gingival health!  </li>
            <li> THAT, THERE REMEDY WAS A $10.00 COUPON TOWARDS A NEW ONE...</li>
            <li> THEN YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A NEW ONE...</li>
            <li> when the color is halfway gone, you buy new brushes.  </li>
            <li> Refills are cheap enough ($5 dollar range) unlike some toothbrushes - low cost of ownership  3)</li>
            <li> The design is so much better in that the small brushhead  </li>
            <li> There appeared to be an o-ring at the top of the body where the small metal rod that the brushhead attaches to comes out of, and Braun support told me the unit was water-sealed.</li>
            <li> I follow a pretty basic mouth cleaning process of:</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.</li>
            <li> In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!</li>
            <li> the sonic care people did not to fix my old toothbrush, instead they wanted me to buy a new one..</li>
            <li> I owned an older model Braun with the round brush and never really liked it, but this Sonic Toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days to get use to the brush but after that, easy.  </li>
            <li> If I had the option, I would specifically rate this a 4.9, less than a perfect score, solely because of the questionable color plastics chosen for this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but in the meanwhile when (not if)  gunk and moisture finds its way into the many hard to get at places in the unit</li>
            <li> The seller didn&#x27;t include an invoice with my purchase but was extremely responsive and sent me a copy of the invoice quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one.  </li>
            <li> I thought it tickled my gums, but very shortly I realize how much the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of the toothbrush is working on cleaning your teeth</li>
            <li> So far it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It does need a spot to sit that is near an outlet for recharging.  </li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t need sensitive unless you&#x27;re brushing your tongue.  </li>
            <li> if you dont frequent a dentist as often.</li>
            <li> so I ended up buying a Braun Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 kit at Target.</li>
            <li> Much improved from just using a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used the Oral B Sonic Complete model S-200 for nearly three years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the son of a dentist, so I was taught at an early age the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; way to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I told him I was using the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> My sensitive teeth much prefer it to the non-sonic Oral-B electric that I was previously using, and my teeth are very much whiter than before as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 2 minute timer - 30 seconds for each part of the quadrant (upper right, upper left, bottom right, bottom left of the mouth).</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s not so little...</li>
            <li> 30-second timers  - does not automatically turn off after two minutes like some other electronic toothbrushes  - long-lasting charge (took it on several two-week vacations and it still had more charge left when I returned home)  - storage for three additional heads in charging station</li>
            <li> The other reviews all cover most of the basics, but one thing that keeps this from being a great toothbrush is the incredibly annoying \\&quot;timer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Cons:  -difficult to complete a full brushing without tapping the power button (first tap cycles to low speed, then off, then full power)  -30</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants clean teeth and can&#x27;t decide between the color green or blue.</li>
            <li> At least 250 full charge/discharge cycles is what I expect out of Ni-Cd&#x27;s, charging once every week gives me about 250 weeks (little more than 4.5 years).</li>
            <li> , heads stay on    Cons:  - no replacement battery (dead battery &#x3D; bulky manual toothbrush)  - no carrying case (apparently the S-320 model does)  - very long &amp; bulky (it was hard to fit into my toiletries travel case)  - no PDF/digital owner&#x27;s manual (OK, so this might be nit-picking, but keeping the printed manuals for every electronics gadget is a pain!)    </li>
            <li> you can set it to two different modes (normal, soft brushing)</li>
            <li> I have previously used two Sonicare models, the Advance and the Elite, and while they worked fine they were both frustratingly hard to keep clean</li>
            <li> -long handle makes it easy to reach into tight places   </li>
            <li> I consider myself a fairly simple man and will be trying to find a new model with the features this one has.</li>
            <li> So, when I bought some new heads it was time to bring the unit back to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> As reviews here say the Sonic Complete is as powerful as Sonicare and replacing the battery is possible, so I decided to give it a try when I saw the S-200 for less than 50 dollars shipped with 30-day return offered.    </li>
            <li> One thing I noticed that was not advertised was that in addition to the 2-minute timer (three long pauses), the brush also indicates 30-second intervals (one short pause), which I found very helpful for timing even brushing around all my teeth.     </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one, I&#x27;ve tried professional however</li>
            <li> I purchased replacement heads at regular intervals, and would recommend the soft heads.</li>
            <li> Apparently this was its death cry.</li>
            <li> I am tired of the hefty dentist bills and wanted to try something to get the kids to do a better job brushing their teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually think I&#x27;ll have the toothbrush that long, but the point is that I think the battery should be fine if you don&#x27;t charge it everyday.    </li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference from other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My dentist informed me that this was due to gum recession (when the gums are pushed back from the tooth, exposing the more delicate and HIGHLY sensitive roots of the tooth) caused by vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too professional, I only need a basic reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> only 2 settings - regular and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> electric razors are not necessarily any better, and often much worse, than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The Vitality barely moves, totally garbage.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, this is a very solid product that is held back by the fact that it looks like a hodgepodge of different color plastics, none of which come anywhere near matching or aethsetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, it took a few seconds to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> If you are someone with the same problems, a regular brusher who can&#x27;t seem to ever keep the build-up of plaque behind the front teeth, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li> if need be, and the body can be gently rinsed under the tap and wiped down-</li>
            <li> WHEN OPEN TOOTHBRUSH MAKE SURE U DON&#x27;T BREAK THE VERY THIN COPPER WIRES, CUS</li>
            <li> I bought them on Ebay for less than half the retail price, so I can buy more to save the trouble to switch heads.</li>
            <li> the radius is a whole newworld of brushing - it feels weird at first</li>
            <li> Apparently others have said that now the storage tower isn&#x27;t included with  models other than the more expensive S-320.</li>
            <li> Problem: The units don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have to just hope my next one lasts as long as this one.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this procedure is only used years in the future when the battery finally dies, and if you are inclined to dispose of the battery at a recycling center.</li>
            <li> Each charge last for a long time as well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good tooth brush, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> video shows the performance between 3 typical sonic brushes: Sonicare e3000, Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 and Vitality Sonic.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Sonic Complete Pro</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t they just make this toothbrush a simple black, white, or any solid color?  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to brush your tongue with, but my tongue scraper takes care of that just fine.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t hurt your gums.    </li>
            <li> so you know how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I had bought a Sonicare toothbrush not too long ago as I had one that died.</li>
            <li> , you think i need my toothbrush telling me how long to brush?????  </li>
            <li> This change took a little getting used to: the sonicare had straight bristles, the braun slightly angled bristles.</li>
            <li> (The quality of the Sonicares I formerly used declined to the point where a unit typically lasted only a month or two.)</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare in the past and was in the market for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 30 second indicator to move to another section of your mouth frees me up to think about other things than brushing.  </li>
            <li> Web site often suggest what other people bought at same time.  </li>
            <li> The kit I bought at Target included a nice storage tower/charger base for 3 brushheads, andmy model doesn&#x27;t include the massage feature (big deal).</li>
            <li> Packaging was kind of flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a cover for the toothbrush head which is less sanitary in a bathroom setting, and will make it annoying to share across multiple people with nowhere to store the extra heads.     </li>
            <li> and you just make small circles with the brush and let the sonic action do the rest.  </li>
            <li> , it has come down in recent years.</li>
            <li> After years of my dental hygienist asking me why I haven&#x27;t bought one of these sonic toothbrushes, I finally broke down and bought one.  </li>
            <li> This is smaller and ligher--takes up way less counter space.</li>
            <li> and I had a lot less plaque at my last dental appointment.  </li>
            <li> then after 2 minutes it vibrates 4 times to tell me to stop brushing, because i&#x27;m too stupid to make my own decisions.  </li>
            <li> have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Got this a few weeks back when it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d not really want the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> THAT I NEEDED FOR A FEW EXTRA BUCKS</li>
            <li> After my last AA power toothbrush corroded and died after just a few months of use, I picked this one up.</li>
            <li> How is a person supposed to know that following the illustration would destroy their toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Then 3 months later I started having trouble with the vibration of the head.</li>
            <li> I later ordered replacement heads, and now my mother shares the base and they are both able to use this to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I previous had a elite sonic care tooth brush that cost over $100.00 and died a few years later...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first -</li>
            <li> The other two work closely well</li>
            <li> and they can now move to the other side of their mouth.</li>
            <li> So, yes, when I am an empty nester and can utilize my counter space for this tool, I will purchase one, too!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush because my other one gave out.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because it was a gold box savings and needed to replace my other Oral B.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing mindless and helped my boys know how long to brush each area.</li>
            <li> it pauses with a little blip - gets kind of annoying  </li>
            <li> YOU DO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see how my next dentist appointment goes and if I have to spend less time than usual with the dental hygienist and that scary sharp scraper thing she uses.</li>
            <li> If you would rather brush your teeth on your own time, then it&#x27;s incredibly annoying that the motor skips every 30 seconds and then stutters for a few seconds every 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The only con I have noticed is that the tooth brush head is alittle small, but the vibration and cleaning power of the toothbrush makes this less noticeable.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the last few weeks the toothbrush would occasionally not turn on, and eventually started to spontaneously/randomly turn on for brief moments.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are a little harder than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks on one charge (takes 12-14 hrs to fully charge) and the charger unit makes a convenient stand for the toothbrush  -charging unit serves as toothbrush stand (would be even better if the power cord was detachable from the charging base to allow for clutter-free storage for the toothbrush between charges)  </li>
            <li> and it gets down in the crevices.  </li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush but after being encouraged by the dentist for years, I decided to break down and get one.  </li>
            <li> Both the brush and the head cost significantly less than Sonicare.    </li>
            <li> My dentist has stated I have less tarter build up</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, my dentist noticed there was less tartar build-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- lasts about a week and half without charging (like any rechargeable battery, the battery will eventually die).</li>
            <li> No delays or hidden charges.</li>
            <li> second timer is annoying - brush signals by going into a quick on-off sequence for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get into the unit to see if the battery contacts need readjusting or something--if anything inside goes wrong, you&#x27;re looking at purchasing a new unit.</li>
            <li> I did have braces and brushed at least 3 if not more times a day</li>
            <li> Since then, we were scared to waste hundreds of dollars again.    </li>
            <li> so you have to keep in the the charger everyday...</li>
            <li> A FEW MONTHS AGO..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M TIRED OF BUYING THINGS THAT DON&#x27;T EVEN LAST</li>
            <li> I misplaced the Sonicare and cannot find it.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my father, who has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and was having trouble brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li> but like I said I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a few years</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads suggested do not fit the Oral B S-200.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my teeth look whiter</li>
            <li> But if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the back of the handle is a repugnant seafoam green color.  </li>
            <li> It apparently wasn&#x27;t too difficult to learn how to use, as my parents are both in their seventies and do not care for a lot of techno gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product over the past month and here are my findings:    </li>
            <li> Is it really necessary then to provide instructions for this on the charger, when it renders the appliance useless?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether leaving the toothbrush on the charger all the time would over time lead to diminished battery life, but would recommend against storing it on the charger.     </li>
            <li> Of course, the bristles themselves are yet another random shade of blue.  </li>
            <li> After about two years of using the brush, I noticed some small areas at the base of a few teeth that became VERY sensitive to the slightest pressure.</li>
            <li> It has a timer which is   helpful plus cuts off if brushing an area too hard.  </li>
            <li> the head can reach around to those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places.  </li>
            <li> I think my boys were pressing too hard on their teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product only for a month, some other reviewers were disappointed with the battery life, I can&#x27;t comment on that yet.</li>
            <li> No hassle to remove and clean the brush head; had to do those with the Sonicare each and every time, or it would get really disgusting.</li>
            <li> it was less expensive than the Sonicare, I wanted to compare the two, and if I find the Sonicare</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of buying the Oral-B S-200 because I&#x27;d had a Sonicare Advance 4100 for probably 3 years before.</li>
            <li> It is slightly harsher - the brush with it is a little harsher on my teeth and gums, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> illustration shows how to remove the base and the inner parts/battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and no build up of plaque behind the front teeth.</li>
            <li> bad - the head is too small, therefore it takes longer to brush than i care for.        </li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> The S-200 does not come with a \\&quot;refill storage tower\\&quot;; the picture is wrong.</li>
            <li> Now it does not vibrate at all and its useless.</li>
            <li> STINKS..</li>
            <li> useless and annoying to me.  </li>
            <li> bad -</li>
            <li> Well, for me it&#x27;s a bad experience with this item.  </li>
            <li> The bad news:</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i hate the stupid quadrant timer.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see why people find it annoying.     </li>
            <li> I examined the base of the brush and the recharging stand, but both were plastic.</li>
            <li> The manual states, \\&quot;removing the base DESTROYS THE APPLIANCE, and VOIDS</li>
            <li> i hate stupid gimmicks!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You will notice whiter teeth within days, your teeth feel cleaner, gums feel tougher, and battery life is amazing.  It will go up to 2 weeks on one charge.  It has a built-in timer so you know how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth.  It also has 2 speeds for sensitivity.  Great purchase, a must have for anyone that is particular about oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I owned an older model Braun with the round brush and never really liked it, but this Sonic Toothbrush works great.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for about a month.  Its not as powerful a a Sonicare but still works fine.  I love the feel of the handle, it is slim and very light weight.  It hold a charge for sbout two weeks.  Only con is after two minutes of brushing it doesn&#x27;t turn off on it on, you have to manual do it.  Great brush so buy one much more bang for buck than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for a Christmas present.  I had thought about getting an electronic toothbrush, but I had not done any research.  In any case, I was eager to try it.  When I first used it, it took a few seconds to get used to it.  I thought it tickled my gums, but very shortly I realize how much the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of the toothbrush is working on cleaning your teeth and you just make small circles with the brush and let the sonic action do the rest.  I have used it a couple of times and already my teeth feel cleaner.  I also find that it is fun to use so I end up brushing my teeth a lot longer than with a regular brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went to see how much refills were at Wal-Mart and they were $7.97.  This is why I gave it 4 stars and not five.  $8 every three months is a bit more espensive than a regular brush (that I usually get free from Target when they have the tooth paste / tooth brush packages).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toothbrush. It leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than ever without harming your gums.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. Well worth the money. There is a noticable difference between using this and using a manual brush. I also used to have a sonicare and this is way better.</li>
            <li> We owned an older model Braun power brush but it wasn&#x27;t sonic. This is smaller and ligher--takes up way less counter space. The cleaning is wonderful and makes your mouth feel fresh and wonderful. It does however, make quite a &#x27;singing&#x27; noise while using. My son actually LOVES how it sounds and wants his own...I think for some kids it would be a great way for them to brush-- you can open/close your mouth to change the pitch! Great price as well, it has come down in recent years. A pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush and I am please with its performance.     Pros:  -powerful   -long handle makes it easy to reach into tight places   -operates app. 2 weeks on one charge (takes 12-14 hrs to fully charge) and the charger unit makes a convenient stand for the toothbrush  -charging unit serves as toothbrush stand (would be even better if the power cord was detachable from the charging base to allow for clutter-free storage for the toothbrush between charges)  -price; I had considered the Sonicare product but decided on this because of the huge price difference. I am satisfied.    Cons:  -difficult to complete a full brushing without tapping the power button (first tap cycles to low speed, then off, then full power)  -30 second timer is annoying - brush signals by going into a quick on-off sequence for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> So far it has met my expectations. I have only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using an oral B rotating brush head for several years.  This sonic  oral B is by far superior.  I have been using it for about a month and my teeth  are almost to a point of \\&quot;dental hygienist\\&quot; clean.  It has a timer which is   helpful plus cuts off if brushing an area too hard.  Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> Got this a few weeks back when it was on sale.  I can&#x27;t compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  My dentist recommended the phillips brand but I chose this one over the price.  I love it.  If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one.  It&#x27;s amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel.  I was skeptical at first - I just thought my dentist was trying to give me something I did not need.  I was wrong I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Sonic Complete Rechargeable Toothbrush. Has the feel of the instrument the dentist uses to clean your teeth. Does a great a job.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these Oral-B toothbrush units in mid-December 2009, one for me and one for my husband. They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean. Problem: The units don&#x27;t last long. Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use. You can&#x27;t get into the unit to see if the battery contacts need readjusting or something--if anything inside goes wrong, you&#x27;re looking at purchasing a new unit. Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market. (The quality of the Sonicares I formerly used declined to the point where a unit typically lasted only a month or two.)</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of buying the Oral-B S-200 because I&#x27;d had a Sonicare Advance 4100 for probably 3 years before. I was so used to it I thought I&#x27;d not really want the Oral-B. I am pleasantly surprised. It is slightly harsher - the brush with it is a little harsher on my teeth and gums, but not in a bad way. After using the Oral-B for about 3 weeks I am very happy that I made this purchase. It&#x27;s light, does a great job cleaning, and should be fairly easy to find replacement brushes. Thanks, Amazon, for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this and I had been watching prices to get the best deal when I saw this and ordered it. I really like the way it makes my teeth feel just like I had a real cleaning at the dentist office. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the vibrations, they make my nose tickle. It works great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the past month and here are my findings:    Pros  1) Cleans teeth well, I have deep molars and it gets down in the crevices.  2) Refills are cheap enough ($5 dollar range) unlike some toothbrushes - low cost of ownership  3) Well sealed, doesn&#x27;t seem to build up any toothpaste munge, and rinses off well  4) A second push on the power button when running goes into \\&quot;slow\\&quot; vibration mode - good for brushing your tongue without feeling like you&#x27;re going to gag    Cons  1) 30 second pause - every 30 seconds it pauses with a little blip - gets kind of annoying  2) Packaging was kind of flimsy, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a cover for the toothbrush head which is less sanitary in a bathroom setting, and will make it annoying to share across multiple people with nowhere to store the extra heads.     Overall  Good product, works well, seems to be standing up to normal use. If you&#x27;re looking for a no-nonsense toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo6KXAGJI6BC40]]This video shows the performance between 3 typical sonic brushes: Sonicare e3000, Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 and Vitality Sonic. The Vitality barely moves, totally garbage. The other two work closely well, both are very powerful.    We bought 3 Sonicare brushes in our family several years ago, per our dentist&#x27;s suggestion. They cost over $100/ea and they all died in a year or so (actually just the battery, but no way to replace just the battery). Since then, we were scared to waste hundreds of dollars again.    Then I found the Sonicare e3000 that uses 2 AA batteries, thought it could solve the battery problem. What a nightmare, water leaked in and broke them one after one.    Hopelessly, my attention went to Oral-B. First I bought a Vitality Sonic to give it a try; what a beautiful piece of garbage made in Germany. No vibe at all, as you see in the video. As reviews here say the Sonic Complete is as powerful as Sonicare and replacing the battery is possible, so I decided to give it a try when I saw the S-200 for less than 50 dollars shipped with 30-day return offered.    Cannot be happier. The timer does not shut off the brush at 2 minutes like the Sonicare does. The brush bristles are a little harder than Sonicare. Both are very good things to my tea teeth. It is indeed as powerful as Sonicare as you see in the video. Made in Germany, including the charger. No hassle to remove and clean the brush head; had to do those with the Sonicare each and every time, or it would get really disgusting. Both the brush and the head cost significantly less than Sonicare.    I have no idea why people are still buying Sonicare while this S-200 is so perfect and cost so little. I also wonder why Oral-B still bother to make garbage like the Vitality Sonic for $20 while this one only cost $20 more than that.</li>
            <li> I previous had a elite sonic care tooth brush that cost over $100.00 and died a few years later...the sonic care people did not to fix my old toothbrush, instead they wanted me to buy a new one.. so i would never buy sonic care again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i saw the reviews on this toothbrush and decide to try it...1st my teeth feel a lot cleaner than with sonic care elite..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that when you use to toothbrush longer than 20 seconds, a fully charged battery runs out in about 4 -5 days..so you have to keep in the the charger everyday...also it louder than the sonic care elite..but you get use to it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your teeth are really squeaky clean after you use this toothbrush, i know i ran my finger over my teeth and it squeaked...&lt;br /&gt;this is a great toothbrush at a great price....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL ORAL-B JUST LIKE PHILIPS CUSTOMER SERVICE STINKS..I CONTACTED THEM BECAUSE THIS TOOTHBRUSH STARTED RUNNING OUT OF POWER A FEW MONTHS AGO..ORAL-B STATED THAT THE TOOTHBRUSH SHOULD LAST BETWEEN 3-5 YRS, WELL MINE LASTED MAYBE 2 YRS 2MONTHS AFTER THE POWER PROBLEM STARTED WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT, THERE REMEDY WAS A $10.00 COUPON TOWARDS A NEW ONE...THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE SO I WENT ONLINE UTUBE FOUND SEVERAL VIDEOS ON HOW TO CHANGE THE BATTERY, AND I WAS ABLE TO DO IT AND MY TOOTHBRUSH IS BACK TO WORKING AGAIN, I WENT TO BATTERY PLUS STORE AND THEY CONNECTED THE 2 BATTERIES THAT I NEEDED FOR A FEW EXTRA BUCKS, IT COST ME ALL OF $9.00..SO THERE YOU HAVE; IT ORAL-B JUST WANTS YOU TO BUY A NEW TOOTHBRUSH..I&#x27;M TIRED OF BUYING THINGS THAT DON&#x27;T EVEN LAST THE TIME THEY ARE SUPPOSE TOO..IF ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM JUST CHECKOUT THE UTUBE VIDEOS ON CHANGE ORAL-B TOOTHBRUSH BATTERY..IT WORKS..YOU DO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN OPEN TOOTHBRUSH MAKE SURE U DON&#x27;T BREAK THE VERY THIN COPPER WIRES, CUS IF THAT HAPPEN THEN YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A NEW ONE...</li>
            <li> I had bought a Sonicare toothbrush not too long ago as I had one that died. On a recent trip to the mountains of Colorado I misplaced the Sonicare and cannot find it. I bought this for a couple of reasons - it was less expensive than the Sonicare, I wanted to compare the two, and if I find the Sonicare I will have two different brushes.    So far I have been very pleased with the unit. Has many of the same features and the timer is a nice feature. Pros are that it seems to be as efficient as the Sonicare, easier to keep clean, and is lighter. Cons are that after the timer goes through it cycle it does not shut off the toothbrush. Also, the location of the on/off button is such that (for the way I use it) it is easy to change the setting on the brush or shut it off. Once you change it the timer resets itself.    All in all I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the purchase, my teeth feel so much cleaner and I am brushing longer as well.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting one of these for a while and when it came on super sale at Amazon, I bought it. I definitely feel like my teeth are cleaner using this brush over a regular brush. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how my next dentist appointment goes and if I have to spend less time than usual with the dental hygienist and that scary sharp scraper thing she uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product by Oral B, this model are not too soft, doing its work to brush every single teeth and gum, i like to use 2nd level to massage gum. This is my 2nd one, I&#x27;ve tried professional however, it&#x27;s too professional, I only need a basic reliable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a 2nd toothbrush for my girlfriend who visits on the weekends.  She normally uses the one that rotates by Oral B.  After using this sonic TB she wants to take it home and leave the old one at my house.  I highly recommend this TB.  Had it since October &#x27;09 and have had no problems with it.  Only lacks the travel case which you can easily rig one up but that would have been a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush. Actually, it&#x27;s not so little... But it gets the job done well, and the timer ensures that you&#x27;ll give each quadrant of your mouth adequate cleaning. After my last AA power toothbrush corroded and died after just a few months of use, I picked this one up. It seems to be made to last.</li>
            <li> The S-200 does not come with a \\&quot;refill storage tower\\&quot;; the picture is wrong. Instead, it has a tiny charger stand. The toothbrush cleans okay, but I wanted to store the brush-head inside the tower.</li>
            <li> I returned this product with Delievery confirmation showing the seller received it back on Dec 23rd 2010 but still they have not posted a credit for the return. I sent them an email yesterday to check the status but still have not received a reply from them.</li>
            <li> When my Sonicare toothbrush stopped working after only 18 months, I asked my dentist for a toothbrush recommendation.  He recommended this toothbrush, and I love it!.  The 30 second indicator to move to another section of your mouth frees me up to think about other things than brushing.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I enjoy the clean feeling and the brushing so much, that I find myself brushing more often and for longer than 2 minutes at a time.  The brush takes up little room on my bathroom counter, and the toothbrush was a great price. Overall, a really good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my kids. I am tired of the hefty dentist bills and wanted to try something to get the kids to do a better job brushing their teeth thoroughly. The timer that this toothbrush has is really nice. It lets the kids know when 30 seconds is up and they can now move to the other side of their mouth. So far, it is helping the kids brush for a full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my father, who has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and was having trouble brushing his teeth.  This item was a perfect gift, because the brush does all of the work, and his teeth are getting cleaner than before.  I later ordered replacement heads, and now my mother shares the base and they are both able to use this to brush their teeth.  It apparently wasn&#x27;t too difficult to learn how to use, as my parents are both in their seventies and do not care for a lot of techno gadgets.  As I was shopping for an electric toothbrush, the reviews on this model steered me toward it specifically because of its ease of use.  It does need a spot to sit that is near an outlet for recharging.  If you don&#x27;t have adequate counter space, you will have to be a bit creative or flexible (or both) to make this work, but my folks are very pleased with how their teeth feel after using this brush.  Initially, my mother said her gums bled a bit, but after a few days, that has stopped, indicating better gingival health!  So, yes, when I am an empty nester and can utilize my counter space for this tool, I will purchase one, too!  (Well, okay...maybe sooner.)      As I shopped around for this item, I found the best price here at Amazon.  It was definitely worth the amount of $$.</li>
            <li> as far as electric toothbrushes go, this is a good deal.  don&#x27;t bother with those really cheap ones they have now (like the spinbrush, etc.)    i tried a friend&#x27;s new sonicare (the kind that squeezes out crest liquid toothpaste through the brush) and i liked it better.  it just seemed faster to me and possibly a better clean, though i didn&#x27;t care for the liquid toothpaste thing.  so i got this one to save money.      the good - it&#x27;s simple.  put the toothpaste on and go.  only 2 settings - regular and sensitive.  you shouldn&#x27;t need sensitive unless you&#x27;re brushing your tongue.  the charger is simple and perfect.  the brushes change color to indicate use.  when the color is halfway gone, you buy new brushes.  simple and perfect.   i hate stupid gimmicks!  which brings me to..    bad - i hate the stupid quadrant timer.  i&#x27;ve been brushing since i was a child, you think i need my toothbrush telling me how long to brush?????  there&#x27;s no \\&quot;off\\&quot; button to turn this feature off.  so every 30 seconds the toothbrush stops working for a second and vibrates.  useless and annoying to me.  then after 2 minutes it vibrates 4 times to tell me to stop brushing, because i&#x27;m too stupid to make my own decisions.  look, if i want to brush for 2 1/2 or 3 minutes, is that a crime??  leave me alone, toothbrush!  i know when i&#x27;m done!      good - cleans pretty well, though not as good as the radius toothbrush (this is an angled brush with a huge head and a lot of bristles).  the head can reach around to those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places.  it does not require much pressure to brush.  it doesn&#x27;t require using a lot of toothpaste.     bad - the head is too small, therefore it takes longer to brush than i care for.        summary - 3 stars.  i prefer it to a normal-sized manual brush but not the radius toothbrush.  just because something is electric doesn&#x27;t make it better, just like electric razors are not necessarily any better, and often much worse, than a manual razor.  the radius is a whole newworld of brushing - it feels weird at first but you get used to it.  it&#x27;s fast and highly effective.  just my opinion, i say go for a sonicare if you want an electric and can afford one, but if you want an electric and are looking to save money, this is a reliable product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to a manual toothbrush!  My dentist even saw a difference after 6 months!  My husband and I both have one and love it!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 4 years when the battery died. Loved it. Looked around to replace it with another sonic toothbrush and chose the Braun S-200. This change took a little getting used to: the sonicare had straight bristles, the braun slightly angled bristles. Things I like about the S-200 over the sonicare: 1) timer doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes is up (I always had to turn the sonicare back on to finish up), 2) the on/off button is easier to press, 3) easier clean up with the braun - the sonicare screw on top was forever getting a buildup of stuff on it</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but the batteries are not replaceable so you need to replace the whole unit when they won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist and it&#x27;s terrific.  You can really feel the difference from other electric toothbrushes.  It both cleans your teeth and massages your gums.  Even my girlfriend who I never thought would want to use an electric toothbrush used mine and then wanted one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of one of these. The last one lasted 4 or 5 years.  We like the timer, it reminds us to brush for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and it is still going strong. My dentist has stated I have less tarter build up and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Top notch electric toothbrush!  Our dentist is amazed at how we never have plaque build up when we go for our 6 month cleaning appts.  Would recommend highly, especially if you dont frequent a dentist as often.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for about a week now and my teeth do feel cleaner. I have sensitive gums, so I was worried the more powerful vibrations of the brush would cause some damage but on the contrary, my gums feel healthier and stronger now. If you are looking for a good tooth brush, you will not be disappointed. I admit I was a bit hesitant to spend $80 on the Oral B S-200 but it was definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The sensations of this toothbrush are weirdly satisfying especially if you have never used a sonic toothbrush before. They key selling point is that our teeth have never felt quite so polished.  The price is great, the brush is simple and pleasant to use. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush I bought a year ago. My sensitive teeth much prefer it to the non-sonic Oral-B electric that I was previously using, and my teeth are very much whiter than before as well. I&#x27;ve had no problems or quality issues with this product either.</li>
            <li> I have previously used two Sonicare models, the Advance and the Elite, and while they worked fine they were both frustratingly hard to keep clean so I ended up buying a Braun Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 kit at Target. I paid around $60 for it. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 years I think and can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product. Its performance is similarly as good  as the Sonicare models but it has them beat by far both in cost and ease of keeping clean. The design is so much better in that the small brushhead  stalk easily removes/pops out from the body for easy rinsing and storage if need be, and the body can be gently rinsed under the tap and wiped down- it seems to be pretty well sealed and I&#x27;ve been rinsing it off every day for almost 3 years. Compare this to the Sonicare. Those models combine the brushhead and a plastic cap that screws into the handle/body and both brushhead and body aren&#x27;t sealed well at all from water and gunk getting into crevices and such. Sure you can replace the heads every 3 months or so but in the meanwhile when (not if)  gunk and moisture finds its way into the many hard to get at places in the unit (it&#x27;s not designed to be taken apart) eventually mildew and rot starts building up inside. Yuck.     When I first bought the Sonic I emailed Braun asking if it was sealed from moisture (it sure appeared to be) because the manual recommended rinsing the brushhead but just wiping clean the handle/body. There appeared to be an o-ring at the top of the body where the small metal rod that the brushhead attaches to comes out of, and Braun support told me the unit was water-sealed. I just lightly rinse the top end of the body/handle and wipe the entire unit dry after each use. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take a chance and ever submerge the brush/body/motor unit under water but like I said I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a few years and it still works great.    The kit I bought at Target included a nice storage tower/charger base for 3 brushheads, andmy model doesn&#x27;t include the massage feature (big deal). Apparently others have said that now the storage tower isn&#x27;t included with  models other than the more expensive S-320. Anyway, the S-200 is a great value and performer and don&#x27;t let a lack of a storage tower be a deal breaker. I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with this product. One reviewer mentioned it was built in Germany in case that would be an issue I guess- which had me scratching my head, who cares. If anything it&#x27;s nice to see a product available from somewhere else besides China.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Oral B battery toothbrush for a year. It is my 40th birthday and I wanted something to treat myself so I bought this tooth brush. It is the same as the Oral B S-320 but without the massage feature, which is not necassary at all and it was only $79.99 which is the best price for a rechargable toothbrush. I have not had my teeth cleaned in two years (oops) and thought of doing so, but it costs $80 so I decided to try this tooth brush as see if it felt like going to get my teeth cleaned. I really believe it feels just as good as getting my teeth cleaned! It is quite strong and you must get used to the strong vibration inside your mouth, but it is very effective. My teeth felt smooth as glass and I really enjoyed using it. I now feel so invested in my teeth and keeping my mouth healthy that I will go get my teeth cleaned. This tooth brush will clean your teeth much better then the battery powered Oral B tooth brushes and so much better then a hand held tooth brush. I love it and and so happy I bought it and I feel I got a good deal on this model for $79.99. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, for me it&#x27;s a bad experience with this item.  In my case, it woks fine only 3 months, after that this have an erratic perfomance. At this mommnet i take a decisition: dont use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush but after being encouraged by the dentist for years, I decided to break down and get one.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and it has helped me to brush longer.  It took a few days to get use to the brush but after that, easy.  The brush is easy to use and the timer is great.  My only complaint is the light on the charger is quite bright so you need to shut the bathroom door, especially when it is in the blinking mode and charging.  Other than that, a great product.  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist thinks at the next visit!  New smile!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be much of a review. I bought this on October 17, 2007 here on Amazon and must&#x27;ve skipped reviewing it. The good news is: It has been used at least twice a day since October 17, 2007. The bad news: It just stopped charging yesterday, June 24, 2015. I&#x27;m back to buy a replacement one and thought I would post this review. I consider myself a fairly simple man and will be trying to find a new model with the features this one has. I&#x27;m already leaning towards the Oral-B Pro-3000. Very impressive lifespan on this one and I&#x27;ll have to just hope my next one lasts as long as this one. I remember when I bought this one. I couldn&#x27;t believe an electric toothbrush would make that much difference, but it has. I&#x27;m planning on overnight shipping the next one just so I don&#x27;t have to wait to have my electric toothbrush. I follow a pretty basic mouth cleaning process of: Full two minutes with the electric toothbrush as soon as I get out of bed. Two to three light brushings in the afternoon to evening. Then I used the electric toothbrush before going to bed, followed by a once over with my wife&#x27;s water irrigation pick. I&#x27;ll probably regret saying this, but I&#x27;m 40 now and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since my mid-20s and while I gave up on the gleaming white smile, I&#x27;m still very happy to have made it this far without any dental problems. I credit this toothbrush for a lot of my oral health.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush about 2 years ago and have happily used it ever since.  It leaves the teeth feeling clean and is not too bulky to hold. I find the timer buzz convenient and easy to ignore if you chose so. Can&#x27;t see why people find it annoying.     Both my husband and myself use the same model - we just change brush heads.  The brush head replacements are inexpensive and come with different colored rings.  The battery holds charge forever, which is great for trips.  We&#x27;ve taken it to 8-10 day trips without the charger, and used it both twice a day, and it still had charge.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush! It replaced one that we purchased at the dentist office. These are no longer available so I was delighted to find it at Amazon. Great service!</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 days, and the battery&#x27;s charge depleted. I examined the base of the brush and the recharging stand, but both were plastic. I didn&#x27;t see how plastic would conduct electricity and allow for any sort of charge to occurr. So I examined the charger, and at the bottom of it, there was an illustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The illustration shows how to remove the base and the inner parts/battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT DO THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly realized that I could not put the parts back into the brush. The manual states, \\&quot;removing the base DESTROYS THE APPLIANCE, and VOIDS THE WARRANTY\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...So why have an illustration of this readily seen on the charger? Furthermore, this procedure is only used years in the future when the battery finally dies, and if you are inclined to dispose of the battery at a recycling center. Is it really necessary then to provide instructions for this on the charger, when it renders the appliance useless? And honestly, who reads manuals, especially for a toothbrush? How is a person supposed to know that following the illustration would destroy their toothbrush? Leave the illustration in the manual, where you have the space to include the appropriate warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just another example of a clever and ambiguous attempt to exploit the ignorance of people, to make more money. Now I have to buy another. I suppose I could try my luck with another brand, but as the saying goes, it&#x27;s better to go with \\&quot;the devil you know\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Initially the sensation made me giggle.  After a couple uses I got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.  My teeth feel cleaner, mouth fresher, and I&#x27;m hopeful that I will no longer get the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; lecture from my dental team. &lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s something to smile about!</li>
            <li> Have daughter with braces...her teeth never looked better.  Much improved from just using a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used the Oral B Sonic Complete model S-200 for nearly three years. I should note that a lot of this review is probably applicable to the S-320 model as well.     When I first started using the toothbrush, it took a while to get used to the sonic vibrations in my mouth. It was a very unusual sensation--almost tickled--and made me laugh, but I soon got used to it after about a week. Interestingly, when my girlfriend first started using it she had the same experience, couldn&#x27;t stop laughing.    I noticed immediately that my teeth felt much cleaner, very smooth. It was effortless to clean my teeth since the toothbrush did all the real work. One thing I noticed that was not advertised was that in addition to the 2-minute timer (three long pauses), the brush also indicates 30-second intervals (one short pause), which I found very helpful for timing even brushing around all my teeth.     I purchased replacement heads at regular intervals, and would recommend the soft heads. After about two years of using the brush, I noticed some small areas at the base of a few teeth that became VERY sensitive to the slightest pressure. My dentist informed me that this was due to gum recession (when the gums are pushed back from the tooth, exposing the more delicate and HIGHLY sensitive roots of the tooth) caused by vigorous brushing. I didn&#x27;t think I was brushing vigorously at all, but I had been using the regular \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting. After hearing that this discomfort was due to brushing I  started using the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting and things returned to normal, and this lower setting still effectively cleaned my teeth.    Unfortunately, in the last few weeks the toothbrush would occasionally not turn on, and eventually started to spontaneously/randomly turn on for brief moments. Apparently this was its death cry. I&#x27;m not sure whether leaving the toothbrush on the charger all the time would over time lead to diminished battery life, but would recommend against storing it on the charger.     Overall, I really liked the sonic complete toothbrush, would buy it again, and highly recommend everyone use a sonic toothbrush.    Pros:  - superior teeth cleaning  - 2-minute and 30-second timers  - does not automatically turn off after two minutes like some other electronic toothbrushes  - long-lasting charge (took it on several two-week vacations and it still had more charge left when I returned home)  - storage for three additional heads in charging station*  - toothbrush head holder in charging station can be pulled out easily for routine cleaning*  - drainage holes in the bottom of each toothbrush head slot (no nasty buildup) and good ventilation allows heads to dry (no mildew/mold)*  - wall-mountable charging station*  - non-slip rubber bottom on charging station  - solid construction, heads stay on    Cons:  - no replacement battery (dead battery &#x3D; bulky manual toothbrush)  - no carrying case (apparently the S-320 model does)  - very long &amp; bulky (it was hard to fit into my toiletries travel case)  - no PDF/digital owner&#x27;s manual (OK, so this might be nit-picking, but keeping the printed manuals for every electronics gadget is a pain!)    *It appears that the S-200 model no longer comes with the larger charging station with head storage, but the S-320 model does.</li>
            <li> Worked well for awhile, then just stopped, even after full charge. Seems the switch broke in the unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush because my other one gave out. I like this tooth brush, it does a good job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and have really liked it so far. I really feel that my mouth feels cleaner after I brush with this toothbrush. It has also helped me brush longer and more thuroughly. It gives you a warning every 30 seconds, telling you when to switch sides of your mouth. While I don&#x27;t always use this, it has helped me to brush for a full two minutes.  Each charge last for a long time as well. I actually can&#x27;t remember the last time I charged my toothbrush. I would say once every couple weeks, and I brush multiple times a day.  The only con I have noticed is that the tooth brush head is alittle small, but the vibration and cleaning power of the toothbrush makes this less noticeable.   I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a better toothbrush that wants a cleaner mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a really great toothbrush. I&#x27;m the son of a dentist, so I was taught at an early age the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; way to brush your teeth. Well, after the VERY first time I used the Oral B S-200, my teeth felt more clean than my regular toothbrush ever got them, and felt more like they do right after coming from the dentist for a cleaning! This is a great product that is priced well, and well worth the purchase.    I think my favorite feature is the built in timer that pulses the toothbrush every 30 seconds so you know to switch to a different part of your mouth. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to brush your tongue with, but my tongue scraper takes care of that just fine.</li>
            <li> This was highly rated by Consumer Reports, Amazon.com had the best price by far, so my pearly whites are happy and so am I!</li>
            <li> The other reviews all cover most of the basics, but one thing that keeps this from being a great toothbrush is the incredibly annoying \\&quot;timer.\\&quot; If you brush your teeth in four quadrants for 30 seconds each and stop at exactly 2 minutes, then you&#x27;ll love this brush (when did it drop to 2 minutes anyway? Dentists recommended 3 minutes when I was in school). If you would rather brush your teeth on your own time, then it&#x27;s incredibly annoying that the motor skips every 30 seconds and then stutters for a few seconds every 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Web site often suggest what other people bought at same time.  The replacement brush heads suggested do not fit the Oral B S-200.  Be sure you order right brushes.</li>
            <li> The seller didn&#x27;t include an invoice with my purchase but was extremely responsive and sent me a copy of the invoice quickly. It&#x27;s nice that the seller pays such close attention to consumer feedback.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, my dentist noticed there was less tartar build-up. I told him I was using the Sonic Complete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- 2 minute timer - 30 seconds for each part of the quadrant (upper right, upper left, bottom right, bottom left of the mouth). &lt;br /&gt;- you can set it to two different modes (normal, soft brushing) &lt;br /&gt;- the 3rd feature, a massage (for the gums) &lt;br /&gt;- lasts about a week and half without charging (like any rechargeable battery, the battery will eventually die). &lt;br /&gt;- comes with a travel case (holds toothbrush and 2 extra brush heads) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A fancy version of a toothbrush but worth the money. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because it was a gold box savings and needed to replace my other Oral B. I am so happy with it. My teeth feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after using it and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; my gums like Sonicare did.  It has a great battery life and two different speeds.  After a few weeks, my teeth look whiter and I had a lot less plaque at my last dental appointment.  My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased.  In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare in the past and was in the market for a new toothbrush. This one is very good. I like the 30 second stutter that happens as you brush. It makes brushing mindless and helped my boys know how long to brush each area. There is a high and low setting that was useful for the kids. One problem I had happend 2 weeks after the purchase. My oldest boy dropped the tooth brush in the sink and a corner broke off the bottom. Not to worry it still worked and charged. Then 3 months later I started having trouble with the vibration of the head. I think my boys were pressing too hard on their teeth. Now it does not vibrate at all and its useless. I can&#x27;t really fault the tooth brush but...thought I should mention it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than the Oral-B Crossaction Power that I used earlier. The head is nice and small and gets into hard to reach areas, the brush stand has no exposed metal (it&#x27;s really cool from an engineering standpoint, they seem to be using a magnetic field to charge the battery), so it&#x27;s pretty safe to leave by the sink.    After using the brush, my teeth feel smooth &amp; clean, like after going to a dentist. It takes a little getting used to but the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t hurt your gums.    I&#x27;ve been using the product only for a month, some other reviewers were disappointed with the battery life, I can&#x27;t comment on that yet. However, I think Ni-Cd batteries are happier if you put them through full charge/discharge cycles, a full charge lasts a week. At least 250 full charge/discharge cycles is what I expect out of Ni-Cd&#x27;s, charging once every week gives me about 250 weeks (little more than 4.5 years). I don&#x27;t actually think I&#x27;ll have the toothbrush that long, but the point is that I think the battery should be fine if you don&#x27;t charge it everyday.    Also, this really shouldn&#x27;t matter but this toothbrush is made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Placing the order and receiving it were as simple as it should be.  No delays or hidden charges. The product is great - I&#x27;ve owned one before so was expecting just what I got.  I&#x27;d recommend both the product and using Amazon to purchase.</li>
            <li> After years of my dental hygienist asking me why I haven&#x27;t bought one of these sonic toothbrushes, I finally broke down and bought one.  Wow, what a difference!  I am a brusher and flosser, but the results are very real.  My teeth are whiter and no build up of plaque behind the front teeth. Amazing!  If you are someone with the same problems, a regular brusher who can&#x27;t seem to ever keep the build-up of plaque behind the front teeth, you will love this product.  If you are not a regular tooth brusher (ew!) than you need this product.  The timing mechanism is extra good, because it makes you really take the two minutes twice a day that you need to keep those pearly whites, well, pearly white!</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ve read the reviews about how this is a great toothbrush that does the job and your teeth will be clean.  This review chooses to focus on the color scheme of this Oral-B unit.  I chose to rate this product with five stars.  If I had the option, I would specifically rate this a 4.9, less than a perfect score, solely because of the questionable color plastics chosen for this toothbrush.  To start it off, the front of the handle was made aquamarine.  This hideous color should not match any sane person&#x27;s bathroom decor.  But if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, the back of the handle is a repugnant seafoam green color.  Between these varying shades of hideousness, a strip of cerulean blue flake plastic accents the toothbrush.  The brush head itself has a ring of royal blue around the neck, and the back of the brush head is cornflower blue.   Of course, the bristles themselves are yet another random shade of blue.  In conclusion, this is a very solid product that is held back by the fact that it looks like a hodgepodge of different color plastics, none of which come anywhere near matching or aethsetically pleasing.  Why can&#x27;t they just make this toothbrush a simple black, white, or any solid color?  I recommend this product to anyone who wants clean teeth and can&#x27;t decide between the color green or blue.</li>
            <li> The Dentist recommended this for my wife, I was worried she wouldn&#x27;t like using it but with it&#x27;s two speeds it&#x27;s working great. Highly recomended and it also got the highest consumer reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I previously had a Sonic Complete Pro and it lasted 4 years. It was a great toothbrush; however, the battery died and since you can&#x27;t replace the batteries I had to buy another. Amazon offered a great deal on this toothbrush. Now it&#x27;s not the Pro but I really don&#x27;t need the extra toothbrush compartment which is pretty much the difference between the two models. I love this toothbrush! When I go for my annual cleaning to the dentist they always comment on how clean and tarter free my teeth are.</li>
            <li> 2.5 years later and this thing is still working great.  The battery still lasts 2-3 weeks.  Its awesome.  Lasts much longer than the old mechanical electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I expect more than a hundred uses from an item made by a respectable manufacturer. Now, as I am writing this in 2013 and the unit is no longer sold... you are probably thinking &amp;#34;he must have used it a lot more than he thinks he did?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not so. It sat unused in the bathroom draw because the heads had given up. So, when I bought some new heads it was time to bring the unit back to use. It died after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless... traditional toothbrushs for me from now on..</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It certainly helps me to brush longer.  My husband is not keen on the sound however.</li>
            <li> Great !! I&#x27;d give it 6 out of 5 !! &amp;lt;g&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, comfortable to handle, gentle but VERY effective cleaning. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like having your dentist clean your teeth every day. &lt;br /&gt;Can;t recomment it highly enough,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife when her Sonicare died. She loves it. Great price. She didn&#x27;t want the better one and is very happy with it. Her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use it every day. I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch from a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have 4 of s-200, one s-320 for my father now. My wife, son and me use one at home, I have one at work. I bought them on Ebay for less than half the retail price, so I can buy more to save the trouble to switch heads. This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way. It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush head regularly like sonicare does. The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new. Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.   I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong. The German really did a wonderful engineering job. My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does a good job in keeping your teeth clean. Try it and you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> My Mom got me my first oral B electric and I fell in love.  Really!  They make your teeth feel so clean. When the one my Mom bought me would no longer hold a charge I bought this one.  I went with the same one.  I would recommend leaving it off the charger like it says to do in the manual.  I didn&#x27;t with my first one and I think that is why the battery life was shorter than one would expect.  I did have braces and brushed at least 3 if not more times a day so maybe I just used it up.  I have already gotten more battery life out of this one, than my first one and I do leave it off the charger.</li>
