            <li>I am glad I was able to catch it on Amazon and enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>Versense has  a romantic and clean scent and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>ITS HUGE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Light &amp; elegant smell</li>
            <li>She smells too good really .LOL</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fresh and elegant.  </li>
            <li>Been buying this scent for a couple of years now, wear it every day, very fresh, LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>They refuse to return perfume even though it says they will &amp;#34;return an unopened item in original condition for a full refund&amp;#34;, but when I tried to return this item, it said &amp;#34;CAN&#x27;T RETURN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I Really love the gently fresh spring like scent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing and ageless scent that you can and should use year round that is not over powering,  but a perfect balance.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, light citrus smell, unique smell.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it an any of the fine stores anymore.</li>
            <li>And at the half the price its a great bargain!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was the best I have found and arrived in the mail in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine, and came in a sealed wrapper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big purchaser of fragrances and Versense and Versace Bright Crystals is another great new one from this house...</li>
            <li>It has a light citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t available in the dept. stores</li>
            <li>Fantastic service.</li>
            <li>The scent is airy and light.</li>
            <li>The perfume is fantastic-</li>
            <li>Anyways, worth the price, because it costs much more anywhere else</li>
            <li>Genuine product.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to get the big bottle.</li>
            <li>it is one of my favorites and it was such a great price so worth it!</li>
            <li>I looked past the the company and apreciated the wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and feel so pretty using it.  </li>
            <li>at first wife of this perfume it seemed too citrusy but as it had time to settle on my skin I love it</li>
            <li>This one is crisp, clean, and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>The smell is earthy, yet clean.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>This perfume has a strong bergamot and woody head note (this is the smell right after you spray it).</li>
            <li>SPECIAL SPECIAL SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>All they have is Versace Bright Crystal or Yellow Diamond, and those 2 do not even compare!</li>
            <li>It is earthy and bright at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful blend with citrus overtones, light enough for spring and summer, but musky enough for evening wear and ANY time of year!</li>
            <li>I like this one bcz its light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about fragrances, because many give me a headache.</li>
            <li>It is my mother&#x27;s absolute favorite</li>
            <li>clean and fresh smell-not</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly, well Packed.</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong, but it is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great for summer or all year round.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh scent of spring.</li>
            <li>So fresh and fruit perfume.</li>
            <li>Mature and elegant.</li>
            <li>Company shipping was OK not great but the fact that Gianni Versace for Women is so great</li>
            <li>bought two bottles in fear they would discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li>Fresh with citrus tones.</li>
            <li>about 30 min after you spray it) is fresh and citrus.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone that is looking for a fresh start.</li>
            <li>( I am sensitive to overwhelming scented perfumes)</li>
            <li>Love it, clean, fresh, little sexy with a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as stated, and came quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean, not harsh for people around you to be breathing.</li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming like many others I am thrilled you can still purchase it on Amazon since retail stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>The smell of this perfume is really fresh and nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really stay long on me.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I am delighted and it is the real thing...no imitation.</li>
            <li>My Husband first bought this for me in Europe.  </li>
            <li>crisp and spring-</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I imagine.</li>
            <li>a favorite daily scent for me</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought me the first bottle of this fragrance from London.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it has an intense smell that may not be optimal for someone looking for a fresh and lighter fruity/citrus smell.</li>
            <li>We all have different tastes in perfume, but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn only this for exactly one year now and people still feel the need to tell me how good I smell on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The sharp but very pleasant citrus scent is not replaceable with any other.</li>
            <li>Great size bottle that will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t need to put on much of this scent.</li>
            <li>Soft and clean sent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice fragrance, light and very feminine, however, it does not last long.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is very clean and light, you can wear it year round.  </li>
            <li>This was not a good purchase for me, but it is still a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is my imagination, but this bottle of Versace Versense does not smell as good as the ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>I dont know if its an everyday perfume though , more special events - going out etc .</li>
            <li>hesitated first to order it on line - for obvious reason, it might not be the original stuff ...</li>
            <li>what I expected!It is a very pleasant perfume for  a active women, for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available through Versace, so I believe this will be my last opportunity to find it again.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I felt like the company took alot of care when packaging my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price here is so much cheaper than department store.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>but after this, I will not shop as much on here.  </li>
            <li>and I got this for her for Christmas for much cheaper than what you would pay in a department store.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend !</li>
            <li>My husband really loves it when I wear Versace Versense.  </li>
            <li>One of my favourites by far!!!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t last longer than 3~4 hours, but the scent is worth it!</li>
            <li>It is my new signature scent, it just won that position from Dolce&#x27;s Light Blue!</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, my favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li>There is an intense citrus smell when first sprayed but it becomes a more complex fragrance as it wears.  </li>
            <li>Hands down,  this is my new favorite, replacing my #1 Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto perfume to #2.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>Fresh, unique, long lasting.</li>
            <li>This perfume has an elegant smell and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>This scent is fresh, clean, fruity and a little floral all rolled into one!  </li>
            <li>It was what I ordered and it was brand new still sealed in the wrapping.</li>
            <li>I had a small bottle, and now I bought the biggest one because it&#x27;s my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s a more watered down version from what I originally had-</li>
            <li>Hard to find this and love it.</li>
            <li>Every one that gets near me ask me which fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classy and will leave an impression.</li>
            <li>The price is not overly expensive and it lasts a good while if you just use a spray or 2 a day.</li>
            <li>I was running out of Versace and was very happy to get my Versace from amazon, because it was a lot less expensive than what I was paying for and the bottle was bigger, imagine that.  </li>
            <li>Buyer sold this item several dollars less than competitors and shipped it lightening quick!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume, and plan to re-purchase now that mine has finally run out.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a major attention getter and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Light and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s grassy, woody, and a little spicy--everything you need if you naturally smell sweet (and therefore make any traditional perfume smell overpowering).</li>
            <li>This is becoming more and more difficult to find, sadly!  </li>
            <li>I thinking of buying a perfume for men some time in the near future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my new scent for as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li>Not only did I pay less than 50% less than I usually do at the stores I feel very satisfied with the product that was delivered to me.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, but something seemed a little different lately-</li>

            <li> I am glad I was able to catch it on Amazon and enjoy it while it lasts.</li>

            <li> ITS HUGE LOVE IT</li>

            <li> Been buying this scent for a couple of years now, wear it every day, very fresh, LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> They refuse to return perfume even though it says they will &amp;#34;return an unopened item in original condition for a full refund&amp;#34;, but when I tried to return this item, it said &amp;#34;CAN&#x27;T RETURN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I Really love the gently fresh spring like scent!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing and ageless scent that you can and should use year round that is not over powering,  but a perfect balance.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, light citrus smell, unique smell.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it an any of the fine stores anymore.</li>
            <li> And at the half the price its a great bargain!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price was the best I have found and arrived in the mail in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine, and came in a sealed wrapper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big purchaser of fragrances and Versense and Versace Bright Crystals is another great new one from this house...</li>
            <li> It has a light citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t available in the dept. stores</li>
            <li> Fantastic service.</li>
            <li> The scent is airy and light.</li>
            <li> The perfume is fantastic-</li>
            <li> Anyways, worth the price, because it costs much more anywhere else</li>
            <li> Genuine product.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to get the big bottle.</li>
            <li> it is one of my favorites and it was such a great price so worth it!</li>
            <li> I looked past the the company and apreciated the wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel so pretty using it.  </li>
            <li> at first wife of this perfume it seemed too citrusy but as it had time to settle on my skin I love it</li>
            <li> This one is crisp, clean, and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> The smell is earthy, yet clean.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a strong bergamot and woody head note (this is the smell right after you spray it).</li>
            <li> SPECIAL SPECIAL SPECIAL.</li>
            <li> All they have is Versace Bright Crystal or Yellow Diamond, and those 2 do not even compare!</li>
            <li> It is earthy and bright at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It is a wonderful blend with citrus overtones, light enough for spring and summer, but musky enough for evening wear and ANY time of year!</li>
            <li> I like this one bcz its light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about fragrances, because many give me a headache.</li>
            <li> It is my mother&#x27;s absolute favorite</li>
            <li> clean and fresh smell-not</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, well Packed.</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong, but it is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great for summer or all year round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh scent of spring.</li>
            <li> So fresh and fruit perfume.</li>
            <li> Mature and elegant.</li>
            <li> Company shipping was OK not great but the fact that Gianni Versace for Women is so great</li>
            <li> bought two bottles in fear they would discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li> Fresh with citrus tones.</li>
            <li> about 30 min after you spray it) is fresh and citrus.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone that is looking for a fresh start.</li>
            <li> ( I am sensitive to overwhelming scented perfumes)</li>
            <li> Love it, clean, fresh, little sexy with a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as stated, and came quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean, not harsh for people around you to be breathing.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming like many others I am thrilled you can still purchase it on Amazon since retail stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is really fresh and nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really stay long on me.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I am delighted and it is the real thing...no imitation.</li>
            <li> My Husband first bought this for me in Europe.  </li>
            <li> crisp and spring-</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I imagine.</li>
            <li> a favorite daily scent for me</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought me the first bottle of this fragrance from London.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it has an intense smell that may not be optimal for someone looking for a fresh and lighter fruity/citrus smell.</li>
            <li> We all have different tastes in perfume, but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn only this for exactly one year now and people still feel the need to tell me how good I smell on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The sharp but very pleasant citrus scent is not replaceable with any other.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle that will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t need to put on much of this scent.</li>
            <li> Soft and clean sent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance, light and very feminine, however, it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is very clean and light, you can wear it year round.  </li>
            <li> This was not a good purchase for me, but it is still a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my imagination, but this bottle of Versace Versense does not smell as good as the ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if its an everyday perfume though , more special events - going out etc .</li>
            <li> hesitated first to order it on line - for obvious reason, it might not be the original stuff ...</li>
            <li> what I expected!It is a very pleasant perfume for  a active women, for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is no longer available through Versace, so I believe this will be my last opportunity to find it again.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I felt like the company took alot of care when packaging my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The price here is so much cheaper than department store.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> but after this, I will not shop as much on here.  </li>
            <li> and I got this for her for Christmas for much cheaper than what you would pay in a department store.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend !</li>
            <li> My husband really loves it when I wear Versace Versense.  </li>
            <li> One of my favourites by far!!!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last longer than 3~4 hours, but the scent is worth it!</li>
            <li> It is my new signature scent, it just won that position from Dolce&#x27;s Light Blue!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, my favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li> There is an intense citrus smell when first sprayed but it becomes a more complex fragrance as it wears.  </li>
            <li> Hands down,  this is my new favorite, replacing my #1 Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto perfume to #2.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> Fresh, unique, long lasting.</li>
            <li> This perfume has an elegant smell and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> This scent is fresh, clean, fruity and a little floral all rolled into one!  </li>
            <li> It was what I ordered and it was brand new still sealed in the wrapping.</li>
            <li> I had a small bottle, and now I bought the biggest one because it&#x27;s my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s a more watered down version from what I originally had-</li>
            <li> Hard to find this and love it.</li>
            <li> Every one that gets near me ask me which fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classy and will leave an impression.</li>
            <li> The price is not overly expensive and it lasts a good while if you just use a spray or 2 a day.</li>
            <li> I was running out of Versace and was very happy to get my Versace from amazon, because it was a lot less expensive than what I was paying for and the bottle was bigger, imagine that.  </li>
            <li> Buyer sold this item several dollars less than competitors and shipped it lightening quick!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume, and plan to re-purchase now that mine has finally run out.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a major attention getter and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Light and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but not strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grassy, woody, and a little spicy--everything you need if you naturally smell sweet (and therefore make any traditional perfume smell overpowering).</li>
            <li> This is becoming more and more difficult to find, sadly!  </li>
            <li> I thinking of buying a perfume for men some time in the near future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my new scent for as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Not only did I pay less than 50% less than I usually do at the stores I feel very satisfied with the product that was delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but something seemed a little different lately-</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, left on the skin even after a shower.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell</li>
            <li> It seems as if it is far weaker, almost watered down.</li>
            <li> The smell stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself as a birthday present but also got it from 2 other people.  </li>
            <li> Like other review said its not long lasting... maybe for about half a day.</li>
            <li> Possibly it is because the scent is not made by Versace anymore, and not available in stores.</li>
            <li> Once you try it, you wouldn&#x27;t waste anytime purchasing a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to try other ones.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing when your favorite scent is discontinued and less aromatic than you expected.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon.com is less than in a department store.</li>
            <li> but despite it saying on the receipt &amp;#34;RETURNS ARE EASY!&amp;#34;, THAT IS NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using it all year round.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about ordering a perfume online, I&#x27;ve been using this perfum for about 3 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flirty smell; everyday wear.</li>
            <li> + I thought for the price it would be the small one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend carrying it around in a small spritzer.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for myself, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gonna keep buying until supplies run out, since they don&#x27;t make it anymore :(</li>
            <li> The base notes (</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is insane over this stuff.</li>
            <li> While the others haven&#x27;t been horrible, I missed this scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My Husband first bought this for me in Europe.  It has become my favorite fragrance. It was much more expensive than what I paid.  I am delighted and it is the real thing...no imitation. My Husband is happy he can purchase them for me at a much better price. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> ooooh VERSACE how I love this fragrance it&#x27;s so light crisp and spring-like!...got a sample with an order I placed with Sephora but they charged way too much...saw it on here and decided to give it a shot...I picked the free shipping that takes 5-9 days and got the perfume in 3 days! I&#x27;m a big purchaser of fragrances and Versense and Versace Bright Crystals is another great new one from this house...good job Versace keep up the good work!(PS if you want to get any man in your life a good Cologne get Versace Man eau Fraiche that smell is AMAZING my husband hates cologne but this he loves!)</li>
            <li> My sister received Versace Versense as a gift. When I went to visit her, I asked if I could use some. I stayed with her a week but could not stay away from this fragrance! It is a wonderful blend with citrus overtones, light enough for spring and summer, but musky enough for evening wear and ANY time of year! I&#x27;ve been a lover of &#x27;Happy&#x27; cologne, until I found Versense, which makes me even happier!</li>
            <li> person who need it, is very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very nice product and I will keep on buying it. and I will definitely recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and what I expected!It is a very pleasant perfume for  a active women, for everyday use. I love it and I&#x27;m using it all year round.</li>
            <li> I like this one bcz its light and fresh. It wasn&#x27;t available in the dept. stores so I purchased here. Its original Versace Versense edt spray for a good value. Like other review said its not long lasting... maybe for about half a day. Other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> very good smell, fast delivery, good presentation</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is insane over this stuff. She smells too good really .LOL</li>
            <li> Smell good!!!! I love it I bought for my daughter but im going to buy for myself ð</li>
            <li> VERSACE VERSENSE is my summer fragrance for years by now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated first to order it on line - for obvious reason, it might not be the original stuff ... I was wrong!  It&#x27;s excellent, true to its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, here I come!  Many orders to follow, thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LD</li>
            <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could. I used to wear this perfume awhile back &amp; the stores stopped carring it so I&#x27;ve had to try other ones. While the others haven&#x27;t been horrible, I missed this scent. I am so glad to know I can purchase it here. Love! Love! Love!</li>
            <li> Delivery was in time and no damage.</li>
            <li> refreshing and smoooth</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present last year, I&#x27;m a big fan of perfumes and this one has lasted me just over a year. The smell is very clean, not harsh for people around you to be breathing. I&#x27;ve worn only this for exactly one year now and people still feel the need to tell me how good I smell on a daily basis. I would highly recommend this perfume, and plan to re-purchase now that mine has finally run out.</li>
            <li> Versace versace versace the smell is very refreshing, its one of the best in my wife&#x27;s wardrobe, and looking forward to buy another the same because she loved it</li>
            <li> how could this wonderful scent now be discontinued???? makes no sense to me</li>
            <li> Very very good. The smell stays for a long time.Recomended from my wife.</li>
            <li> The Versace Versense smells good to me.  The price is not overly expensive and it lasts a good while if you just use a spray or 2 a day.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is a perfect blend of fresh, clean and some citrus/sweetness. It is no longer available through Versace, so I believe this will be my last opportunity to find it again. I can wear this both for daytime and (dress up ) evening, and I always get complements on it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my imagination, but this bottle of Versace Versense does not smell as good as the ones I have purchased in the past.  It seems as if it is far weaker, almost watered down. Possibly it is because the scent is not made by Versace anymore, and not available in stores. Very disappointing when your favorite scent is discontinued and less aromatic than you expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and  arrived before scheduled!  I would purchase from this distributor again</li>
            <li> I wear this almost daily &amp; get compliments all the time!!</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance. It is not overwhelming like many others I am thrilled you can still purchase it on Amazon since retail stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot Versace for this beautiful scent. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love it. Light &amp; elegant smell</li>
            <li> Hard to find this and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! It&#x27;s a fresh scent of spring. Lasts all day and everybody complement on it. The price on Amazon.com is less than in a department store. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It is not overpowering and I get many compliments.  Great for summer or all year round.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this fragrance I always get compliments.  My manicurist was wearing this one day and I fell in love with it!!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, well Packed. The scent lasts a long time, left on the skin even after a shower. I had a small bottle, and now I bought the biggest one because it&#x27;s my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic service. Fast and I already knew the scent so it is gorgeous and perfect for my tropical home.</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely great.</li>
            <li> It lasting a beautiful fragrance IÂ´ll keep wearing this great aroma. And the delivering time its perfect. Just love it.</li>
            <li> So fresh and fruit perfume. I love it and all my friends as well. Moderate lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about ordering a perfume online, I&#x27;ve been using this perfum for about 3 years and when I received it I was very pleased, the scent stay all day. The fragrance is very fresh and elegant.  Every one that gets near me ask me which fragrance I am wearing. Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WONDERFUL,  WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. SPECIAL SPECIAL SPECIAL. TOTALY WOMEN, WOMEN,  WOMEN NOT GIRLY GIRLY. Mature and elegant. When I leave the room it stays!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Company shipping was OK not great but the fact that Gianni Versace for Women is so great I looked past the the company and apreciated the wonderful fragrance. So Alluring and sultry.</li>
            <li> Love this it is my signature scent ...shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> Love it smells great...thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles in fear they would discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh and citrusy. Great for spring and summer daytime.</li>
            <li> This is my fragrance and I can only get it on line. Can&#x27;t get it an any of the fine stores anymore. This is my fav and I only wear this fragrance. Soft and clean sent. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I imagine. .. lasting. . I&#x27;m loving it. .</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it , bit of a tropical smell with hints of spices (maybe nutmeg ?) . I dont know if its an everyday perfume though , more special events - going out etc .</li>
            <li> Hands down,  this is my new favorite, replacing my #1 Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto perfume to #2. The smell is earthy, yet clean.  I see some reviews classify this as a summer perfume.  I can&#x27;t pin it to a season.  It&#x27;s a signature smell that you attach to an identity of a person,  not a season. It&#x27;s a refreshing and ageless scent that you can and should use year round that is not over powering,  but a perfect balance.  Once someone smells this on you,  they will never forget it or you. It&#x27;s classy and will leave an impression.</li>
            <li> a favorite daily scent for me</li>
            <li> The scent is airy and light. The shipping was fast and I felt like the company took alot of care when packaging my purchase. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfume. You just don&#x27;t get tired of it. It has light and pleasant summer aroma. It can be worn to work and going out. I advertised it to all my friends, and all the ladies are now hooked. This is my 2nd bottle in two years. Amazon prices are the lowest on line as well.</li>
            <li> i will buy again, thank you</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.  It took longer than the two days but I was informed before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; a great product</li>
            <li> Once you try it, you wouldn&#x27;t waste anytime purchasing a larger bottle. It&#x27;s sweet but not strong. It&#x27;s a flirty smell; everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a decade. I don&#x27;t see it in a store anymore and wonder if it is discontinued. If so, I would buy several of them and stock up. The sharp but very pleasant citrus scent is not replaceable with any other.</li>
            <li> Love it, clean, fresh, little sexy with a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and so glad they sell it on Amazon since I cannot find it in stores around here anymore. Nice light and refreshing smell!</li>
            <li> Light and fresh. Great for summer</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance, light and very feminine, however, it does not last long.  During the holidays a sample was included in a magazine. I purchased it for myself, but was disappointed. After spraying it on, it disappears shortly afterwards. I thought it was just me, however, no one else can smell it on me either.  This was not a good purchase for me, but it is still a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite ones I love the smell</li>
            <li> Light and not overwhelming.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> One of my favourites by far!!! Fresh, unique, long lasting. If you like verbena then this is your perfume!!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT QUALITY RECOMMENDED SELLER. AS THIS PRODUCT INDICATES THE SITE. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Been buying this scent for a couple of years now, wear it every day, very fresh, LOVE IT.  Amazon price is great as well.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me the first bottle of this fragrance from London.  I Really love the gently fresh spring like scent!  I was shopping around for my second bottle and found it at Amazon.  The price here is so much cheaper than department store.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as stated, and came quickly. The perfume is fantastic- I&#x27;ve found my new scent for as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I am very picky about fragrances, because many give me a headache. This one is crisp, clean, and sophisticated. I had to order this one from Amazon, because stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. All they have is Versace Bright Crystal or Yellow Diamond, and those 2 do not even compare!</li>
            <li> Love it...it was a lovely gift to my mom</li>
            <li> Great mother&#x27;s day gift!</li>
            <li> One of all my favorite perfumes! Love the scent - you will too! And at the half the price its a great bargain!</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and they love it! bought one for myself &amp; I like it as well. Wonderful clean scent</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, light citrus smell, unique smell.  Gonna keep buying until supplies run out, since they don&#x27;t make it anymore :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 5 years ago, decided to order it again. I&#x27;m in love. Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Now it is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> LA ESCENCIA O EL AROMA NO DURA NI UN MINUTO EN NINGUNA PARTE DEL CUERPO O DE LA ROPA QUE USO, PARECE AGUA!  REALLY IT  IS AS A BOTLE OF WATER, IT DOESNT  SMELL  ANYTHING</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is really fresh and nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really stay long on me. Anyways, worth the price, because it costs much more anywhere else I checked.</li>
            <li> Le gusto a mi esposa, tiene muy buen aroma. llego a tiempo y sin ningÃºn problema el empaque sin ningÃºn problema</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it is one of my favorites and it was such a great price so worth it!</li>
            <li> My girfriend loved this item... I love the smell on her</li>
            <li> I bought it for Mother&#x27;s Day she loves it  I thinking of buying a perfume for men some time in the near future</li>
            <li> I was very impressed. I cannot find this scent in the stores anymore. This is my favorite scent. Not only did I pay less than 50% less than I usually do at the stores I feel very satisfied with the product that was delivered to me. It was what I ordered and it was brand new still sealed in the wrapping.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but something seemed a little different lately- not sure if it&#x27;s a more watered down version from what I originally had- but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself as a birthday present but also got it from 2 other people.  I wanted to return it but despite it saying on the receipt &amp;#34;RETURNS ARE EASY!&amp;#34;, THAT IS NOT TRUE.  I am a big amazon.com shopper but after this, I will not shop as much on here.  They refuse to return perfume even though it says they will &amp;#34;return an unopened item in original condition for a full refund&amp;#34;, but when I tried to return this item, it said &amp;#34;CAN&#x27;T RETURN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34;  I will definitely never buy perfume on amazon.com again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued. I am glad I was able to catch it on Amazon and enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Genuine product. Good longevity. Very satisfied with this purchase. You can check this perfume&#x27;s pyramid at fragrantica.com.</li>
            <li> you saved me a lot of money.  I was running out of Versace and was very happy to get my Versace from amazon, because it was a lot less expensive than what I was paying for and the bottle was bigger, imagine that.  &amp;#34;thank you, thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for two months after I literally followed a woman around in the grocery store to ask her what she was wearing!  I love this.  There is an intense citrus smell when first sprayed but it becomes a more complex fragrance as it wears.  It is earthy and bright at the same time.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Always get compliments when i wear this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean and fresh smell-not overwheling.&lt;br /&gt;Price was the best I have found and arrived in the mail in less than a week.</li>
            <li> As expected.  No problems</li>
            <li> This scent is fresh, clean, fruity and a little floral all rolled into one!  I get many compliments when I wear this fragrance.  It is my new signature scent, it just won that position from Dolce&#x27;s Light Blue!</li>
            <li> This perfume is incredible.  It is my mother&#x27;s absolute favorite and I got this for her for Christmas for much cheaper than what you would pay in a department store.  Great size bottle that will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t need to put on much of this scent.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume. The smell is very strong and lasts long. For now, it became my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent  ! You will get many compliments when you wear this Versache spray !  highly recommend !</li>
            <li> My husband really loves it when I wear Versace Versense.  This fragrance is a major attention getter and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this in the stores and couldn&#x27;t find it. Even at Macy&#x27;s where I bought it last. One of my all time favorite and I was happy to get the big bottle. A must have.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel so pretty using it.  Versense has  a romantic and clean scent and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Fresh with citrus tones. Always get great compliments when I wear it. I definitely recommend it. Great for day or evening.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! The smell is not too strong, but it is certainly noticeable. I use only two sprays and the smell lasts all day! I always get compliments from men, women and my students (I&#x27;m a teacher and this smell has not been offensive to anyone that I know of since I started wearing it in 2010!) every time I wear it! I certainly don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing +++ I thought for the price it would be the small one OH NO!!!!!!!!!! ITS HUGE LOVE IT THANKSAAAA+++</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the swift delivery and packaging was great. at first wife of this perfume it seemed too citrusy but as it had time to settle on my skin I love it</li>
            <li> Good perfume, easy to obtain through Amazon. This is better than shopping at overpriced malls. I can always find the product online.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a strong bergamot and woody head note (this is the smell right after you spray it). The base notes (about 30 min after you spray it) is fresh and citrus. Keep in mind that it has an intense smell that may not be optimal for someone looking for a fresh and lighter fruity/citrus smell. This perfume has an elegant smell and it is long lasting. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> | love the scent! So far, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume! The price is the best than any stores have! Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Versace is currently me top rated scent, love it!  I would recommend it for anyone that is looking for a fresh start.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very clean and light, you can wear it year round.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that they have discontinued the fragrance, it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> Summery scent with floral and citrus notes. Clean and fresh, perfect for the warmest weather.</li>
            <li> My wife Loves it. For the price it was great.</li>
            <li> My favorite summer scent--fresh and citrousy. This is also the perfume I got the most compliments on (and bf absolutely loved it). It won&#x27;t last longer than 3~4 hours, but the scent is worth it! I&#x27;d recommend carrying it around in a small spritzer.</li>
            <li> This is becoming more and more difficult to find, sadly!  I absolutely love this scent and tend to hoard it, as to never run out (women, I know you understand that!).  Buyer sold this item several dollars less than competitors and shipped it lightening quick!</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments on this perfume. Smell great and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache ( I am sensitive to overwhelming scented perfumes)</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell (:</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Friend at work has this, and I had to have it!  Love the smell, and have had compliments on the fragrance.  Packaging was fine, and came in a sealed wrapper.</li>
            <li> perfect scent for the warmer months</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever. Love this scent, goes well for any occasion. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> We all have different tastes in perfume, but this is by far my favorite! Go to the department store and try it out. Then buy it on Amazon to save ooodles of money!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom.  She loved it! It smells fresh and clean.  Great gift idea. I highly suggest it.</li>
