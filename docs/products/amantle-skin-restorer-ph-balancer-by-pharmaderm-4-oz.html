            <li>Acid Mantle is the only thing that got rid of poison ivy on my new tattoo!</li>
            <li>Obviously supply and demand on this product is high.</li>
            <li>A-Mantle can be pretty expensive at the pharmacy, but I&#x27;ve found it to be reasonably priced at Amazon, and I&#x27;m sure other websites.  </li>

            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> wish I could get more.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my hands which often can become cracked and dry in winter. I would not be without it. Works so much better than hand lotions I have used. Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> We ended up not using this product after all.  We got it for excema but it burned when applied so it wasn&#x27;t used again.  It&#x27;ll probably make a good regular moisturer for something else.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it after a pedicure.</li>
            <li> This cream works great for my dry skin.  I am prone to breaking out in rashes on my hands when my skin gets too dry.  This cream makes my itchy rashes go away and keeps my skin moist.  It also helps keeps my eczema under control.  A wonderful product - wish they sold it in more places.</li>
            <li> This works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I put it on my cuticles every chance I get. My husband uses it on his hands too.</li>
            <li> I used to get horrible rashes up both my arms from profesional dishwashing. After trying all manner of creams and lotions and going to 2 dermatologists, a pharmacist mentioned acid mantle cream. I used it, my rashes cleared up, and I was very happy. Now my son has started his restaurant \\&quot;career\\&quot; as a dishwasher and his arms are starting to break out, so I&#x27;m getting a large jar for him. This stuff is a miracle if you have dermatitis as a result from continual contact with cleaning products.</li>
            <li> On the description of the product, it says that it is made by AcidMantle. When i recieved the product, it says that it is made buy Doak Dermatologist. Nowhere on the product does it say that it is made by AcidMantle.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands - that&#x27;s how it started out.  Being a mother of 2 and my hands always in water, the condition has gotten worse.  When I went to the dermatologist, she said the skin on my hands has been compromised so much that it will never be the same and I will always have to deal with sensitive skin there.  My hands get so irritated and inflamed that they really pain me.  I can use steroids at times to get in under control, but she put me on to Acid Mantle as well.  Love it.  Really works and helps my skin heal and stay moisturized.  When my hands are paining me, I put some on and the pain starts to go away.  A-Mantle can be pretty expensive at the pharmacy, but I&#x27;ve found it to be reasonably priced at Amazon, and I&#x27;m sure other websites.  Highly recommend for any dry skin or even Eczema.</li>
            <li> A pediatrician recommended this lotion when my young daughter had extreme eczema on her ankles and knees. I tried several lotions, even mail order, and nothing worked like this. My daughter is now older and I still use it when she has flare ups of stubborn dry skin.</li>
            <li> A great product that works for my sons eczema, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Obviously supply and demand on this product is high.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but it is WAY too expensive.  Just a few years ago it was about 1/3 the cost.  I know it has long since lost the patent, so have no idea why it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, rashes etc. Love the product a little goes a long way. Kind of expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne as a teenager and the doctor told me to wash my face with Lava soap and use Amantle aka acid mantle as a moisturizer.  I have been using only these two products on my face since I was 16 and I am now almost 53.  I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles and people comment on how nice my skin is.  Takes me about a yr to use up a jar of this.</li>
            <li> Sorry for me. This product did not work. It actually made my condition worse. I was encouraged by the reviews so felt secure in purchasing this product. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised and quickly.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Skin is smoother and healthier.  I have my kids using it as well.  We live in Miami, florida and Sunny days combined with salty water can be harsh on your skin.  This is perfect to control your skins PH balance.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every type of lotion and cream, including LacHydrin 5.  The Doak Acid Mantle cream works better than anything else.  It even helps with itchy spells, rather than having to spray Benadryl spray which gets sticky.  It is very expensive so I use it on my affected areas, for me right now my face, hands, and neck.  Worth the price to me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost 2 years. My dermatologist had recommended it because of a severe case of dermatitis I have. It was to rebuild my skin, he said. That has not happened but I notice that my skin feels much better after I apply the cream. I am happy to have found the 4 oz. size because the tube I had before was about 1 oz and I paid $11 for it!</li>
            <li> Years ago while living in Chicago I suffered from the worst winter itch of my life.  A friend told me about Mantle cream and I&#x27;ve been using every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 10 years to improve the condition of the dry patches I have on my face.  It is gentle and effective.  I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> Winter dryness made my finger tips dry and cracked, becoming extremely painful.  Nothing would help until I told a pharmacist at Walmarts in Palmdale, CA.  She suggested the cream \\&quot;Acid Mantle\\&quot; rubbed into the tips of my thumbs and any other finger tip that cracked.  What a winner!!  That was 15 years ago and I use it lightly on the ends of my thumbs every night when I go to bed in the winter, or any other time if needed.  It&#x27;s not easy to find and this last time I had to order it from the internet.  I can&#x27;t praise it enough!    N. Dana  Oak Park, CA</li>
            <li> Some time ago, I developed a dry skin condition in the area under my eyes (close to the nose) and low forehead (around the eyebrows). The area was pinkish in color but not itchy. I used this cream before bedtime and the skin was back to its normal tone by next day. Somehow, the condition went away on its own after some time. I don&#x27;t know whether the cream cured the condition or it was due to some of the natural supplements I was taking (Omega 3, Vitamin E). Regardless, this product did the job while the condition was present. Apparently, the cream balances the pH of the skin to its normal state. I would recommend AMantle to anyone who may be experiencing any type of skin condition that does not go away with regular creams.</li>
            <li> This is something which I use for every skin rash and inflamation; anywhere in the body; and I mean everywhere. It is seldom you find a perfect product like this one!</li>
            <li> Acid Mantle is the only thing that got rid of poison ivy on my new tattoo! I had already tried everything else.....</li>
            <li> Package was received promptly.  AMantle doesn&#x27;t seem to be a strong as my past purchases, but I&#x27;m very glad to have found this product as no other drugstores carrry this product.  I will use this vendor again.</li>
