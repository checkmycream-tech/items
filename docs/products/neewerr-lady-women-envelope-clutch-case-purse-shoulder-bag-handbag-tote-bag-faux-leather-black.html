            <li>This bag is cute and simple, slightly cheaply made, but it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ideal thing to have when you want to carry quite a few items.</li>
            <li>Nethertheless, I am quite pleased for the price and decent quality</li>
            <li>This came in the mail today which I was super excited about cuz the anticipated delivery date said it would take much longer.</li>
            <li>so I put some of the packaging I side to stretch it and left it in a warm place so the material could give.</li>

            <li>Really like the slim profile.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>This is a very flat purse - great for a few papers, or my tablet, but nothing bulkier.</li>
            <li>probably i expected a little more but for the priced i paid i guess its okay.</li>
            <li>Not saying that I haven&#x27;t dropped some major coin on designer bags,</li>
            <li>The bag was super stiff</li>
            <li>course you pay for what you get, but I must say, every last bit of optimism I had left in me was completely washed out.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a weird plastic smell emanating from it, so everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no lining.</li>
            <li> The item was what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing much fits in this bag maybe a thin wallet, a cell phone and some lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much because the bag was so cheaply priced, but the bag smells terrible,  </li>
            <li> I will still use this for a small reading book and some small necessities while carrying folders, binders, and text books around and using the locker frequently.</li>
            <li> Can be dressed up or down.  </li>
            <li> (I got the black one)</li>
            <li> you paid less than 10 dlls for it..</li>
            <li> Less of a lady&#x27;s clutch</li>
            <li> but i got it anyway, which is why I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it would&#x27;ve gotten less.</li>
            <li> There was a hole on the front because seamstress went offline and the inside is choppy and unfinished with no lining.</li>
            <li> but unfortunatley it was too thin and short for the flap to close.</li>
            <li> It has the most awful odor!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention to use it for school to hold small books, folders, and a binder</li>
            <li> cuz I absolutely hate spending $$$$ on expensive clutches that get drinks spilled on them all night or might accidentally get left in a cab; which I totally wouldn&#x27;t get mad if it happened to this one.</li>
            <li> This was very sad.</li>
            <li> This purse has the worst smell to it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Meh.  This is a very flat purse - great for a few papers, or my tablet, but nothing bulkier.</li>
            <li> This purse has the worst smell to it! I was not expecting much because the bag was so cheaply priced, but the bag smells terrible,  looks super cheap and is falling apart. Plus, it is smaller than it is pictured. I would not recommend this to anyone just based on the smell alone. I plan on giving it to Goodwill immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really big more like a notebook bag. It fits my iPad even with a case on. This bag is cute and simple, slightly cheaply made, but it&#x27;s so cute. I also got one for my friend as a Christmas gift. She loves it and uses it already.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this clutch no stars.&lt;br /&gt;#1. There is absolutely no lining. The cheap outer leather of the clutch is the one and only layer of the clutch.&lt;br /&gt;#2. The button closure wasn&#x27;t lined up so when I went to open open close the clutch...well...it didn&#x27;t. I would just open it and fold it over when I was finished.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you pay for what you get, but I must say, every last bit of optimism I had left in me was completely washed out.</li>
            <li> cute purse for just grabbing on the go love how large the purse is.. fast shipping would purchase another one</li>
            <li> I like it it&#x27;s cute and all but it is way too big i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this big</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it because I used the white one and it fell apart while I was out. I don&#x27;t want to take the chance</li>
            <li> It has the most awful odor! I have tried several methods of odor removal but to no avail. The size and shape are perfect...just soooo smelly!</li>
            <li> As seen in picture love it</li>
            <li> This bag ifs more than I&#x27;d expected, it&#x27;s beautiful and great for any occasion</li>
            <li> The item was what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Really like the slim profile.  Looks good!</li>
            <li> There was a hole on the front because seamstress went offline and the inside is choppy and unfinished with no lining.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail today which I was super excited about cuz the anticipated delivery date said it would take much longer. (I got the black one) I opened it up and I don&#x27;t have a weird plastic smell emanating from it, so everything seems fine. I love the size that it&#x27;s so huge and it&#x27;s perfect for a night out on the town (which I bought it for) cuz I absolutely hate spending $$$$ on expensive clutches that get drinks spilled on them all night or might accidentally get left in a cab; which I totally wouldn&#x27;t get mad if it happened to this one. To everyone else: If u pay $15 and get pissed, try dropping more dough for the kind of quality you&#x27;re looking for. #justsaying. Not saying that I haven&#x27;t dropped some major coin on designer bags, cuz I have, but since I expect this clutch to go thru a lot, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The bag is okay... probably i expected a little more but for the priced i paid i guess its okay.</li>
            <li> Total garbage, no surprise. Save your money. The strap broke the first time I used it. This was very sad.</li>
            <li> I noticed some comments saying something about the smell.. come on!! you paid less than 10 dlls for it.. it smells like it should smell.. fine for me.. I love the shape.. I wore it the day I got it.. I got lots of great compliments!</li>
            <li> Lovely clutch. Can be dressed up or down.  It&#x27;s the ideal thing to have when you want to carry quite a few items.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Very versatile.</li>
            <li> Looks unfinished, unrefined.  Less of a lady&#x27;s clutch</li>
            <li> You get what a you pay for. This bags design is cute. However the quality is really cheap. I knew this going into the purchase but i got it anyway, which is why I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it would&#x27;ve gotten less. The bag was super stiff so I put some of the packaging I side to stretch it and left it in a warm place so the material could give. The strap broke the first time it was worn, and the inside of the bag has a Crack from the material being folded. I also have not unzipped the back zipper it might as well be decorative because the pouch is just a flimsy piece of paper like cloth. Nothing much fits in this bag maybe a thin wallet, a cell phone and some lip gloss. I just use it as a clutch and its cute that way.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention to use it for school to hold small books, folders, and a binder but unfortunatley it was too thin and short for the flap to close. Nethertheless, I am quite pleased for the price and decent quality altough the pocket lining inside isn&#x27;t neat. I will still use this for a small reading book and some small necessities while carrying folders, binders, and text books around and using the locker frequently.The bag looks exaclty as advertised and got the 2 straps.</li>
            <li> The Fabric is too tough.wish it was a bit softer, nevertheless a great buy,can be used for a sophisticated or casual look.</li>
            <li> cheap looking and smells, but you get what you pay for.</li>
