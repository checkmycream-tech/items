            <li>I really love this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>I love the eye cream and tried the face cream.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my neck and decolletage.</li>
            <li>LOVE- LOVE- LOVE this cream I started using 1 month ago and already noticing a difference-</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat that! :)</li>
            <li>After a week or so, and after decreasing usage to once per day from twice, I noticed more blackheads, enlarged pores, and increased appearance of whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how much even toned and bright my face looked, along with the fine lines diminished.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, I sent an email to Le Parfait asking more questions about their products and the CEO of the company contacted me immediately and sent me samples of their new products: apple stem lip balm and nail renewal - both really amazing products.</li>
            <li>It has reduced the fine lines in my face and leaves it feeling smoother.</li>
            <li>I also use the eye cream and find that it minimizes my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I love it because I can see the toning and smoothing in my face quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly &amp; leaves my skin feeling tighter &amp; not greasy.  </li>
            <li>So, no improvement, and significant detriment to my skin.</li>
            <li>and nice love it and buy next time</li>

            <li>It certainly makes her skin much smoother and has a very nice gentle perfume, I have told her when I get to her age</li>
            <li>Thankyou for the quick delivery and will send you another order when required.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is completely amazing - got rid of the fine lines and crepe-like dry skin that used to be there.</li>
            <li>I have skin that is sensitive to many products</li>
            <li>It is much more soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>Excellent ingredients for the price--wish it came in a bigger jar--would buy in bulk--saw a brighter complexion within a few days--not a moisturizer..</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the new me!!!  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m 54.</li>
            <li>I love this and especially the under eye cream that goes with it.</li>
            <li>This facial cream together with the eye cream are fully satisfying all my expectations.</li>
            <li>It is based on cultured stem cell of a rare Swiss apple that has unusually regenerative properties.</li>
            <li>My wife was given a pot of this cream  several months ago and was so pleased with it when it came to an end she wanted more, but we had a big problema finding it on sale.</li>
            <li>Most of the &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; hypoallergenic, miracle creams only moisturize but do nothing to revitalize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely am in love with this facial cream.</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and I barely notice any wrinkles I am 64 years</li>
            <li>I really like the use of apple stem cell technology in this product.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin and seems to have helped both its texture and suppleness.</li>
            <li>I find it reasonably priced for the money.</li>
            <li>and this item has really changed the look and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It does seem to tighten my skin and give it a much healthier look.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps you could send a bucket full next time !!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to use this trust me you will be hooked and</li>
            <li>My fine lines are less visible and the overall appearance of my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>It is good, not great.</li>
            <li>This face cream is amazing and truly for all skin types, it does not sting my sensitive area when I apply it, and my face remains balance even after 12 hours, absolutely no oily or dry</li>
            <li>Helps clearing the dark circles around my eyes, its light, helps with my break outs</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My dark circles have diminished and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Received the jar of cream,and I am with the habit of looking for the expiration date of products I bought, and to my surprised, I see that on the bottom of the jar show the expiration date as of 06 27 13.</li>
            <li>I have soft supple skin in the morning when I put it on at night.</li>
            <li>I now ordered the triple action vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Has made my skin soft and it&#x27;s firmer.</li>
            <li>After several days, my skin was irritated and developed severe dry, flaky patches, especially along my nasolabial fold (line from nose to corner of mouth), with a new fine line appearing where none had been before.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it will be heavy, but it absorbs quickly and your face feels completely refreshed after applying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the face cream....brightens my face and seems to calm down my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I am 44, live in dry Colorado, and have sun damage from my teenage years</li>
            <li>I have a combination of dry cheeks and eyes, oily T-zone (forehead, nose and chin), sensitive around the jaw bones.</li>
            <li>But after the first 1/4 jar I noticed a dramatic positive difference.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy nor does it feel like there&#x27;s a film on my skin all day like some other moisturerizers leave.  </li>
            <li> : I have been using this for soooooo long.  </li>
            <li> After applying a generous amount to my face, my face felt simultaneously greasy and dry somehow.  </li>
            <li> Sad smile not enough change has happened to be recognized by the people around.</li>
            <li> The last 2 shipments came &amp;#34;spoiled.&amp;#34;  The cream was an odd color and appears the oils and other ingredients separated.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little difference only for the first few weeks but sadly the miracle didn’t happened after all...</li>
            <li> I am going to look for a different product for the next time around, which makes me sad since I have been using this for so long.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they have been sold out on Amazon</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, and this cream was extremely irritating over time.  </li>
            <li> My friend has noticed it the other day!</li>
            <li> All natural feel with the plump and POW of an expensive luxury cream.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin with this product within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My face feels firm and plump.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as I won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find products containing this ingredient on the American retail market until now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for me.  </li>

            <li> I really like the use of apple stem cell technology in this product.  It is gentle on my skin and seems to have helped both its texture and suppleness.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m 54. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week now and I do notice improvement in my skin. I will give an update in a couple weeks as I still need more time to see how well this works.</li>
            <li> I love them! I&#x27;ve been using the anti-aging facial creme and eye cream for a month now. My dark circles have diminished and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using le Parfait apple stem cell anti-aging cream for about a year now. I have skin that is sensitive to many products and I often develop rashes, even after using a product for a while. This product is wonderful. It has reduced the fine lines in my face and leaves it feeling smoother. I find it reasonably priced for the money. I also love the convenience of buying it on line and shipped to my door.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging cream keeps my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this and especially the under eye cream that goes with it. I am 44, live in dry Colorado, and have sun damage from my teenage years and this item has really changed the look and texture of my skin. It is much more soft &amp; supple. The eye cream is completely amazing - got rid of the fine lines and crepe-like dry skin that used to be there.</li>
            <li> This facial cream together with the eye cream are fully satisfying all my expectations. After months of researching for an anti-aging product that actually works, I found out there is a revolutionary anti aging ingredient on the European market called Phytocell Tec Malus Domestica or Apple Stem Cells discovered by a Swiss company. It is based on cultured stem cell of a rare Swiss apple that has unusually regenerative properties. I was unable to find products containing this ingredient on the American retail market until now. I bought both the eye and the facial cream from Le Parfait two weeks ago and I use them every morning and evening. I see improvement as days are passing by. My fine lines are less visible and the overall appearance of my skin has improved significantly. My friend has noticed it the other day! I am so happy I found these products! On top of this, I sent an email to Le Parfait asking more questions about their products and the CEO of the company contacted me immediately and sent me samples of their new products: apple stem lip balm and nail renewal - both really amazing products. What a great company! I strongly recommend these products to all women!</li>
            <li> I bought the anti aging cream and I loved it I will become a lifetime customer I recommend it to all women</li>
            <li> Received the jar of cream,and I am with the habit of looking for the expiration date of products I bought, and to my surprised, I see that on the bottom of the jar show the expiration date as of 06 27 13. Very disappointed, as I won&#x27;t be able to use it. Why on earth they sell the jar that is expired almost a year ago???</li>
            <li> Excellent ingredients for the price--wish it came in a bigger jar--would buy in bulk--saw a brighter complexion within a few days--not a moisturizer..but an excellent anti aging cream..already bought a second jar..</li>
            <li> I felt a little difference only for the first few weeks but sadly the miracle didn’t happened after all...Sad smile not enough change has happened to be recognized by the people around.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. All natural feel with the plump and POW of an expensive luxury cream.  Loved how it did not feel oily or leave chemical scent on my face. I do recommend and I am a picky with my products!</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream.  It is so light-weight it feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my face but silk!  It does seem to tighten my skin and give it a much healthier look.  It&#x27;s not heavy nor does it feel like there&#x27;s a film on my skin all day like some other moisturerizers leave.  I love how it feels and looks and would highly recommend it!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have a combination of dry cheeks and eyes, oily T-zone (forehead, nose and chin), sensitive around the jaw bones. I basically had to put on 3 different kinds of face cream every day to maintain a balance.  This face cream is amazing and truly for all skin types, it does not sting my sensitive area when I apply it, and my face remains balance even after 12 hours, absolutely no oily or dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is even out a bit after just one week.  I love this face cream.</li>
            <li> It is good, not great.</li>
            <li> I love the eye cream and tried the face cream. It delivers! I have soft supple skin in the morning when I put it on at night. I love using it on my neck and decolletage. I buy two at a time of this product. I have to!</li>
            <li> Just opened second jar.  My skin looks and feels healthier and I have had people comment that my skin &amp;#34;is glowing&amp;#34;.  Great product!</li>
            <li> LOVE- LOVE- LOVE this cream I started using 1 month ago and already noticing a difference- even my esthetician saw the change.  It goes on smoothly &amp; leaves my skin feeling tighter &amp; not greasy.  I also use the eye cream and find that it minimizes my fine lines.  I now ordered the triple action vitamin C serum. I am looking forward to the new me!!!  Darlene Hutton</li>
            <li> My wife was given a pot of this cream  several months ago and was so pleased with it when it came to an end she wanted more, but we had a big problema finding it on sale. Thanks to Amazon we were able to purchase it on line and at a very good Price. So we ordered 2 so we had a spare as she didn&#x27;t want to be without again. It certainly makes her skin much smoother and has a very nice gentle perfume, I have told her when I get to her age I will start to use it as well (just kidding). Thankyou for the quick delivery and will send you another order when required. Perhaps you could send a bucket full next time !!! A Cox</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering this and I have found it to be really great my skin is smooth and I barely notice any wrinkles I am 64 years and my husband says I look like I&#x27;m 34 so I am very happy with your product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am using the 2% eye cream AND the 5%. I live in Colorado and have sensitive skin so I have tried dozens of creams, balms, salves, etc. Most of the &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; hypoallergenic, miracle creams only moisturize but do nothing to revitalize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they have been sold out on Amazon and I can&#x27;t find it locally. You have a great product, please restock soon. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this facial cream. I love it because I can see the toning and smoothing in my face quickly. Helps clearing the dark circles around my eyes, its light, helps with my break outs and I also us it as a sun screen protector (its not sun block, but helps) before I apply my make up. I use it religiously on a daily after I shower and I even have family members using it, my boyfriend is also hooked to this cream. I highly recommend everyone to use this trust me you will be hooked and the price is great too....can&#x27;t beat that! :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for me.  I do have sensitive skin, and this cream was extremely irritating over time.  After applying a generous amount to my face, my face felt simultaneously greasy and dry somehow.  After several days, my skin was irritated and developed severe dry, flaky patches, especially along my nasolabial fold (line from nose to corner of mouth), with a new fine line appearing where none had been before.  After a week or so, and after decreasing usage to once per day from twice, I noticed more blackheads, enlarged pores, and increased appearance of whiteheads.  So, no improvement, and significant detriment to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use both the face cream and the under eye cream.  I am 37 and I have wasted so much money trying many expensive anti aging creams that didn&#x27;t change the look of my skin. I noticed a difference in my skin with this product within a few weeks.  I was amazed how much even toned and bright my face looked, along with the fine lines diminished.  I have been using it for almost a year and I have no intention in stopping now.  Also, I should mention that I have problem skin that breaks out and this cream did NOT cause a break out.  It seems like it will be heavy, but it absorbs quickly and your face feels completely refreshed after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have been using this for soooooo long.  The last 2 shipments came &amp;#34;spoiled.&amp;#34;  The cream was an odd color and appears the oils and other ingredients separated.  One time I could forgive, but when it happened a second time it feels like a quality control issue that should have been rectified. I am going to look for a different product for the next time around, which makes me sad since I have been using this for so long.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for one year. But after the first 1/4 jar I noticed a dramatic positive difference. Thank You</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I feel it is as good as some that sell for double the price. Has made my skin soft and it&#x27;s firmer.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have purchased it twice.  My face feels firm and plump.</li>
            <li> I like the face cream....brightens my face and seems to calm down my rosacea.</li>
