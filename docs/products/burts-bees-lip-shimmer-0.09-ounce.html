            <li>I love almost all the colors of this lip shimmer.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my lips feel plumper and luscious</li>
            <li>My favorite lip shimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and color for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I also loved the Super Glossy because it&#x27;s lightweight, shimmery, high gloss and has a pleasant smell/taste.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and feels like it lasts longer than most chap sitcks.</li>
            <li>I love everything about Burt&#x27;s Bees lip shimmer -- it feels great going on, smells nice, keeps my lips soft and moist for hours, and adds just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>Peony&#x3D; Great natural shimmer color.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>your lips easily glide against one another and part with no noticeable resistance.</li>
            <li>This product is a pretty color - like nude, it doesn&#x27;t show as a color, but the shimmer is nice.</li>
            <li>I love the minty cool feeling.</li>
            <li>The Watermelon shade is the one that I like the best because I like the cool pink</li>
            <li>my favorite was a tie between the lip shimmer and the super glossy.</li>
            <li>I like this as it goes on smoothly and feels like it is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This product gives you a hint of color along with creamy, smooth lips.  </li>
            <li>Love how minty fresh</li>
            <li>Like the color and the feel which is light and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>Colors are very natural and really any of them will look great on anyone.</li>
            <li>Most of all I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>Photo makes it look a tad more orange than it really is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting better VERY</li>
            <li>They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized.</li>
            <li>Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>but it is not bad.</li>
            <li>but with a shimmery-low to mildly saturated lip color.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Lip shimmer, I plan to buy more when I run out &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>this - previous order was great, I don&#x27;t understand who the supplier is this time, but this is not the way to send items.</li>
            <li>Feels good on dry lips and gives just a splash of color.</li>
            <li>the shimmer is so nice and Peony is close to my lip color, make my lips look pretty and natural</li>
            <li>My skin has yellow undertones, and is somewhat light, yet the product still provided enough contrast to be attractive.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy a lipcolor twice and have worn this for years.</li>
            <li>but I do like quality &amp; more natural products &amp; this seems to be from what I know of it.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky or tacky and stays on with a nice tint of color, sheer</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Used this when my lipstick wore out and it was a nice substitute with just enough shimmer for the feminine effect.</li>
            <li>I own 3 of the following Burt&#x27; Bees tinted/colored lip care products:&lt;br /&gt;~Lip</li>
            <li>Great for all day/every day, non-dressy occasions when I feel like I need a little spiffing up!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, fresh minty smell and all natural hydrating ingredients</li>
            <li>I adored the high moisturizing content of the lip shimmer, it was basically like using the original Burts Bees lip balm (one of my must haves where ever I go)</li>
            <li>I ordered a few of these in different colors and this is the best is</li>
            <li>They feel great on and are extremely portable, not to mention all natural and well-priced.</li>
            <li>Loved the subtle color and the light shimmery factor.</li>
            <li>It tastes like peppermint and makes my lips feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is not too assuming, and is light and soft on the lips.</li>
            <li>it is pretty too.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get this in more colors.</li>
            <li>Plus, it didn&#x27;t taste funny.</li>
            <li>I really like this color!</li>
            <li>Some of the other colors are too shimmery, but this one has a nice balance of color and shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is such an easy color for everything.</li>
            <li>Like most lip gloss/shimmers, it does tend to dry my lips out after wearing it for a while and a couple applications.</li>
            <li>Love this color, subtle but noticeable, blends in really nicely with my natural lip color.  </li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and just adds a little something when I want to look a bit prettier than au natural.</li>
            <li>order was handled very well.</li>
            <li>In the severe winter weather my lips get really chapped but this really worked well this winter.</li>
            <li>Not too much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup/lipstick much</li>
            <li>Just enough color and a smooth application.</li>
            <li>three of these items have low to light color tint.</li>
            <li>Nice color for everyday.  </li>
            <li>and if you like high gloss I also recommend trying the Super Glossy Natural Lip Shine.</li>
            <li>Tried other colors, but this one I use most often.  </li>
            <li>Subtle color, good moisture.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Minty fresh and not too much color, just enough.</li>
            <li>but you can actually tell that there is color to it, unlike most lip sheer lip glosses.</li>
            <li>and I keep this in my purse to add a little touch of color when needed. :)</li>
            <li>Has peppermint oil which I normally would pass up on as well</li>
            <li>Fun any day red.  </li>
            <li>fine product, fast shipper, brand new items, plus shipper included a little bonus gift for me.  </li>
            <li>Gives a slight tingly feeling on the lips, lightly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Glossy Natural Lip Shine in Sweet Pink.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday protection with a little color.</li>
            <li>Item comes in a clear V shaped squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>least favorite was the 100% natural lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I tried to peel it off and it stuck to the tube and would not peel completely off</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my lips and makes them feel soft.</li>
            <li>you want some NATURAL color.  </li>
            <li>% natural lip gloss in autumn haze.</li>
            <li>After applying it, and parting the lips you can feel a slight resistance while with the Lip Shimmer and Super Glossy</li>
            <li>The lip shimmer also really helped reduce issues with dry lips, too (the reason that I tried this).</li>
            <li>I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter.</li>
            <li>The 100% natural gloss had the highest amount of shimmer/subtle sparkle followed by the Lip shimmer and the Super Glossy.&lt;br /&gt;~After drinking/eating/blotting all wore away evenly and did not leave behind unsightly color staining on the lips.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this item! Subtle color, good moisture.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes your lips and adds a little color...I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Photo makes it look a tad more orange than it really is. But, I like their lip shimmers.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen this anywhere!  Especially with subscribe and save.  $3 and change is wonderful!  I love this.  Just a slight color on your lips, and not glossy.</li>
            <li> order was handled very well.</li>
            <li> I like this as it goes on smoothly and feels like it is moisturizing.  Most of all I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> I love this it is like a lip stick, but feels like a chapstick. It tastes like peppermint and makes my lips feel smooth and soft. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and dry like lipstick. The color is gorgeous and just adds a little something when I want to look a bit prettier than au natural.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy color for everything. It is not too assuming, and is light and soft on the lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before from Amazon and I loved it.  Came perfect.  Then my last order of 2 of these Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer&#x27;s came with a big bar code sticker/label stuck on the tube that covered 90% of the tube.  I tried to peel it off and it stuck to the tube and would not peel completely off so now I have a tube that is extremely sticky and will pick up lint, dust and dirt and I can&#x27;t put in my purse or it will stick to everything I have in there.  Not happy with this - previous order was great, I don&#x27;t understand who the supplier is this time, but this is not the way to send items. I will buy from local store where I don&#x27;t have a tube that is gummy, has a massive mangled label and sticks to my fingers. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate the color.  Just wanted a plain, non-sparkled lip gloss!</li>
            <li> My favorite balm. I rarely buy a lipcolor twice and have worn this for years. It IS frosty. I have to watch the amount I put on but it is not bad. I never wear frosted lipstick so its really ok. Has peppermint oil which I normally would pass up on as well but its pleasant and heals my lips.</li>
            <li> This provides a nice punch of color. Easy to apply, fresh minty smell and all natural hydrating ingredients - how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift &amp; I really liked it. I&#x27;m not real familier with Burts Bees but I do like quality &amp; more natural products &amp; this seems to be from what I know of it. I like that it is moisturizing with a tint to it &amp; has a tingling mint to it. In the severe winter weather my lips get really chapped but this really worked well this winter. I ordered more. I recommend if your more of a chap stick not lipstick but want a bit of color kinda gal. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer is THE best product for your lips.  This product gives you a hint of color along with creamy, smooth lips.  My go to lip color everytime!</li>
            <li> I am a label reader, but I missed this one. Who would think a little peppermint oil could cause this major reaction? This product is a pretty color - like nude, it doesn&#x27;t show as a color, but the shimmer is nice. I cannot use it regardless. It stung like heck when I tried it on. I thought it was me because NO manufacturer would make a product that HURTS... would they?&lt;br /&gt;I persevered and by the third day of trying to wear it my bottom lip was mysteriously swollen and painful. Like the other customer this happened to I thought I needed MORE!!! You know, to heal the swelling and pain. The next day my lip split open and got a small sore on it. In the trash it went. It&#x27;s been three weeks and my lip is still swollen, split and sore. It&#x27;s getting better VERY slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d better put my two cents in here so that hopefully I can save another person from dealing with this very unpleasant side effect.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm, and cheaper on amazon than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> I love everything about Burt&#x27;s Bees lip shimmer -- it feels great going on, smells nice, keeps my lips soft and moist for hours, and adds just the right amount of color. Peony was the first color I tried last month, and I&#x27;ve since ordered this product in a few other shades. In fact, I&#x27;ve stopped wearing lipstick or any other form of lip color completely!</li>
            <li> product was open upon arrival. original seal was broken and i couldn&#x27;t tell if had been used or maybe was a tester??  was this a mistake?</li>
            <li> fine product, fast shipper, brand new items, plus shipper included a little bonus gift for me.  I was very happy with this shipper and the product.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmers are awesome. It moisturizes my lips and makes them feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great color...hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh and not too much color, just enough. I would definitely order this product again and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Love how minty fresh this Burt&#x27;s Bees lip shimmer is and it is pretty too. My skin has yellow undertones, and is somewhat light, yet the product still provided enough contrast to be attractive. The lip shimmer also really helped reduce issues with dry lips, too (the reason that I tried this). Would order again.</li>
            <li> Another good product from Burt&#x27;s Bees. The peony color is lighter than I thought it would be so next time I&#x27;ll try a darker color.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is light and smooth.  The color is just perfect and I can carry the tube in my pocket.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this Lip Shimmer is wonderful. It is not sticky or tacky and stays on with a nice tint of color, sheer but you can actually tell that there is color to it, unlike most lip sheer lip glosses. I will definitely get this in more colors.</li>
            <li> Love this lip stick.  Nice color for everyday.  Feels great on the lips!</li>
            <li> nice color , feels good !</li>
            <li> It is the perfect amount of color.  Not too much.  Love it.  Delivered on time and as promised. It was a great experience.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few of these in different colors and this is the best is you want some NATURAL color.  Some of the other colors are too shimmery, but this one has a nice balance of color and shimmer.</li>
            <li> Gives a slight tingly feeling on the lips, lightly moisturizing.  Love this color, subtle but noticeable, blends in really nicely with my natural lip color.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup/lipstick much and I keep this in my purse to add a little touch of color when needed. :)</li>
            <li> Tried other colors, but this one I use most often.  Feels good on dry lips and gives just a splash of color. Glides on easily and feels like it lasts longer than most chap sitcks.</li>
            <li> Peony&#x3D; Great natural shimmer color. I wear almost every day.  Cherry&#x3D; Fun any day red.  Fig&#x3D; Sultry day to night shimmer.    I feel these colors would work well with any skin tone. I love the minty cool feeling. So refreshing! This lip shimmer is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I do not wear lipstick. I&#x27;ve never found a lipstick I like that doesn&#x27;t make me cough, nor a color I like.&lt;br /&gt;This shade PEONY, in a lip shimmer is absolutely the best thing for me. Just enough color and a smooth application.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like a &amp;#34;fuss,&amp;#34; then this peony shade is for you. I can see somewhat of a shimmer, a hint of a color, but it&#x27;s not a strong color, which I like.</li>
            <li> I love almost all the colors of this lip shimmer. They feel great on and are extremely portable, not to mention all natural and well-priced. A nice alternative to Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, and lasts for a long time.  Like most lip gloss/shimmers, it does tend to dry my lips out after wearing it for a while and a couple applications. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My 2nd burt&#x27;s bees in peony. 1st was from sephora in my country . This was way cheaper just couldnt pass it up . Love how it makes my lips feel plumper and luscious</li>
            <li> Good for everyday protection with a little color.</li>
            <li> Used this when my lipstick wore out and it was a nice substitute with just enough shimmer for the feminine effect. Plus, it didn&#x27;t taste funny.</li>
            <li> Great for all day/every day, non-dressy occasions when I feel like I need a little spiffing up! Feels great on lips. Colors are very natural and really any of them will look great on anyone.</li>
            <li> I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter. The secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer. They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot. The Watermelon shade is the one that I like the best because I like the cool pink colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients they list are: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, beeswax, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, lanolin, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil. May contain: iron oxide, mica, carmine, titanium dioxide. The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized. Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer so you don&#x27;t have a build up like you might with regular lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> the shimmer is so nice and Peony is close to my lip color, make my lips look pretty and natural</li>
            <li> Nice color and feels good to apply.  But builds in at the corner of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip shimmer. I&#x27;ve been using this brand and color for years and love it. Adds color and a bit of moisture. I use it over the pomegranate lip balm for extra protection during drier days.</li>
            <li> I own 3 of the following Burt&#x27; Bees tinted/colored lip care products:&lt;br /&gt;~Lip Shimmer in Peony.&lt;br /&gt;~Super Glossy Natural Lip Shine in Sweet Pink. Item comes in a clear V shaped squeeze tube. The description on the back is spot on, &amp;#34;Moisturizes like a balm with a juicy fruit flavor and a sheer color gloss&amp;#34;. IMO the smell/taste is reminiscent of a fruity Bonne Bell chapstick (it&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve used one of those, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you which flavor exactly).&lt;br /&gt;~100% natural lip gloss in autumn haze. Item comes in a short/skinny cylinder tube with a sponge tipped applicator wand.&lt;br /&gt;All three of these items have low to light color tint. The 100% natural gloss had the highest amount of shimmer/subtle sparkle followed by the Lip shimmer and the Super Glossy.&lt;br /&gt;~After drinking/eating/blotting all wore away evenly and did not leave behind unsightly color staining on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;Of these 3 my favorite was a tie between the lip shimmer and the super glossy. I adored the high moisturizing content of the lip shimmer, it was basically like using the original Burts Bees lip balm (one of my must haves where ever I go) but with a shimmery-low to mildly saturated lip color. I also loved the Super Glossy because it&#x27;s lightweight, shimmery, high gloss and has a pleasant smell/taste. To get the best of both products I like to use the lip shimmer first and top it off with a dab of the super gloss.&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite was the 100% natural lip gloss. Loved the subtle color and the light shimmery factor. However, the product has an unpleasant sticky/tacky heavy feel to it which reminded me of Mac Lip Glass. After applying it, and parting the lips you can feel a slight resistance while with the Lip Shimmer and Super Glossy your lips easily glide against one another and part with no noticeable resistance. I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell/taste...the closest thing I can compare it to is the smell/taste of a very green banana.&lt;br /&gt;In summation I definitely recommend the Lip shimmer, I plan to buy more when I run out &#x3D;) and if you like high gloss I also recommend trying the Super Glossy Natural Lip Shine.</li>
            <li> I really like this color!</li>
            <li> Like the color and the feel which is light and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the peppermint in it makes my lips feel soooooo good.</li>
