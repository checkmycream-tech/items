            <li>love, love, love!</li>

            <li>and I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>HUGE HELP!</li>
            <li>and it helps to smooth it out ,making it easier to apply!</li>
            <li>Maybe this is more for oily skin types?</li>
            <li>Not invisible, mind you, but better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so smooth looking!</li>
            <li>If I could afford to buy it by the case, I would. :-)</li>
            <li>When I used it under makeup, I found it disappeared or was displaced when I applied my BB cream/etc over top.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I make sure I never run out.  </li>
            <li>i have had problems iwth pores and oily face since i can remember , i absolutely love the texture that I get when I use the cream.</li>
            <li>Best pore coverage that does the great job, not completely pore no more but its the best one out there</li>
            <li>Love this refiner..</li>
            <li>this is my favorite make up  like the matte finish</li>
            <li>I often question the miraculous claims of beauty products, as I&#x27;m sure most of you do.  </li>
            <li>No More\\&quot; had a catchy name, but its pore minimizing properties was not what most attracted me.  </li>
            <li>I can get weeks more of additional use like this.  </li>
            <li>Jesus Christ, so many bottles and jars that did NOTHING.</li>
            <li>but I love the effect.</li>
            <li>Wish the pictures were better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products at all kinds of price ranges and have to agree with the specialists.....</li>
            <li>Do not need to use much for great coverage.  </li>
            <li>okay, wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it since then.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Has a nice feel, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin shine free for hours !</li>
            <li>While the primer looks more gel based, this product is more of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a lovely light silky texture that works well as a very light foundation</li>
            <li>I have huge pores so I have tried many pores reducing primers, creams.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write product reviews but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>it improves the look of my complexion and prevents my face from becoming shiny.</li>
            <li>Great product, will be buying more in future.</li>
            <li>Also creates a silky smooth texture to my skin, making foundation application super easy!</li>
            <li>I will often use it as a base/concealer/foundation substitute with nothing else on top, or with just a pressed powder over it if I want full coverage.</li>
            <li>We love this product and I am certain you will to if you would just give it a try!!</li>
            <li>And it did eliminates fine lines.</li>
            <li>Super!  </li>
            <li>Try just one or two little pumps until you see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does not cause acne, which is huge concern for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in that.</li>
            <li>It was smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and can be worn alone or with makeup.</li>
            <li>It has a light beige color.</li>
            <li>Then a light dusting of powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like this product it gives my skin a smooth look</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, reduces the look of the pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many top name primers, nothing makes my face foundation ready as well as Dr Brandt Pores</li>
            <li>Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores</li>
            <li>No More three years ago, I have found the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>Then I use my Bare Minerals Fairly Medium powder</li>
            <li>and it was a significant amount.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>It does not clog the pore it just fills it in and makes it disappear till you clean your face.</li>
            <li>Wow - I think this stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>I got some in my Ipsy bag and decided I needed a full tube of it almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>and i have VERY LARGE PORES AND SHINY SKIN!</li>
            <li>This product will get right into your pores and cover them and it gives you a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good primer for soooo long</li>
            <li>It works on me very well, and really fast shipping:) will buy it again:) thanks.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great at creating a matte finish but also making pores less visible.</li>
            <li>I wish I could use it as a whole face foundation!!</li>
            <li>AND I had much fewer blackheads!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>and I get a natural, smooth and  easy coverage.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a few years now, it&#x27;s great &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and makes my face feel very silky</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so it makes more sense to purchase here on Amazon for the same price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few of these and what makes this stand out even more is the nice tint to it and</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>You could put the remaining product in a travel pot to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>it was WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I also use it around my lips for the laugh line crevices...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product works any better than a biore strip and would not waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li>I do not need to touch up my face at all as my makeup still looks fresh even after 8 hours or longer.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and silky my skin is after using this.</li>
            <li>Like so many of u, I have tried countless products to shrink my pores &amp; control shine, and am happy to have finally ended my search :) It does help to shrink them permenently over time, and it can wear off during the day, but Ill gladly pay the money for this miracle worker!!</li>
            <li>I had previously been using Pixi Flawless &amp; Poreless and was really happy with the way it worked, but it only made my pores less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this product directly from Dr. Brandt&#x27;s website because it came with a free sample size as well, but I think they discontinued doing that</li>
            <li>but the smell dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and I received it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores and a dermatologist</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it works very well for making my skin look more smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>This is better than the Too Faced brand pore stuff and the Bare minerals brand pore stuff and the  Smashbox brand primer.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this products with any expectations of having it diminish large pores or oily skin!</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, the bottle or instructions (or somewhere) indicated that the product is supposed to work instantly and doesn&#x27;t have continuing results, but in my experience, this product works best if used every day and takes a few days of use before noticing any drastic results.</li>
            <li>I can just lightly smear it on, other areas I need to rub it in a bit more but either way</li>
            <li>Well they are no longer visible thanks to this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Clinique&#x27;s Pore Refining Solutions with much better results, though I still don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li>When I first squeezed some of this out of the tube I was a bit concerned for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so</li>
            <li>Loved this for the first few weeks, but I fell asleep with it on once</li>
            <li>and I started getting interested in make-up and decided to join one of those monthly glam-bag clubs.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Besides, I&#x27;d rather just not get oily in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The first photo is with the product on.</li>
            <li>Better price than the local store.</li>
            <li>I put it on my forehead for no shine &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li>Now because of this product I can literally go the entire day (8 hours +) without needing a single touchup and my makeup looking as great as it did when I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li>Now that the price has come down a bit, I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
            <li>Nothing really makes your pores smaller, but I find my makeup looks much better after using these two  products.</li>
            <li>I live in WY where it&#x27;s super dry, and have found it works even better over day cream.</li>
            <li>One of the samples was for this product and upon my first use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but it did make my skin super-soft, so I kept using every day.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product in store paying almost twice as much.</li>
            <li>I take just a teensy bit and sort of rub it upwards over the large pores on my cheeks and beside my mouth</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>, yes I still see my pores as large as ever.</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>that said, for those of you who have large pores</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much money</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face before work while getting ready</li>
            <li>Like.. really, really dried-out.</li>
            <li>stuff that is really inexpensive and all-natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing to control my shine or diminish the look of my pores.  </li>
            <li>and they absolutely disappear.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and nothing really mattifies it, but this comes close.</li>
            <li>Dr. Brandt&#x27;s item is very pricey and that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5</li>
            <li>Really like this pores refiner.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with skin that is very oil while also having dryness, flakes, and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used the whole system</li>
            <li>This stuff really hides the pores.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Stay out of the sun, use a cleansing and moisterising regime that suits your skin type and always wear an SPF and thats all anyone can do untill a real breakthro is made .</li>
            <li>Pores are a real issue with aging men, so I am very cautious what I put on this aging face.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will use it forever!</li>
            <li>I found that going through Amazon rather than an Avon rep made the products much cheaper, as well.  </li>
            <li>Covers pores very well.</li>
            <li>Makes a smooth almost flawless base for makeup.</li>
            <li>It dispenses as a silky smooth light cream and has a slight hint of color for a natural look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!! :)</li>
            <li>They are a true wonder, but there are times when you&#x27;re in public and you just can&#x27;t whip these things out.  </li>
            <li>Others with less oily skin may have better, longer-lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and getting older.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this particular product for over a year now</li>
            <li>and I assured him (and his assistant) that I was only suffering a mild case of the vapors.  </li>
            <li>When the bottle gets older, you need to mix it up (because it separates).</li>
            <li>have always had super oily skin tried every product from cheap to expensive and have never found a product that keeps me shine free for more than a half hour until now.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes...</li>
            <li>I will still use the primer for days where I need a little more coverage from my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very large, deep pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I have big pores as I get older and it really covered worh the price!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it, can&#x27;t find anything else like it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still looking for the no more oily answer :)</li>
            <li>This is the same exact product for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Because of my oily skin and large pores I always had to search high and low to find a foundation</li>
            <li>(mine are mainly on my cheeks next to my nose; I&#x27;m half asian with oily skin), I finally did find an AMAZING product (two products, together, actually), that work to reduce almost completely the appearance of my huge pores.  </li>
            <li>Did not work at all on my 43 year old face and it still does not work on my 44 year old face!</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose, 2 were so big someone actully asked me if I had my nose pierced!</li>
            <li>It definitely softened the appearance of my pores - for certain.</li>
            <li>I have large pores, my pores look the same after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>It works great, you only need a very little and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>definitely dried-out my skin - and FAST.</li>
            <li>I dont wear powder or foundation because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>AT AMAZON AND AT ANY PLACE SO FAR.</li>
            <li>it really does make your pores look smaller and it doesn&#x27;t shine.</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s from a brand that calls itself &amp;#34;DOCTOR&amp;#34; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to apply too much and look like its caked on so its a process of wiping off whats there and re-applying, so starting over just about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smooths wrinkles and bumps and almost completely gets rid of all of your pores.</li>
            <li>I cut the end off to see how much was left</li>
            <li>nothing bronzer cant fix and as far as minimizing pores for me</li>
            <li>plus I use consealer only (no foundation) which is kind of thick</li>
            <li>We achieve such a smooth natural finish, a small amount goes a long way, and we can use a little more during our day just to freshen-up our \\&quot;look\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if with long term use that will improve but so far, its little more than a mattifying cream.</li>
            <li>it is very light and a little bit goes a long way !  </li>
            <li>At first i didnt notice how well this product works until i wore my makeup without it, big different.</li>
            <li>I use it when done and go near a window w a mirror and dab it on w a finger to any obvious crevice and blend with a fingertip and blot til natural.</li>
            <li>I am super pale, and was worried about it being tinted, but the color disappears once you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller</li>
            <li>Six years ago I began using Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>If its closed pores you want then this product really isnt for you.</li>
            <li>I have searched for YEARS and spent so much money on a solution, and finally have it.</li>
            <li>When I first apply this product, it does indeed make my pores look smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>After rubbing it in - the tint actually wasn&#x27;t even apparent on my skin.</li>
            <li>Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).   </li>
    </ol>

            <li> love, love, love!</li>
            <li> It does really work, after application, your pores disappear making your face look smooth and flawless.  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> HUGE HELP!</li>
            <li> and it helps to smooth it out ,making it easier to apply!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is more for oily skin types?</li>
            <li> Not invisible, mind you, but better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so smooth looking!</li>
            <li> If I could afford to buy it by the case, I would. :-)</li>
            <li> When I used it under makeup, I found it disappeared or was displaced when I applied my BB cream/etc over top.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I make sure I never run out.  </li>
            <li> i have had problems iwth pores and oily face since i can remember , i absolutely love the texture that I get when I use the cream.</li>
            <li> Best pore coverage that does the great job, not completely pore no more but its the best one out there</li>
            <li> Love this refiner..</li>
            <li> this is my favorite make up  like the matte finish</li>
            <li> I often question the miraculous claims of beauty products, as I&#x27;m sure most of you do.  </li>
            <li> No More\\&quot; had a catchy name, but its pore minimizing properties was not what most attracted me.  </li>
            <li> I can get weeks more of additional use like this.  </li>
            <li> Jesus Christ, so many bottles and jars that did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> but I love the effect.</li>
            <li> Wish the pictures were better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products at all kinds of price ranges and have to agree with the specialists.....</li>
            <li> Do not need to use much for great coverage.  </li>
            <li> okay, wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it since then.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Has a nice feel, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin shine free for hours !</li>
            <li> While the primer looks more gel based, this product is more of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a lovely light silky texture that works well as a very light foundation</li>
            <li> I have huge pores so I have tried many pores reducing primers, creams.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write product reviews but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> it improves the look of my complexion and prevents my face from becoming shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product, will be buying more in future.</li>
            <li> Also creates a silky smooth texture to my skin, making foundation application super easy!</li>
            <li> I will often use it as a base/concealer/foundation substitute with nothing else on top, or with just a pressed powder over it if I want full coverage.</li>
            <li> We love this product and I am certain you will to if you would just give it a try!!</li>
            <li> And it did eliminates fine lines.</li>
            <li> Super!  </li>
            <li> Try just one or two little pumps until you see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it does not cause acne, which is huge concern for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in that.</li>
            <li> It was smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and can be worn alone or with makeup.</li>
            <li> It has a light beige color.</li>
            <li> Then a light dusting of powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like this product it gives my skin a smooth look</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, reduces the look of the pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many top name primers, nothing makes my face foundation ready as well as Dr Brandt Pores</li>
            <li> Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores</li>
            <li> No More three years ago, I have found the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> Then I use my Bare Minerals Fairly Medium powder</li>
            <li> and it was a significant amount.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> It does not clog the pore it just fills it in and makes it disappear till you clean your face.</li>
            <li> Wow - I think this stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li> I got some in my Ipsy bag and decided I needed a full tube of it almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> and i have VERY LARGE PORES AND SHINY SKIN!</li>
            <li> This product will get right into your pores and cover them and it gives you a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good primer for soooo long</li>
            <li> It works on me very well, and really fast shipping:) will buy it again:) thanks.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great at creating a matte finish but also making pores less visible.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it as a whole face foundation!!</li>
            <li> AND I had much fewer blackheads!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> and I get a natural, smooth and  easy coverage.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now, it&#x27;s great &amp; I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and makes my face feel very silky</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so it makes more sense to purchase here on Amazon for the same price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these and what makes this stand out even more is the nice tint to it and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> You could put the remaining product in a travel pot to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> it was WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I also use it around my lips for the laugh line crevices...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works any better than a biore strip and would not waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> I do not need to touch up my face at all as my makeup still looks fresh even after 8 hours or longer.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and silky my skin is after using this.</li>
            <li> Like so many of u, I have tried countless products to shrink my pores &amp; control shine, and am happy to have finally ended my search :) It does help to shrink them permenently over time, and it can wear off during the day, but Ill gladly pay the money for this miracle worker!!</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Pixi Flawless &amp; Poreless and was really happy with the way it worked, but it only made my pores less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product directly from Dr. Brandt&#x27;s website because it came with a free sample size as well, but I think they discontinued doing that</li>
            <li> but the smell dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> and I received it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and a dermatologist</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it works very well for making my skin look more smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> This is better than the Too Faced brand pore stuff and the Bare minerals brand pore stuff and the  Smashbox brand primer.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this products with any expectations of having it diminish large pores or oily skin!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, the bottle or instructions (or somewhere) indicated that the product is supposed to work instantly and doesn&#x27;t have continuing results, but in my experience, this product works best if used every day and takes a few days of use before noticing any drastic results.</li>
            <li> I can just lightly smear it on, other areas I need to rub it in a bit more but either way</li>
            <li> Well they are no longer visible thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Clinique&#x27;s Pore Refining Solutions with much better results, though I still don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed some of this out of the tube I was a bit concerned for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so</li>
            <li> Loved this for the first few weeks, but I fell asleep with it on once</li>
            <li> and I started getting interested in make-up and decided to join one of those monthly glam-bag clubs.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Besides, I&#x27;d rather just not get oily in the first place.  </li>
            <li> The first photo is with the product on.</li>
            <li> Better price than the local store.</li>
            <li> I put it on my forehead for no shine &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li> Now because of this product I can literally go the entire day (8 hours +) without needing a single touchup and my makeup looking as great as it did when I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li> Now that the price has come down a bit, I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Nothing really makes your pores smaller, but I find my makeup looks much better after using these two  products.</li>
            <li> I live in WY where it&#x27;s super dry, and have found it works even better over day cream.</li>
            <li> One of the samples was for this product and upon my first use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but it did make my skin super-soft, so I kept using every day.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product in store paying almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> I take just a teensy bit and sort of rub it upwards over the large pores on my cheeks and beside my mouth</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> , yes I still see my pores as large as ever.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> that said, for those of you who have large pores</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much money</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face before work while getting ready</li>
            <li> Like.. really, really dried-out.</li>
            <li> stuff that is really inexpensive and all-natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing to control my shine or diminish the look of my pores.  </li>
            <li> and they absolutely disappear.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and nothing really mattifies it, but this comes close.</li>
            <li> Dr. Brandt&#x27;s item is very pricey and that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5</li>
            <li> Really like this pores refiner.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with skin that is very oil while also having dryness, flakes, and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used the whole system</li>
            <li> This stuff really hides the pores.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> Stay out of the sun, use a cleansing and moisterising regime that suits your skin type and always wear an SPF and thats all anyone can do untill a real breakthro is made .</li>
            <li> Pores are a real issue with aging men, so I am very cautious what I put on this aging face.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will use it forever!</li>
            <li> I found that going through Amazon rather than an Avon rep made the products much cheaper, as well.  </li>
            <li> Covers pores very well.</li>
            <li> Makes a smooth almost flawless base for makeup.</li>
            <li> It dispenses as a silky smooth light cream and has a slight hint of color for a natural look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!! :)</li>
            <li> They are a true wonder, but there are times when you&#x27;re in public and you just can&#x27;t whip these things out.  </li>
            <li> Others with less oily skin may have better, longer-lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and getting older.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this particular product for over a year now</li>
            <li> and I assured him (and his assistant) that I was only suffering a mild case of the vapors.  </li>
            <li> When the bottle gets older, you need to mix it up (because it separates).</li>
            <li> have always had super oily skin tried every product from cheap to expensive and have never found a product that keeps me shine free for more than a half hour until now.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes...</li>
            <li> I will still use the primer for days where I need a little more coverage from my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very large, deep pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have big pores as I get older and it really covered worh the price!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, can&#x27;t find anything else like it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still looking for the no more oily answer :)</li>
            <li> This is the same exact product for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Because of my oily skin and large pores I always had to search high and low to find a foundation</li>
            <li> (mine are mainly on my cheeks next to my nose; I&#x27;m half asian with oily skin), I finally did find an AMAZING product (two products, together, actually), that work to reduce almost completely the appearance of my huge pores.  </li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my 43 year old face and it still does not work on my 44 year old face!</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose, 2 were so big someone actully asked me if I had my nose pierced!</li>
            <li> It definitely softened the appearance of my pores - for certain.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, my pores look the same after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> It works great, you only need a very little and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> definitely dried-out my skin - and FAST.</li>
            <li> I dont wear powder or foundation because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> AT AMAZON AND AT ANY PLACE SO FAR.</li>
            <li> it really does make your pores look smaller and it doesn&#x27;t shine.</li>
            <li> But since it&#x27;s from a brand that calls itself &amp;#34;DOCTOR&amp;#34; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to apply too much and look like its caked on so its a process of wiping off whats there and re-applying, so starting over just about.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smooths wrinkles and bumps and almost completely gets rid of all of your pores.</li>
            <li> I cut the end off to see how much was left</li>
            <li> nothing bronzer cant fix and as far as minimizing pores for me</li>
            <li> plus I use consealer only (no foundation) which is kind of thick</li>
            <li> We achieve such a smooth natural finish, a small amount goes a long way, and we can use a little more during our day just to freshen-up our \\&quot;look\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if with long term use that will improve but so far, its little more than a mattifying cream.</li>
            <li> it is very light and a little bit goes a long way !  </li>
            <li> At first i didnt notice how well this product works until i wore my makeup without it, big different.</li>
            <li> I use it when done and go near a window w a mirror and dab it on w a finger to any obvious crevice and blend with a fingertip and blot til natural.</li>
            <li> I am super pale, and was worried about it being tinted, but the color disappears once you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller</li>
            <li> Six years ago I began using Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> If its closed pores you want then this product really isnt for you.</li>
            <li> I have searched for YEARS and spent so much money on a solution, and finally have it.</li>
            <li> When I first apply this product, it does indeed make my pores look smaller and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in - the tint actually wasn&#x27;t even apparent on my skin.</li>
            <li> Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).   </li>
            <li> A few things to mention it does have a light color to it making my skin appear pale</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, but from just a 2 days of using this, my skin started to DRY OUT and react as though I had a severe sunburn!!!!</li>
            <li> and I am very fair-skinned, so tinted usually means streaky and Jersey Shore-ish in the face for me, so I tend to avoid tinted products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty big pores, and this seriously just makes them disappear.  </li>
            <li> However, the effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip for new users: A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have excessively oily skin and until this products was never able to make my makeup last more than a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this (I usually don&#x27;t for what sounds like miracle cures)</li>
            <li> I only use Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Pores no More and mascara in the summer months for a polished natural look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a concealer, but for minor imperfections or discoloration, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I use it all year long for oily skin control.  </li>
            <li> You may have to do some touch up later in the day because it sinks into the pore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired has been able to accomplish what Pores No More</li>
            <li> One thing that did surprise me was that it is tinted not clear.</li>
            <li> But it does not last long, very possibly due to the oiliness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> To test, I put some on the back of one hand and then compared them to each other</li>
            <li> MY SKIN JUST TURNED DRY AND FLAKING</li>
            <li> No More\\&quot; is the first product I&#x27;ve found that seems to slow down oil production.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make your pores smaller, it helps tame the shine</li>
            <li> I looked like I have white or dark pits in my face.  </li>
            <li> They did make my pores slightly smaller though, which doesn&#x27;t mean much to me because dirt is still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> The REALLY big pores in between my eyebrows just get a bit less noticeable, but they are practically craters, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I was doing my makeup and after applying the pore refiner I looked in the mirror and thought omg!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t overly like is it needs to be re-applied a few times in a day.  </li>
            <li> , it is little round pads of cotton already saturated with the solution) and run the pad over my already cleansed face, and then I put a few drops of Avon&#x27;s Resurfacing Liquid (again, I don&#x27;t remember the exact name, but it&#x27;s a little glass/silvery bottle with dropper).  </li>
            <li> Actually, it only take a very small amount and with the back of my fingernail</li>
            <li> It was quite pricey for such a small tube, and I expected a lot from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You get a matte finish and it does hide those small pin holes from long ago acne.</li>
            <li> After only 3 days, I was SHOCKED at how my pores next to my nose were nearly nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> The negative is that you can only use about half of the tube as it no longer pumps.  </li>
            <li> Although I read rave reviews about this product (not Amazon reviews; just general reviews through Google and Yahoo, etc.), I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t perform any miracles with my large pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely prefer no smell or a regular makeup-like scent to this weird one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face ends up looking slightly oily and pores show up.  </li>
            <li> do have slightly oily skin, but not oily where it should look like it ends up looking, wish I could find the answer.  </li>
            <li> for the pore minimizing claims - there is a slightly noticeable difference when I put the product on one side of my face.  </li>
            <li> This is simply too expensive to use regularly...</li>
            <li> , it smoothed my skin slightly.</li>
            <li> I use it on errand days all by itself with a little blush.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, it smells a little funky, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> A rip off and a waste of the $40</li>
            <li> and it destroyed my face for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I JUST WASTED MY MONEY</li>
            <li> I would  see a difference but just using the pores no more was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> When I applied a thin layer to my skin, I noticed in the areas where I have some acne scarring, it sat in my scars and looked like I had white dots all over my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> She says it is all down to Dr. Brandt pours no more.</li>
            <li> and I mean not one other pore refiner/</li>
            <li> No More vacuum cleaner (2x/week) and cleanser (every other day) for about a month, but sadly those did not remove my blackheads.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of the product.</li>
            <li> No More Pore Refiner this summer</li>
            <li> No More Pore Refiner with makeup to cover my blackheads because I had a summer job</li>
            <li> Usually blotting my nose will somewhat revitalize the look, so I still like the product.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 10th purchase of PORES NO MORE, although I haven&#x27;t purchased all of them here.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to try pores no more.  </li>
            <li> No More, but</li>
            <li> THIS NO MORE PORE REFINER WAS IN MY IPSY BAG</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it smells a bit weird</li>
            <li> My husband calls it my \\&quot;Speckling Compound\\&quot; and he is not far from wrong.  </li>
            <li> Hard to explain...</li>
            <li> I am telling anyone and everyone who has complained about their pores to me about this combo.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not as thick as the primer</li>
            <li> No More!  </li>
            <li> my pores look so small!</li>
            <li> I have used alternates but simply not as good as this product.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a moisturizer around my mouth and nose area to get rid of the scaley and unhealthy look</li>
            <li> My GF uses this as a base to refine her pours and she simply raves about it.</li>
            <li> It was to drying and made my pores look worse.</li>
            <li> I hate buying and trying things that don&#x27;t work only to throw them out.</li>
            <li> for all users: I hate wasting product, and in this case, there is still a LOT left after the tube stops pumping.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> After $45.00 I was very disappointed that it worked no better than Olay pore vanisher.  </li>
            <li> While I know that&#x27;s impossible, \\&quot;Pores</li>
            <li> /&gt;#2 - it smells sort of bad - a bit chemically.</li>
            <li> And my pores are not even that bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S THE WORST EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it wasn&#x27;t horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got a sample from ipsy bag and i love it! At first i didnt notice how well this product works until i wore my makeup without it, big different. I dont have big pores but my foundation and powder last all day (12 hours) also my bronzer, blush and brow shadow. And it did eliminates fine lines. Will buy it again until i can find a cheaper primer that can do the same.</li>
            <li> Wow - I think this stuff is magic!  I have pretty big pores, and this seriously just makes them disappear.  I wish I could use it as a whole face foundation!!</li>
            <li> I only buy this product to wear my make up.!!!! I don&#x27;t have much money but when I do. This is what I buy. The best ever as far as primer is concerned !!! Can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of Clinique and smashbox, but I found dr. brandt&#x27;s to be the best for me.  It was smooth. not greasy, stayed on all day, and covered the pores the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Not only does it make your pores smaller, it helps tame the shine plus I use consealer only (no foundation) which is kind of thick and it helps to smooth it out ,making it easier to apply! I have large pores on my nose, 2 were so big someone actully asked me if I had my nose pierced! Well they are no longer visible thanks to this product! Like so many of u, I have tried countless products to shrink my pores &amp; control shine, and am happy to have finally ended my search :) It does help to shrink them permenently over time, and it can wear off during the day, but Ill gladly pay the money for this miracle worker!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of all the great reviews. I have combination skin and wanted to target my T-zone area that has some larger pores from teenage years. My skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, but from just a 2 days of using this, my skin started to DRY OUT and react as though I had a severe sunburn!!!! I only used it just 1x a day in the evenings too. Over a weekend, I had to do multiple alone / and Clinique Moisture Surge masks to heal my skin! Even after that weekend, my skin peeled off/flaked off for days after (like sunburn recovery). I&#x27;ve also used Clinique&#x27;s Pore Refining Solutions with much better results, though I still don&#x27;t use it daily. Maybe this is more for oily skin types? Proceed with caution!</li>
            <li> This product is similar to applying chalk to your skin.  It left my skin with chalky and flakey appearance.  I had to use a moisturizer around my mouth and nose area to get rid of the scaley and unhealthy look it left.  I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend it to anyone.  A rip off and a waste of the $40+ dollars I paid.</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed some of this out of the tube I was a bit concerned for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - its tinted. I didn&#x27;t know that when I bought it and I am very fair-skinned, so tinted usually means streaky and Jersey Shore-ish in the face for me, so I tend to avoid tinted products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - it smells sort of bad - a bit chemically. Hard to explain... I&#x27;d definitely prefer no smell or a regular makeup-like scent to this weird one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it a go. After rubbing it in - the tint actually wasn&#x27;t even apparent on my skin. It definitely softened the appearance of my pores - for certain. To test, I put some on the back of one hand and then compared them to each other and you could definitely see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face before work while getting ready and it made my skin look so nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all - it didn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - here&#x27;s the drawback. By the time I got into my car to head off to work, I looked in the mirror and my skin was all dried-out looking!! Like.. really, really dried-out. I had to go back inside and add some moisturizer before I could leave because it was actually to the point of instantly flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely dried-out my skin - and FAST. So, make sure you&#x27;re using a good moisturizer before you put it on (and maybe spray your face with a &amp;#34;makeup setter&amp;#34; after you&#x27;ve finished - before you head out (that def. helped too! I use this &amp;#34;rose water&amp;#34; stuff that is really inexpensive and all-natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works very well for making my skin look more smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Pores No More Pore Refiner this summer when I was experimenting with ways to cover the blackheads on my nose. After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller AND I had much fewer blackheads!! Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).   I used the Pores No More Pore Refiner with makeup to cover my blackheads because I had a summer job. I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so when I stopped using the Pore Refiner I saw that my blackheads and pores reappeared.  Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores No More vacuum cleaner (2x/week) and cleanser (every other day) for about a month, but sadly those did not remove my blackheads. They did make my pores slightly smaller though, which doesn&#x27;t mean much to me because dirt is still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product for those with acne scars. It goes on smooth and can be worn alone or with makeup. After using it once, I won&#x27;t leave the house without it. It&#x27;s not a concealer, but for minor imperfections or discoloration, it works wonders. And it does not cause acne, which is huge concern for me. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The best pore minimized!</li>
            <li> I have very large, deep pores on my nose. When I first apply this product, it does indeed make my pores look smaller and less noticeable. Not invisible, mind you, but better. However, the effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and I can&#x27;t run to the ladies room every 2 hours and reapply. Usually blotting my nose will somewhat revitalize the look, so I still like the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks under my makeup. It has a light beige color. It feels like silk when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Loved this for the first few weeks, but I fell asleep with it on once (I know!) and it destroyed my face for a few weeks. Also, no SPF.</li>
            <li> Great purchase at a lower price. I have used this product for years.  I will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I never go without it! Makes my face so smooth looking!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and getting older.  This product works great for reducing pores and setting foundation.  I never knew this would make such a difference or I would have bought it years ago!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought this and I am pretty happy with it. I can definitely tell a difference when I put this stuff on. it improves the look of my complexion and prevents my face from becoming shiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine NOT using this amazing product. it is worth every penny. I have turned on my sister to it and anyone else who will listen. If I could afford to buy it by the case, I would. :-)</li>
            <li> This product does &#x27;spackle&#x27; to fill in/level pores the best. When I used it under makeup, I found it disappeared or was displaced when I applied my BB cream/etc over top. Now, I use the Bobbi Brown primer over Obagi sunscreen, under the Bobbi Brown BB cream (or Laura Mercier tinted sunscreen/moisturizer), then concealer, THEN this product just on tricky pore areas. Then a light dusting of powder. Perfection.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. I dont wear powder or foundation because my skin is sensitive. so this is perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used when trying to achieve great coverage for my pores.  It dispenses as a silky smooth light cream and has a slight hint of color for a natural look. My daughter and I have been using this particular product for over a year now and we are completely hooked because of the wonderful coverage and the difference it makes in diminishing our pores!! We achieve such a smooth natural finish, a small amount goes a long way, and we can use a little more during our day just to freshen-up our \\&quot;look\\&quot;! It truly does perform its magic in shrinking our pores and makes us look like a \\&quot;million bucks\\&quot;!! We love this product and I am certain you will to if you would just give it a try!! So, go ahead, take the plunge and experience the magic!! Thank you Dr. Brandt for \\&quot;Pores No More!\\&quot; and for giving me back the confidence I lacked when it came to my appearance.</li>
            <li> NOTHING, and I mean not one other pore refiner/primer I&#x27;ve tired has been able to accomplish what Pores No More has. I have excessively oily skin and until this products was never able to make my makeup last more than a few hours after application. Now because of this product I can literally go the entire day (8 hours +) without needing a single touchup and my makeup looking as great as it did when I leave the house in the morning. Also makes my foundation glide on effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years now &amp; I Love it!!!  I&#x27;ve tried many top name primers, nothing makes my face foundation ready as well as Dr Brandt Pores No More!  I use it on errand days all by itself with a little blush.  I highly recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I had gotten a sample and fell in love. The best thing about it is you can put in under OR over your makeup!! I have very large pores and a dermatologist recommended I spend $100+ on their products if I want them to appear smaller (remember, you can&#x27;t shrink you&#x27;re pores, only make them LOOK smaller). Well fast forward a few years and I started getting interested in make-up and decided to join one of those monthly glam-bag clubs. One of the samples was for this product and upon my first use, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but it did make my skin super-soft, so I kept using every day. A few days later I was doing my makeup and after applying the pore refiner I looked in the mirror and thought omg! my pores look so small! Then I realized the pore refiner must be working, as I hadn&#x27;t used anything different.  If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, the bottle or instructions (or somewhere) indicated that the product is supposed to work instantly and doesn&#x27;t have continuing results, but in my experience, this product works best if used every day and takes a few days of use before noticing any drastic results. I originally bought this product directly from Dr. Brandt&#x27;s website because it came with a free sample size as well, but I think they discontinued doing that so it makes more sense to purchase here on Amazon for the same price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> A great product will order again, covers pores an makes skin look smooth. this product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY ANY ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER-PAYLESS BEAUTY. THEY DON&#x27;T ACCEPT RETURNS AND I PAID $40 SOMETHING FOR THIS GARBAGE AND NOW THEY ARE SELLING $30. WTH! MY SKIN JUST TURNED DRY AND FLAKING AS SOON AS I PUT IT ON. I TRIED TO RETURN BUT REJECTED BY THIS SELLER SINCE IT&#x27;S USED AND SKIN CARE ITEMS. THIS ITEM DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A SEAL AND SKIN CARE ITEMS SHOULD BE RETURNED IF THEY MAKE ANY IRRITATIONS ON YOUR SKIN. I JUST WASTED MY MONEY AND IT&#x27;S THE WORST EXPERIENCE AT AMAZON AND AT ANY PLACE SO FAR.</li>
            <li> I love this product! it really does make your pores look smaller and it doesn&#x27;t shine.</li>
            <li> My GF uses this as a base to refine her pours and she simply raves about it. She is constantly getting comments on her skin and makeup. She says it is all down to Dr. Brandt pours no more.</li>
            <li> This does not work as described.  Complete waste of money.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had read some good reviews about this product  so I bought it. But didn&#x27;t work for me. It was to drying and made my pores look worse. And my pores are not even that bad.Definitely did not do what it states.  I do not recommend this product. I got it on time so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m even giving it any stars at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many primers and stuff that claim to minimize pores &amp; this is the best product that does minimize pores that ive tried! You use it after you do your makeup. I use it when done and go near a window w a mirror and dab it on w a finger to any obvious crevice and blend with a fingertip and blot til natural. This is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I only use Dr. Brandt&#x27;s Pores no More and mascara in the summer months for a polished natural look.  I use it all year long for oily skin control.  I make sure I never run out.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great base to apply under foundation.</li>
            <li> i have had problems iwth pores and oily face since i can remember , i absolutely love the texture that I get when I use the cream. it is not miracle my pores are still there but they are not as visible and it keeps my skin from getting oily . it is very light and a little bit goes a long way !  i will buy it again !!</li>
            <li> Best pore coverage that does the great job, not completely pore no more but its the best one out there</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing to control my shine or diminish the look of my pores.  It feels good on my skin but that&#x27;s about the sum of it.  Do not buy this products with any expectations of having it diminish large pores or oily skin!</li>
            <li> Love this refiner..it helps my foundation stay on longer and smoother...I wear it over the&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Brandt Mattifying lotion and it gives me good results..Would recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Ipsy (I got the tinted one) and I&#x27;m hooked.  I had previously been using Pixi Flawless &amp; Poreless and was really happy with the way it worked, but it only made my pores less noticeable.  This stuff kicks its butt!  I take just a teensy bit and sort of rub it upwards over the large pores on my cheeks and beside my mouth and they absolutely disappear.  The REALLY big pores in between my eyebrows just get a bit less noticeable, but they are practically craters, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I am super pale, and was worried about it being tinted, but the color disappears once you put it on your skin.  The only thing I am not fond of is the smell.  It sort of smells medicine-y to me.  But since it&#x27;s from a brand that calls itself &amp;#34;DOCTOR&amp;#34; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  This refiner smooths over the surface of the skin to allow makeup to enhance the face and not settle in the pores.  Needs to be part of any makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for five years.  Works well summer or winter-dry or humid. Try one tube tor yourself and decide.</li>
            <li> It does really work, after application, your pores disappear making your face look smooth and flawless.  The only thing I don&#x27;t overly like is it needs to be re-applied a few times in a day.  My face ends up looking slightly oily and pores show up.  I don&#x27;t want to apply too much and look like its caked on so its a process of wiping off whats there and re-applying, so starting over just about.&lt;br /&gt;I do have slightly oily skin, but not oily where it should look like it ends up looking, wish I could find the answer.  I gave it 5 stars because like I said it works, I&#x27;m still looking for the no more oily answer :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, can&#x27;t find anything else like it. It&#x27;s my make-up staple.</li>
            <li> I had a sample size of this and then bought it. It&#x27;s fantastic. I have oily skin and nothing really mattifies it, but this comes close. I use it over my Elta MD Tinted SPF 41 sunblock. I don&#x27;t have to use liquid or cream foundation anymore. Just mineral powder foundation and I get a natural, smooth and  easy coverage. Dr. Brandt&#x27;s item is very pricey and that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5*. I hate buying and trying things that don&#x27;t work only to throw them out. Nothing really makes your pores smaller, but I find my makeup looks much better after using these two  products.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it every day and it stops my make up from dissolving throughout the day/absorbing into my skin. Also creates a silky smooth texture to my skin, making foundation application super easy!</li>
            <li> Super!  Makes a smooth almost flawless base for makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product - keeps my face from getting shiny - great item!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Expensive yes! This is one of those items you get what you pay for. If you have skin where a hole is left when you remove a blackhead this is what you want. It does not clog the pore it just fills it in and makes it disappear till you clean your face. It is the best I have ever found. No breakouts from this. Just does what it says it will do. It does not cure the problem it just covers it till you remove it. Wonderful stuff if you have holes for scars.</li>
            <li> Really like this pores refiner.  I have bought a few of these and what makes this stand out even more is the nice tint to it and how silky it feels going on.  Does a nice job minimizing pores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite make up  like the matte finish</li>
            <li> covers my pores and keeps me from being shiny. love, love, love! and i have VERY LARGE PORES AND SHINY SKIN! HUGE HELP!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product in store paying almost twice as much. This is the same exact product for a fraction of the cost. I recommend it highly. It works great, you only need a very little and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I buy this product over and over.... This is probably my 10th purchase of PORES NO MORE, although I haven&#x27;t purchased all of them here. I haven&#x27;t found anything that hides my pores as well as this product does. I am a skin care specialist. A product-junkie. This isn&#x27;t a CURE. This is a COVER-UP.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this (I usually don&#x27;t for what sounds like miracle cures) but this stuff is great.  As soon as you put it on you can tell it adds sort of a colorless powdery &#x27;anti-sheen&#x27; to your skin.  So it&#x27;s great at creating a matte finish but also making pores less visible. Some areas I can just lightly smear it on, other areas I need to rub it in a bit more but either way it&#x27;s great.  A little also goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth the money. My only complaint is that it smells a bit weird but the smell dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I often question the miraculous claims of beauty products, as I&#x27;m sure most of you do.  \\&quot;Pores No More\\&quot; had a catchy name, but its pore minimizing properties was not what most attracted me.  It was its oil-reducing claim.  I am one of those people who was...uhhhh... \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with skin that is very oil while also having dryness, flakes, and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address the oiliness, I use oil blotting papers throughout the day.  They are a true wonder, but there are times when you&#x27;re in public and you just can&#x27;t whip these things out.  Besides, I&#x27;d rather just not get oily in the first place.  While I know that&#x27;s impossible, \\&quot;Pores No More\\&quot; is the first product I&#x27;ve found that seems to slow down oil production.  I can tell because I now use fewer blotters each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pore minimizing claims - there is a slightly noticeable difference when I put the product on one side of my face.  But it does not last long, very possibly due to the oiliness of my skin.  Others with less oily skin may have better, longer-lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for new users: A little goes a long way. Try just one or two little pumps until you see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for all users: I hate wasting product, and in this case, there is still a LOT left after the tube stops pumping.  I cut the tube open on a diagonal with scissors and use my fingers to scoop it out.  I can get weeks more of additional use like this.  You could put the remaining product in a travel pot to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go out in public without it</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose.  I have tried a lot of products.  After reading reviews I decided to try pores no more.  After $45.00 I was very disappointed that it worked no better than Olay pore vanisher.  I don&#x27;t know if I used the whole system I would  see a difference but just using the pores no more was not worth it.  Going to try what one reviewer suggested with the avon products.  I will uodate and let you know how that works.  I had high hopes...try, try again.</li>
            <li> I have battled my pores since adolescence. I have tried ALL the foundations, highlighters, neitralizers, brighteners, cleansers, masks... Jesus Christ, so many bottles and jars that did NOTHING. I blanched at the price of Pores No More, but it was WORTH IT. It works! It works. Hallelujah, it works. My speckled T-zone becomes a blurry, airbrushed porcelain finish. I don&#x27;t use it with foundation. It&#x27;s just flawless on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my cranky, ginger complexion. Hasn&#x27;t made me break-out like everything else does. Wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago!</li>
            <li> I like this product it gives my skin a smooth look I use it sometime alone and the under my makeup smooths out my skin</li>
            <li> This is simply too expensive to use regularly...but I love the effect.</li>
            <li> Advertises to minimize pores, but it doesn&#x27;t!  I have large pores, my pores look the same after applying this product.  It does leave my skin silky, but that is not why I purchased the product.  Pores, yes I still see my pores as large as ever.</li>
            <li> OMG! This product is amazing. It instantly made my pores look smaller. When you apply your makeup on over it, it looks smooth and flawless. One thing that did surprise me was that it is tinted not clear. Highly recommend!!! The first photo is with the product on. Wish the pictures were better.</li>
            <li> This product will get right into your pores and cover them and it gives you a smooth look. You may have to do some touch up later in the day because it sinks into the pore.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this product, I highley recommend it!! It last along time you only need alittle! I have big pores as I get older and it really covered worh the price!</li>
            <li> Because of my oily skin and large pores I always had to search high and low to find a foundation the absolute perfect color or else I looked like I have white or dark pits in my face.  Six years ago I began using Bare Minerals.  Why oh why wasn&#x27;t this around 40 years ago?  After trying Pores No More three years ago, I have found the perfect solution.  My husband calls it my \\&quot;Speckling Compound\\&quot; and he is not far from wrong.  Actually, it only take a very small amount and with the back of my fingernail I push it into all the places I want to hide.  Then I use my Bare Minerals Fairly Medium powder and I&#x27;m good to go - when I bother to wear make up.  I&#x27;m still using the second of two 0.5 oz tubes I bought three years ago.  I like the smaller sample tubes.  This stuff really hides the pores.  Don&#x27;t use too much.  I still have to blot my face with a Viva paper towel every hour or two but it takes the shine away.  My dentist asked me if I was alright when I blotted my face in the dentist chair recently and I assured him (and his assistant) that I was only suffering a mild case of the vapors.  We all had a good time that day.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as a good primer, and even can work on super-light skin. When the bottle gets older, you need to mix it up (because it separates).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I got some in my Ipsy bag and decided I needed a full tube of it almost immediately.  It smooths wrinkles and bumps and almost completely gets rid of all of your pores. I will often use it as a base/concealer/foundation substitute with nothing else on top, or with just a pressed powder over it if I want full coverage. Admittedly, it smells a little funky, but nothing unbearable. I will gladly tell anyone who listens about this miracle product!</li>
            <li> If its closed pores you want then this product really isnt for you. Its a lovely light silky texture that works well as a very light foundation but thats about it. I have tried many products at all kinds of price ranges and have to agree with the specialists.....nothing closes open pores. Stay out of the sun, use a cleansing and moisterising regime that suits your skin type and always wear an SPF and thats all anyone can do untill a real breakthro is made .</li>
            <li> It works but pricy.  I have used alternates but simply not as good as this product.  Pores are a real issue with aging men, so I am very cautious what I put on this aging face.</li>
            <li> It works on me very well, and really fast shipping:) will buy it again:) thanks.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.  Do not need to use much for great coverage.  The negative is that you can only use about half of the tube as it no longer pumps.  I cut the end off to see how much was left and it was a significant amount.</li>
            <li> I like it, gives somewhat of an airbrush effect. Last time I wore it, my friends told me I looked younger.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never find a product like this and it&#x27;s worth every penny!  I found it 2 years ago and nothing else compares to its quality.</li>
            <li> I found this item in a magazine as the best for hiding lines/pock marks/etc. It really does work. You get a matte finish and it does hide those small pin holes from long ago acne. I also use it around my lips for the laugh line crevices...okay, wrinkles. I highly recommend this product and will use it forever!</li>
            <li> I have huge pores so I have tried many pores reducing primers, creams.  None of them work like this one.  It goes on smooth, reduces the look of the pores.  Love this stuff. I have been using it for 3 years.  Now that the price has come down a bit, I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works any better than a biore strip and would not waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition. Better price than the local store. This product makes pores disappear. My skin looks very smooth. This is better than the Too Faced brand pore stuff and the Bare minerals brand pore stuff and the  Smashbox brand primer. I had a very good experience.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have been looking for a good primer for soooo long and I am so happy I found this one. A friend of mine recommended it to me and she gave me a sample and I fell in love with it since then. I was not necessarily looking for something to hide pores, but something to help mattify my face. I have oily/combination skin and finding a good primer has always been a hassle for me. I was always looking for a primer to help control the oil I get on my T-zone. If you want a product that will make your makeup look great all day this is the ONE! I do not need to touch up my face at all as my makeup still looks fresh even after 8 hours or longer. Yes, this product is a bit pricey but it is totally worth it. And a little goes a long way! So this tube will probably last me about a year!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years now, it&#x27;s great &amp; I will buy it again. Makes my skin look smoother</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Flawless look</li>
            <li> The way this is marketed you think one application would give you some airbrushed look. It does not!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if with long term use that will improve but so far, its little more than a mattifying cream.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and silky my skin is after using this. It makes my skin look flawless. I live in WY where it&#x27;s super dry, and have found it works even better over day cream.</li>
            <li> Great product, will be buying more in future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Way cheaper than the stores and I received it pretty quickly. Great as a primer before your make up, great to matte oily skin. Will order again when I run low on dr brandts.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose. This product is incredible at making them disappear!  The tint blends perfectly with my skin, the products is lightweight and goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Has a nice feel, goes on smoothly.  Works fairly well, again, not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great product. reduces pore size. I have very light skin and it adds no color to my skin. Provides a nice matte finish which lasts about 5-6 hours for me on a work day (depending on temperature, humidity, etc,).</li>
            <li> ALL OF MY PURCHASES ON AMAZON ARE GREAT. FLAWLESS.  THIS NO MORE PORE REFINER WAS IN MY IPSY BAG AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE COMPLEXION &amp;#34;LOOK&amp;#34; AND NO BREAKOUTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CINDY G</li>
            <li> Although I read rave reviews about this product (not Amazon reviews; just general reviews through Google and Yahoo, etc.), I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t perform any miracles with my large pores.  It was quite pricey for such a small tube, and I expected a lot from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, for those of you who have large pores (mine are mainly on my cheeks next to my nose; I&#x27;m half asian with oily skin), I finally did find an AMAZING product (two products, together, actually), that work to reduce almost completely the appearance of my huge pores.  I bought Avon&#x27;s Retexturizing Glycolic Peels (or something like that, it is little round pads of cotton already saturated with the solution) and run the pad over my already cleansed face, and then I put a few drops of Avon&#x27;s Resurfacing Liquid (again, I don&#x27;t remember the exact name, but it&#x27;s a little glass/silvery bottle with dropper).  After only 3 days, I was SHOCKED at how my pores next to my nose were nearly nonexistent.  It&#x27;s crazy.  I found that going through Amazon rather than an Avon rep made the products much cheaper, as well.  I am telling anyone and everyone who has complained about their pores to me about this combo.  I have searched for YEARS and spent so much money on a solution, and finally have it.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn&#x27;t horrible, it smoothed my skin slightly. When I applied a thin layer to my skin, I noticed in the areas where I have some acne scarring, it sat in my scars and looked like I had white dots all over my face. It also made my skin oily.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and makes my face feel very silky</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write product reviews but this product is amazing! I am in my 40&#x27;s have always had super oily skin tried every product from cheap to expensive and have never found a product that keeps me shine free for more than a half hour until now. This product keeps my skin shine free for hours ! So if your looking for oil/shine control buy this product. A few things to mention it does have a light color to it making my skin appear pale nothing bronzer cant fix and as far as minimizing pores for me I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in that.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my 43 year old face and it still does not work on my 44 year old face!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. Covers pores very well.</li>
            <li> I like this product! It takes very little of the product. I put it on my forehead for no shine &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the same product I recently got in a beauty bag sample. This is Pore refiner; the product I sampled is Pore Refiner PRIMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference? This product goes on lighter, has a slightly different smell and texture than the primer. While the primer looks more gel based, this product is more of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results from both are very similar. Pores are refined, skin is mattified and makeup goes on smoother with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up keeping this product. Even though it&#x27;s not as thick as the primer it does a nice job for every day. I will still use the primer for days where I need a little more coverage from my makeup.</li>
