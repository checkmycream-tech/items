    <ol>
            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>The largest one is best for home or office, as they can break if it is in your purse.  </li>
            <li>And these get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful and work great.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t want to share with my daughter, which was the original thought!</li>
            <li>But if they had made it to me in one piece, I would have really loved these files</li>
            <li>it is a good thing to buy.</li>
            <li>This are so awesome &amp; worth the price .</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>These nail files are amazing.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t realize how nice it was to use glass nail files, but now I want to get another set.</li>
            <li>Love these glass files and I love all cheeky products.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more for sure</li>
            <li>These glad files glide on your nail tips while filing</li>
            <li>They are so much better for your nails compared to metal files or emery boards.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love these.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>they really work good.</li>
            <li>But for nails they are fantastic, they don&#x27;t get worn out and leave a nice clean smooth</li>
            <li>This is my first time to order and use glad files!</li>
            <li>She liked it very much.</li>
            <li>They are easy to maintain and leave your nails smooth.</li>
            <li>the cheap disposable files work just fine.</li>
            <li>They leave the tip of my nails smooth and get off everything that isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I got these in today, very fast delivery, and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>The nail art is great but delivery  was way too long</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait and price though.</li>
            <li>I own several of these files.  </li>
            <li>However it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li>When she received it, she said it was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>These are the first glass files I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>This product is way better than the traditional nail file.</li>
            <li>I never use any other kind of file.</li>
            <li>One side of the large file is smooth but the two smaller ones appear to be ground on both sides.</li>
            <li>They were not broken as some have said.</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Some areas are pretty rough followed by perfectly smooth areas.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another file as long as these are available.</li>
            <li>The small ones are so handy to throw in your purse.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth my time or money to ship them back to get a refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m coming right back here</li>
            <li>The Files are beautiful, but the shipment I got came in with 2 of them broken in half.</li>

            <li> took a long time to get here (about a month) but that was expected as they came overseas.</li>

            <li> The files are unevenly ground.</li>
            <li> and if you can wait, inexpensive to have a small one to carry and two to keep at home - with a replacement if one breaks.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> I waited quite some time for these and 2 out of the 3 files were broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> horrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect.  everything as promised.  Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Love these glass files and I love all cheeky products. These are wonderful and work great. I will purchase more for sure</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a crystal file to remove callouses from your feet, this is not what you want, the crystals simply aren&#x27;t coarse enough. Unfortunately that is what I was looking for. But for nails they are fantastic, they don&#x27;t get worn out and leave a nice clean smooth edge.&lt;br /&gt;They took a long time to get here (about a month) but that was expected as they came overseas. They were not broken as some have said. Well worth the wait and price though.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to order and use glad files! I got these in today, very fast delivery, and I&#x27;m in love. I will never go back to an emery board again! These glad files glide on your nail tips while filing and there are no tears on my nails! I&#x27;m hoping to improve my nails between using these files and using a nail strengthener so that my nails will grow again. I am very happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t want to share with my daughter, which was the original thought! Lol</li>
            <li> I own several of these files.  The small ones are so handy to throw in your purse.  The largest one is best for home or office, as they can break if it is in your purse.  They are so much better for your nails compared to metal files or emery boards.  I never use any other kind of file.</li>
            <li> after waiting a month for it, when i opened the packege two of the three nail files came broked. it was a waist</li>
            <li> I must admit; delivery took way longer than expected. However it was well worth the wait. I&#x27;m a man and like to keep my nails short and neat. And these get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Plus they&#x27;re pretty. Took a bit too get  here though, forgot I even ordered them</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I waited quite some time for these and 2 out of the 3 files were broken. I guess you get what you pay for, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> horrible product. Will never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The Files are beautiful, but the shipment I got came in with 2 of them broken in half. They were shipped from China or something so I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth my time or money to ship them back to get a refund. I was really dissapointed. But if they had made it to me in one piece, I would have really loved these files</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my sister. When she received it, she said it was exactly what she was looking for. She liked it very much.</li>
            <li> They work great.  Just wash and use again. Have not dulled yet.</li>
            <li> The files are unevenly ground. Some areas are pretty rough followed by perfectly smooth areas. One side of the large file is smooth but the two smaller ones appear to be ground on both sides. These are the first glass files I&#x27;ve used so I can&#x27;t compare them to anything but for the price...the cheap disposable files work just fine. I probably won&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The nail art is great but delivery  was way too long</li>
            <li> I will never buy another file as long as these are available.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these. They leave the tip of my nails smooth and get off everything that isn&#x27;t. This product is way better than the traditional nail file. This is a definite must have for ANYONE who does their nails. Whether you keep your nails simple or you decorate them you will be ecstatic you took this advice n bought these. If n when I need to replace these I&#x27;m coming right back here n placing another order.</li>
            <li> This seller did warn that &#x27;regular&#x27; delivery took a while, but I&#x27;d almost forgotten I&#x27;d ordered them by the time they came. They are in individual plastic covers, but of course that doesn&#x27;t protect from breakage. On the other hand, they are glass nail files that work well and if you can wait, inexpensive to have a small one to carry and two to keep at home - with a replacement if one breaks.</li>
            <li> they really work good. it is a good thing to buy. that is all that I use.thanks for them is all</li>
            <li> This are so awesome &amp; worth the price . I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Glass files are my number one choice to use on my nails. I like the different sizes. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> These nail files are amazing. i didn&#x27;t realize how nice it was to use glass nail files, but now I want to get another set. They are easy to maintain and leave your nails smooth. With every stroke of the file on my nail, I can see the shaping and smoothing done. These files require fewer strokes to fix a nick, or to shape your nail. I wish I had known about these sooner.</li>
