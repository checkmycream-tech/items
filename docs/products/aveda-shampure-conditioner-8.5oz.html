            <li>I love Aveda conditioner (and also the blue shampoo), the best part is that they are free from animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I also love all AVEDA hair products, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love the scent so much, I&#x27;ve used a dollop here and there as a body wash.</li>

            <li>The scent is high end and intoxicating.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft and i would definitely buy it and recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Other positives are that they keep my hair shiny, manageable, and split end free.  </li>
            <li>I can completely understand the obsession with the Shampure products.</li>

            <li> but i gave it three due to the mishap.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very tangled and it&#x27;s difficult to get a comb through it.  </li>

            <li> Still a very good product.</li>
            <li> A bit of a heavy odor, otherwise leaves hair shiny, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love the smell!!! I also love all AVEDA hair products, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair had tons of bounce after using this! It wasnt really slippery when I applied it to my wet hair, so I was a little skeptical at first...but once my hair dried, it was really in great shape. Luscious waves and a delicious fragrance. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I started using this shampoo as recommended by our stylist.  It leaves hair very tangled and it&#x27;s difficult to get a comb through it.  I will use what I have (in conjunction with another conditioner because my poor daughter&#x27;s head can only take so much) and then I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> the smell is awesome!! it makes my hair super soft and i would definitely buy it and recommend it to anyone!</li>

            <li> I bought this product because I was expecting a great smelling shampoo and conditioner. They both have a unpleasent odor. Not happy with the product from this seller. Will use the Aveda website next time.</li>
            <li> Love the Aveda Hairspray so tried the Shampoo and Conditioner. The Shampoo was ok but the Conditioner felt like it didn&#x27;t do anything my hair was very hard to comb through every time after using.  Probably will not purchased again.</li>
            <li> Love Shampure - hands down</li>
            <li> I have always loved this shampoo. I like how my hair feels and smells after!</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner, a little heavy for my hair so I would choose a lighter Aveda conditioner in the future.</li>
            <li> I can completely understand the obsession with the Shampure products. The scent is high end and intoxicating. Although I&#x27;d ordered the CONDITIONER, I actually received the SHAMPOO. I&#x27;m laid back about things like this. Since I&#x27;d never used an Aveda product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Shampoo is very clean--and low-sudsing. It rinses really well without residue or buildup. I love the scent so much, I&#x27;ve used a dollop here and there as a body wash. It works great and the smell is divine. I&#x27;m going to order again--but from a different supplier. Just because you get a lower price, doesn&#x27;t always mean you&#x27;re getting what you ordered. However--I&#x27;ll be a regular Aveda user now. Its definitely a FIVE STAR PRODUCT, but i gave it three due to the mishap. Hopefully next time I&#x27;ll actually get the conditioner, LOL!</li>
            <li> love the smell and how it cleans my hair without drying it out and weighing it down.</li>
