            <li>Feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with my acne on my face and made my oily skin even more oily, but it does wonders for my back-acne!!</li>
            <li>Good, but the seller took a lot of time ti shipped</li>
            <li>but it still is a good wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle to your skin and it makes your skin flawless and beautiful! :)</li>

            <li>The customer service was amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>but it smells nice, and feels nice on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice, too~</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective this is against it</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars and not  5 because it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and so clean after I used this foaming soap.</li>
            <li>It works great and my face has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good cleanser to easily foam up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suitable for oily and acne skin.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been going into my skin much more effectively.</li>
            <li>Best product i&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>I actually love it.</li>
            <li>figure out more on where I stand about</li>
            <li>This is a more affordable one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you but let me just tell you this, &amp;#34;YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really help my acne (when I have it) or prevent it greatly.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the more expesive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li>Lovely face cleaner</li>
            <li>I love this acne foam cleanser.</li>
            <li>But, all in all, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am super glad that I did!</li>
            <li>It always feels very clean after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally tried it while I was in Korea and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>When I first got this product and use it, I instantly felt my skin smoother, and felt my flawless!</li>
            <li>this in the mornings and tretinoin cream at night, plus a diet free from gluten and lactose, my acne was gone in 2 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see what it can bring to my skin while using it for a longer time.</li>
            <li>This cleanser, in combination with Face Shop&#x27;s Clean Face Spot Corrector, has been working so well for me.</li>
            <li>It literally leaves her face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>For foam cleansing to be most effective, you have to massage the foam onto your face for about 3 - 4 minutes until the foam actually starts to fade away.</li>
            <li>It also has a really good lather, so I only use a pea size!</li>
            <li>Though it is good, overall, I would not repurchase it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really quick too.</li>
            <li>Turns out that this one is the most flattered one so far.</li>
            <li>It made his face more clear from Acne Pimples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!!!I had tried other products but the results have not been anywhere as good as this.</li>
            <li>This product gives me more outbreaks of which I have not dry but does not help me to improve it, buy two cans thinking it would help me, since I read very positive reviews, now I have to use it out of obligation.</li>
            <li>When i first used it, I really liked it because my skin felt clean and firm, but it didn&#x27;t help with the acne as I had hoped for it too.</li>
            <li>He told me to order some more for him in the future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and my face really cleared up!</li>
            <li>but I do have enlarged pores so my skin can get oily during hot weather.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Starting with the pros, you only need a little to foam up to a nice luxurious lather and the product feels silky smooth, both creamy and light, against the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Then, I heard of thefaceshop and really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my oily skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have acne</li>
            <li>He commented that this product works much better than the more expensive ones that they sell in the department store.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a day (usually at night) to fully remove any makeup or impurities from the day because it lathers up so so much that i can feel my skin get super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works really well specially with the other two , the cream and the toner , they control the oil on ur face</li>
            <li>When I start to get new pimples</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with acne (even adult acne) and combination skin.</li>
            <li>However, if you are not sensitive to these fatty acids, this is a perfectly suitable face wash.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to call this cleanser</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and night, and so far it&#x27;s kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>, i have combination oily skin with a hint of sensitive acne skin.</li>
            <li>My back is almost clear now</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve recently fixed my oily skin problem by treating my pores with various Korean skin products</li>
            <li>; It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my face feeling clean but hydrated, and only requires a small amount.</li>

            <li> , i have combination oily skin with a hint of sensitive acne skin.</li>
            <li> My back is almost clear now</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve recently fixed my oily skin problem by treating my pores with various Korean skin products</li>
            <li> ; It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my face feeling clean but hydrated, and only requires a small amount.</li>
            <li> and it last for such a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The major con of this product for me is that it contains several fatty acids (Myristic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lauric Acid), which are comedogenic for some people, myself included.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on your face for a long time</li>
            <li> tell the difference between it and other products, like American products</li>
            <li> When I am done using this product I will use Egg Pore foam washes or some other foam washes that focus on cleansing pores deeply.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> Unlike the Etude House Acne cleansing foam, this wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry your face and, since I have combo/oily skin, it helps with that too.</li>
            <li> the shipping is quite expensive but the product worth to try.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a herbal scent, somewhat similar to green tea.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way also.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For me came empty box without product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for over four years, and this last year it was worse than ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I already notice a difference from just the few days I have been using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too harsh and I can&#x27;t use it for my face at all</li>
            <li> It cleans the face without leaving it dried out.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad acne skin</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for such a long time, and have previously been very cynical of products out there.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this cleansing in face shop store and it costs 10-15 bucks.</li>
            <li> (i usually just wash my face for 1 minute) because it CAN irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a toner that does the job search no more</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for at least 5 years now.</li>
            <li> though unfortunately it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin feeling a bit tight (coming from someone with horribly oily skin).</li>
            <li> Before use this item I use to have dirty skin</li>
            <li> Worse!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worse!!! For me came empty box without product!!!</li>
            <li> Good, but the seller took a lot of time ti shipped</li>
            <li> It was a great product! I actually love it. Feel great on your skin. the shipping is quite expensive but the product worth to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suitable for oily and acne skin.&lt;br /&gt;Feel refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect product! and nice service as well!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for such a long time, and have previously been very cynical of products out there. This cleanser, in combination with Face Shop&#x27;s Clean Face Spot Corrector, has been working so well for me. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it very long but it smells nice, and feels nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and other products, like American products but I like bottle and how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are in Korean, so beware!&lt;br /&gt;Will figure out more on where I stand about it&#x27;s quality after a week or so of its use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this cleansing in face shop store and it costs 10-15 bucks. This is a more affordable one. The only issue is it might take a month or two for shipping. I would suggest plan your purchase earlier.</li>
            <li> It works really well specially with the other two , the cream and the toner , they control the oil on ur face</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this face wash all the time now. It literally leaves her face squeaky clean. Highly recommend for those with acne (even adult acne) and combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad acne skin and I&#x27;ve been trying some facial washes. I got this yesterday and I was eager to try it. Turns out that this one is the most flattered one so far. Unlike the Etude House Acne cleansing foam, this wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. It has a scent of green tea, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see what it can bring to my skin while using it for a longer time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with my acne on my face and made my oily skin even more oily, but it does wonders for my back-acne!! My back is almost clear now and I&#x27;m really glad. It works because it&#x27;s drying out the pimples which this product is too drying to use for the face, only works for my back.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my son..He said he loves it.  It made his face more clear from Acne Pimples. He commented that this product works much better than the more expensive ones that they sell in the department store.  He often receives compliment from his friends.  He told me to order some more for him in the future.</li>
            <li> What is in this product!? I love it, especially the smell it left after I use it. When I first got this product and use it, I instantly felt my skin smoother, and felt my flawless! I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you but let me just tell you this, &amp;#34;YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!&amp;#34; Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have acne prone skin but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to call this cleanser an &amp;#34;acne solution.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my face feeling clean but hydrated, and only requires a small amount. However, it doesn&#x27;t really help my acne (when I have it) or prevent it greatly. I would recommend this as a solid, every day cleanser but not a life changer</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser! I use it every morning and night, and so far it&#x27;s kept my acne at bay. It smells nice, too~ It also has a really good lather, so I only use a pea size!</li>
            <li> This product works so well! I had tried every American face product that I could find and they would work for a while, but then it would plateau and my face would go back to looking the same way it was before. Then, I heard of thefaceshop and really wanted to try it and I am super glad that I did! I would recommend this to everybody. Just one thing though, it says foaming cleanser, but I haven&#x27;t gotten it to become foam, I&#x27;ve just gotten it smoother and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Better than some of the more expesive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Before use this item I use to have dirty skin but after i wash my face with this now , I have good skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works so well and it last for such a long time! It&#x27;s worth the buy. It&#x27;s gentle to your skin and it makes your skin flawless and beautiful! :)</li>
            <li> I originally tried it while I was in Korea and immediately fell in love with it. This stuff is amazing!!!I had tried other products but the results have not been anywhere as good as this. Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Ive used this product for a while and it&#x27;s a good cleanser to easily foam up.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for at least 5 years now. I purchased this and have been using this for five days now and my face really cleared up! The shipping was really quick too. I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for over four years, and this last year it was worse than ever.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended I tried this product, and so I did; what else did I have to lose.&lt;br /&gt;Using this in the mornings and tretinoin cream at night, plus a diet free from gluten and lactose, my acne was gone in 2 months. Now, I&#x27;m off to deal with scars!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and so clean after I used this foaming soap. The customer service was amazing. I will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li> When i first used it, I really liked it because my skin felt clean and firm, but it didn&#x27;t help with the acne as I had hoped for it too. Though it is good, overall, I would not repurchase it.</li>
            <li> It works really well on my oily skin and I already notice a difference from just the few days I have been using it. It works great and my face has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s too harsh and I can&#x27;t use it for my face at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne so I don&#x27;t know how effective this is against it but I do have enlarged pores so my skin can get oily during hot weather. Foam cleansing is so much healthier for my skin than harsh scrubs so I gave this a try. For foam cleansing to be most effective, you have to massage the foam onto your face for about 3 - 4 minutes until the foam actually starts to fade away. I used to wash after 30 seconds but now I massage for 3 minutes and it&#x27;s been going into my skin much more effectively. It always feels very clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars and not  5 because it&#x27;s effective but I&#x27;ve recently fixed my oily skin problem by treating my pores with various Korean skin products so now I don&#x27;t have any problem with my skin. So this wash is no longer necessary for me but it still is a good wash. When I am done using this product I will use Egg Pore foam washes or some other foam washes that focus on cleansing pores deeply.</li>
            <li> Lovely face cleaner though unfortunately it does not work for me. Starting with the pros, you only need a little to foam up to a nice luxurious lather and the product feels silky smooth, both creamy and light, against the skin. It has a bit of a herbal scent, somewhat similar to green tea. It does leave the skin feeling a bit tight (coming from someone with horribly oily skin). This may not be the product for you if you have drier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major con of this product for me is that it contains several fatty acids (Myristic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lauric Acid), which are comedogenic for some people, myself included. However, if you are not sensitive to these fatty acids, this is a perfectly suitable face wash.</li>
            <li> I use this for my combination acne prone skin and I can&#x27;t go without it. I use it once a day (usually at night) to fully remove any makeup or impurities from the day because it lathers up so so much that i can feel my skin get super clean afterwards. Just don&#x27;t leave it on your face for a long time (i usually just wash my face for 1 minute) because it CAN irritate the skin. A little goes a long way also.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. I even use it on occasion. It cleans the face without leaving it dried out.</li>
            <li> This product gives me more outbreaks of which I have not dry but does not help me to improve it, buy two cans thinking it would help me, since I read very positive reviews, now I have to use it out of obligation. If you want to try, do it this is a recommendation</li>
            <li> I love this acne foam cleanser. When I start to get new pimples I use this product and instantly my pimples are gone. It&#x27;s amazing. Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry your face and, since I have combo/oily skin, it helps with that too. However. When I recieved the package, it was wrapped in an oatmeal box, so, beware of that. But, all in all, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> Best product i&#x27;ve found so far, i have combination oily skin with a hint of sensitive acne skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a toner that does the job search no more this is it.</li>
            <li> Awesome face wash!! Really works!</li>
