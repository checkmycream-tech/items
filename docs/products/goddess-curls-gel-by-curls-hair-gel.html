    <ol>
            <li>Great shine with no flaking!</li>
            <li>This Gel is a great product!!</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>My curls held up beautifully without being crunchy or droopy.  </li>
            <li>The best product I&#x27;ve used for curls (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Goddess Curls off and on for about a year now and have really loved it, and since I had Amazon credit, decided to purchase here instead of at Target.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted something that would provide a good hold.</li>
            <li>All of the Curls products are really good and do not cost a fortune like some of the others.</li>
            <li>then I work the Goddess Glaze through my hair kind of scrunching it.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time today and loved it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products on my daughter&#x27;s hair, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>love Goddess Curls Gels and hope you ladies will too.</li>
            <li>love Goddess Curls Gels and hope you ladies will too.</li>
            <li>There are many types of products for the woman of color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to use more of their line, but it is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>There is no coconut oil ANYTHING in this gel, which is a HUGE plus since my hair doesn&#x27;t tolerate coconut oil.</li>
            <li>but the ingredients are nothing special and available cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and soft and defined.</li>
            <li>gel also works really well with my favorite leave-in, which is Shea Moisture Reconstructive Conditioner.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks clean and healthy and soft</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but there&#x27;s a lot of it, and it&#x27;s very curly</li>
            <li>(I comb it from underneath for volume and lightly on top) and all the crunchiness disappears and I have nice shiny, soft curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I love it for natural hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Never even considering her hair could be wavy or even curly with the right products.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, as it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I did try several of their products and they worked OK</li>
            <li>I first used this product I was turned off by the smell.</li>
            <li>Scrunching should be automatic though. ;)</li>
            <li>Scrunching should be automatic though. ;)</li>
            <li>I think that helped with the curls as well, if your hair is not properly trimmed, it won&#x27;t curl rite, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased, I didn&#x27;t think curls were possible until today!!!!!</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant (which is something to consider if you have long hair) but that is the only positive thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the product form target the bottle says use with your regular conditioner which does normally leave my hair soft and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This product keeps her fine and tight curls freeze free and defined.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually on the watery side, and I think that&#x27;s why it works so well in my fine curls.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a very affordable product especially if you, like me, walk a fine line between paying rent and eating.</li>
            <li>This product is affordable and really works.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an affordable product that really works, this is it.</li>
            <li>It has turned my curls into straight scraggly pieces of hair.</li>
            <li>I use 1 or 2 pumps, it does absolutely NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Now if only they&#x27;d make a fragrance free line of ALL their products...</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten more wavey as I&#x27;ve aged, and I needed something to enhance the waves and turn them into curls.  </li>
            <li>You do really have to pay attention to the instructions for use with this product or you won&#x27;t like the results.</li>
            <li>You do absolutely have to apply the gel in sections.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were dismissive and mocking to a customer asking for help with \\&quot;kinky frizzy\\&quot; hair publicly making fun of her laughing about her straight hair.</li>
            <li>The price is kinda high</li>
            <li>it does only caters to \\&quot;real curly\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li>the curl patter remained nice however it left my hair very dry and rough.</li>
            <li>When I want curly hair instead of blowing it out straight and torturing it with a flat iron, I start with Prive Vanishing Oil (which when dry makes my hair really shine - I use it for both straight and curly styles)</li>
            <li>This company has made it crystal clear on their fb page</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really what I would consider a &#x27;traditional&#x27; gel-it&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>This formula does have a natural smell from some of the ingredients, but no added fragrance.</li>
            <li>Product made my hair feel crunchy wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought it should be for my hair.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just glop it all into one big section because your curls won&#x27;t turn out very well.</li>
            <li>If you want elongated soft waves after a twist out, then this is you product.</li>
            <li>If I use more, I get a head of stiff, semi straight bedraggled curls giving me the look of a 1980s wet head witch.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t work the same, my hair is really dry at the ends, and has a strong alcohol like smell (this is not normal).  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, curly hair, and I put it on before an all day trip to the zoo.  </li>
            <li>I used the entire product line and for the first time since I&#x27;ve gone natural (9 mos since BC), this thick, matted and course 4c hair had very distinctive curls</li>
            <li>I use a nickel size amount of this mixed with the same amount of Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner and my hair is perfectly soft all day.</li>
            <li>It works well for those who have fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> It works well for those who have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it does dry out my hair a little bit, but I usually fix that at night by spritzing with water and applying my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not like the soft curls that I have with other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to Jessicurl, I am not late for work because I was spending too much time trying to make a poor product work</li>
            <li> I find that it works MUCH better if I put a tiny bit of water in my hands with it to thin it down a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a regular gel: it doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I simply let my hair air dry or clip it up.</li>
            <li> The next day (or when it&#x27;s 100% dry)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got moderately curly hair that stays very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Here in Southern California, it is dry, dry, dry.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff in my hair and yes, it did define my curls but left it extremely rough.</li>
            <li> I do not care for wet looking hair but after using it I needed to rinse and recondition my hair to bring life back into it.</li>
            <li> When my hair is almost dry, I use my hair dryer with the difuser attachment just to bring out the shine from the Prive Oil and set the curls.  </li>
            <li> out of my 4b/c curls, it also took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I get lots of curls/body and no major crispy feeling like with other gel products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Goddess Curls Gel at Sally&#x27;s for $8.00-it runs about the same price or slightly cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> It can dry a little stiff, but with some jumping around (as a 7 year old will do), it loosens up and doesn&#x27;t look shiny- wet or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It dries out my natural hair (3C type) leaving it dull looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with limp ringlets.</li>
            <li> After trying various amounts of this for 2 weeks, applying it to very wet, towel dried or nearly dry hair, scrunching then applying and every other combo I could think of to make this work, I gave up and threw it out.</li>
            <li> So to find a gel that provides a loose hold and &#x27;tones down&#x27; the curl definition; was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like other products in the line</li>
            <li> Gotta try the other products.</li>
            <li> Not pretty.</li>
            <li> I use a wire afro pick and pick my hair out upside down for maximum volume.</li>
            <li> Today is one of those muggy, sticky days that usually leaves me with a head full of frizz.      </li>
            <li> In addition, I would suggest that you apply to small sections of wet hair.</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning, I used the curl goddess with a little leave in conditioner and did a twist set on my hair</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews about the product, I thought it would be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Glycerine based products seem to encourage frizz (at least for me) because it draws moisture from the air to your hair.</li>
            <li> I do have fairly thick hair and found that thiis is the product for me.  </li>
            <li> I hate to accuse someone of sending me an altered product, but now I know that from now on will only buy the product at an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Hated it! :(</li>
            <li> I think it smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shine with no flaking!</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve used for curls (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many). I have fine hair, but there&#x27;s a lot of it, and it&#x27;s very curly</li>
            <li> This product is affordable and really works. I have 4b hair and was looking for a product that would give me defined curls. After reading the negative reviews about the product, I thought it would be a waste of money. However, because of the price I decided to give it a try. I thought that for my hair type it was not possible. However, I applied it to my hair and would you believe my hair was curly. If you are looking for an affordable product that really works, this is it. In addition, I would suggest that you apply to small sections of wet hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product form target the bottle says use with your regular conditioner which does normally leave my hair soft and very healthy looking. Once  added the goddess curls hair gel the curl patter remained nice however it left my hair very dry and rough. I used it once again and had the same results. I like other products in the line but I will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time today and loved it!  I have fine, thick, curly hair, and I put it on before an all day trip to the zoo.  Today is one of those muggy, sticky days that usually leaves me with a head full of frizz.      My curls held up beautifully without being crunchy or droopy.  They&#x27;re nice and soft and defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got moderately curly hair that stays very dry and frizzy. I use a nickel size amount of this mixed with the same amount of Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner and my hair is perfectly soft all day.</li>
            <li> The only gel that gives me kinky  hair curls! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This Gel is a great product!! It works well for those who have fine thin hair. It&#x27;s not like a regular gel: it doesn&#x27;t dry crunchy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the same product, but I bought the botanical gel from Target and have been using it for about a month. It has turned my curls into straight scraggly pieces of hair. Even when I wash it out, my curls are still straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking it might be time to change to a different gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Goddess Curls off and on for about a year now and have really loved it, and since I had Amazon credit, decided to purchase here instead of at Target.  I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  The product doesn&#x27;t work the same, my hair is really dry at the ends, and has a strong alcohol like smell (this is not normal).  I hate to accuse someone of sending me an altered product, but now I know that from now on will only buy the product at an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products on my daughter&#x27;s hair, this is my favorite.  She&#x27;s biracial.  This product keeps her fine and tight curls freeze free and defined.  It can dry a little stiff, but with some jumping around (as a 7 year old will do), it loosens up and doesn&#x27;t look shiny- wet or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love it for natural hair. The price is kinda high but it&#x27;s worth it. Gotta try the other products.</li>
            <li> Garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Jessicurl line for several years and don&#x27;t know why I strayed and bought this. It smells pleasant (which is something to consider if you have long hair) but that is the only positive thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use 1 or 2 pumps, it does absolutely NOTHING for my hair. If I use more, I get a head of stiff, semi straight bedraggled curls giving me the look of a 1980s wet head witch. Not pretty. After trying various amounts of this for 2 weeks, applying it to very wet, towel dried or nearly dry hair, scrunching then applying and every other combo I could think of to make this work, I gave up and threw it out. I&#x27;m back to Jessicurl, I am not late for work because I was spending too much time trying to make a poor product work and my hair looks clean and healthy and soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have 3c, 3b and 4a curls. I put this stuff in my hair and yes, it did define my curls but left it extremely rough. Not like the soft curls that I have with other products</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;d love to use more of their line, but it is not fragrance free. This formula does have a natural smell from some of the ingredients, but no added fragrance. I find that it works MUCH better if I put a tiny bit of water in my hands with it to thin it down a bit. I scrunch up my curls and use a diffuser. I get lots of curls/body and no major crispy feeling like with other gel products. Now if only they&#x27;d make a fragrance free line of ALL their products...</li>
            <li> Product made my hair feel crunchy wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought it should be for my hair. thank you</li>
            <li> I started purchasing this through the salon where I get my hair done.  My hair has gotten more wavey as I&#x27;ve aged, and I needed something to enhance the waves and turn them into curls.  I do have fairly thick hair and found that thiis is the product for me.  When I want curly hair instead of blowing it out straight and torturing it with a flat iron, I start with Prive Vanishing Oil (which when dry makes my hair really shine - I use it for both straight and curly styles) then I work the Goddess Glaze through my hair kind of scrunching it.  When my hair is almost dry, I use my hair dryer with the difuser attachment just to bring out the shine from the Prive Oil and set the curls.  I know it dries crunchy, but all I do is run a wide-toothed comb through it (I comb it from underneath for volume and lightly on top) and all the crunchiness disappears and I have nice shiny, soft curls that last all day.  I will never use another product since I started using this one.</li>
            <li> This company has made it crystal clear on their fb page it does only caters to \\&quot;real curly\\&quot; hair! They were dismissive and mocking to a customer asking for help with \\&quot;kinky frizzy\\&quot; hair publicly making fun of her laughing about her straight hair. Never even considering her hair could be wavy or even curly with the right products. I did try several of their products and they worked OK but the ingredients are nothing special and available cheaper elsewhere. I will never buy a CURLS product again.</li>
            <li> A lot of ladies don&#x27;t seem to like using this product, but me-I am a FAN! I purchased the Goddess Curls Gel at Sally&#x27;s for $8.00-it runs about the same price or slightly cheaper at Target. It is definitely a very affordable product especially if you, like me, walk a fine line between paying rent and eating. I do like that this product does not contain glycerine. Here in Southern California, it is dry, dry, dry. Glycerine based products seem to encourage frizz (at least for me) because it draws moisture from the air to your hair. For me, that just causes nothing but problems. So to find a gel that provides a loose hold and &#x27;tones down&#x27; the curl definition; was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product I was turned off by the smell. I think it smells awful. The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me, as it dissipates quickly. This isn&#x27;t really what I would consider a &#x27;traditional&#x27; gel-it&#x27;s not heavy or sticky. It&#x27;s actually on the watery side, and I think that&#x27;s why it works so well in my fine curls. I use this for wash-n-go&#x27;s when I don&#x27;t want my &#x27;fro to be as defined and would like my curls to be a bit looser and elongated. To achieve that look I simply let my hair air dry or clip it up. The next day (or when it&#x27;s 100% dry) I use a wire afro pick and pick my hair out upside down for maximum volume. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel also works really well with my favorite leave-in, which is Shea Moisture Reconstructive Conditioner. There is no coconut oil ANYTHING in this gel, which is a HUGE plus since my hair doesn&#x27;t tolerate coconut oil. The only issue I have is that it does dry out my hair a little bit, but I usually fix that at night by spritzing with water and applying my favorite moisturizer. You do really have to pay attention to the instructions for use with this product or you won&#x27;t like the results. You do absolutely have to apply the gel in sections. You can&#x27;t just glop it all into one big section because your curls won&#x27;t turn out very well. I made this mistake once. You also MUST scrunch out the crunch immediately after applying the product. Otherwise you get noodle curls. Scrunching should be automatic though. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Goddess Curls Gels and hope you ladies will too. It&#x27;s a staple product of mine.take once.

            <li> Absolutely Not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took the BOING! out of my 4b/c curls, it also took forever to dry. If you want elongated soft waves after a twist out, then this is you product. I just wanted something that would provide a good hold. I&#x27;m left with limp ringlets. Hated it! :(</li>
            <li> This curl product works well. All of the Curls products are really good and do not cost a fortune like some of the others.</li>
            <li> It dries out my natural hair (3C type) leaving it dull looking. I do not care for wet looking hair but after using it I needed to rinse and recondition my hair to bring life back into it. There are many types of products for the woman of color but this just did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a review for the shampoo that I watched on YouTube. I used the entire product line and for the first time since I&#x27;ve gone natural (9 mos since BC), this thick, matted and course 4c hair had very distinctive curls and I was amazed!!!!! After washing and conditioning, I used the curl goddess with a little leave in conditioner and did a twist set on my hair so I could trim it. I think that helped with the curls as well, if your hair is not properly trimmed, it won&#x27;t curl rite, but I love this product. The only thing is that it does not moisturize the way I would like but, but I use coconut oil, Shea oil, tea tee oil and vitamin E, so it works, just wish it softened as well, but it does what it says it does, and that&#x27;s give you curls. I am pleased, I didn&#x27;t think curls were possible until today!!!!!</li>
