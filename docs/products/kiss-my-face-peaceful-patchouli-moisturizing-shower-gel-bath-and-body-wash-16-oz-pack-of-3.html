            <li>I use it with a loofah sponge so combined with the exfoliation and the beautiful aroma of the gel - my shower times are...</li>

            <li>I love patchouli, so for me this perfect.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff: it lathers beautifully, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin like parchment paper.  </li>
            <li>so thought shower gel would be a good buy for me.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a good foam too.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li>The store in my area aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore, so I was glad to be able to find it on-line here through Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly but the scent is very light...</li>
            <li>I love the product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of patchouli.</li>
            <li>I love the lather.</li>
            <li>I love this wash</li>
            <li>and I love using it every morning.</li>
            <li>What was once a lovely bubble bath with a really nice scent has become a wasteful product that smells a lot like cheap dishsoap.</li>
            <li>I bought this product some time ago and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Love to bathe in this and also use it as a handwash.  </li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and I have used this on my shower sponge for years.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would foam more than it did.</li>
            <li>but I love the scent of patchouli.  </li>
            <li>, I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product and was glad to get it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>If you love the smell of patchouli, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>I love the olive oil kiss my face soap bar...but needed something more practical for taking to the gym in the morning.  </li>
            <li>If that is you thing you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and the smell ..</li>
            <li>Gave a bottle to a friend and they love it too...</li>
            <li>its ok i guess.</li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of a cheap shampoo you&#x27;d buy from a dollar store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it does not smell strong at all.</li>
            <li>This is what you want if you love the smell of patchouli, plus the bonus of a full 16 oz.</li>
            <li>Like the light scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and feeling of patchouli oil every day</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh smelling skin :)</li>
            <li>it is the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather and you have to use a lot of it to get clean.</li>
            <li>but I love it so much that I have to have it and</li>
            <li>you do not feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>the scent smells more like some old basement rather than patchouli.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that smelt like my patchouli oil and was surprised because most people commented that this smells like it.</li>
            <li>Feels very gentle on my skin too and foams well.</li>
            <li>peacefully spa like.  </li>
            <li>So calming and peaceful.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the entire KMF Patchouli line of products and the bath/shower gel is no exception!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product smells exactly like latex paint.</li>
            <li>When I first was considering ordering this, I wondered why one needed to purchase three large bottles.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t quite place the smell aside from being certain it was NOT patchouli.</li>
            <li>Secondly, and more importantly, it does not foam or bubble even enough to feel like soap.</li>
            <li>Last a good, long time.  </li>
            <li>the price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am so saddened it has changed so much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for carrying it</li>
            <li>Not as much like patchouli as Id like but</li>
            <li>What I really don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>I love it and would  recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for patchouli without all the other \\&quot;fragrances\\</li>
            <li>This is a great product, you only need a very little bit for a soothing shower,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more along the lines of barely scented public restroom hand soap.</li>
            <li>Male, female, young and old .. 1 soap per household is nice  ..  </li>
            <li>Soft and gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but find it hard to get at retail stores..</li>
            <li>I even indulge in it occasionally &amp; find it very relaxing coupled with some music.</li>
            <li>I love patchouli and was excited when I found a shower gel, I was however, quite disappointed upon first use.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a guy I let get away who wore the cologne, so the fragrance brings back bitter sweet memories of a time when decisions were easier and life was simpler.</li>
            <li>Last, but not least..</li>
            <li>but that is barely a concern.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of my old hippie days back in college.</li>

            <li> Reminds me of my old hippie days back in college.</li>
            <li> First of all the gel hardly lathers, second of all after washing with it</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding it locally</li>
            <li> There is nothing dramatically wrong with this product, EXCEPT the patchouli fragrance is minor and one must use a large amount of the product to generate an aroma.</li>
            <li> It is subtle but stays with you throughout the day, so don&#x27;t be surprised</li>
            <li> It does not suds up like other washes unless you spread it around the loufa</li>
            <li> but this one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love Patchouli and was very disappointed when I purchased this shower gel and moisturizing lotion together at the local Wegman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ir also takes quite a bit to make pretty measly suds.</li>
            <li> ordering it on here is a little pricey</li>
            <li> After using it a few times.. I want to tell kiss my face to kiss my ---.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula along with the packaging</li>
            <li> any more so one feels as though one must use A LOT to get anything out of it and when used as a shower gel it leaves a horrible sticky residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> although i always had in the past ..</li>
            <li> I could have sworn I&#x27;d smelled it in the past</li>
            <li> Amazon is again less expensive than other sources.</li>
            <li> The subtle smell of this wash in the morning is like aromatherapy to me.</li>
            <li> If you want the scent of patchouli to be a part of your shower regime well, you have the wrong product.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t so I guess that is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> I have three bottles to use. :(</li>
            <li> hate running out of it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Kiss My Face Peaceful Patchouli Shower Gel is wonderful. I use it with a loofah sponge so combined with the exfoliation and the beautiful aroma of the gel - my shower times are... well... peacefully spa like.  I love the product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is what you want if you love the smell of patchouli, plus the bonus of a full 16 oz. in each bottle.  It is subtle but stays with you throughout the day, so don&#x27;t be surprised if people ask what you&#x27;re wearing.  It reminds me of a guy I let get away who wore the cologne, so the fragrance brings back bitter sweet memories of a time when decisions were easier and life was simpler.</li>
            <li> There is nothing dramatically wrong with this product, EXCEPT the patchouli fragrance is minor and one must use a large amount of the product to generate an aroma. When I first was considering ordering this, I wondered why one needed to purchase three large bottles. Now I know why--my wife has used about three-fourths of one bottle in three baths. Cannot give you a recommendation for an alternative product but this one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice lather.  Clean and fresh smelling skin :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this shower gel. So calming and peaceful. Very good price for the huge bottle. Feels very gentle on my skin too and foams well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Patchouli lover, but it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I&#x27;ve heard this is a   great product and the price is so reasonable.  Everyone&#x27;s right!!!!  I love it and would  recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for patchouli without all the other \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; mixed  in (BBW).  Buy the set of three and you&#x27;ll more!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I love the scent of patchouli. I love the lather. The fragrance is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> The subtle smell of this wash in the morning is like aromatherapy to me. It does not suds up like other washes unless you spread it around the loufa but that is barely a concern. I love this wash and I love using it every morning. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly but the scent is very light...I &#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula along with the packaging but it does not smell the same as it use to.</li>
            <li> The formula for this product changed. What was once a lovely bubble bath with a really nice scent has become a wasteful product that smells a lot like cheap dishsoap. It doesn&#x27;t foam any more so one feels as though one must use A LOT to get anything out of it and when used as a shower gel it leaves a horrible sticky residue on the skin. I am so saddened it has changed so much. It used to be my favourite bubble bath / shower gel ever.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the entire KMF Patchouli line of products and the bath/shower gel is no exception!  This gel does not have that &amp;#34;phony generated&amp;#34; sort of Patchouli scent that some companies try to pass off upon an unsuspecting public.  This gel smells so heavenly, it is almost like having incense in a bottle of bath gel.  My honey started using it and now, we both love it!  We will definitely continue to purchase the KMF Patchouli line!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product some time ago and enjoyed it. This time, however, it is different and quality has definitely slipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it does not smell strong at all. It&#x27;s more along the lines of barely scented public restroom hand soap. Secondly, and more importantly, it does not foam or bubble even enough to feel like soap. Imagine putting one part bubbly soap into three parts olive oil. There you have this product.</li>
            <li> Have always like Kiss My Face products. Shower gel does not leave me feeling all oiled up. Like the light scent. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and feeling of patchouli oil every day so thought shower gel would be a good buy for me.  Not with this product.  First of all the gel hardly lathers, second of all after washing with it you do not feel clean and fresh.  Last, but not least.. the scent smells more like some old basement rather than patchouli.  Now I am stuck with three 16 ounces bottles of this crud.  After using it a few times.. I want to tell kiss my face to kiss my ---.</li>
            <li> Love to bathe in this and also use it as a handwash.  Reminds me of my old hippie days back in college.</li>
            <li> Love this bath and shower gel !!!!</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> I love patchouli, and I have used this on my shower sponge for years. I was hoping it would foam more than it did. The label says that they have improved the lather, but I couldn&#x27;t notice any abundance of suds. The aroma in the shower is wonderful. Aches and pains wash away.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but find it hard to get at retail stores..ordering it on here is a little pricey but I love it so much that I have to have it and hate running out of it.  I get so many compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Amazon is again less expensive than other sources. Even with shipping charges. My wife uses this it add tit her relaxation several times a week. I even indulge in it occasionally &amp; find it very relaxing coupled with some music.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff: it lathers beautifully, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin like parchment paper.  The store in my area aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore, so I was glad to be able to find it on-line here through Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time adn as advertise.  My hippie maybe showing but I love the scent of patchouli.  Gives you a good foam too.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve used up what I have, I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and was glad to get it at such a great price.  This bath and shower gel makes you smell great.  I love patchouli, so for me this perfect.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  However, there was a delay in shipping.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. If you love the smell of patchouli, don&#x27;t buy this product. I love the olive oil kiss my face soap bar...but needed something more practical for taking to the gym in the morning.  I wanted something that smelt like my patchouli oil and was surprised because most people commented that this smells like it. It doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have three bottles to use. :(</li>
            <li> This has a suttle scent.  Last a good, long time.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love patchouli and was excited when I found a shower gel, I was however, quite disappointed upon first use. At first I couldn&#x27;t quite place the smell aside from being certain it was NOT patchouli. I then realized where i had smelled the scent before, in a can of latex paint. This product smells exactly like latex paint. If that is you thing you will love it. If you want the scent of patchouli to be a part of your shower regime well, you have the wrong product. Ir also takes quite a bit to make pretty measly suds. This could be excused if it smelled good ...maybe. But it doesn&#x27;t so I guess that is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you only need a very little bit for a soothing shower,&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy anything else. and it comes in a variety of scents.</li>
            <li> love it! greta in the bath or in shower, but i prefer bath. This and woodland pine is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this soap and the smell .. Its good for everyone in the family.. Gave a bottle to a friend and they love it too... Male, female, young and old .. 1 soap per household is nice  ..  I had trouble finding it locally although i always had in the past .. Thanks amazon for carrying it</li>
            <li> Best product, great pricing</li>
            <li> I love Patchouli and was very disappointed when I purchased this shower gel and moisturizing lotion together at the local Wegman&#x27;s. I could have sworn I&#x27;d smelled it in the past and it was a great Patchouli scent but not so now. Maybe they changed the formula as others have noticed as well.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this product. Its smells just so so. Not as much like patchouli as Id like but its ok i guess. What I really don&#x27;t like about it is the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather and you have to use a lot of it to get clean. Kind of reminds me of a cheap shampoo you&#x27;d buy from a dollar store.</li>
