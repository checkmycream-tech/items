    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think this is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product, but there are two reasons I docked the item</li>
            <li>Follow these directions and you will be happy!</li>
            <li>Use baby powder for best results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was perfect, it all depends how you use it.</li>
            <li>This is where practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li>Again, practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li>I will probably give it another try, when it&#x27;s time, and practice will make perfect.</li>
            <li>Best wax there is...</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it though, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would work either, but it was awesome and gave me salon quality results.</li>
            <li>and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>The wax itself was great!</li>
            <li>I was not too impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand to pay for services I can do perfectly well myself.  </li>
            <li>If you use it according to the directions it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li>Lol!</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>to the amount of hair removed by the wax, I can&#x27;t weigh in very successfully.  </li>
            <li>This kit is excellent for waxing at home, at a good price.</li>
            <li>being said, I think the product is great.</li>
            <li>but besides that I was happy.</li>
            <li>If anyone could give suggestions that would be great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I got this kit.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>for me is great.</li>
            <li>It worked great</li>
            <li>Another great tip: go to Sally Beauty Supply and buy yourself a can of Numbing spray and their wax strips.</li>
            <li>but this works great for me</li>
            <li>It works great in ripping out all the unsightly hairs and keeps my beard and mustache</li>
            <li>My wax heats up in no  time and the experience is great...</li>
            <li>The results are great</li>
            <li>This product would have been great if the warmer got hotter.</li>
            <li>This product works great when used as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Wax worked great on underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This warmer kit is great.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and it works great</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>works great, the wife loves it</li>
            <li>, it was great.</li>
            <li>issue isn&#x27;t the wax itself - that&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s always been.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I&#x27;ve found this product!!</li>
            <li>or it will stick and not feel good at all.  </li>
            <li>This wax is really good</li>
            <li>, that way you can get a good grip to pull it off.    </li>
            <li>The instructions had some good suggestions, like putting talcum powder on your skin/hair before applying the wax.  </li>
            <li>This warmer warms the wax, but does not allow it to get to a good workable temperature.</li>
            <li>IT DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li>Additionally the wax smells good.</li>
            <li>Good to go.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the results.  </li>
            <li>I have successfully waxed my own hair before, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the kit.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Works great, practically pain free, pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t get wax all over the counter.</li>
            <li>when you get it onto your skin you have to pick the exact perfect time to remove it-</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m here to buy more!</li>
            <li>My mom and I love this product!</li>
            <li>Hi bought it to make my life easier and this product is great easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Once it is applied to the &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; places, it does a great job of removing the hair and it is smooth for about a week before it starts to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing -- like a dessert.</li>
            <li>There was nothing I could do to make this product easy-to use or effective.</li>
            <li>has its own warmer and 2.</li>
            <li>It heated up in about 30-40 minutes, and I used it on my underarms since I honestly can&#x27;t do brazilians on my own.  </li>
            <li>It took me 1.5 hours to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li>and now I can wax my eyebrows in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to address popular complaints, for those who are wondering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use your own warmer</li>
            <li>I put the wax tin into the warmer with the ring around the lower part of the tin and it wouldn&#x27;t really warm up.</li>
            <li>The warmer does take a while to warm up (the instruction guide says 25 minutes).</li>
            <li>Really the best wax kit ever!</li>
            <li>I take care of my own waxing needs for pennies that would cost me a ton at the salon.</li>
            <li>It gets warm but doesn&#x27;t melt the wax.</li>
            <li>will never buy another home spa waxing kit of any kind again.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another home spa waxing kit of any kind again.  </li>
            <li>4 stars because it takes foreveeeeeerrr for the wax to be warm.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>- wax takes some time to warm up</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend unless they were experienced with waxing both at home and salon to be familiar with the level of pain</li>
            <li>I felt like I was slathering a sweet fondue sauce on myself lol.     </li>
            <li>It still works the same and wonderfully well; gets a good percentage of the hair, no strips to have to deal with.</li>
            <li>It was also very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the wax warm in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the warmer because I can turn it on to warm up and by the time I am done my shower I can use it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>It was SOO easy and removed everything!  </li>
            <li>you can push the top layer with the provided sticks and you will see the melted wax rise up, wait 5 more mins and take the wax that are closest to the sides as these parts is where the really warm wax that you want is located.</li>
            <li>Running to the microwave is much more time effective than sitting around 3 hours or more to have the wax soften.  </li>
            <li>Another reason is that although this product is great, it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to find a kit with it&#x27;s own heater for a good price!  </li>
            <li>Also I make sure to clean my face really good afterwards to prevent the redness.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Pull the wax quickly and apply pressure to the area!!    </li>
            <li>And the wax is a very cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>I wanted an at-home wax kit that would be easy and effective.</li>
            <li>I slathered the wax on my underarm making sure to leave a \\&quot;lip\\&quot; to pull the wax.  </li>
            <li>I actually love it</li>
            <li>Instead of coming off in a strip when you pulled, it was more like pulling taffy apart.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I guess it worked ok</li>
            <li>, you just have to make sure the hair you plan to wax it</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or bumps :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many wax and hair removal products.</li>
            <li>The bikini line was better than the underarms but had more redness.</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts, but not any more than it did at the salon.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use any streeps.</li>
            <li>it works great for me, I wish I would have known before and instead of wasting $20 on the whole kit</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even get MOST of the hair out.</li>
            <li>This worked MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>I found that I got better results when I used one spatula stick to load up another one, for 3-4 inches of length, by the time I got the wax spread out on the stick</li>
            <li>Using strips with the stuff works much better, but that defeats the purpose of using a stripless wax doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>Would be better if it had strips.</li>
            <li>but you get more than twice the product.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need strips.</li>
            <li>Supply  and bought the GiGi HoneyBee Microwave kit which is awesome and only 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>It is most likely the best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The GiGi wax also came with prep, wax remover, and after wax supplies, much better buy than this thing.</li>
            <li>I was worried about doing this myself because I have never used waxing products before and wasn&#x27;t sure what</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product and will continue to buy refills.</li>
            <li>I love the Sally Hansen Wax.</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a much better price than I could find in Wal-Mart or anywhere else in town.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always glad to have a Prime account.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been more dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li>I do not know why so many people had problems.</li>
            <li>It obviously was not salon quality, but was perfect for maintaining my brows and lip!</li>
            <li>I probably will not buy more wax once this runs out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to find a product like this product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>At $20, I wasn&#x27;t sure, but got it anyway.</li>
            <li>When it came time to use it, I immediately fell in love.     </li>
            <li>Just make sure that the skin is taut.     </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it was about one hour or maybe more.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the perfect product to keep me from running back and forth</li>
            <li>Make sure the tin is pushed all the way into the warmer.  </li>
            <li>It only takes about 20 mins to heat up and it works great!!</li>
            <li>like what most reviewers say here, it does take forever to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>Something else I liked about this wax is that it&#x27;s more environmentally friendly</li>
            <li>, how warm the wax should be, direction to pull off and clean up.</li>
            <li>Love this, it warms up quickly and keeps warm.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I paid $20 for this I wasn&#x27;t really expecting amazing things from it.</li>
            <li>I can see how it would be easy to get drops of wax on the counter, etc., but I just twirl the applicator a lot to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen.    </li>
            <li>After many hours browsing on the web looking for a solution to get smooth armpits, I decided to try waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep using it to get a good feel for when the wax is ready to be pulled off.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply (I used toothpicks for a more accurate application), the wax cooled quickly, and the wax was very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think most people don&#x27;t realize that the wax is well heated on the bottom but to get the top heated you have to get some of that hot wax from the bottom on the top</li>
            <li>Do not leave the lid on to cool!</li>
            <li>I know any brazilian waxing hurts, but this stuff did not come off as easily as the wax in the salons.</li>
            <li>once you can mix the wax, it never heats to a consistency that spreads easily-</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and just pull off with your fingers and no strips.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re at the end of the area, swoop it around so the end can easily be flicked up.</li>
            <li>I apply 5 or 6 at a time and get it done very quickly.     </li>
            <li>Easy to use and saves time and money.</li>
            <li>This Sally Hansen was was so easy to use, one I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove from my skin and surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Wax does not spread easily .</li>
            <li>This is evenly heated, and dries evenly, so it stays pretty tidy.  </li>
            <li>I loved it its just what I was looking for ,leaves your skin so soft ,and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>The wax itself is nice, hardens fast and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>positive thing about it is that it has a very gentle and pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and there was still a huge clump of unmelted wax.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local store thinking it would be great.  </li>
            <li>I waited about 35 minute for it to melt well, when I used it all my hairs got off on my arm and eyebrows- smooth and free.</li>
            <li>They never work - you spend more time trying to get reasonable results in the time you can be completely finished with good results with better products.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT STICKY, it leaves no sticky residue, which is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>but I seem to be growing a beard in my advanced age.</li>
            <li>area smooth for about 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li>No doubt actually going to a salon would improve the results, but for the money ($13 when I bought it) this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li>No doubt actually going to a salon would improve the results, but for the money ($13 when I bought it) this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li>made my skin feel smooth and moisturized..</li>
            <li>It was messing, but easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I figured it would be much easier to regulate the wax temperature and keep it warm until I was done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you could reuse it 4 or 5 times if your hair is light.</li>
            <li>The wax is fabulous</li>
            <li>- cheap (my can lasted over a year doing eyebrows every 4-6 weeks)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the microwave wax, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come with solvent to clean it off of skin, and it doesn&#x27;t come off easily if at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either.</li>
            <li>It is great and definitely removes all of the hair!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, not messy, the wax smells good, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and no wax strips needed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get it to warm up faster by pressing the tin all the way down, as suggested by others, but I learned that after waiting about 30 minutes for it to warm up.  </li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing the bliss poetic waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited, read the directions, and kept checking on the wax.</li>
            <li>Doing this will shorten the heating time significantly, making this a usable product.    </li>
            <li>The wax works pretty cleanly, much better than all of my experiences with wax strips and Nads (shudder).  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this when learned about it.</li>
            <li>It does take about an hour the first time for it to heat up but after that its quick and easy!</li>
            <li>and I was excited about it,</li>
            <li>So, make sure it is not too hot when you apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I use this product specially to wax my arms and bikini, and it&#x27;s great, my hair is less tick, just love</li>
            <li>Save the chips on a clean piece of wax paper and after you&#x27;re done, pack them into the jar and leave it on until they&#x27;re melted, then turn if off or keep going.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, doing a few patch tests, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was able to continue waxing until I was finished with very consistently-heated wax.  </li>
            <li>so when I found this I said cool.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product locally thinking the \\&quot;stripless\\&quot; concept was a good one.</li>
            <li>I love this product - mostly because the wax is ready and STAYS ready without having to deal with microwaving, or anything else.  </li>
            <li>sure the rubber strip on the container can&#x27;t be seen (people complain about it not heating up fast)    </li>
            <li>-You don&#x27;t need to wait forever for them to cool,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only as good as the person using it.  </li>
            <li>Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product.</li>
            <li>Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do.</li>
            <li>Heated quickly, spread easily, worked exactly like the microwavable kit.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it is so worth it, it is a good product, and I already have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Once I figured this out, the wax became gooey really quick.</li>
            <li>It was super quick to do my underarms.</li>
            <li>and I read the directions many times from different sources and even read the reviews to make sure</li>
            <li>Also, doing it in the direction of the hair, and then quickly going over it all squiggly helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years for all my facial hair removal and it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>Also, the wax gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very fun working with hot wax.    </li>
            <li>After realizing that I had to push the black band all the way into the warmer, it works great.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works well, and for around $20, 6 months is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good for smaller areas, and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying the replacement wax for this unit once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>I had some cloth strips I bought at the beauty supply shop, originally for the honey wax, and I tried applying the hot wax, then applying the cloth strip, and then pulling the wax off using the cloth strip.  </li>
            <li>help the warmer, I place a folded dry washcloth over the top of the can to help keep more of the heat within the wax can.</li>
            <li>There was some melted wax underneath the clump so after making a huge mess I got to the wax and all was good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known many people that have this little waxing kit, have used them myself, and actually own one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(warmer, wax, instructions and wooden \\&quot;spatulas (popsicle sticks would be more accurate a description) into the trash can.      </li>
            <li>It appears that there are a lot of low scores for this product because \\&quot;it takes forever to warm the wax\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>just warm enough to use.</li>
            <li>So many of the one star reviews sound the same to me</li>
            <li>Once finished with waxing, then used some of the warm wax to get rid of the cooled wax left on my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought that if I even did it 3 times it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Bought this item contemplating whether spending 20 dollars on it would be worth my while.</li>
            <li>If its not working for you, make sure you take off the wax before it completely hardens.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I will pay the extra 10 bucks to go to a salon.</li>
            <li>It was even effective on a man&#x27;s facial hair, after he had grown out his \\&quot;beard\\&quot; for a week.  </li>
            <li>, it took a bit of resourcefulness to make it work well, but was worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth</li>
            <li>The box was crumbles and clearly taped and the top.  </li>
            <li>You could plug it in today and it may be warm enough by Christmas to melt the wax, but probably not.  </li>
            <li>I ended up dumping the wax from this into one of my old microwave safe containers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The time it takes to heat the wax up is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my Eyebrows and legs and it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This unit works well to keep the wax warm, but not to initially heat the wax as it states on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you plan to do that it&#x27;s a good idea to start from the least hairy areas and then move to waxing the most hairy areas.    </li>
            <li>The warmer doesn&#x27;t warm the wax up enough to make it useable.</li>
            <li>So I moved on to the next step, doing my own.  </li>
            <li>The more you use (the more empty the container gets), the shorter the time it takes to melt.</li>
            <li>So, make sure you plan ahead and have time to wait for the wax to melt completely.</li>
            <li>As long as you find the right amount of time to leave the wax on without letting it harden too much, using this wax should be easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used to go to the European Wax Center and it was awesome until I released how much money I was expending every 4 weeks or so for a brazilian and  full legs waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes a difference too whether or not the wax is the right temperature when you apply it.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I determined that this was the right kit with the right</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it and the warmer is not working right.</li>
            <li>ANy positive reviews of this product have got to be plants!  </li>
            <li>One trick is to make sure the rubber ring around the wax can makes a tight seal inside the warmer so that it fits right on top of the heating element.  </li>
            <li>Overall though,  great kit and has saved me many trips to the salon to tame my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>With a little repetition, you get the feel for how big you can make a &amp;#34;Strip&amp;#34; and when and how to best pull it off before it</li>
            <li>After the wax came off, I moisturized with coconut oil and now my skin is very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It did remove some hair and left the area very smooth..  </li>
            <li>This was really easy to use, unlike the one that you need to microwave, the only problem was it dries up on the spatula so quickly.</li>
            <li>When there isn&#x27;t very much, or when it&#x27;s all melted, it gets hot.</li>
            <li>Tipping the solid wax on top into the melted wax below also helps.    </li>
            <li>I tried it first on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>But it really pulls hair!  </li>
            <li>The warmer is not working like it did at first, and even after an hour of heating the wax is not fully melted.</li>
            <li>This is the first strip-less home waxing kit I have seen.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use baby powder before you apply the wax, makes a big difference with the wax coming off easier.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars because it DID work the first time.</li>
            <li>The wax takes about 30 min to heat and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot -</li>
            <li>This is the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, so I have nothing to compare it too.  </li>
            <li>First, it took an hour for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li>This was my first time waxing by myself and I have never waxed my bikini area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of wax varieties, but this is the first I&#x27;ve tried that 1.</li>
            <li>The tin got hot but there was no effect on the wax whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It was ALMOST painless when i did it with talcum powder first before waxing C.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced by this from a friend, I was talking to her about always wanting to get a wax but never got the chance.</li>
            <li>After asking around, there were so many mixed reviews that I decided to do my eyebrows myself.</li>
            <li>Next time I will be more patient.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have purchased off of Amazon that I did not like.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it&#x27;s best for small jobs or spot waxing- pits, faces, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the wax scalding hot, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself with it, and it&#x27;s probably not going to catch on fire if you forget about it.  </li>
            <li>but, then I heard that all you had to do is make sure its placed properly (to where you can&#x27;t see the rubber).</li>
            <li>This product might be Ok if you knew that next Friday you wanted to wax.  </li>
            <li>The wax itself even seems to be of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to do my face several times over before running out.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to do my face several times over before running out.  </li>
            <li>it will slide around, revealing the molten wax at the very bottom!)</li>
            <li>I did remove the rubber piece first though.</li>
            <li>The box came pretty banged up so that might be a reason why it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but hour after hour I slipped more maddeningly into remorse and desperation and finally I tried to shave the s</li>
            <li>I first used it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it took almost 3 hours to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had more success with melted wax products than with wax strips, which always left behind too much hair, &amp; it&#x27;s much more convenient &amp; effective if the wax is continuously heated.</li>
            <li>the wax is warm not hot.</li>
            <li>The wax is just like other waxes of its kind.</li>
            <li>There are many other hard wax or stripless at-home waxing kits that are much more effective.</li>
            <li>The cheap, easily shorted warmer on the other hand?</li>
            <li>The plug in heater is really way more convenient than having to make trips back and forth to the microwave.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair was much longer than it usually needs to be for successful waxing, the wax didn&#x27;t pick up all of the hair in any of the areas that I used it on.</li>
            <li>Needs a little practice to get used to shaping the eyebrows, but is pretty cool :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it as easy on small places like  my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m getting better with practice.  </li>
            <li>Got fully undressed first, so I could go straight to the shower.</li>
            <li>Once I had the wax heated up I tested a strip on my husbands leg hair first to see if it really works like it says it should.</li>
            <li>Like many others who have purchased this product, I had a problem with the wax taking an extremely long time to melt.  </li>
            <li>They make it possible to cover a much larger area much more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Many are complaining that it takes too long to heat.</li>
            <li>While it was heating up, I read reviews and pretty much everyone hates it.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with waxing this product is well worth it, for a personal use.  </li>
            <li>There is a small light that comes on so make sure it is on - should be heating then.</li>
            <li>It took far too long to warm.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money in the warmer unit just buy the wax refills and warm it up in hot water this way</li>
            <li>and I love not having a single hair in my arms or legs</li>
            <li>Had to tighten my budget but didn&#x27;t want to give up certain beauty treatments</li>
            <li>and I find the wax strips sometimes don&#x27;t work well in certain area.  </li>
            <li>It does take a bit longer than 25 minutes to melt completely, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me, and it does get VERY HOT, so use caution.  </li>
            <li>I have been to European Wax center in california several times to get a full brazilian and they are great and their wax is just like the one sold in this product.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re good with stuff like this, follow our instructions, (not Sally&#x27;s those are kinda vague), and you&#x27;ll be super pumped at the fact you just saved $10!</li>
            <li>The wax itself, provided you get it hot enough, is nothing special.</li>
            <li>Refill kits don&#x27;t look to be too expensive and if I&#x27;m feeling bold I can always find a recipe to make my own and refill the original tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Refill kits don&#x27;t look to be too expensive and if I&#x27;m feeling bold I can always find a recipe to make my own and refill the original tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 20 minutes, the wax was evenly heated and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>but it must be getting ready to be discontinued because I can&#x27;t find the wax refills anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing out.</li>
            <li>I have had laser hair removal treatments both places, so I do not have much hair to remove.</li>
            <li>The problem is that metal on metal doesn&#x27;t conduct heat very well, put some conductor in there</li>
            <li>you dont have to wait for the whole thing to melt, after 15 mins</li>
            <li>lastly, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to the salon and have someone see your body parts.</li>
            <li>Its been 5 hours and it still isn&#x27;t ready.  </li>
            <li>The wax thickens really well and pulls out almost ALL the hair in one try.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After removing the wax strip, it was a very noticeable difference, both on my face and on the wax strip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s really small&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still sticky and gooey and doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the box was very mistreated and there were no popsicle sticks included...</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need to wait for the whole thing to melt before using--</li>
            <li>Do it fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather do my pampering and upkeep at home and this product makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>The wax will be ready in 20-30 min.</li>
            <li>Buy yourself a $5 candle warmer and get your wax ready much faster.</li>
            <li>It never pulls off in one whole strip it always breaks.</li>
            <li>It will heat up much faster.</li>
            <li>It keeps you from going to and from the microwave as much.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows fill in much faster than my hair grows.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It would, of course, be better if it washed off with soap and water like a sugar wax, but it only took me baby oil and a soft brush to get it all off.</li>
            <li>However this warmer seems to not get warm enough to actually melt all the wax!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 7:41 PM the next day they wax is only slightly warm not melted yet.</li>
            <li>It stays nice and firm and comes off in one piece.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of great things on Amazon, but this was a complete waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li>I bought this and just like many of the other people said, it did not heat up</li>
            <li>, it was cool enough to apply without too much difficulty.    </li>
            <li>so you can pull it off easily, and wait like 30 seconds for it to kinda dry.  </li>
            <li>Had the same problems others did with long warm up time.</li>
            <li>and then it cools down too fast to get most of the work done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply beyond my imagination how they can make a product that heats this little can of cosmetic wax so thoroughly, so sincerely, and so genuinely.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t work to its full potential.</li>
            <li>Actually, in regards to size, it IS a bit impractical for full leg waxing, although I have done it.  </li>
            <li>Usually I use my own warmer, but I threw it away when it broke.</li>
            <li>Well, it takes about an hour to melt the wax and will not melt fast enough some of the wax you already used so most probably you will not get the job done with only one can</li>
            <li>It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the can in and made sure the black rubber thing was covered</li>
            <li>As the fuzz-forest grows thicker it has a greater impact on the application of make-up, causing my face to have an odd post-foundation texture.  </li>
            <li>I had been waxing for several years, strip-less European wax, at my favorite salon House of Wax in Cooper City, FL.</li>
            <li>warmer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax consistently.</li>
            <li>I stir frequently, and switch off the unit for a few minutes at a time when it&#x27;s getting too warm.</li>
            <li>Get the Gigi space saver, same size and heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is almost the same and it would cost me more to ship this back than to just throw it away.</li>
            <li>You stir the wax to get it going, the warmer does not hold a steady temp</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have a steady hand to use this product.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t reco putting your bare hands on it, the cup only gets warm, so I was able to just push it back down with my hands without any burning or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>It takes an hour to even get the wax warm enough to stir, and no matter how long you leave it on it never gets as hot as it should be for proper hair removal.</li>
            <li>The price of a good spa and the satisfaction of the results is far less \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; than several hours of hell and torment of trying to use this product.r</li>
            <li>The price of a good spa and the satisfaction of the results is far less \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; than several hours of hell and torment of trying to use this product.</li>
            <li>After waiting the 25 minutes for the wax to warm up it was still hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no stranger to waxing my legs, so I expected a bit of a mess and hair removal isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter and applied to clean dry sweat-free skin.</li>
            <li>would say I started waxing with about 50% of the wax completely melted, and I noticed that the wax was very stringy.</li>
            <li>I did make sure the hair was long enough.</li>
            <li>However, I found out that the wax can be reused with no problem, as long as you aren&#x27;t grossed out by using wax that is already full of hair :</li>
            <li>I have used other sally hansen waxing products before and they were fine-</li>
            <li>There are plenty of wax products available for less than $10 that can be ready in minutes to apply.</li>
            <li>That being said, if you have experience waxing and can do it well enough, maybe this stuff is right for you.</li>
            <li>And if you can suffer through the extra pain and get it done right, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li>It also keeps the wax at the right consistency the entire time</li>
            <li>I found that when I&#x27;m using a new tin of wax, after 25 minutes it seems like it still isn&#x27;t warm, but if I poke through the upper level of wax, the bottom half is all melted and usable.</li>
            <li>A majority of my hair was gone with the exception of the fine, blonde hairs that grow near my eyebrows that are barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In reality it&#x27;s very small (a bit wider than a soda can) and the plastic is kind of dinky.  </li>
            <li>In reality it&#x27;s very small (a bit wider than a soda can) and the plastic is kind of dinky.  </li>
            <li>I live in apartment with no microwave</li>
            <li>I was told this product would be new</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find a good Brazilian wax for less than $65, which I am not willing to pay monthly.</li>
            <li>I did somehow end up pulling off being able to wax my legs plus make a large enough mess all over the place and on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it gets warm by a few degree but not enough to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a local spa that had the same type of waxing available, so I haven&#x27;t gone.  </li>
            <li>The wax is a mess, it hardens lightening fast and doesn&#x27;t come off with a clean pull.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the wax came off, and if some of it stuck, I could put a bit of hot wax on top of it, apply the cloth and pull it off, leaving only a few bits of wax that could be scratched off (taking the hair with it) or tweezed off.    </li>
            <li>The wax stays at an even temperature making it much easier to use and the &amp;#34;spatulas&amp;#34; work much better than the little plastic one that came in my last kit.  </li>
            <li>I do like how the heat plate is covered and the entire piece is pretty compact, but it is over priced.</li>
            <li>&quot; Even then, the wax was not runny or hot enough to apply with ease.</li>
            <li>The unit doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product, I spent over 25 bucks on the warmer kit then extras, because I&#x27;ve always liked other Sallie Hansen strip-</li>
            <li>I found one at a local grocery store and bought it assuming the first one I got was just defective.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pretty gross</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to melt all the wax.</li>
            <li>a small amount and apply in the direction of hair growth, in squiggles to make sure it grabs the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial hair removal products to keep my lady beard and unibrow in check, mostly relying on the microwaveable wax until I left it in the microwave too long and killed the microwave.  </li>
            <li>The warmer isn&#x27;t hot enough, so it takes about an hour to heat the wax hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>if you wax frequently you better get this product and do it yourself, because it actually works just like the wax at the Wax Center</li>
            <li>It does take a long time to heat up, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>I suppose you need a little experience in waxing, but it&#x27;s easy to learn.  </li>
            <li>You can even put your sticks back in the wax to clean them off (melt the wax back off of them) before turning the heating unit off.  </li>
            <li>I tried pressing the tin further down into the warmer, making sure the rubber band was where it was supposed to be, poking and prodding the wax, but all to no avail.</li>
            <li>so it was one huge mess.</li>
            <li>Sure it was a little difficult at first making sure it was plugged in, waited a littler than 20 minutes</li>
            <li>The few times i was able to spread even a little, it hardened again too quickly to pick up any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I moved up the rubber ring to the upper part of the tin it sat down into the warmer and actually got warm.</li>
            <li>While the idea of the wax warmer is smart because you don&#x27;t have to reheat in the middle of a waxing session, the wax itself just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Most were positive ones, the negative ones were all basically about the same issue.  </li>
            <li>I think that for the size and price, it&#x27;s a fabulous little gadget.  </li>
            <li>We usually use microwave wax with strips which works fine, and have also used honey and sugar which worked somewhat less fine.  </li>
            <li>Following the suggestions of other reviewers re. wax position and stirring the wax easily heated within 25 min.</li>
            <li>so when the wax gets a little runny turn it off for a bit, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t too short or too long, use baby powder first, and wax.  </li>
            <li>A huge waste of twenty bucks.</li>
            <li>and it was clearly used.  </li>
            <li>Initially I had problems heating the wax, maybe because I plugged it in an extension cord, but when I plugged it directly to the outlet, It melted really fast.</li>
            <li>However, when I really got to waxing the next day it seemed that something happened to the wax.</li>
            <li>I waited over 40 minutes for the wax to completely heat through.  </li>
            <li>how much difference that tiny change made - the wax was ready 5 minutes later.</li>
            <li>however, it was really minimized after i used talcum powder the second time, before waxing.</li>
            <li>B000CCSXFU GiGi Professional Brazilian Waxing Kit]].</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27; say so much for the actual wax</li>
            <li>And if you read that in all of these reviews, why are you surprised?  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s professional use.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but I eventually got the hang of it, and I have probably saved about $200 on professional waxings.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me.</li>
            <li>It is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Its been a couple of months since i bought it, i was busy and could not try it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It grosses my 5 year old son out</li>
            <li>(too early</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the wax completely harden on your skin</li>
            <li>, I boil some water and place the tub of wax in the the water to heat and soften the wax while the warming unit heats up, making the initial heating process MUCH faster.</li>
            <li>I bought a professional warmer at a beauty supply store and never use it.</li>
            <li>- not permanent so if you take too much, your hair will grow back eventually.  </li>
            <li>and we didn&#x27;t want to get this wax anywhere near her</li>
            <li>I had to make cuts in my budget and could not afford to get my Brazilian done professionally every month anymore.  </li>
            <li>Because I had to pick it off kind of slowly, I ended up with red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>A good warmer has a heating element on the sides as well as the bottom, but this has only a thin strip of metal on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This complaint is not very important since it works well regardless of appearance.ery successfully.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t give it less than three stars though because the wax works exactly like it says it does.</li>
            <li>, I mean I have wax so many times</li>
            <li>That particular problem made the microwave kit especially frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall it is a giant waste of money and you&#x27;re better off spending the extra cash to get a real wax pot.</li>
            <li>, maybe this makes me a bad person, but when I go to the coffee shop, I&#x27;ll grab an extra wooden stirrer, as they make excellent applicators for eyebrow waxing since they&#x27;re narrower than what&#x27;s in the kit, and you don&#x27;t want to reuse them as that&#x27;s rather unhygienic.</li>
            <li>The wax didn&#x27;t take long to heat up, but once you&#x27;re ready to start spreading the wax on your skin...</li>
            <li>like I said, do a few at a time, and as long at you can quickly tap without getting stuck, it&#x27;s ready to be flicked and peeled.     </li>
            <li>, it does not contain very much wax, and because of the brittleness, it needs to be applied pretty thickly to peel off at all.</li>
            <li>Just as another person mentioned, you have to push the tin containing the wax down until the O ring (the black rubber ring near the top of the tin)is no longer visible so that the wax warms in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I read the tips noted by those who gave the product 4 or more stars which are, press the can in the canister until you do not see the rubber ring; use talcum powder on skin before you apply; you may want to use cloth strips (which you have to purchase separately), especially for hard to reach areas</li>
            <li>The only issue I had is recently the new wax refills do not heat all the way up, so I am needing to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I just recently moved and was in search for a new person to wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller body areas, but I suspect that it will be much easier to use on, say, my upper lip or eyebrows than trying to get a strip to work.</li>
            <li>I am a hairy guy, and it takes a ton of wax to do the job, if I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to reuse the wax it would have gotten really expensive really fast.    </li>
            <li>left it all day just to check how long it would take, the machine is hot but the wax never melted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>because now it costs me not only money but too much time and gas to get there and back.</li>
            <li>I have a love hate relationship with Sally products but was glad to see this in the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the most success by applying the wax in small sections and peeling it off BEFORE it gets hard.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other hard waxes that stay in one nice strip, this wax has a tendency to break.  </li>
            <li>It was not hot even if you get it straight from the can and put it directly to your skin.</li>
            <li>Doing these things I had very little mess to clean up -- I normally get wax all over the container, my hands, the counter, etc, but this stuff only got on my hands--because I tested the wax with my fingertips to ensure that it wasn&#x27;t too hot before use.</li>
            <li>I came here and was SO surprised to see all the negative reviews, kinda baffled really because my experience has been overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li>It hurts a hell of a lot less, takes a lot less time, and you get a better quality wax.    </li>
            <li>The wax does not heat up high enough, even after almost two hours and never melts enough to spread.</li>
            <li>It may take a little longer than 25 mins to melt, just make sure the wax container is pressed down into the unit.  </li>
            <li>The wax at the bottom was hot while the top cold, so by mixing it it solved that problem</li>
            <li>I appreciate having heated wax near by instead of having to rush before it solidifies or constantly run to the microwave to melt the stuff.    </li>
            <li>As recommended by reviews I pushed the wax tin as far into the warmer as I could to get it to heat properly, which it did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing my brows/stache since like grad school, when I could barely afford to add on a wax at the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>have done only the brazilian so far</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how much money I would have spent if I&#x27;d gone to the salon rather than used this each time.</li>
            <li>I kept applying the wax too thin and/or waiting too long to remove and it would kind of shatter as I pulled if off.</li>
            <li>I tried to apply wax over that to pick it up, and what resulted was leaving behind even more debris and wax that would not come up.</li>
            <li>It took a little trial and error to get the technique right.</li>
            <li>During my first attempt, I sat waiting for an hour for the wax to heat up just to realize that the tin wasn&#x27;t pushed down all the way</li>
            <li>I started out with very small areas, but towards the end I was getting better at applying a long strip at once.</li>
            <li>Since I have a peach fuzz situation, some hairs are too short/long to be pulled out by the wax, but it takes enough off to make a big difference in appearance and makes the long ones much easier to find with tweezers afterward.  </li>
            <li>Since I have a peach fuzz situation, some hairs are too short/long to be pulled out by the wax, but it takes enough off to make a big difference in appearance and makes the long ones much easier to find with tweezers afterward.  </li>
            <li>Once when I had my underarms professionally done, it did not hurt and I had hair growing back the next couple of days.  </li>
            <li>The wax is easy to use, and if you pull it off before it completely hardens it gets almost all the hair and no wax is left behind.</li>
            <li>You also need to pull it off at the right time -- not too early or too late.</li>
            <li>So I gave the wax warmer a try, and on the first go round</li>
            <li>It was stiff and I was only able to get a little bit out to use.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with this warmer is that it is not quiet warm enough so the wax still a little too thick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin.</li>
            <li>Not long enough,</li>
            <li>and it was still pretty thick (not easy to stir, dried quickly and was very stringy when taking the wax out).</li>
            <li>I plug it a little before getting in the shower, and is ready when I am post-shower prepped.  </li>
            <li>Only my underarm and pubic area is dark, but I don&#x27;t particularly mind.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a nice little heating unit, I hated having to keep running back to the microwave to reheat wax.  </li>
            <li>In my pubic area, it grows back SO fast and ugly, and I can&#x27;t even shave more than once every 5 days, if that.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I think this is great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product, but there are two reasons I docked the item</li>
            <li> Follow these directions and you will be happy!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s was perfect, it all depends how you use it.</li>
            <li> This is where practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li> Again, practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li> I will probably give it another try, when it&#x27;s time, and practice will make perfect.</li>
            <li> Best wax there is...</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it though, it&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li> and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> The wax itself was great!</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed with this product.</li>

            <li> If you use it according to the directions it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Lol!</li>
            <li> Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> to the amount of hair removed by the wax, I can&#x27;t weigh in very successfully.  </li>
            <li> This kit is excellent for waxing at home, at a good price.</li>
            <li> being said, I think the product is great.</li>
            <li> but besides that I was happy.</li>
            <li> If anyone could give suggestions that would be great.</li>

            <li> for me is great.</li>
            <li> It worked great</li>
            <li> Another great tip: go to Sally Beauty Supply and buy yourself a can of Numbing spray and their wax strips.</li>
            <li> but this works great for me</li>
            <li> It works great in ripping out all the unsightly hairs and keeps my beard and mustache</li>
            <li> My wax heats up in no  time and the experience is great...</li>
            <li> The results are great</li>
            <li> This product would have been great if the warmer got hotter.</li>

            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> works great, the wife loves it</li>
            <li> , it was great.</li>
            <li> issue isn&#x27;t the wax itself - that&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s always been.</li>
            <li> and I love it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I&#x27;ve found this product!!</li>
            <li> or it will stick and not feel good at all.  </li>
            <li> This wax is really good</li>
            <li> , that way you can get a good grip to pull it off.    </li>
            <li> The instructions had some good suggestions, like putting talcum powder on your skin/hair before applying the wax.  </li>
            <li> This warmer warms the wax, but does not allow it to get to a good workable temperature.</li>
            <li> IT DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li> Additionally the wax smells good.</li>
            <li> Good to go.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the results.  </li>
            <li> I have successfully waxed my own hair before, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the kit.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Works great, practically pain free, pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t get wax all over the counter.</li>
            <li> when you get it onto your skin you have to pick the exact perfect time to remove it-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m here to buy more!</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this product!</li>
            <li> Hi bought it to make my life easier and this product is great easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Once it is applied to the &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; places, it does a great job of removing the hair and it is smooth for about a week before it starts to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing -- like a dessert.</li>
            <li> There was nothing I could do to make this product easy-to use or effective.</li>
            <li> has its own warmer and 2.</li>
            <li> It heated up in about 30-40 minutes, and I used it on my underarms since I honestly can&#x27;t do brazilians on my own.  </li>
            <li> It took me 1.5 hours to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li> and now I can wax my eyebrows in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to address popular complaints, for those who are wondering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use your own warmer</li>
            <li> I put the wax tin into the warmer with the ring around the lower part of the tin and it wouldn&#x27;t really warm up.</li>
            <li> The warmer does take a while to warm up (the instruction guide says 25 minutes).</li>
            <li> Really the best wax kit ever!</li>
            <li> I take care of my own waxing needs for pennies that would cost me a ton at the salon.</li>
            <li> It gets warm but doesn&#x27;t melt the wax.</li>
            <li> will never buy another home spa waxing kit of any kind again.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another home spa waxing kit of any kind again.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because it takes foreveeeeeerrr for the wax to be warm.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> - wax takes some time to warm up</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend unless they were experienced with waxing both at home and salon to be familiar with the level of pain</li>
            <li> I felt like I was slathering a sweet fondue sauce on myself lol.     </li>
            <li> It still works the same and wonderfully well; gets a good percentage of the hair, no strips to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> It was also very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the wax warm in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the warmer because I can turn it on to warm up and by the time I am done my shower I can use it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> It was SOO easy and removed everything!  </li>
            <li> you can push the top layer with the provided sticks and you will see the melted wax rise up, wait 5 more mins and take the wax that are closest to the sides as these parts is where the really warm wax that you want is located.</li>
            <li> Running to the microwave is much more time effective than sitting around 3 hours or more to have the wax soften.  </li>
            <li> Another reason is that although this product is great, it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find a kit with it&#x27;s own heater for a good price!  </li>
            <li> Also I make sure to clean my face really good afterwards to prevent the redness.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Pull the wax quickly and apply pressure to the area!!    </li>
            <li> And the wax is a very cheap quality.  </li>
            <li> I wanted an at-home wax kit that would be easy and effective.</li>
            <li> I slathered the wax on my underarm making sure to leave a \\&quot;lip\\&quot; to pull the wax.  </li>
            <li> I actually love it</li>
            <li> Instead of coming off in a strip when you pulled, it was more like pulling taffy apart.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I guess it worked ok</li>
            <li> , you just have to make sure the hair you plan to wax it</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or bumps :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many wax and hair removal products.</li>
            <li> The bikini line was better than the underarms but had more redness.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts, but not any more than it did at the salon.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use any streeps.</li>
            <li> it works great for me, I wish I would have known before and instead of wasting $20 on the whole kit</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even get MOST of the hair out.</li>
            <li> This worked MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I found that I got better results when I used one spatula stick to load up another one, for 3-4 inches of length, by the time I got the wax spread out on the stick</li>
            <li> Using strips with the stuff works much better, but that defeats the purpose of using a stripless wax doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> Would be better if it had strips.</li>
            <li> but you get more than twice the product.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need strips.</li>
            <li> Supply  and bought the GiGi HoneyBee Microwave kit which is awesome and only 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> It is most likely the best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The GiGi wax also came with prep, wax remover, and after wax supplies, much better buy than this thing.</li>
            <li> I was worried about doing this myself because I have never used waxing products before and wasn&#x27;t sure what</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product and will continue to buy refills.</li>
            <li> I love the Sally Hansen Wax.</li>
            <li> Love this kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a much better price than I could find in Wal-Mart or anywhere else in town.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always glad to have a Prime account.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li> I do not know why so many people had problems.</li>
            <li> It obviously was not salon quality, but was perfect for maintaining my brows and lip!</li>
            <li> I probably will not buy more wax once this runs out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am happy to find a product like this product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> At $20, I wasn&#x27;t sure, but got it anyway.</li>
            <li> When it came time to use it, I immediately fell in love.     </li>
            <li> Just make sure that the skin is taut.     </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I think it was about one hour or maybe more.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the perfect product to keep me from running back and forth</li>
            <li> Make sure the tin is pushed all the way into the warmer.  </li>
            <li> It only takes about 20 mins to heat up and it works great!!</li>
            <li> like what most reviewers say here, it does take forever to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> Something else I liked about this wax is that it&#x27;s more environmentally friendly</li>
            <li> , how warm the wax should be, direction to pull off and clean up.</li>
            <li> Love this, it warms up quickly and keeps warm.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I paid $20 for this I wasn&#x27;t really expecting amazing things from it.</li>
            <li> I can see how it would be easy to get drops of wax on the counter, etc., but I just twirl the applicator a lot to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen.    </li>
            <li> After many hours browsing on the web looking for a solution to get smooth armpits, I decided to try waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep using it to get a good feel for when the wax is ready to be pulled off.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply (I used toothpicks for a more accurate application), the wax cooled quickly, and the wax was very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think most people don&#x27;t realize that the wax is well heated on the bottom but to get the top heated you have to get some of that hot wax from the bottom on the top</li>
            <li> Do not leave the lid on to cool!</li>
            <li> I know any brazilian waxing hurts, but this stuff did not come off as easily as the wax in the salons.</li>
            <li> once you can mix the wax, it never heats to a consistency that spreads easily-</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and just pull off with your fingers and no strips.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re at the end of the area, swoop it around so the end can easily be flicked up.</li>
            <li> I apply 5 or 6 at a time and get it done very quickly.     </li>
            <li> Easy to use and saves time and money.</li>
            <li> This Sally Hansen was was so easy to use, one I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove from my skin and surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Wax does not spread easily .</li>
            <li> This is evenly heated, and dries evenly, so it stays pretty tidy.  </li>
            <li> I loved it its just what I was looking for ,leaves your skin so soft ,and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> The wax itself is nice, hardens fast and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> positive thing about it is that it has a very gentle and pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there was still a huge clump of unmelted wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store thinking it would be great.  </li>
            <li> I waited about 35 minute for it to melt well, when I used it all my hairs got off on my arm and eyebrows- smooth and free.</li>
            <li> They never work - you spend more time trying to get reasonable results in the time you can be completely finished with good results with better products.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT STICKY, it leaves no sticky residue, which is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> but I seem to be growing a beard in my advanced age.</li>
            <li> area smooth for about 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li> No doubt actually going to a salon would improve the results, but for the money ($13 when I bought it) this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li> No doubt actually going to a salon would improve the results, but for the money ($13 when I bought it) this is a great choice.  </li>
            <li> made my skin feel smooth and moisturized..</li>
            <li> It was messing, but easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be much easier to regulate the wax temperature and keep it warm until I was done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you could reuse it 4 or 5 times if your hair is light.</li>
            <li> The wax is fabulous</li>
            <li> - cheap (my can lasted over a year doing eyebrows every 4-6 weeks)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, so you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the microwave wax, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come with solvent to clean it off of skin, and it doesn&#x27;t come off easily if at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either.</li>
            <li> It is great and definitely removes all of the hair!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, not messy, the wax smells good, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and no wax strips needed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get it to warm up faster by pressing the tin all the way down, as suggested by others, but I learned that after waiting about 30 minutes for it to warm up.  </li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing the bliss poetic waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited, read the directions, and kept checking on the wax.</li>
            <li> Doing this will shorten the heating time significantly, making this a usable product.    </li>
            <li> The wax works pretty cleanly, much better than all of my experiences with wax strips and Nads (shudder).  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this when learned about it.</li>
            <li> It does take about an hour the first time for it to heat up but after that its quick and easy!</li>
            <li> and I was excited about it,</li>
            <li> So, make sure it is not too hot when you apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I use this product specially to wax my arms and bikini, and it&#x27;s great, my hair is less tick, just love</li>
            <li> Save the chips on a clean piece of wax paper and after you&#x27;re done, pack them into the jar and leave it on until they&#x27;re melted, then turn if off or keep going.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, doing a few patch tests, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was able to continue waxing until I was finished with very consistently-heated wax.  </li>
            <li> so when I found this I said cool.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product locally thinking the \\&quot;stripless\\&quot; concept was a good one.</li>
            <li> I love this product - mostly because the wax is ready and STAYS ready without having to deal with microwaving, or anything else.  </li>
            <li> sure the rubber strip on the container can&#x27;t be seen (people complain about it not heating up fast)    </li>
            <li> -You don&#x27;t need to wait forever for them to cool,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only as good as the person using it.  </li>
            <li> Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product.</li>
            <li> Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do.</li>
            <li> Heated quickly, spread easily, worked exactly like the microwavable kit.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is so worth it, it is a good product, and I already have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Once I figured this out, the wax became gooey really quick.</li>
            <li> It was super quick to do my underarms.</li>
            <li> and I read the directions many times from different sources and even read the reviews to make sure</li>
            <li> Also, doing it in the direction of the hair, and then quickly going over it all squiggly helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years for all my facial hair removal and it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Also, the wax gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very fun working with hot wax.    </li>
            <li> After realizing that I had to push the black band all the way into the warmer, it works great.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works well, and for around $20, 6 months is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good for smaller areas, and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying the replacement wax for this unit once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I had some cloth strips I bought at the beauty supply shop, originally for the honey wax, and I tried applying the hot wax, then applying the cloth strip, and then pulling the wax off using the cloth strip.  </li>
            <li> help the warmer, I place a folded dry washcloth over the top of the can to help keep more of the heat within the wax can.</li>
            <li> There was some melted wax underneath the clump so after making a huge mess I got to the wax and all was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known many people that have this little waxing kit, have used them myself, and actually own one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (warmer, wax, instructions and wooden \\&quot;spatulas (popsicle sticks would be more accurate a description) into the trash can.      </li>
            <li> It appears that there are a lot of low scores for this product because \\&quot;it takes forever to warm the wax\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> just warm enough to use.</li>
            <li> So many of the one star reviews sound the same to me</li>
            <li> Once finished with waxing, then used some of the warm wax to get rid of the cooled wax left on my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought that if I even did it 3 times it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Bought this item contemplating whether spending 20 dollars on it would be worth my while.</li>
            <li> If its not working for you, make sure you take off the wax before it completely hardens.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I will pay the extra 10 bucks to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> It was even effective on a man&#x27;s facial hair, after he had grown out his \\&quot;beard\\&quot; for a week.  </li>
            <li> , it took a bit of resourcefulness to make it work well, but was worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth</li>
            <li> The box was crumbles and clearly taped and the top.  </li>
            <li> You could plug it in today and it may be warm enough by Christmas to melt the wax, but probably not.  </li>
            <li> I ended up dumping the wax from this into one of my old microwave safe containers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The time it takes to heat the wax up is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my Eyebrows and legs and it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This unit works well to keep the wax warm, but not to initially heat the wax as it states on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you plan to do that it&#x27;s a good idea to start from the least hairy areas and then move to waxing the most hairy areas.    </li>
            <li> The warmer doesn&#x27;t warm the wax up enough to make it useable.</li>
            <li> So I moved on to the next step, doing my own.  </li>
            <li> The more you use (the more empty the container gets), the shorter the time it takes to melt.</li>
            <li> So, make sure you plan ahead and have time to wait for the wax to melt completely.</li>
            <li> As long as you find the right amount of time to leave the wax on without letting it harden too much, using this wax should be easy and effective.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used to go to the European Wax Center and it was awesome until I released how much money I was expending every 4 weeks or so for a brazilian and  full legs waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes a difference too whether or not the wax is the right temperature when you apply it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I determined that this was the right kit with the right</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it and the warmer is not working right.</li>
            <li> ANy positive reviews of this product have got to be plants!  </li>
            <li> One trick is to make sure the rubber ring around the wax can makes a tight seal inside the warmer so that it fits right on top of the heating element.  </li>
            <li> Overall though,  great kit and has saved me many trips to the salon to tame my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> With a little repetition, you get the feel for how big you can make a &amp;#34;Strip&amp;#34; and when and how to best pull it off before it</li>
            <li> After the wax came off, I moisturized with coconut oil and now my skin is very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It did remove some hair and left the area very smooth..  </li>
            <li> This was really easy to use, unlike the one that you need to microwave, the only problem was it dries up on the spatula so quickly.</li>
            <li> When there isn&#x27;t very much, or when it&#x27;s all melted, it gets hot.</li>
            <li> Tipping the solid wax on top into the melted wax below also helps.    </li>
            <li> I tried it first on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> But it really pulls hair!  </li>
            <li> The warmer is not working like it did at first, and even after an hour of heating the wax is not fully melted.</li>
            <li> This is the first strip-less home waxing kit I have seen.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use baby powder before you apply the wax, makes a big difference with the wax coming off easier.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it DID work the first time.</li>
            <li> The wax takes about 30 min to heat and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot -</li>
            <li> This is the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, so I have nothing to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> First, it took an hour for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> This was my first time waxing by myself and I have never waxed my bikini area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of wax varieties, but this is the first I&#x27;ve tried that 1.</li>
            <li> The tin got hot but there was no effect on the wax whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It was ALMOST painless when i did it with talcum powder first before waxing C.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced by this from a friend, I was talking to her about always wanting to get a wax but never got the chance.</li>
            <li> After asking around, there were so many mixed reviews that I decided to do my eyebrows myself.</li>
            <li> Next time I will be more patient.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have purchased off of Amazon that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it&#x27;s best for small jobs or spot waxing- pits, faces, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the wax scalding hot, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself with it, and it&#x27;s probably not going to catch on fire if you forget about it.  </li>
            <li> but, then I heard that all you had to do is make sure its placed properly (to where you can&#x27;t see the rubber).</li>
            <li> This product might be Ok if you knew that next Friday you wanted to wax.  </li>
            <li> The wax itself even seems to be of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to do my face several times over before running out.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to do my face several times over before running out.  </li>
            <li> it will slide around, revealing the molten wax at the very bottom!)</li>
            <li> I did remove the rubber piece first though.</li>
            <li> The box came pretty banged up so that might be a reason why it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but hour after hour I slipped more maddeningly into remorse and desperation and finally I tried to shave the s</li>
            <li> I first used it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it took almost 3 hours to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had more success with melted wax products than with wax strips, which always left behind too much hair, &amp; it&#x27;s much more convenient &amp; effective if the wax is continuously heated.</li>
            <li> the wax is warm not hot.</li>
            <li> The wax is just like other waxes of its kind.</li>
            <li> There are many other hard wax or stripless at-home waxing kits that are much more effective.</li>
            <li> The cheap, easily shorted warmer on the other hand?</li>
            <li> The plug in heater is really way more convenient than having to make trips back and forth to the microwave.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair was much longer than it usually needs to be for successful waxing, the wax didn&#x27;t pick up all of the hair in any of the areas that I used it on.</li>
            <li> Needs a little practice to get used to shaping the eyebrows, but is pretty cool :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it as easy on small places like  my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m getting better with practice.  </li>
            <li> Got fully undressed first, so I could go straight to the shower.</li>
            <li> Once I had the wax heated up I tested a strip on my husbands leg hair first to see if it really works like it says it should.</li>
            <li> Like many others who have purchased this product, I had a problem with the wax taking an extremely long time to melt.  </li>
            <li> They make it possible to cover a much larger area much more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Many are complaining that it takes too long to heat.</li>
            <li> While it was heating up, I read reviews and pretty much everyone hates it.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with waxing this product is well worth it, for a personal use.  </li>
            <li> There is a small light that comes on so make sure it is on - should be heating then.</li>
            <li> It took far too long to warm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in the warmer unit just buy the wax refills and warm it up in hot water this way</li>
            <li> and I love not having a single hair in my arms or legs</li>
            <li> Had to tighten my budget but didn&#x27;t want to give up certain beauty treatments</li>
            <li> and I find the wax strips sometimes don&#x27;t work well in certain area.  </li>
            <li> It does take a bit longer than 25 minutes to melt completely, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me, and it does get VERY HOT, so use caution.  </li>
            <li> I have been to European Wax center in california several times to get a full brazilian and they are great and their wax is just like the one sold in this product.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re good with stuff like this, follow our instructions, (not Sally&#x27;s those are kinda vague), and you&#x27;ll be super pumped at the fact you just saved $10!</li>
            <li> The wax itself, provided you get it hot enough, is nothing special.</li>
            <li> Refill kits don&#x27;t look to be too expensive and if I&#x27;m feeling bold I can always find a recipe to make my own and refill the original tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Refill kits don&#x27;t look to be too expensive and if I&#x27;m feeling bold I can always find a recipe to make my own and refill the original tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 20 minutes, the wax was evenly heated and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> but it must be getting ready to be discontinued because I can&#x27;t find the wax refills anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I threw the whole thing out.</li>
            <li> I have had laser hair removal treatments both places, so I do not have much hair to remove.</li>
            <li> The problem is that metal on metal doesn&#x27;t conduct heat very well, put some conductor in there</li>
            <li> you dont have to wait for the whole thing to melt, after 15 mins</li>
            <li> lastly, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to the salon and have someone see your body parts.</li>
            <li> Its been 5 hours and it still isn&#x27;t ready.  </li>
            <li> The wax thickens really well and pulls out almost ALL the hair in one try.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing the wax strip, it was a very noticeable difference, both on my face and on the wax strip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s really small&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sticky and gooey and doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the box was very mistreated and there were no popsicle sticks included...</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need to wait for the whole thing to melt before using--</li>
            <li> Do it fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather do my pampering and upkeep at home and this product makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> The wax will be ready in 20-30 min.</li>
            <li> Buy yourself a $5 candle warmer and get your wax ready much faster.</li>
            <li> It never pulls off in one whole strip it always breaks.</li>
            <li> It will heat up much faster.</li>
            <li> It keeps you from going to and from the microwave as much.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows fill in much faster than my hair grows.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It would, of course, be better if it washed off with soap and water like a sugar wax, but it only took me baby oil and a soft brush to get it all off.</li>
            <li> However this warmer seems to not get warm enough to actually melt all the wax!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 7:41 PM the next day they wax is only slightly warm not melted yet.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and firm and comes off in one piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of great things on Amazon, but this was a complete waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li> I bought this and just like many of the other people said, it did not heat up</li>
            <li> , it was cool enough to apply without too much difficulty.    </li>
            <li> so you can pull it off easily, and wait like 30 seconds for it to kinda dry.  </li>
            <li> Had the same problems others did with long warm up time.</li>
            <li> and then it cools down too fast to get most of the work done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply beyond my imagination how they can make a product that heats this little can of cosmetic wax so thoroughly, so sincerely, and so genuinely.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work to its full potential.</li>
            <li> Actually, in regards to size, it IS a bit impractical for full leg waxing, although I have done it.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use my own warmer, but I threw it away when it broke.</li>
            <li> Well, it takes about an hour to melt the wax and will not melt fast enough some of the wax you already used so most probably you will not get the job done with only one can</li>
            <li> It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the can in and made sure the black rubber thing was covered</li>
            <li> As the fuzz-forest grows thicker it has a greater impact on the application of make-up, causing my face to have an odd post-foundation texture.  </li>
            <li> I had been waxing for several years, strip-less European wax, at my favorite salon House of Wax in Cooper City, FL.</li>
            <li> warmer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax consistently.</li>
            <li> I stir frequently, and switch off the unit for a few minutes at a time when it&#x27;s getting too warm.</li>
            <li> Get the Gigi space saver, same size and heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is almost the same and it would cost me more to ship this back than to just throw it away.</li>
            <li> You stir the wax to get it going, the warmer does not hold a steady temp</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have a steady hand to use this product.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t reco putting your bare hands on it, the cup only gets warm, so I was able to just push it back down with my hands without any burning or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> It takes an hour to even get the wax warm enough to stir, and no matter how long you leave it on it never gets as hot as it should be for proper hair removal.</li>
            <li> The price of a good spa and the satisfaction of the results is far less \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; than several hours of hell and torment of trying to use this product.r</li>
            <li> The price of a good spa and the satisfaction of the results is far less \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; than several hours of hell and torment of trying to use this product.</li>
            <li> After waiting the 25 minutes for the wax to warm up it was still hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to waxing my legs, so I expected a bit of a mess and hair removal isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and applied to clean dry sweat-free skin.</li>
            <li> would say I started waxing with about 50% of the wax completely melted, and I noticed that the wax was very stringy.</li>
            <li> I did make sure the hair was long enough.</li>
            <li> However, I found out that the wax can be reused with no problem, as long as you aren&#x27;t grossed out by using wax that is already full of hair :</li>
            <li> I have used other sally hansen waxing products before and they were fine-</li>
            <li> There are plenty of wax products available for less than $10 that can be ready in minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> That being said, if you have experience waxing and can do it well enough, maybe this stuff is right for you.</li>
            <li> And if you can suffer through the extra pain and get it done right, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> It also keeps the wax at the right consistency the entire time</li>
            <li> I found that when I&#x27;m using a new tin of wax, after 25 minutes it seems like it still isn&#x27;t warm, but if I poke through the upper level of wax, the bottom half is all melted and usable.</li>
            <li> A majority of my hair was gone with the exception of the fine, blonde hairs that grow near my eyebrows that are barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In reality it&#x27;s very small (a bit wider than a soda can) and the plastic is kind of dinky.  </li>

            <li> I live in apartment with no microwave</li>
            <li> I was told this product would be new</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find a good Brazilian wax for less than $65, which I am not willing to pay monthly.</li>
            <li> I did somehow end up pulling off being able to wax my legs plus make a large enough mess all over the place and on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it gets warm by a few degree but not enough to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a local spa that had the same type of waxing available, so I haven&#x27;t gone.  </li>
            <li> The wax is a mess, it hardens lightening fast and doesn&#x27;t come off with a clean pull.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the wax came off, and if some of it stuck, I could put a bit of hot wax on top of it, apply the cloth and pull it off, leaving only a few bits of wax that could be scratched off (taking the hair with it) or tweezed off.    </li>
            <li> The wax stays at an even temperature making it much easier to use and the &amp;#34;spatulas&amp;#34; work much better than the little plastic one that came in my last kit.  </li>
            <li> I do like how the heat plate is covered and the entire piece is pretty compact, but it is over priced.</li>
            <li> &quot; Even then, the wax was not runny or hot enough to apply with ease.</li>
            <li> The unit doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, I spent over 25 bucks on the warmer kit then extras, because I&#x27;ve always liked other Sallie Hansen strip-</li>
            <li> I found one at a local grocery store and bought it assuming the first one I got was just defective.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pretty gross</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to melt all the wax.</li>
            <li> a small amount and apply in the direction of hair growth, in squiggles to make sure it grabs the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial hair removal products to keep my lady beard and unibrow in check, mostly relying on the microwaveable wax until I left it in the microwave too long and killed the microwave.  </li>
            <li> The warmer isn&#x27;t hot enough, so it takes about an hour to heat the wax hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> if you wax frequently you better get this product and do it yourself, because it actually works just like the wax at the Wax Center</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to heat up, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> I suppose you need a little experience in waxing, but it&#x27;s easy to learn.  </li>
            <li> You can even put your sticks back in the wax to clean them off (melt the wax back off of them) before turning the heating unit off.  </li>
            <li> I tried pressing the tin further down into the warmer, making sure the rubber band was where it was supposed to be, poking and prodding the wax, but all to no avail.</li>
            <li> so it was one huge mess.</li>
            <li> Sure it was a little difficult at first making sure it was plugged in, waited a littler than 20 minutes</li>
            <li> The few times i was able to spread even a little, it hardened again too quickly to pick up any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I moved up the rubber ring to the upper part of the tin it sat down into the warmer and actually got warm.</li>
            <li> While the idea of the wax warmer is smart because you don&#x27;t have to reheat in the middle of a waxing session, the wax itself just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Most were positive ones, the negative ones were all basically about the same issue.  </li>
            <li> I think that for the size and price, it&#x27;s a fabulous little gadget.  </li>
            <li> We usually use microwave wax with strips which works fine, and have also used honey and sugar which worked somewhat less fine.  </li>
            <li> Following the suggestions of other reviewers re. wax position and stirring the wax easily heated within 25 min.</li>
            <li> so when the wax gets a little runny turn it off for a bit, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t too short or too long, use baby powder first, and wax.  </li>
            <li> A huge waste of twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> and it was clearly used.  </li>
            <li> Initially I had problems heating the wax, maybe because I plugged it in an extension cord, but when I plugged it directly to the outlet, It melted really fast.</li>
            <li> However, when I really got to waxing the next day it seemed that something happened to the wax.</li>
            <li> I waited over 40 minutes for the wax to completely heat through.  </li>
            <li> how much difference that tiny change made - the wax was ready 5 minutes later.</li>
            <li> however, it was really minimized after i used talcum powder the second time, before waxing.</li>
            <li> B000CCSXFU GiGi Professional Brazilian Waxing Kit]].</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27; say so much for the actual wax</li>
            <li> And if you read that in all of these reviews, why are you surprised?  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s professional use.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but I eventually got the hang of it, and I have probably saved about $200 on professional waxings.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me.</li>
            <li> It is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Its been a couple of months since i bought it, i was busy and could not try it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It grosses my 5 year old son out</li>
            <li> (too early</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the wax completely harden on your skin</li>
            <li> , I boil some water and place the tub of wax in the the water to heat and soften the wax while the warming unit heats up, making the initial heating process MUCH faster.</li>
            <li> I bought a professional warmer at a beauty supply store and never use it.</li>
            <li> - not permanent so if you take too much, your hair will grow back eventually.  </li>
            <li> and we didn&#x27;t want to get this wax anywhere near her</li>
            <li> I had to make cuts in my budget and could not afford to get my Brazilian done professionally every month anymore.  </li>
            <li> Because I had to pick it off kind of slowly, I ended up with red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> A good warmer has a heating element on the sides as well as the bottom, but this has only a thin strip of metal on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This complaint is not very important since it works well regardless of appearance.ery successfully.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t give it less than three stars though because the wax works exactly like it says it does.</li>
            <li> , I mean I have wax so many times</li>
            <li> That particular problem made the microwave kit especially frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall it is a giant waste of money and you&#x27;re better off spending the extra cash to get a real wax pot.</li>
            <li> , maybe this makes me a bad person, but when I go to the coffee shop, I&#x27;ll grab an extra wooden stirrer, as they make excellent applicators for eyebrow waxing since they&#x27;re narrower than what&#x27;s in the kit, and you don&#x27;t want to reuse them as that&#x27;s rather unhygienic.</li>
            <li> The wax didn&#x27;t take long to heat up, but once you&#x27;re ready to start spreading the wax on your skin...</li>
            <li> like I said, do a few at a time, and as long at you can quickly tap without getting stuck, it&#x27;s ready to be flicked and peeled.     </li>
            <li> , it does not contain very much wax, and because of the brittleness, it needs to be applied pretty thickly to peel off at all.</li>
            <li> Just as another person mentioned, you have to push the tin containing the wax down until the O ring (the black rubber ring near the top of the tin)is no longer visible so that the wax warms in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I read the tips noted by those who gave the product 4 or more stars which are, press the can in the canister until you do not see the rubber ring; use talcum powder on skin before you apply; you may want to use cloth strips (which you have to purchase separately), especially for hard to reach areas</li>
            <li> The only issue I had is recently the new wax refills do not heat all the way up, so I am needing to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I just recently moved and was in search for a new person to wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller body areas, but I suspect that it will be much easier to use on, say, my upper lip or eyebrows than trying to get a strip to work.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy, and it takes a ton of wax to do the job, if I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to reuse the wax it would have gotten really expensive really fast.    </li>
            <li> left it all day just to check how long it would take, the machine is hot but the wax never melted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> because now it costs me not only money but too much time and gas to get there and back.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with Sally products but was glad to see this in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the most success by applying the wax in small sections and peeling it off BEFORE it gets hard.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other hard waxes that stay in one nice strip, this wax has a tendency to break.  </li>
            <li> It was not hot even if you get it straight from the can and put it directly to your skin.</li>
            <li> Doing these things I had very little mess to clean up -- I normally get wax all over the container, my hands, the counter, etc, but this stuff only got on my hands--because I tested the wax with my fingertips to ensure that it wasn&#x27;t too hot before use.</li>
            <li> I came here and was SO surprised to see all the negative reviews, kinda baffled really because my experience has been overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> It hurts a hell of a lot less, takes a lot less time, and you get a better quality wax.    </li>
            <li> The wax does not heat up high enough, even after almost two hours and never melts enough to spread.</li>
            <li> It may take a little longer than 25 mins to melt, just make sure the wax container is pressed down into the unit.  </li>
            <li> The wax at the bottom was hot while the top cold, so by mixing it it solved that problem</li>
            <li> I appreciate having heated wax near by instead of having to rush before it solidifies or constantly run to the microwave to melt the stuff.    </li>
            <li> As recommended by reviews I pushed the wax tin as far into the warmer as I could to get it to heat properly, which it did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my brows/stache since like grad school, when I could barely afford to add on a wax at the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> have done only the brazilian so far</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how much money I would have spent if I&#x27;d gone to the salon rather than used this each time.</li>
            <li> I kept applying the wax too thin and/or waiting too long to remove and it would kind of shatter as I pulled if off.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply wax over that to pick it up, and what resulted was leaving behind even more debris and wax that would not come up.</li>
            <li> It took a little trial and error to get the technique right.</li>
            <li> During my first attempt, I sat waiting for an hour for the wax to heat up just to realize that the tin wasn&#x27;t pushed down all the way</li>
            <li> I started out with very small areas, but towards the end I was getting better at applying a long strip at once.</li>
            <li> Since I have a peach fuzz situation, some hairs are too short/long to be pulled out by the wax, but it takes enough off to make a big difference in appearance and makes the long ones much easier to find with tweezers afterward.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a peach fuzz situation, some hairs are too short/long to be pulled out by the wax, but it takes enough off to make a big difference in appearance and makes the long ones much easier to find with tweezers afterward.  </li>
            <li> Once when I had my underarms professionally done, it did not hurt and I had hair growing back the next couple of days.  </li>
            <li> The wax is easy to use, and if you pull it off before it completely hardens it gets almost all the hair and no wax is left behind.</li>
            <li> You also need to pull it off at the right time -- not too early or too late.</li>
            <li> So I gave the wax warmer a try, and on the first go round</li>
            <li> It was stiff and I was only able to get a little bit out to use.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this warmer is that it is not quiet warm enough so the wax still a little too thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not long enough,</li>
            <li> and it was still pretty thick (not easy to stir, dried quickly and was very stringy when taking the wax out).</li>
            <li> I plug it a little before getting in the shower, and is ready when I am post-shower prepped.  </li>
            <li> Only my underarm and pubic area is dark, but I don&#x27;t particularly mind.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a nice little heating unit, I hated having to keep running back to the microwave to reheat wax.  </li>
            <li> In my pubic area, it grows back SO fast and ugly, and I can&#x27;t even shave more than once every 5 days, if that.</li>
            <li> The usual complaint was that it took too long to warm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on this result, maybe my theory is right about Sally Hansen wax&#x27;s not having a low melting point since I have a completely different experience with GiGi all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of returning it to the store when I decided to search online and discovered from other reviews here that I hadn&#x27;t pushed the wax far enough into the warmer.</li>
            <li> Now the warmer unit is completly useless, some times it takes about 4 hours to warm up the wax, other times just doesn&#x27;t do it at all.</li>
            <li> Mine heated up in less than the prescribed 25 mins, because I pushed the tin as far in as it would go and made sure to give it the wax hard mix about halfway through (stab it with your spatula a few times and poke the edges against the wall of the</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it (apply a little thicker, leave a lip at the bottom, pull off before it&#x27;s totally solid), it&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my underarms with pretty good results (though shaving is just plain easier and less painful, especially during the winter) and it worked for that as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax should still be a little soft to touch but should be solid enough to rip off.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this kit hoping that it would be a little better than the Honey Wax solutions, which seems to leave about 1/2 the hair behind.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t take 25 minutes to heat up like the instructions say (which is long enough as it is).</li>
            <li> The key to not having stuck wax is to not wait too long...</li>
            <li> That is the key, if you wait too long it wont adhere to the strip.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wait long enough and it wont pull up the hair.  </li>
            <li> Based on my online research, all I could think about was that maybe Sally Hansen wax didn&#x27;t have a low melting point, and that was why it took so long to melt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first sight you might think it&#x27;s not ready yet, but then use one of the sticks and push down or sideways (careful because some of the wax may spill, that happened to me).</li>
            <li> This product was a complete let down.</li>
            <li> Turn the lid upside down and completely cover the opening.</li>
            <li> i think I should start by saying that I have some previous experience waxing myself, I am far of being a pro, but have done it a bunch of time.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I have heavy facial hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I believe reviewers who are having trouble with heating are not putting the canister into the heater far enough.</li>
            <li> Put wax paper down over the area, down put too much on the stick, and wipe off the excess on the can.     </li>
            <li> Other waxes didn&#x27;t remove the hair at all and still left me very red and irritated.</li>
            <li> it should still be a little soft (not sticking to your fingers though)...</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but what I ended up doing was removing the little rubber ring, and getting the bottom of the wax tin directly on the heating element inside the warmer.</li>
            <li> Just a little warning to test on an inconspicuous spot if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And it was just so much more painful and left my skin so red.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get much hair, too late</li>
            <li> This is a COMPLETE waste of money.</li>
            <li> &quot; long or it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> You have to wait for it to harden a bit when you apply, but don&#x27;t wait too long</li>
            <li> (I was a long way from finishing both legs when I ran out</li>
            <li> So overall we spent about 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> wait too long</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a bit of learning curve, you have to get used to knowing when to peel it off, wait too long</li>
            <li> Too long, and it shatters and you have to tweeze.</li>
            <li> From the pictures I expected it to be quite a bit bigger than it is.  </li>
            <li> From the pictures I expected it to be quite a bit bigger than it is.  </li>
            <li> Finally, use 2 spatulas--1 skinny, 1 wide -- to stir and distribute the wax to minimize drips, splatters, etc.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The wax takes a really, really, really long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t need to be creepily long.</li>
            <li> Once I had enough volume of melted wax, I started pouring this liquid wax into my Sally Hansen tin that was empty.</li>
            <li> I thought it was horrendously messy when I first tried using this system, but within a few sessions I had it figured out.  </li>
            <li> the other half of the wax will melt as you use the first half.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the money, time or effort and you&#x27;ll be left with a serious mess to contend with.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t seem like enough wax (It was enough for my underarms and half of one leg)</li>
            <li> Also, the bits leftover on your skin are easier to remove than other hard waxes -- they&#x27;re easier to see because this wax is an opaque yellow, and easier to remove because it dries more brittle than other hard waxes, so</li>
            <li> I figured that was cheaper than 1 eyebrow wax at any salon (usually $8-10 + tip where I live).</li>
            <li> On my eyebrow I held my skin taut and keep my other hand close to the skin per the directions and it came off in 3 pieces and left 1/2 of the hair.</li>
            <li> More expensive, but you pay for the quality!</li>
            <li> The wax temperature was not consistent enough to be user-friendly</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take long at all for the wax to melt!</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist and she recommended a hard wax kit (she didn&#x27;t recommend any particular brand).</li>
            <li> I did not grow my eyebrows very long at all..maybe about 2 days after tweezing.</li>
            <li> Do no wait until the the wax is completely dry to pull, it will break.</li>
            <li> and I was delaying getting a shower so my skin wouldn&#x27;t be moist, but I see that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem by the time the wax is usable since I would definitely be dry by then.</li>
            <li> If you let it dry rock-solid, it crumbles and hurts to chisel off.  </li>
            <li> The wax will dry like a crispy shell as i cools, but WILL catch the hair and still pull it out, and WILL NOT leave residue.  </li>
            <li> After using the wax I rubbed ice cubes over my skin to decrease the redness and then rubbed in a bit of baby oil to remove the excess wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of this kit is that the evenness of the wax temperature prevents the edges of the tin from getting crusted in excess dry wax like the microwave kit.  </li>
            <li> After the wax has warmed I then completely dry the tub and place it in the warmer to continue the warming process - for which this unit works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The warmer was less than I expected, so I wonder if they&#x27;re subsidizing the warmer by making the wax more expensive.</li>
            <li> Remember to push the tin down into the unit completely, so that the black ring is no longer visible.</li>
            <li> The entire thing is small meaning it won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> I do not normally write reviews, but I had to for this.</li>
            <li> usually buy the microwavable wax but wanted a warmer to keep the wax soft during the waxing process.</li>
            <li> Then I put it back in and pushed down until you couldn&#x27;t see the band</li>
            <li> Some people suggested pushing the wax tin down into the warmer further, so that the rubber band grips the edges of the warmer.  </li>
            <li> Even when I did manage to pull off a decent strip of wax, It left behind tons of hair.</li>
            <li> and I actually think it hurt less than when I go to a salon</li>
            <li> Following these instructions resulted in much less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> also like how small the warmer is and how the chord is stored in the bottom (outside obviously) of the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so now I have a ton of little red welts on my leg.</li>
            <li> Part would rip off the hair in a neat little strip as it is supposed to do, lending me enough promise to keep trying...</li>
            <li> It is a little messy and hard to pull the wax off yourself, but I believe it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> After 15 more minutes it had only progressed to a scary thick mess.  </li>
            <li> There were so many bad reviews for this waxing kit, and now that I have the product I am baffled.</li>
            <li> I tried swapping out wax tins in case my wax was just a bad batch, but still couldn&#x27;t get it to heat to the appropriate temperature.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for most, waxing takes patience and common sense...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND, I had a few itchy red spots on my leg the day after like some of the hair follicles got irritated.</li>
            <li> Be careful at that stage because the stick will pull the metal cup out of the warmer.  </li>
            <li> You can use almost anything that has a wet and pasty or gel-like consistency.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it was still not ready by 11am</li>
            <li> I grew up plucking my armpit hair, which I think made my armpit skin really rough over time.</li>
            <li> it works well on soft hair, need to reapply on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the results of waxing, but hated the kit.  </li>
            <li> I called Sally Hansen and asked why it takes so long to melt the wax, and was told the black rubber band needs to be taken off</li>
            <li> It does take a bit, but honestly, if it heated the wax in 10 minutes it would probably be a little dangerous!  </li>
            <li> the first time i used this product it was PAINFUL, but this is natural because it is waxing.</li>
            <li> So, if taking too long to melt the was is the only complaint you have about this Sally Hansen wax warmer, perhaps you want to try what I&#x27;ve done before you decide to pitch this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the trick is learning to use it, the first time is going to be a horrible mess, after that is greattttt! :))))&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is a lot of work, and it is a bit of a mess, but I think it is a mess for me because of lack of experience waxing myself, and I think waxing is just messy in general.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just from experience in other salons.</li>
            <li> The problem was that parts came off and other parts didn&#x27;t, which meant I had to remove the stuck-on wax with my fingers or with tweezers - both took hair with it.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the heating problems other people did.  </li>
            <li> BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to use this product that I didn&#x27;t wait for all of the wax to heat through, after all I was only planning on doing my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve tried other sally hansen waxes, surgi wax, you name it).</li>
            <li> One thing I like about this vs. other wax kits is that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my wax to cloth strips ratio--I can just put wax where I need it when I need it.</li>
            <li> I usually go over twice if my hair is short.</li>
            <li> extremely compact and</li>
            <li> The first time I did it home was not perfect, but I learned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After waiting so long and getting nowhere the mood was killed</li>
            <li> I finally extracted the wax from the tin and microwaved it in a small jar after which it worked perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having used it before, I know to leave it to dry a little longer then the instructions said.</li>
            <li> Took forever to warm up, but the worst part is that you cannot grab the wax well enough to pull it off.  </li>
            <li> Well, if you don&#x27;t let it dry, yes, it&#x27;s gooey and messy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up moving far away from the big city and could no longer afford to go have it done...</li>
            <li> Definitely hated this, it took SO long just to get a little bit warm.</li>
            <li> One more thing to note, take the manufacturers suggestion and apply baby powder to your skin prior to applying the wax, it makes removal much less painful!    </li>
            <li> I was excited to use the Sally Hansen Simple Spa wax warmer kit, b/c I hate using the microwave.</li>
            <li> plugged it for an hour, the wax has not melted a bit, i tried piercing with spatchula, and it is same hard as when unpacked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had this thing plugged in for two hours and the wax was still not warm enough to spread.</li>
            <li> you have to PUSH it down.</li>
            <li> After heating it for an hour (and pressing the tin down, poking the wax, etc.</li>
            <li> and then after like 15 minutes or so of heating up take one of the sticks and push the wax down and to the side.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s $40 down the drain.</li>
            <li> The wax never got melted down.  </li>
            <li> The other wax kept breaking as I was trying to peel!</li>
            <li> No half pulled out or broken off hairs.</li>
            <li> when applying put a thick cover, it will make it less painful and will take out more hair.</li>
            <li> Some tips for making it easier and less painful:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> the heating part: I checked some reviews before and some said to take out the black band and some to leave.</li>
            <li> I like the product and just saw canisters of wax half price at CVS</li>
            <li> I waxed eyebrows for all my friends and my family, and we all agree it hurts less than wax strips.</li>
            <li> Push it all the way in so the black ring is not visible.</li>
            <li> Applying vitamin E creme after resulted in less scarring and redness.    </li>
            <li> the bottom half is already melted at this point</li>
            <li> Give it half a dozen chances before you decide to throw it out, because chances are, your problems will be &amp;</li>
            <li> I hurried back upstairs and began what would soon become the most horrific 5 hours of my life.  </li>
            <li> With the black rubber ring, the wax was not heating up.</li>
            <li> you have to push the tin down so you don&#x27;t see the little black rubber ring around it</li>
            <li> You also have to create a little lip once you put a piece down which you can do with the popsicle stick</li>
            <li> It took 2 1/2 hours (directions say 25 minutes) for the wax to melt to a workable condition (this with trying to stir it which is a nightmare) and it was still a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else you guys really expected.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to pay attention to the reviews that complained about how long it takes to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t working with wax that&#x27;s too hot or cold.</li>
            <li> The mess.</li>
            <li> I never made a mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit creamy in appearance and it seems to irritate my skin less than the alternative.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It SHOULD say to press the tin down firmly-</li>
            <li> Just put a little dollop on the plate and press down the tin of wax firmly onto it.</li>
            <li> Come on, now, Sally Hansen, give us something a little flexible that we can wash and re-use.</li>
            <li> You have to use a little bit thicker of a coating than the demonstration video does</li>
            <li> but a little bit pliable, kinda tricky but can be resolved with practice.</li>
            <li> it \\&quot;chips off\\&quot; of your skin with a little picking.</li>
            <li> Spread the stuff on, leave it little taily thing at the end</li>
            <li> Does take a little practice to get your technique down.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> To make matters even worse, I was wearing a fuzzy black bathrobe which somehow managed to stick to whatever residual stickiness is left all over me</li>
            <li> To make matters even worse, I was wearing a fuzzy black bathrobe which somehow managed to stick to whatever residual stickiness is left all over me</li>
            <li> We wet through a little hard time and couldn&#x27;t always get to the salon.</li>
            <li> I removed the black ring as other reviewers suggested, but after over 2 hours it still wouldn&#x27;t heat up, and the wax was still rock hard.</li>
            <li> It actually ended up being the least messy hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> or I was afraid of pulling fast after the taffy incident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset I wasted my money on this product and will not be buying the refills.</li>
            <li> It was a bit messy and it took a while to heat up.  </li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> things start to get messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say, \\&quot;Do not remove the rubber ring on the tin, as it keeps tin firmly in the unit.\\</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What wax isn&#x27;t messy?  </li>
            <li> but its probably becasue they did not push the wax firmly in the warmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> The metal tin has to be pushed down really hard so that the black ring goes in the warmer.</li>
            <li> I put it in a bowl of water and put it in the microwave to melt it, and when I was finally able to apply it to my face, it peeled off very painfully in 1/4 inch pieces with my eyebrows attached.   </li>
            <li> Then do the waxing part, it should be much less painful with the talcum powder dabbed on the area to be waxed first.</li>
            <li> less wax products, and now I can&#x27;t do anything with it!</li>
            <li> other wax I tried was GiGi, strip and hard wax.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that you don&#x27;t have to keep microwaving -- that&#x27;s what usually causes me to stop, tired and frustrated, mid-wax.  </li>
            <li> The wax itself gets EVERYWHERE, and believe me when I say, once this stuff dries, it&#x27;s not easy to get off the counter-top of your bathroom or your skin.</li>
            <li> It takes off over 95% of my hair each time, and I have dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This complaint is not very important since it works well regardless of appearance.</li>
            <li> because there&#x27;s no going back and grabbing random little hairs.</li>
            <li> Wow, the absolute WORST at-home wax product I&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li> It melt really slow and cold really quick.&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heating up was ridiculous, but after reading the reviews on here, I pushed the metal can down hard into the holder so that the black ring around the can could no longer be seen.</li>
            <li> I had it on for a few hours, the wax remained hard.</li>
            <li> Although it is only $20, this kit is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> - there are no cloth strips to throw away and the small metal tin</li>
            <li> The tin they give you is fairly small</li>
            <li> my hands, the floor and small bits still stuck to my legs.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on a small convenient</li>
            <li> I have used many at home waxing products and this was terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find the refills in local stores</li>
            <li> When the store was out of my usual brand (Nads)</li>
            <li> I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a small allergic condition on my legs and waxing there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that one tin would do both of my legs in full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It took me 2-3 hours to melt this small tin of wax that came with the Sally Hansen wax warmer kit.</li>
            <li> It is a very messy business ending up with wax all over the unit,</li>
            <li> Waste of $20 and a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I hated having to run up and down steps to the microwave to heat the wax and then burn myself because the wax was way too hot.</li>
            <li> It took the wax 45 minutes to heat (supposed to take 25, which is also ridiculously long), there isn&#x27;t very much of it, and - worst of all - it hardly removes any of the hair.</li>
            <li> Poke a finger slightly under the tail, then rip that sucker off!  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I think the instructions should be clearer and the application sticks are a little weak.</li>
            <li> Both were completely messy and hard to remove from anything!  </li>
            <li> and you leave half the wax behind.  </li>
            <li> I actually think its less painful that way.</li>
            <li> I also find this product significantly less painful than the Sally Hansen microwaveable waxes, which is definitely a big plus.</li>
            <li> The wax it comes with works fine, but the warmer itself is terrible.</li>
            <li> it was still hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s not too hard to get the wax residue off.</li>
            <li> and it is hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> After 2 hours, the wax still hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hard wax on my bikini for years and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li> , once I had used up all the Sally Hansen hard wax that came with the warmer kit, I decided to purchase a 14-oz GiGi</li>
            <li> all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re buying a budget 3oz waxing kit, have a little patience and understanding with the poor thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- you need to spread a UNIFORM, thin, rectangular layer on your skin, leaving a little thick wad at the end to serve as a \\&quot;tail\\&quot; for pulling off.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 1/8\\</li>
            <li> when you remove the wax, it should be at a point where it is not warm to touch anymore</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t return it because of the type of product it is; I&#x27;m afraid to just leave it on and go to work someday, but that might be the only way I end up with usable wax.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the formulation of the wax.  </li>
            <li> Alot of people say the wax did not warm up</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still too sticky, too late and</li>
            <li> And, I discovered that you don&#x27;t need to do it in the direction of hair growth, you can do it sideways, so you can make it so that the end of the strip isn&#x27;t on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> If I can give negative star I would.</li>
            <li> I plug the warmer in at least an hour before I plan on using it.</li>
            <li> BUT, when I got home and plugged that sucker in, it never heated the wax at all.  </li>
            <li> Heat the stuff up, swipe it on thick and immediately use a strip and rip off while its still gooey.</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> For me, I have thick hair and the wax itself works</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that my hair is REALLY thick.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t heat up and stays thick and stringy.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li> It never takes long at all now for me to melt this GiGi hard wax using my Sally Hansen wax warmer kit!!!</li>
            <li> Also I find the wax container very small.</li>
            <li> I think this is absolutely ridiculous</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wayyy less expensive.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS STIFF!!</li>
            <li> Not good very very small.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit because regular waxes just make my skin breakup really bad.</li>
            <li> All in all, I fear that I wasted almost 30 bucks on this useless thing...</li>
            <li> Not good its bad no good hot and verey small so its so bad with me and no good</li>
            <li> DIDnt work at all, did not warm!</li>
            <li> IS VERY SLOW AT MELTING THE WAX</li>
            <li> It can be VERY thick before you have to turn it on again.</li>
            <li> must put wax on very thick and let harden.</li>
            <li> It grows in white and fluffy, like peach fuzz, so it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world, but it does bother me, and has for years.  </li>
            <li> I hate those cloth strips and running back and forth from the microwave</li>
            <li> The thing that drove me crazy was after the pain of ripping the wax off once it set for a few seconds, it didn&#x27;t even get all the hair out.</li>
            <li> So I would go and pull off the strip, but it would break and leave another chunk behind on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Once it hardens on the wood, it renders the stick worthless for a second application.  </li>
            <li> but it would leave chunks of broken wax adhered all over along the edges, on my skin.</li>
            <li> Waxing usually becomes painful when the wax breaks and you have to pull over and over again, thick covers solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Purchased for family member in nursing facility, feel bad that we wasted her money!</li>
            <li> The wax is expensive.</li>
            <li> needless to say..</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> this is definitely their worst offering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked and laughing at the negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> it is exceedingly stringy and difficult to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creepy, yes, but who cares.</li>
            <li> I used to go to an expensive salon downtown for my waxing needs</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is just the wrong type...</li>
            <li> Something wrong with unit</li>
            <li> but I have been unable to find it.</li>
            <li> I did a Brazilian myself (yes, seriously!!</li>
            <li> I tried using the fabric strips from another past, failed home wax kit and that helped some but still would leave behind horrific clumps of sticky wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, if you&#x27;re not experienced in waxing, leave this thing alone, you will just be frustrated.  </li>
            <li> so now I look like I have grotesque, fuzzy moles everywhere.  </li>
            <li> so now I look like I have grotesque, fuzzy moles everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of Sally Hansen products in the past few years trying to get that spa result from home, always sadly disappointed and always having to return to the awful razor, which somehow seems to be less horrible an experience than all the strips and creams and pseudo salon kits out there that I&#x27;ve tried to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the worst waxing kit I have ever tried, hands down.</li>
            <li> It was a terrible mess.</li>
            <li> I have tried, sugar, the cold wax Sally Hansen makes, the plastic strips that Sally Hansen makes and some others.</li>
            <li> … I hate it and the worst part is that I bought a refill at the same time, so now I&#x27;m stuck with all these…</li>
            <li> made it go crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brazilian waxing kit for years now, but always found it inconvenient to  have to reheat the wax when it cooled off.</li>
            <li> With all the negative reviews, I braced myself for the worst.</li>
            <li> That being said it is very tedious and does not work well.</li>
            <li> really bad product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I am used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; so it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me.</li>
            <li> Waxing will always be somewhat painful, but the anticipation of doing it to yourself hightens this sensation of pain.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product, like all other Sally Hansen&#x27;s hair removal products.</li>
            <li> so disappointed this has been discontinued and I can no longer get refills.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> I received 2 packs of refills :-(</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been an hour and the stupid warmer hasn&#x27;t warmed the wax.  </li>
            <li> I am begging anyone to please save yourself some grief and money.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> Ignore the bad reviews and try it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t planning on reviewing, but was shocked to see the negatives when I went to order it!</li>
            <li> I hated spending the money and taking the time to go to the salon all the time.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and well... I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be returning this product to the store.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have EVER encountered.</li>
            <li> it was so PAINFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen has the worst hair removal products out of any I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> however, I am having a horrible time locating refills?!?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible luck with hair removal products, and even just Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.  </li>
            <li> This kit is awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely hated this, it took SO long just to get a little bit warm.</li>
            <li> i think I should start by saying that I have some previous experience waxing myself, I am far of being a pro, but have done it a bunch of time.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I think the product is great. Some tips for making it easier and less painful:&lt;br /&gt;- when applying put a thick cover, it will make it less painful and will take out more hair. Waxing usually becomes painful when the wax breaks and you have to pull over and over again, thick covers solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;- Do no wait until the the wax is completely dry to pull, it will break. Pull it when its still a bit soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the heating part: I checked some reviews before and some said to take out the black band and some to leave. I started by taking it out, didn&#x27;t work. Then I put it back in and pushed down until you couldn&#x27;t see the band, it only took like 15 mins to heat up. At first sight you might think it&#x27;s not ready yet, but then use one of the sticks and push down or sideways (careful because some of the wax may spill, that happened to me). The wax at the bottom was hot while the top cold, so by mixing it it solved that problem</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local Target, I am so pissed about it that I came on Amazon to write a review. It took 2 1/2 hours (directions say 25 minutes) for the wax to melt to a workable condition (this with trying to stir it which is a nightmare) and it was still a mess. I followed the directions to the letter and applied to clean dry sweat-free skin. The wax is a mess, it hardens lightening fast and doesn&#x27;t come off with a clean pull. On my eyebrow I held my skin taut and keep my other hand close to the skin per the directions and it came off in 3 pieces and left 1/2 of the hair. I am begging anyone to please save yourself some grief and money. I am hoping to return this junk for a refund.</li>
            <li> I loved it its just what I was looking for ,leaves your skin so soft ,and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon, rather I purchased it locally. It appears that there are a lot of low scores for this product because \\&quot;it takes forever to warm the wax\\&quot;. Just as another person mentioned, you have to push the tin containing the wax down until the O ring (the black rubber ring near the top of the tin)is no longer visible so that the wax warms in a timely manner. This tip is not included in the instructions. Tipping the solid wax on top into the melted wax below also helps.    During my first attempt, I sat waiting for an hour for the wax to heat up just to realize that the tin wasn&#x27;t pushed down all the way (the O ring was still visible) and as a consequence the wax wasn&#x27;t being heated. You can&#x27;t just place it in- you have to PUSH it down. After i figured that out, waxing was a breeze. I appreciate having heated wax near by instead of having to rush before it solidifies or constantly run to the microwave to melt the stuff.    Oh and of course this stuff hurts-- you are pulling hair out of their follicles!! Pull the wax quickly and apply pressure to the area!!    I gave this product 4 stars because I realized my CHEAPER candle warmer can do just as well and probably gets hotter than this wax warmer. I do like how the heat plate is covered and the entire piece is pretty compact, but it is over priced.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t take 25 minutes to heat up like the instructions say (which is long enough as it is). It literally takes hours to get \\&quot;fully heated.\\&quot; Even then, the wax was not runny or hot enough to apply with ease. The wax itself, provided you get it hot enough, is nothing special. I&#x27;m upset I wasted my money on this product and will not be buying the refills. There are plenty of wax products available for less than $10 that can be ready in minutes to apply. So what if I have to walk back to the microwave to reheat it several times- I will still be finished with my wax before the Sally Hansen spa kit even heats up.</li>
            <li> I tried it first on my underarms.  It was a bit messy and it took a while to heat up.  I left it on overnight.  I slathered the wax on my underarm making sure to leave a \\&quot;lip\\&quot; to pull the wax.  I pulled the lip and yanked and as it should, it hurt!  But it really pulls hair!  Once when I had my underarms professionally done, it did not hurt and I had hair growing back the next couple of days.  I read the tips noted by those who gave the product 4 or more stars which are, press the can in the canister until you do not see the rubber ring; use talcum powder on skin before you apply; you may want to use cloth strips (which you have to purchase separately), especially for hard to reach areas (I&#x27;ve not tried this but I&#x27;m going to); apply vitamin E oil to skin after application.  I like the product and just saw canisters of wax half price at CVS, so I&#x27;m going to buy it up!</li>
            <li> I plugged this thing in and waited for 3 hours for the wax to heat up, and it only turned to semi-hard gloop.  I was upset and was about to return it, but I logged on to Amazon to read the reviews.  Some people suggested pushing the wax tin down into the warmer further, so that the rubber band grips the edges of the warmer.  That did it!  Within 20 minutes, the wax was evenly heated and ready to go.  I LOVE the fact that you don&#x27;t have to keep microwaving -- that&#x27;s what usually causes me to stop, tired and frustrated, mid-wax.  I was able to continue waxing until I was finished with very consistently-heated wax.  I also thought it was LESS messy than microwave wax, because with microwave wax you inevitably get to the point where it is hardening and try to keep waxing, leaving hardening globs of wax all over the side of the container, and you don&#x27;t go back and reheat just to clean up the container.  This is evenly heated, and dries evenly, so it stays pretty tidy.  You can even put your sticks back in the wax to clean them off (melt the wax back off of them) before turning the heating unit off.  I think this is great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a local store and used it for about 6 months total. The wax is easy to use, and if you pull it off before it completely hardens it gets almost all the hair and no wax is left behind. I waxed eyebrows for all my friends and my family, and we all agree it hurts less than wax strips. The only issue I had is recently the new wax refills do not heat all the way up, so I am needing to buy a new one. The warmer is not working like it did at first, and even after an hour of heating the wax is not fully melted. Overall it works well, and for around $20, 6 months is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!  I actually love it but it must be getting ready to be discontinued because I can&#x27;t find the wax refills anywhere.  Not in stores, not on line.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store thinking it would be great.  The wax took over an hour to warm up and it stuck to my skin like crazy glue. It was a terrible mess. I threw the whole thing out.</li>
            <li> This is the first strip-less home waxing kit I have seen. I had been waxing for several years, strip-less European wax, at my favorite salon House of Wax in Cooper City, FL. A Brazilian wax + tip ran about $30. But I had to move to the Washington, D.C. area and I couldn&#x27;t find a good Brazilian wax for less than $65, which I am not willing to pay monthly. This kit is excellent for waxing at home, at a good price. I do agree it takes way longer than 25 minutes to heat up. It is a lot of work, and it is a bit of a mess, but I think it is a mess for me because of lack of experience waxing myself, and I think waxing is just messy in general. Make sure you use baby powder before you apply the wax, makes a big difference with the wax coming off easier. and I actually think it hurt less than when I go to a salon (maybe because I&#x27;m doing it myself, know what to expect, use smaller strips? who knows). Overall I think it is so worth it, it is a good product, and I already have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> DIDnt work at all, did not warm!</li>
            <li> It works, I&#x27;m 19 and I love not having a single hair in my arms or legs, I use this product specially to wax my arms and bikini, and it&#x27;s great, my hair is less tick, just love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trick is learning to use it, the first time is going to be a horrible mess, after that is greattttt! :))))&#x27;</li>
            <li> The product did arrive on time but it doesn&#x27;t work.  The unit doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax. This is the second one I&#x27;ve received that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local store after I browsed my choices online. I read the reviews and I still thought I&#x27;d give it a try because of the price. The first time I tried it, doing a few patch tests, it worked perfectly. It did leave some residue but besides that I was happy. However, when I really got to waxing the next day it seemed that something happened to the wax. Instead of coming off in a strip when you pulled, it was more like pulling taffy apart. It hurt and I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same wax as before! I then tried it a third day, thinking maybe I was sweating and that had something to do with it, and it did it again! I don&#x27;t know if maybe the wax got some moisture into it and made it a different consistency or I was afraid of pulling fast after the taffy incident. I give it three stars because it DID work the first time. I don&#x27;t know if I want to try a refill because I don&#x27;t know what the problem is. If anyone could give suggestions that would be great.</li>
            <li> I live in apartment with no microwave so when I found this I said cool.  It is a little messy and hard to pull the wax off yourself, but I believe it is worth it.  Needs a little practice to get used to shaping the eyebrows, but is pretty cool :)</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I have never waxed at home until getting it. I asked my dermatologist and she recommended a hard wax kit (she didn&#x27;t recommend any particular brand). So I found this and got it. The wax takes about 30 min to heat and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot - just warm enough to use. I can see how it would be easy to get drops of wax on the counter, etc., but I just twirl the applicator a lot to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen.    I came here and was SO surprised to see all the negative reviews, kinda baffled really because my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. So many of the one star reviews sound the same to me so frankly I am suspicious of them. If the wax doesn&#x27;t heat in 30 min then the warmer must be defective and should be returned. There is a small light that comes on so make sure it is on - should be heating then. I am so happy I got this kit. I don&#x27;t have to tweeze anymore! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I wanted an at-home wax kit that would be easy and effective. Although it is only $20, this kit is absolutely useless. After heating it for an hour (and pressing the tin down, poking the wax, etc. like everyone else says) it was still hard as a rock. I put it in a bowl of water and put it in the microwave to melt it, and when I was finally able to apply it to my face, it peeled off very painfully in 1/4 inch pieces with my eyebrows attached.   I have successfully waxed my own hair before, so I know what I&#x27;m doing. There was nothing I could do to make this product easy-to use or effective. This is a COMPLETE waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete let down. It didn&#x27;t heat the wax enough so it was one huge mess. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT! I learned my lesson. It&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> This is the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, so I have nothing to compare it too.  I guess it worked ok, you just have to make sure the hair you plan to wax it AT LEAST 1/8\\&quot; long or it won&#x27;t work.  It took 2 1/2 hours for the wax to melt not 25 minutes as stated on the box.  The pain of removing the wax was comparable to removing a band aide. Also, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or bumps :) I will probably purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Wow, the absolute WORST at-home wax product I&#x27;ve used ever. First, it took an hour for the wax to melt. AN HOUR! (not 25minutes per the instructions), and it was still pretty thick (not easy to stir, dried quickly and was very stringy when taking the wax out). One can lasted for the front of one lower leg and knee, and it didn&#x27;t even take the hairs off well. AND, I had a few itchy red spots on my leg the day after like some of the hair follicles got irritated. Bottom line, I ended up shaving the next day. I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many wax and hair removal products. Had the same problems others did with long warm up time. I did use baby powder. I did make sure the hair was long enough. Tried a brazilian and underarms in two different sessions. I have had laser hair removal treatments both places, so I do not have much hair to remove. The hair did come out. The bikini line was better than the underarms but had more redness. Had to reapply wax a couple of times on the underarms and still tweeze. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend unless they were experienced with waxing both at home and salon to be familiar with the level of pain, how warm the wax should be, direction to pull off and clean up. I know the box says \\&quot;For Face &amp; Body\\&quot; but I would NEVER use this on my face. I put paper towels on the countertop before I began. Got fully undressed first, so I could go straight to the shower. Once finished with waxing, then used some of the warm wax to get rid of the cooled wax left on my skin. Then tweezed the stragglers. I don&#x27;t plan on buying the refill when the wax runs out.</li>
            <li> While the idea of the wax warmer is smart because you don&#x27;t have to reheat in the middle of a waxing session, the wax itself just doesn&#x27;t work.  I waited over 40 minutes for the wax to completely heat through.  The instructions say it should take around 25, but at that point the wax just started to pull away from the edges and was solid in some spots.  Be careful at that stage because the stick will pull the metal cup out of the warmer.  While I don&#x27;t reco putting your bare hands on it, the cup only gets warm, so I was able to just push it back down with my hands without any burning or discomfort.  So, once the wax was heated I tested on my wrist for a temperature check, then afterwards attempted to remove hair from my arms and legs.  Literally only took about 3 hairs off.  I am not a beginner waxer, so I know what I&#x27;m doing, however this stuff just didn&#x27;t work.  I recommend purchasing the bliss poetic waxing kit.  More expensive, but you pay for the quality!</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and my upper lip needs to be cleaned up every couple of weeks.  I thought that if I even did it 3 times it would be worth the money.  I don&#x27;t try to do anything bigger or fancier.  You have to wait for it to harden a bit when you apply, but don&#x27;t wait too long or it will stick and not feel good at all.  You don&#x27;t want to take it off too soon or it won&#x27;t work.  Yes, it hurts, but not any more than it did at the salon.  Plus, I can control it myself.  I always seem to need to do touch-up from the salon, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a brazilian wax and I read the reviews ... thought I would try it before I returned it.  I put the can in and made sure the black rubber thing was covered and it heated up no problem.  This was my first time waxing by myself and I have never waxed my bikini area and I had no issues at all, it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.  I am really happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of wax varieties, but this is the first I&#x27;ve tried that 1. has its own warmer and 2. does not use cloth strips. I hate those cloth strips and running back and forth from the microwave so I decided to give this a go. I got it out and waited for over an hour and the wax was still almost completely solid. I was on the verge of returning it to the store when I decided to search online and discovered from other reviews here that I hadn&#x27;t pushed the wax far enough into the warmer. Push it all the way in so the black ring is not visible. It&#x27;s amazing how much difference that tiny change made - the wax was ready 5 minutes later. It took a little trial and error to get the technique right. I kept applying the wax too thin and/or waiting too long to remove and it would kind of shatter as I pulled if off. Once I got the hang of it (apply a little thicker, leave a lip at the bottom, pull off before it&#x27;s totally solid), it&#x27;s not hard. I started out with very small areas, but towards the end I was getting better at applying a long strip at once. I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller body areas, but I suspect that it will be much easier to use on, say, my upper lip or eyebrows than trying to get a strip to work. After you&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s not too hard to get the wax residue off. It would, of course, be better if it washed off with soap and water like a sugar wax, but it only took me baby oil and a soft brush to get it all off. Something else I liked about this wax is that it&#x27;s more environmentally friendly - there are no cloth strips to throw away and the small metal tin the wax comes in could probably even be cleaned and re-used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product, but there are two reasons I docked the item one star: 1. The wax is expensive. The tin they give you is fairly small (I was a long way from finishing both legs when I ran out - you might want to buy a refill when you buy the warmer). The warmer was less than I expected, so I wonder if they&#x27;re subsidizing the warmer by making the wax more expensive. 2. They literally supply popsicle sticks and tongue depressors to apply the wax. Come on, now, Sally Hansen, give us something a little flexible that we can wash and re-use. Next time I think I&#x27;ll try a tiny silicone spatula that has been sitting in my kitchen doing nothing for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit because regular waxes just make my skin breakup really bad. This wax is really good and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use any streeps. I just get a couple of red heads the day after I wax so for me is great. Now the warmer unit is completly useless, some times it takes about 4 hours to warm up the wax, other times just doesn&#x27;t do it at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money in the warmer unit just buy the wax refills and warm it up in hot water this way it works great for me, I wish I would have known before and instead of wasting $20 on the whole kit I would&#x27;ve just buy extra wax.</li>
            <li> Bought this item contemplating whether spending 20 dollars on it would be worth my while. I decided to buy it, figuring that the microwavable waxes could lead to overheating and burning myself. I was really excited, read the directions, and kept checking on the wax. IT NEVER HEATED UP! WAITED AN HOUR AND IT WAS STIFF!! needless to say..DO NOT BUY THIS! IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I bought this product locally thinking the \\&quot;stripless\\&quot; concept was a good one. Boy, was I wrong. The wax didn&#x27;t take long to heat up, but once you&#x27;re ready to start spreading the wax on your skin...things start to get messy. The wax itself gets EVERYWHERE, and believe me when I say, once this stuff dries, it&#x27;s not easy to get off the counter-top of your bathroom or your skin. The thing that drove me crazy was after the pain of ripping the wax off once it set for a few seconds, it didn&#x27;t even get all the hair out. It didn&#x27;t even get MOST of the hair out. Plus, I was left with pieces of wax stuck to my skin for days after. Would not come off. Don&#x27;t buy this product, it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Bought this locally and tried it as soon as I got home.  I&#x27;m no stranger to waxing my legs, so I expected a bit of a mess and hair removal isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant. Well, the warmer takes well over 25 minutes to heat the metal tin containing the wax.  It is a very messy business ending up with wax all over the unit, my hands, the floor and small bits still stuck to my legs.  I gave up after trying for over an hour and pitched the entire box (warmer, wax, instructions and wooden \\&quot;spatulas (popsicle sticks would be more accurate a description) into the trash can.      Stick with wax strips if you intend to do waxings at home.  This isn&#x27;t worth the money, time or effort and you&#x27;ll be left with a serious mess to contend with.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out this product for a brazilian wax to save money instead of going to a salon. I have been to European Wax center in california several times to get a full brazilian and they are great and their wax is just like the one sold in this product. Instead of using strips the wax heats up and then solidifies and pulls the hair when u rip it off.    I had no problem heating up the wax like some complaints said....you have to push the tin down so you don&#x27;t see the little black rubber ring around it and then after like 15 minutes or so of heating up take one of the sticks and push the wax down and to the side. I think most people don&#x27;t realize that the wax is well heated on the bottom but to get the top heated you have to get some of that hot wax from the bottom on the top and then you can stir it around.    Once I had the wax heated up I tested a strip on my husbands leg hair first to see if it really works like it says it should. It worked great so we moved on to me.    I got the wax to work like it says it should. You have to use a little bit thicker of a coating than the demonstration video does but that&#x27;s just from experience in other salons. Once on, the wax cools and you get to rip it off. If its not working for you, make sure you take off the wax before it completely hardens. The wax should still be a little soft to touch but should be solid enough to rip off. You also have to create a little lip once you put a piece down which you can do with the popsicle stick, that way you can get a good grip to pull it off.    The reason I gave this product three stars is because for one it hurt like hell. I know any brazilian waxing hurts, but this stuff did not come off as easily as the wax in the salons. And it was just so much more painful and left my skin so red. Another reason is that although this product is great, it is pretty pricey. The wax that comes in this kit is not enough to cover a lot of skin if you are doing areas like your bikini or your legs.We had to buy the extra tins of wax. So overall we spent about 30 bucks. To go to a salon, it costs me 40 bucks. Honestly, I will pay the extra 10 bucks to go to a salon. It hurts a hell of a lot less, takes a lot less time, and you get a better quality wax.    That being said, if you have experience waxing and can do it well enough, maybe this stuff is right for you. I really couldn&#x27;t give it less than three stars though because the wax works exactly like it says it does. And if you can suffer through the extra pain and get it done right, you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I paid $20 for this I wasn&#x27;t really expecting amazing things from it. But, I did expect it to heat the wax. Which after an hour it didn&#x27;t. I tried pressing the tin further down into the warmer, making sure the rubber band was where it was supposed to be, poking and prodding the wax, but all to no avail. The tin got hot but there was no effect on the wax whatsoever. I have used other sally hansen waxing products before and they were fine- this is definitely their worst offering. Pass</li>
            <li> I love this product - mostly because the wax is ready and STAYS ready without having to deal with microwaving, or anything else.  I plug it a little before getting in the shower, and is ready when I am post-shower prepped.  The key to not having stuck wax is to not wait too long... it should still be a little soft (not sticking to your fingers though)... wait too long and it is hard as a rock.  The convenience factor of constant heat is the biggest score to me... effectiveness is about 4-4.5.  And I just noticed refill kits!  Yippee!</li>
            <li> Ladies, this stuff rocks. Here&#x27;s the trick though. USE STRIPS. Heat the stuff up, swipe it on thick and immediately use a strip and rip off while its still gooey. That is the key, if you wait too long it wont adhere to the strip. This wax HOLDS ON to the hair. I actually think its less painful that way. No half pulled out or broken off hairs. Another great tip: go to Sally Beauty Supply and buy yourself a can of Numbing spray and their wax strips. Its like 8-9 bucks. I use that spray about 5 minutes ahead of time and then also powder myself. This wax makes it quicker because there&#x27;s no going back and grabbing random little hairs. Follow these directions and you will be happy!</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this kit hoping that it would be a little better than the Honey Wax solutions, which seems to leave about 1/2 the hair behind.  Initially, I just followed their directions, putting it on, waiting it to harden just enough, then pulling it off.  The problem was that parts came off and other parts didn&#x27;t, which meant I had to remove the stuck-on wax with my fingers or with tweezers - both took hair with it.    I had some cloth strips I bought at the beauty supply shop, originally for the honey wax, and I tried applying the hot wax, then applying the cloth strip, and then pulling the wax off using the cloth strip.  This worked MUCH better.  Nearly all of the wax came off, and if some of it stuck, I could put a bit of hot wax on top of it, apply the cloth and pull it off, leaving only a few bits of wax that could be scratched off (taking the hair with it) or tweezed off.    It was even effective on a man&#x27;s facial hair, after he had grown out his \\&quot;beard\\&quot; for a week.  About 95% of the hair came off, and what was left were the lightest colored hair.  Even the salon waxing couldn&#x27;t get it, but this wax did.    The instructions had some good suggestions, like putting talcum powder on your skin/hair before applying the wax.  Following these instructions resulted in much less skin irritation.  Applying vitamin E creme after resulted in less scarring and redness.    I was able to get it to warm up faster by pressing the tin all the way down, as suggested by others, but I learned that after waiting about 30 minutes for it to warm up.  Also, the wax gets very hot.  I found that I got better results when I used one spatula stick to load up another one, for 3-4 inches of length, by the time I got the wax spread out on the stick, it was cool enough to apply without too much difficulty.    The timing on when to pull the cloth is tricky.  Too soon and you don&#x27;t get much hair, too late and you leave half the wax behind.  It seemed like about 5-10 seconds was aboutright.</li>
            <li> Like many others who have purchased this product, I had a problem with the wax taking an extremely long time to melt.  I found a solution to this problem by applying a thermal conductor to the heating plate (the metal square in the unit that touches the bottom of the wax tin), applying a thermal conductor to it made the stuff heat about 2-3 times faster.  The problem is that metal on metal doesn&#x27;t conduct heat very well, put some conductor in there and it fills in all the gaps between the metals.  You can use almost anything that has a wet and pasty or gel-like consistency.  Things like grease, crisco, heatsink compound, hair gel, or toothpaste will work.  Just put a little dollop on the plate and press down the tin of wax firmly onto it. Doing this will shorten the heating time significantly, making this a usable product.    Another problem I had with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with enough wax!!  However, I found out that the wax can be reused with no problem, as long as you aren&#x27;t grossed out by using wax that is already full of hair :P.  I am a hairy guy, and it takes a ton of wax to do the job, if I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to reuse the wax it would have gotten really expensive really fast.    Yes, there is a bit of learning curve, you have to get used to knowing when to peel it off, wait too long and it flakes off, don&#x27;t wait long enough and it wont pull up the hair.  Using strips with the stuff works much better, but that defeats the purpose of using a stripless wax doesn&#x27;t it? XD    One more thing to note, take the manufacturers suggestion and apply baby powder to your skin prior to applying the wax, it makes removal much less painful!    Overall, I like this product, it took a bit of resourcefulness to make it work well, but was worth it in my opinion.  I love that it comes with a nice little heating unit, I hated having to keep running back to the microwave to reheat wax.  I also find this product significantly less painful than the Sally Hansen microwaveable waxes, which is definitely a big plus.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this product it was PAINFUL, but this is natural because it is waxing. however, it was really minimized after i used talcum powder the second time, before waxing. you dont have to wait for the whole thing to melt, after 15 mins the bottom half is already melted at this point you can push the top layer with the provided sticks and you will see the melted wax rise up, wait 5 more mins and take the wax that are closest to the sides as these parts is where the really warm wax that you want is located. Then do the waxing part, it should be much less painful with the talcum powder dabbed on the area to be waxed first. when you remove the wax, it should be at a point where it is not warm to touch anymore but a little bit pliable, kinda tricky but can be resolved with practice. reasons why i gave 5 stars is because A. it works. B. It was ALMOST painless when i did it with talcum powder first before waxing C. it&#x27;s on a small convenient can that you can take anywhere in the house and lastly, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to the salon and have someone see your body parts.</li>
            <li> really bad product. waited over an hour or the wax to melt. and it still stayed rock solid. returned it to the store. Bad bad bad!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product last weekend and let it sit for two hours with the wax never softening up, today it&#x27;s been 4 hours and I was delaying getting a shower so my skin wouldn&#x27;t be moist, but I see that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem by the time the wax is usable since I would definitely be dry by then. I think this is absolutely ridiculous and I can&#x27;t return it because of the type of product it is; I&#x27;m afraid to just leave it on and go to work someday, but that might be the only way I end up with usable wax. Do not buy this product, I spent over 25 bucks on the warmer kit then extras, because I&#x27;ve always liked other Sallie Hansen strip-less wax products, and now I can&#x27;t do anything with it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the heating problems other people did.  One trick is to make sure the rubber ring around the wax can makes a tight seal inside the warmer so that it fits right on top of the heating element.  It heated up in about 30-40 minutes, and I used it on my underarms since I honestly can&#x27;t do brazilians on my own.  The wax works pretty cleanly, much better than all of my experiences with wax strips and Nads (shudder).  My biggest complaint is the formulation of the wax.  Unlike other hard waxes that stay in one nice strip, this wax has a tendency to break.  So I would go and pull off the strip, but it would break and leave another chunk behind on the skin.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty good for smaller areas, and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying the replacement wax for this unit once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> Takes an hour to heat up. Would be better if it had strips. faster to melt in the microwave.  don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> I have had this plugged in for over an hour, and you still cannot even put a dent in the wax!  Going back to the store asap</li>
            <li> The wax DOES NOT heat up in 25 minutes as the directions say.  After 2 hours, the wax still hard as a rock.  I have used many at home waxing products and this was terrible.  Running to the microwave is much more time effective than sitting around 3 hours or more to have the wax soften.  I DO NOT recommend this product.  There are many other hard wax or stripless at-home waxing kits that are much more effective.</li>
            <li> Its been 5 hours and it still isn&#x27;t ready.  I attempted to stir it up from the bottom as recommended, but it, too, was not too pliable.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time with this stuff.  I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I had this thing plugged in for two hours and the wax was still not warm enough to spread. I don&#x27;t know if it was an issue with my specific warmer or with all of them. I am returning it and have placed an order for the [[ASIN:B000CCSXFU GiGi Professional Brazilian Waxing Kit]]. It is 20 bucks more expensive but you get more than twice the product. It is also a stripless wax.</li>
            <li> The metal tin has to be pushed down really hard so that the black ring goes in the warmer. Once I figured this out, the wax became gooey really quick. The instructions say, \\&quot;Do not remove the rubber ring on the tin, as it keeps tin firmly in the unit.\\&quot; It SHOULD say to press the tin down firmly- so I give it a 4/5. Use baby powder for best results. It was super quick to do my underarms. The wax thickens really well and pulls out almost ALL the hair in one try. I love that I don&#x27;t need strips. The refill is $10. I think I only used 1/10 of the wax. So my waxing cost about $1.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use the Sally Hansen Simple Spa wax warmer kit, b/c I hate using the microwave. It took me 1.5 hours to warm up the wax. After applying the wax, it kept breaking in pieces. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. If you want a wax warmer, I recommend the gigi wax warmer instead.</li>
            <li> I would give this ZERO stars if I could. I bought this and just like many of the other people said, it did not heat up, I waited 30 mins and it hadn&#x27;t budged so I promptly returned it. I went to Sally&#x27;s Bea. Supply  and bought the GiGi HoneyBee Microwave kit which is awesome and only 15 bucks. It is most likely the best wax I have ever used. It takes only 1 min to heat up and you are ready to go. I have tried, sugar, the cold wax Sally Hansen makes, the plastic strips that Sally Hansen makes and some others. The GiGi wax also came with prep, wax remover, and after wax supplies, much better buy than this thing.</li>
            <li> This warmer warms the wax, but does not allow it to get to a good workable temperature. I still had to put the wax in boiling water on the stove to get the consistency I needed. Then I placed the container of wax in the warmer while I used it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have EVER encountered. Takes hours to heat up. I tried waxing and the wax just sticks to your skin and you have to pick at it with your fingernails it was so PAINFUL!!! What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced by this from a friend, I was talking to her about always wanting to get a wax but never got the chance. She sent me this product and I read the directions many times from different sources and even read the reviews to make sure I know what I&#x27;m dealing with. I got to work and it work swell. Sure it was a little difficult at first making sure it was plugged in, waited a littler than 20 minutes but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt; I waited about 35 minute for it to melt well, when I used it all my hairs got off on my arm and eyebrows- smooth and free. It&#x27;s was perfect, it all depends how you use it. Every product is different for everybody but this works great for me, hopefully it works well for you too.</li>
            <li> so disappointed this has been discontinued and I can no longer get refills.</li>
            <li> I was told this product would be new and it was clearly used.  The box was crumbles and clearly taped and the top.  The wooden spatulas were open and one was removed.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen has the worst hair removal products out of any I&#x27;ve ever used. They never work - you spend more time trying to get reasonable results in the time you can be completely finished with good results with better products. It took the wax 45 minutes to heat (supposed to take 25, which is also ridiculously long), there isn&#x27;t very much of it, and - worst of all - it hardly removes any of the hair. My roots aren&#x27;t even that deep because I&#x27;ve been waxing for years. Terrible, terrible product, like all other Sally Hansen&#x27;s hair removal products. I only bought it because nothing else was on the shelf. Give me Veet over SH garbage any day.</li>
            <li> IS VERY SLOW AT MELTING THE WAX THE WAX BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT DOES A GOOD JOB IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow. The product doesn&#x27;t work to its full potential. It should take about 25 minutes to heat the wax but it took about 2 hours. And the wax is a very cheap quality.  It does the trick eventually so be prepared to wait a while.</li>
            <li> I just recently moved and was in search for a new person to wax my eyebrows. After asking around, there were so many mixed reviews that I decided to do my eyebrows myself. I bought this item through Rite Aid, not Amazon. I was worried about doing this myself because I have never used waxing products before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating up was ridiculous, but after reading the reviews on here, I pushed the metal can down hard into the holder so that the black ring around the can could no longer be seen. This helped tremendously, so I only had to wait about 45 minutes (including the time I was twiddling my fingers before reading reviews.) I was so anxious to use this product that I didn&#x27;t wait for all of the wax to heat through, after all I was only planning on doing my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I started waxing with about 50% of the wax completely melted, and I noticed that the wax was very stringy. Next time I will be more patient. I did not use talcum powder and I thought the waxing was relatively painless. It was easy to apply (I used toothpicks for a more accurate application), the wax cooled quickly, and the wax was very easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the wax strip, it was a very noticeable difference, both on my face and on the wax strip. I did not grow my eyebrows very long at all..maybe about 2 days after tweezing. A majority of my hair was gone with the exception of the fine, blonde hairs that grow near my eyebrows that are barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product and will continue to buy refills. This product was exactly what I was expecting and now I can wax my eyebrows in the comfort of my own home. Next time I am planning on trying different areas of my body to see if I get the same results,</li>
            <li> The wax part of this kit works quite well. The biggest problem with this warmer is that it is not quiet warm enough so the wax still a little too thick.  The second problem is the wooden sticks to apply the was.  Once it hardens on the wood, it renders the stick worthless for a second application.  Once it is applied to the &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; places, it does a great job of removing the hair and it is smooth for about a week before it starts to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help the warmer, I place a folded dry washcloth over the top of the can to help keep more of the heat within the wax can.</li>
            <li> This was really easy to use, unlike the one that you need to microwave, the only problem was it dries up on the spatula so quickly. It was not hot even if you get it straight from the can and put it directly to your skin. I think it even numbed the area I was waxing(pubic area) cause when I tweezed the hair that was left, it did not hurt one bit, may be the warmth of the wax opened up my pores or something. Initially I had problems heating the wax, maybe because I plugged it in an extension cord, but when I plugged it directly to the outlet, It melted really fast.</li>
            <li> ANy positive reviews of this product have got to be plants!  Took forever to warm up, but the worst part is that you cannot grab the wax well enough to pull it off.  Even when I did manage to pull off a decent strip of wax, It left behind tons of hair. A huge waste of twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> It melt really slow and cold really quick.&lt;br /&gt;Takes my time but it works well on soft hair, need to reapply on thick hair.</li>
            <li> It takes hours for the wax to hear up and then it cools down too fast to get most of the work done</li>
            <li> I bought one kit and the wax never even came close to melting.  I returned it.  I found one at a local grocery store and bought it assuming the first one I got was just defective.  That one didn&#x27;t work either!  I returned it to the store and the lady I talked to said she didn&#x27;t know why they sold them at their store because every one of them they&#x27;ve ever sold has been returned.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this, it warms up quickly and keeps warm. I do recommend this but I can&#x27; say so much for the actual wax</li>
            <li> If I would have read the reviews I would have saved time and money by not purchasing this product. After 6 hours the wax still was not melted.  This is the first product that I have purchased off of Amazon that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked and laughing at the negative reviews on this product.  I&#x27;ve known many people that have this little waxing kit, have used them myself, and actually own one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to address popular complaints, for those who are wondering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s really small&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- Um, yeah.  It&#x27;s 3oz.  A shot glass is 1oz.  I&#x27;m not sure what else you guys really expected.  Actually, in regards to size, it IS a bit impractical for full leg waxing, although I have done it.  You can&#x27;t strip 1/4 of your leg with one go, but you CAN get them done.  Personally I think it&#x27;s best for small jobs or spot waxing- pits, faces, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s messy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- What wax isn&#x27;t messy?  This is where practice makes perfect.  I thought it was horrendously messy when I first tried using this system, but within a few sessions I had it figured out.  I no longer drip it on the counter, on the container, etc.  Unfortunately for most, waxing takes patience and common sense...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It sticks to your skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-  Well, if you don&#x27;t let it dry, yes, it&#x27;s gooey and messy.  If you let it dry rock-solid, it crumbles and hurts to chisel off.  No, it does NOT weld to your skin like some budget waxes do.  And actually- IT&#x27;S NOT STICKY, it leaves no sticky residue, which is FABULOUS.  The wax will dry like a crispy shell as i cools, but WILL catch the hair and still pull it out, and WILL NOT leave residue.  Again, practice makes perfect.  With a little repetition, you get the feel for how big you can make a &amp;#34;Strip&amp;#34; and when and how to best pull it off before it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It takes over an hour to heat&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- Yes, yes it does.  And if you read that in all of these reviews, why are you surprised?  Plug it in before you hop in the shower or bath, before dinner, or whatever. It does take a bit, but honestly, if it heated the wax in 10 minutes it would probably be a little dangerous!  It doesn&#x27;t make the wax scalding hot, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself with it, and it&#x27;s probably not going to catch on fire if you forget about it.  I&#x27;ve left mine on overnight on accident with no problems.  You&#x27;re buying a budget 3oz waxing kit, have a little patience and understanding with the poor thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD recommend this product, and I would give it as a gift.  Just keep what your&#x27;e buying in context.  I think that for the size and price, it&#x27;s a fabulous little gadget.  Give it half a dozen chances before you decide to throw it out, because chances are, your problems will be &amp;#34;Operator Error&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing. It&#x27;s the only wax that works for me. Usually I use my own warmer, but I threw it away when it broke. I have been unable to find the refills in local stores so when I saw the warmer kit, I figured I should just kill two birds with one stone and buy and warmer and the wax I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This warmer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax consistently. It was stiff and I was only able to get a little bit out to use. I eventually gave up. I&#x27;m waiting on a response for Sally Hansen and hoping I can take it back to Ulta where I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use your own warmer that&#x27;s professional use.</li>
            <li> I bought the warming kit and refills today and decided to give waxing another whirl. I put the wax tin into the warmer with the ring around the lower part of the tin and it wouldn&#x27;t really warm up. But when I moved up the rubber ring to the upper part of the tin it sat down into the warmer and actually got warm. I managed to do my legs and unibrow. I did somehow end up pulling off being able to wax my legs plus make a large enough mess all over the place and on my skin.  I will probably give it another try, when it&#x27;s time, and practice will make perfect.</li>
            <li> I found this on clearance at a Walgreens for $5. I figured that was cheaper than 1 eyebrow wax at any salon (usually $8-10 + tip where I live). It took some getting used to, but I eventually got the hang of it, and I have probably saved about $200 on professional waxings. I&#x27;ve also used it on my underarms with pretty good results (though shaving is just plain easier and less painful, especially during the winter) and it worked for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep using it to get a good feel for when the wax is ready to be pulled off. Not long enough, and it&#x27;s still sticky and gooey and doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well. Too long, and it shatters and you have to tweeze. Practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a difference too whether or not the wax is the right temperature when you apply it. I know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but what I ended up doing was removing the little rubber ring, and getting the bottom of the wax tin directly on the heating element inside the warmer. I stir frequently, and switch off the unit for a few minutes at a time when it&#x27;s getting too warm. It&#x27;s a lot easier to control the temperature that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, maybe this makes me a bad person, but when I go to the coffee shop, I&#x27;ll grab an extra wooden stirrer, as they make excellent applicators for eyebrow waxing since they&#x27;re narrower than what&#x27;s in the kit, and you don&#x27;t want to reuse them as that&#x27;s rather unhygienic.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this when learned about it. The usual complaint was that it took too long to warm but, then I heard that all you had to do is make sure its placed properly (to where you can&#x27;t see the rubber). So I decided to try it out. When it arrived, the box was very mistreated and there were no popsicle sticks included... So after I got some popsicle sticks I tried it out and well... I was very disappointed. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it, or maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work. It did remove some hair and left the area very smooth..  But it also left a lot of hair... All in all, I fear that I wasted almost 30 bucks on this useless thing... Also I find the wax container very small. The entire thing is small meaning it won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> Wax takes 2 hours to melt. Not çonvienent product. Purchased for family member in nursing facility, feel bad that we wasted her money!</li>
            <li> I received on item and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love the Sally Hansen Wax. It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin. Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me. The warmer does take a while to warm up (the instruction guide says 25 minutes). I found that when I&#x27;m using a new tin of wax, after 25 minutes it seems like it still isn&#x27;t warm, but if I poke through the upper level of wax, the bottom half is all melted and usable.</li>
            <li> Love this kit. I will say... You do have to be patient while waiting for the wax to heat up and thoroughly melt. I find that pointing my hair dryer at it (on the highest setting) does help if I&#x27;m in a hurry. Overall though,  great kit and has saved me many trips to the salon to tame my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I had it on for a few hours, the wax remained hard. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a much better price than I could find in Wal-Mart or anywhere else in town.  I&#x27;m always glad to have a Prime account.</li>
            <li> This product might be Ok if you knew that next Friday you wanted to wax.  You could plug it in today and it may be warm enough by Christmas to melt the wax, but probably not.  I ended up dumping the wax from this into one of my old microwave safe containers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hard wax on my bikini for years and have never had any issues. When the store was out of my usual brand (Nads) I purchased this product. I wish I could give it zero stars. It is completely ineffective. The wax does not heat up high enough, even after almost two hours and never melts enough to spread. The few times i was able to spread even a little, it hardened again too quickly to pick up any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay attention to the reviews that complained about how long it takes to melt the wax. I just wanted to avoid going to the microwave two or three times while waxing. Well, it takes about an hour to melt the wax and will not melt fast enough some of the wax you already used so most probably you will not get the job done with only one can… I hate it and the worst part is that I bought a refill at the same time, so now I&#x27;m stuck with all these…</li>
            <li> Its been a couple of months since i bought it, i was busy and could not try it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it for an hour, the wax has not melted a bit, i tried piercing with spatchula, and it is same hard as when unpacked.&lt;br /&gt;I left it all day just to check how long it would take, the machine is hot but the wax never melted.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even return it as its been a while since i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;i will never again buy this.</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised. Did not heat up well. Did not remove hair. Would not recommend or purchase again</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pretty gross but I seem to be growing a beard in my advanced age. It grosses my 5 year old son out so I use this product to remove it. It works great in ripping out all the unsightly hairs and keeps my beard and mustache (did I forget to mention the Tom Selleck mustache also struggling to burst forth?) area smooth for about 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li> I am female but I have a genetic disorder that encourages the growth of facial hair.  It grows in white and fluffy, like peach fuzz, so it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world, but it does bother me, and has for years.  As the fuzz-forest grows thicker it has a greater impact on the application of make-up, causing my face to have an odd post-foundation texture.  For the last year I used a pen-trimmer to get rid of the fuzz, but when it broke I knew I wanted to try something different, especially something that would deincentivize the hair from growing back.  So, waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m too broke to go to a salon every time it grows back, so I started with a different Sally Hansen wax kit (one that goes in the microwave).  I loved the results of waxing, but hated the kit.  The wax temperature was not consistent enough to be user-friendly so I sought out something different.  After reading the reviews I determined that this was the right kit with the right price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the kit.  As recommended by reviews I pushed the wax tin as far into the warmer as I could to get it to heat properly, which it did.  The wax stays at an even temperature making it much easier to use and the &amp;#34;spatulas&amp;#34; work much better than the little plastic one that came in my last kit.  They make it possible to cover a much larger area much more smoothly.  The wax itself even seems to be of a higher quality.  It&#x27;s a little bit creamy in appearance and it seems to irritate my skin less than the alternative.  After using the wax I rubbed ice cubes over my skin to decrease the redness and then rubbed in a bit of baby oil to remove the excess wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of this kit is that the evenness of the wax temperature prevents the edges of the tin from getting crusted in excess dry wax like the microwave kit.  That particular problem made the microwave kit especially frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the amount of hair removed by the wax, I can&#x27;t weigh in very successfully.  Since I have a peach fuzz situation, some hairs are too short/long to be pulled out by the wax, but it takes enough off to make a big difference in appearance and makes the long ones much easier to find with tweezers afterward.  I expect that continued use will help eliminate everything as the short hairs grow out over time.  No doubt actually going to a salon would improve the results, but for the money ($13 when I bought it) this is a great choice.  I should be able to do my face several times over before running out.  Refill kits don&#x27;t look to be too expensive and if I&#x27;m feeling bold I can always find a recipe to make my own and refill the original tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason the rating wasn&#x27;t five stars is the size of the device.  From the pictures I expected it to be quite a bit bigger than it is.  In reality it&#x27;s very small (a bit wider than a soda can) and the plastic is kind of dinky.  This complaint is not very important since it works well regardless of appearance.ery successfully.

            <li> Best wax there is... however, I am having a horrible time locating refills?!?! Bring back the refills!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t heat up. Never used</li>
            <li> Get the Gigi space saver, same size and heats up really quickly. The price is almost the same and it would cost me more to ship this back than to just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to melt all the wax. Very unhappy with this product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Alot of people say the wax did not warm up but its probably becasue they did not push the wax firmly in the warmer. My wax heats up in no  time and the experience is great... The results are great the wax  made my skin feel smooth and moisturized..</li>
            <li> I love it. Works great, practically pain free, pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t get wax all over the counter. It&#x27;s the s***.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more dissatisfied with a product. Had the untit plugged in for an hour and the wax was still not melted. I&#x27;m returning this product.</li>
            <li> With all the negative reviews, I braced myself for the worst. It actually ended up being the least messy hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried other sally hansen waxes, surgi wax, you name it). Many are complaining that it takes too long to heat. Mine heated up in less than the prescribed 25 mins, because I pushed the tin as far in as it would go and made sure to give it the wax hard mix about halfway through (stab it with your spatula a few times and poke the edges against the wall of the tin-- it will slide around, revealing the molten wax at the very bottom!) If you don&#x27;t mix, it will look like it isn&#x27;t melting at all. Also, you don&#x27;t need to wait for the whole thing to melt before using-- start using it when it&#x27;s half-melted-- the other half of the wax will melt as you use the first half. Finally, use 2 spatulas--1 skinny, 1 wide -- to stir and distribute the wax to minimize drips, splatters, etc. Doing these things I had very little mess to clean up -- I normally get wax all over the container, my hands, the counter, etc, but this stuff only got on my hands--because I tested the wax with my fingertips to ensure that it wasn&#x27;t too hot before use. Also, the bits leftover on your skin are easier to remove than other hard waxes -- they&#x27;re easier to see because this wax is an opaque yellow, and easier to remove because it dries more brittle than other hard waxes, so it \\&quot;chips off\\&quot; of your skin with a little picking. I didn&#x27;t even need to use oil to get it off!     You definitely need to practice to get the hang of it though -- you need to spread a UNIFORM, thin, rectangular layer on your skin, leaving a little thick wad at the end to serve as a \\&quot;tail\\&quot; for pulling off. You also need to pull it off at the right time -- not too early or too late. (too early and it&#x27;s still too sticky, too late and the strip breaks up as you pull it off).  Once you get the hang of it though, it&#x27;s great! It also smells amazing -- like a dessert. I felt like I was slathering a sweet fondue sauce on myself lol.     The plug in heater is really way more convenient than having to make trips back and forth to the microwave. It also keeps the wax at the right consistency the entire time so you aren&#x27;t working with wax that&#x27;s too hot or cold.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  if you&#x27;ve used a wax pot before, don&#x27;t expect this experience to be anything like what you&#x27;ve done before.   the wax takes about 45 minutes to heat enough to even get the applicator stick into it.  once you can mix the wax, it never heats to a consistency that spreads easily- it is exceedingly stringy and difficult to manipulate.  when you get it onto your skin you have to pick the exact perfect time to remove it- otherwise it simply cracks off, or continues to spread without finding purchase.  overall it is a giant waste of money and you&#x27;re better off spending the extra cash to get a real wax pot.</li>
            <li> Really the best wax kit ever! Super easy to use, not messy, the wax smells good, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and no wax strips needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how small the warmer is and how the chord is stored in the bottom (outside obviously) of the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it takes to heat the wax up is worth the wait. For the people who complain try removing the rubber band and then take the stick after 15 mins and try to crack the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my Eyebrows and legs and it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I had never found any at home wax kit that worked until I tried this after my mom purchased it. Other waxes didn&#x27;t remove the hair at all and still left me very red and irritated. I didn&#x27;t think this would work either, but it was awesome and gave me salon quality results. It did take awhile to heat up, but I just left it for 35 mins and then stirred and it was perfect. So easy to apply and just pull off with your fingers and no strips. Ignore the bad reviews and try it! I wasn&#x27;t planning on reviewing, but was shocked to see the negatives when I went to order it! Just a note that I used it for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this kit from a local beauty store to save money over salon waxing.  Before using, I did read all the reviews here on Amazon.  After an hour of waiting for the wax to melt, I finally took off the rubber ring that elevates the jar somewhat above the heating element and stirred the wax up to break up the clumps.  I used talcum powder on the skin before applying the wax and it did help somewhat in terms of letting the wax break away from the skin.  The wax itself removed 99% of the hair that it touched.  After the wax came off, I moisturized with coconut oil and now my skin is very soft and smooth.  Waxing will always be somewhat painful, but the anticipation of doing it to yourself hightens this sensation of pain.  Overall, this product works but I took off one star because of the time needed to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> Not good very very small. I dont like this product n cant return this cuz i have to pay $8 to return this. That&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> The wax takes a really, really, really long time to heat up. Like over an hour. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I do not normally write reviews, but I had to for this. There were so many bad reviews for this waxing kit, and now that I have the product I am baffled. I do not know why so many people had problems.I was able to get the wax warm in about 20 minutes. I did remove the rubber piece first though. The wax itself was great! It obviously was not salon quality, but was perfect for maintaining my brows and lip! It was messing, but easy to clean up. I would recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> does&#x27;n work! do not buy it!</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed with this product. I have been a long-time waxer and have always wanted a warmer kit. I figured it would be much easier to regulate the wax temperature and keep it warm until I was done. However this warmer seems to not get warm enough to actually melt all the wax! The directions say it will take 25 minutes to heat, I had mine going for over an hour and there was still a huge clump of unmelted wax. I was not pleased. There was some melted wax underneath the clump so after making a huge mess I got to the wax and all was good. The wax itself is nice, hardens fast and is easy to remove. This product would have been great if the warmer got hotter. I probably will not buy more wax once this runs out.</li>
            <li> The only waxing system that works. Have used these for years but can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore. Hope they are not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product works great when used as instructed.  It seems that a couple of points from the instructions warrant some emphasis:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Stir the wax before assuming it hasn&#x27;t melted, since the bottom will melt before the top&lt;br /&gt;2.  Don&#x27;t let the wax completely harden on your skin&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to find a product like this product at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve always had more success with melted wax products than with wax strips, which always left behind too much hair, &amp; it&#x27;s much more convenient &amp; effective if the wax is continuously heated.</li>
            <li> Reviews of the actual wax is relative since waxing depends on a lot of different factors (hair length, thickness, pain tolerance etc). For me, I have thick hair and the wax itself works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy the microwavable wax but wanted a warmer to keep the wax soft during the waxing process. This unit works well to keep the wax warm, but not to initially heat the wax as it states on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an alternative, I boil some water and place the tub of wax in the the water to heat and soften the wax while the warming unit heats up, making the initial heating process MUCH faster. After the wax has warmed I then completely dry the tub and place it in the warmer to continue the warming process - for which this unit works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help and not deter you from this kit!</li>
            <li> Following the suggestions of other reviewers re. wax position and stirring the wax easily heated within 25 min. Wax worked great on underarms and bikini area. One thing I like about this vs. other wax kits is that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my wax to cloth strips ratio--I can just put wax where I need it when I need it. Additionally the wax smells good. If it doesn&#x27;t seem like enough wax (It was enough for my underarms and half of one leg) you can try reusing. If you plan to do that it&#x27;s a good idea to start from the least hairy areas and then move to waxing the most hairy areas.    The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a small allergic condition on my legs and waxing there made it go crazy so now I have a ton of little red welts on my leg. Just a little warning to test on an inconspicuous spot if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible luck with hair removal products, and even just Sally Hansen. I was just DONE with shaving and with my hair. In my pubic area, it grows back SO fast and ugly, and I can&#x27;t even shave more than once every 5 days, if that. So I went to Target and saw this. At $20, I wasn&#x27;t sure, but got it anyway. While it was heating up, I read reviews and pretty much everyone hates it. When it came time to use it, I immediately fell in love.     This is how I use it.     -Make sure the rubber strip on the container can&#x27;t be seen (people complain about it not heating up fast)    -Scoop up a small amount and apply in the direction of hair growth, in squiggles to make sure it grabs the hair. When you&#x27;re at the end of the area, swoop it around so the end can easily be flicked up. Do it fast. I apply 5 or 6 at a time and get it done very quickly.     -You don&#x27;t need to wait forever for them to cool, like I said, do a few at a time, and as long at you can quickly tap without getting stuck, it&#x27;s ready to be flicked and peeled.     I did a Brazilian myself (yes, seriously!! No hair AT ALL). And, I discovered that you don&#x27;t need to do it in the direction of hair growth, you can do it sideways, so you can make it so that the end of the strip isn&#x27;t on delicate skin. Just make sure that the skin is taut.     The hair doesn&#x27;t need to be creepily long. My can be about 1/8th\\&quot;. Keep in mind that my hair is REALLY thick. Also, doing it in the direction of the hair, and then quickly going over it all squiggly helps. I usually go over twice if my hair is short. I am NOT a fan of growing my body hair out.     The mess. Put wax paper down over the area, down put too much on the stick, and wipe off the excess on the can.     The temperature. When there isn&#x27;t very much, or when it&#x27;s all melted, it gets hot. Just turn it off. It can be VERY thick before you have to turn it on again. It isn&#x27;t very fun working with hot wax.    Oh, and you can actually reuse the wax. Yeah, they didn&#x27;t tell youthat, did they? Save the chips on a clean piece of wax paper and after you&#x27;re done, pack them into the jar and leave it on until they&#x27;re melted, then turn if off or keep going. I&#x27;d say you could reuse it 4 or 5 times if your hair is light. Only my underarm and pubic area is dark, but I don&#x27;t particularly mind. It&#x27;s creepy, yes, but who cares. It saves money.    I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s a dream! (:</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many facial hair removal products to keep my lady beard and unibrow in check, mostly relying on the microwaveable wax until I left it in the microwave too long and killed the microwave.  When I saw this product, I had to buy it and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. I get a cleaner wax job without being left with a bunch of missed hairs or breaking out into a rash.  It has definitely simplified my waxing ritual and I hope they never stop making it.  It does take a bit longer than 25 minutes to melt completely, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me, and it does get VERY HOT, so use caution.  Remember to push the tin down into the unit completely, so that the black ring is no longer visible. I&#x27;ve had the most success by applying the wax in small sections and peeling it off BEFORE it gets hard.  I have no complaints about this product, although I do prefer the Azulene Oil over the creme lotion.  Going to the salon is not a luxury for me and I can&#x27;t stand to pay for services I can do perfectly well myself.  I&#x27;d rather do my pampering and upkeep at home and this product makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product. I take care of my own waxing needs for pennies that would cost me a ton at the salon. If you use it according to the directions it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before. But I think the one sent to me is defected. It gets warm but doesn&#x27;t melt the wax. The box came pretty banged up so that might be a reason why it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my brows/stache since like grad school, when I could barely afford to add on a wax at the nail salon.  I used to use that stuff that you had to heat up in the microwave.  I was pretty excited to find a kit with it&#x27;s own heater for a good price!  Like $20!  Whaaaat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyhoo, I plugged it in and waited like 25 minutes like the thing said.  At this point, here&#x27;s what you do.  CHIP AWAY AND POKE AT THE EDGES WITH THE SMALLER DOWEL!  You will find some melted wax underneath!  Poke it, stir it around, and wait for it to fully melt.  Use one dowel to spread it on the one you&#x27;re gonna use on your face (or legs or whatever).  Spread the stuff on, leave it little taily thing at the end so you can pull it off easily, and wait like 30 seconds for it to kinda dry.  Poke a finger slightly under the tail, then rip that sucker off!  Good to go.  You can use it on brows, staches, and whatever else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you&#x27;re not experienced in waxing, leave this thing alone, you will just be frustrated.  But if you&#x27;re good with stuff like this, follow our instructions, (not Sally&#x27;s those are kinda vague), and you&#x27;ll be super pumped at the fact you just saved $10!</li>
            <li> Not good its bad no good hot and verey small so its so bad with me and no good no no no</li>
            <li> This warmer kit is great. I found that if I removed the rubber ring and left it covered while it heated the wax will become liquid quicker. Do not leave the lid on to cool! It will get stuck and you can&#x27;t remove it. Turn the lid upside down and completely cover the opening. The wax will be ready in 20-30 min. To remove wax left on the face use baby oil. I bought a professional warmer at a beauty supply store and never use it. That&#x27;s $40 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it works great she uses it in places only your mind knows! Lol! It&#x27;s just like her going to a pro</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen wax for years so I thought I would try this warmer. Not efficient! Buy yourself a $5 candle warmer and get your wax ready much faster. The wax is fabulous so I&#x27;ll give the combined product an extra star.</li>
            <li> I bought this product like everyone else trying to save $$. Bought this and ended up still having to go to the salon cause this product does not work well. must put wax on very thick and let harden. It never pulls off in one whole strip it always breaks. That being said it is very tedious and does not work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it doesnot work..The wax does not get heated...I plug in and wait an hour and it gets warm by a few degree but not enough to melt the wax. I contacted the seller and asked for shipping return lable to send it back but no response was provided.</li>
            <li> This is the worst waxing kit I have ever tried, hands down. The wax is brittle and does not come off in big pieces. The warmer isn&#x27;t hot enough, so it takes about an hour to heat the wax hot enough to use. Even though my hair was much longer than it usually needs to be for successful waxing, the wax didn&#x27;t pick up all of the hair in any of the areas that I used it on. Because I had to pick it off kind of slowly, I ended up with red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does not contain very much wax, and because of the brittleness, it needs to be applied pretty thickly to peel off at all. I&#x27;m not sure that one tin would do both of my legs in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The -one- positive thing about it is that it has a very gentle and pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I called Sally Hansen and asked why it takes so long to melt the wax, and was told the black rubber band needs to be taken off (please don&#x27;t ask me why it&#x27;s not in the instructions).  It will heat up much faster.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. The wax doesn&#x27;t heat up and stays thick and stringy. I&#x27;m returning it immediately, and buying the Gigi brand instead.</li>
            <li> I used to go to an expensive salon downtown for my waxing needs and I loved the results.  Unfortunately, I ended up moving far away from the big city and could no longer afford to go have it done... because now it costs me not only money but too much time and gas to get there and back. I couldn&#x27;t find a local spa that had the same type of waxing available, so I haven&#x27;t gone.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of Sally Hansen products in the past few years trying to get that spa result from home, always sadly disappointed and always having to return to the awful razor, which somehow seems to be less horrible an experience than all the strips and creams and pseudo salon kits out there that I&#x27;ve tried to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this on the shelf my inner voice was screaming \\&quot;NO!  DON&#x27;T FALL FOR IT!\\&quot;  But I was tired of razor burns and angry red bumps, and I did so miss the neat, smooth results of salon waxing, and fell for the promise on the box, totally confident this time it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of the unlucky ones that had the warmer that does not function properly.  Finally, after hours of poking and prodding and waiting, I took the tin downstairs and heated it on my stove burner.  I hurried back upstairs and began what would soon become the most horrific 5 hours of my life.  I can NOT get this stuff off me!  Part would rip off the hair in a neat little strip as it is supposed to do, lending me enough promise to keep trying... but it would leave chunks of broken wax adhered all over along the edges, on my skin. I tried to apply wax over that to pick it up, and what resulted was leaving behind even more debris and wax that would not come up. I tried using the fabric strips from another past, failed home wax kit and that helped some but still would leave behind horrific clumps of sticky wax. Perhaps my skin is just the wrong type... I don&#x27;t know... but hour after hour I slipped more maddeningly into remorse and desperation and finally I tried to shave the s*** off of me, and all hair that it was stuck to, because no amount of picking and pulling and baby oil was saving my soul at that point.  I still have residual sticky on my skin.  My skin is enraged and irritated from all the abuse of trying to get the residual wax off.  The wax is under my fingernails and on my fingers and I&#x27;ve washed and scrubbed and picked and oiled right on into today and I have yet to rid myself of the horrors of this experience. To make matters even worse, I was wearing a fuzzy black bathrobe which somehow managed to stick to whatever residual stickiness is left all over me so now I look like I have grotesque, fuzzy moles everywhere.  Thank GOD my boyfriend is out of town for the weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another home spa waxing kit of any kind again.  The price of a good spa and the satisfaction of the results is far less \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; than several hours of hell and torment of trying to use this product.r that it was stuck to, because no amount of picking and pulling and baby oil was saving my soul at that point.

            <li> The wax it comes with works fine, but the warmer itself is terrible. A good warmer has a heating element on the sides as well as the bottom, but this has only a thin strip of metal on the bottom. It takes an hour to even get the wax warm enough to stir, and no matter how long you leave it on it never gets as hot as it should be for proper hair removal. (It should not burn, but you should feel the heat so that your hair follicles open.) I left it on overnight, thinking eight hours might get it warmer, but it was no hotter than after an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply beyond my imagination how they can make a product that heats this little can of cosmetic wax so thoroughly, so sincerely, and so genuinely.</li>
            <li> I never got to actually use the wax. It took far too long to warm. I turned it on at 9am and it was still not ready by 11am ri-damn-diculous. I just through it away.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it takes foreveeeeeerrr for the wax to be warm. I think it was about one hour or maybe more. Anyway, I used to go to the European Wax Center and it was awesome until I released how much money I was expending every 4 weeks or so for a brazilian and  full legs waxing. So I found this product and decided to give it a chance since is a lot cheaper that going to the wax center.&lt;br /&gt;I have done only the brazilian so far and I love it!! I am used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; so it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me. I recommend this product for girls that are used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; that involves the process of waxing, I mean I have wax so many times so I know what to expect, so if you wax frequently you better get this product and do it yourself, because it actually works just like the wax at the Wax Center and it&#x27;s wayyy less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been heating the wax since 10PM yesterday. It&#x27;s now 7:41 PM the next day they wax is only slightly warm not melted yet. If I can give negative star I would.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it.  Couldn&#x27;t melt the wax.  Brought it back to store.  Prefer the Sally Hansen extra strength all-over body wax that you put in the microwave.</li>
            <li> The warmer doesn&#x27;t warm the wax up enough to make it useable. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of great things on Amazon, but this was a complete waste of time and money!! Keep moving from this product and save yourself a lot of aggravation.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the perfect product to keep me from running back and forth&lt;br /&gt;to the microwave. the instructon said that you are to plug it in and turn it on&lt;br /&gt;and wait for atleast 25 mins. well I waited 30 mins and it still had not melted.&lt;br /&gt;So I used another Cream wax I already had,and by the time I finished the Sally&lt;br /&gt;Hansen Simple Spa Wax Warmer Kit still had NOT did anything. Sorry but the&lt;br /&gt;Idea was greater.</li>
            <li> Hi bought it to make my life easier and this product is great easy to use. extremely compact and the wax is warm not hot.</li>
            <li> It works great.  If you are familiar with waxing this product is well worth it, for a personal use.  It may take a little longer than 25 mins to melt, just make sure the wax container is pressed down into the unit.  It keeps you from going to and from the microwave as much.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Easy to use and saves time and money.</li>
            <li> With the black rubber ring, the wax was not heating up. Without the ring, it sits on the heater and heats up. The wax is just like other waxes of its kind. It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Would be fineif it worked. Arrived in a timely manner but did not heat the wax. Something wrong with unit and I am returning for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I received 2 packs of refills :-( No warmer</li>
            <li> Great Product! Easy to use! It does take about an hour the first time for it to heat up but after that its quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now. I hated spending the money and taking the time to go to the salon all the time. My eyebrows fill in much faster than my hair grows.  The first time I did it home was not perfect, but I learned.&lt;br /&gt; I plug the warmer in at least an hour before I plan on using it. I also use the smallest stick and stir the wax before using.  Also I make sure to clean my face really good afterwards to prevent the redness.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - cheap (my can lasted over a year doing eyebrows every 4-6 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;  - saves time.  It really only takes 5 minutes to do your eyebrows vs going to salon just remember to plug it in ahead of time&lt;br /&gt;  - not permanent so if you take too much, your hair will grow back eventually.  You may need eyeliner in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- it&#x27;s only as good as the person using it.  Does take a little practice to get your technique down.&lt;br /&gt;  - wax takes some time to warm up</li>
            <li> It hurts. I don&#x27;t like it and the warmer is not working right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from CVS and I was excited about it, BUT, when I got home and plugged that sucker in, it never heated the wax at all.  The wax never got melted down.  It&#x27;s cheap, so you get what you pay for.  Maybe I bought a defective machine, but I never got to use it, because it never worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to waxing, but have always used the pre-waxed strips. I decided to try this product out and I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered. I removed the black ring as other reviewers suggested, but after over 2 hours it still wouldn&#x27;t heat up, and the wax was still rock hard. While putting it back in the box the cord keeper for the warmer fell off as well as one of the rubber feet. I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be returning this product to the store. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used the warmer for about a year now and I am very pleased.  After realizing that I had to push the black band all the way into the warmer, it works great.  I suppose you need a little experience in waxing, but it&#x27;s easy to learn.  You stir the wax to get it going, the warmer does not hold a steady temp so when the wax gets a little runny turn it off for a bit, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t too short or too long, use baby powder first, and wax.  I have heavy facial hair and sensitive skin and this is the only wax that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.  I gave it 4 stars because I think the instructions should be clearer and the application sticks are a little weak.</li>
            <li> works great, the wife loves it</li>
            <li> Read tons of comments on this product before I purchased.  Most were positive ones, the negative ones were all basically about the same issue.  Make sure the tin is pushed all the way into the warmer.  It only takes about 20 mins to heat up and it works great!! Had to tighten my budget but didn&#x27;t want to give up certain beauty treatments this did the trick!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this on my sweetie last night.  We usually use microwave wax with strips which works fine, and have also used honey and sugar which worked somewhat less fine.  After waiting the 25 minutes for the wax to warm up it was still hard as a rock.  After 15 more minutes it had only progressed to a scary thick mess.  Unlike the microwave wax, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come with solvent to clean it off of skin, and it doesn&#x27;t come off easily if at all.  After waiting so long and getting nowhere the mood was killed and we didn&#x27;t want to get this wax anywhere near her so we gave up.</li>
            <li> I picked it up on clearance somewhere and thought why not try it for the price.  I first used it on my underarms.  It was SOO easy and removed everything!  I have a lot of thick hair. :/ It was also very easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t find it as easy on small places like  my eyebrows, but I&#x27;m getting better with practice.  I had to make cuts in my budget and could not afford to get my Brazilian done professionally every month anymore.  So I moved on to the next step, doing my own.  It worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;The other wax I tried was GiGi, strip and hard wax. It was terrible.  Both were completely messy and hard to remove from anything!  This Sally Hansen was was so easy to use, one I got the hang of it.  I never made a mess.  It&#x27;s easy to remove from my skin and surfaces.  It stays nice and firm and comes off in one piece. The other wax kept breaking as I was trying to peel! It does take a long time to heat up, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  I plug it in well before I need to use it.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I ran out and I&#x27;m here to buy more!</li>
            <li> Heats up in 50 min. Wax does not spread easily . I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This kit is awful.  I was looking forward to using it since I suffer from hirsutism and I find the wax strips sometimes don&#x27;t work well in certain area.  It&#x27;s been an hour and the stupid warmer hasn&#x27;t warmed the wax.  I can&#x27;t even push one of the wooden sticks in it.  Very disappointing.  I should have read the amazon reviews prior to purchasing at the local big box store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brazilian waxing kit for years now, but always found it inconvenient to  have to reheat the wax when it cooled off. So I gave the wax warmer a try, and on the first go round, it was great. Heated quickly, spread easily, worked exactly like the microwavable kit. The second time around, I plugged it in and the wax wouldn&#x27;t heat up. After 2 hours, all I got was wax the consistency of playdoh. I tried swapping out wax tins in case my wax was just a bad batch, but still couldn&#x27;t get it to heat to the appropriate temperature. I finally extracted the wax from the tin and microwaved it in a small jar after which it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue isn&#x27;t the wax itself - that&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s always been. The cheap, easily shorted warmer on the other hand? Waste of $20 and a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I grew up plucking my armpit hair, which I think made my armpit skin really rough over time. The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops. I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either. After many hours browsing on the web looking for a solution to get smooth armpits, I decided to try waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me. There were two wax warmer kit products I was considering: this Sally Hansen brand, or GiGi. Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product. So, I went to Walmart &amp; bought a Sally Hansen kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I&#x27;ve found this product!! Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do. It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem:&lt;br /&gt;Just like what most reviewers say here, it does take forever to melt the wax. It took me 2-3 hours to melt this small tin of wax that came with the Sally Hansen wax warmer kit. Based on my online research, all I could think about was that maybe Sally Hansen wax didn&#x27;t have a low melting point, and that was why it took so long to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, once I had used up all the Sally Hansen hard wax that came with the warmer kit, I decided to purchase a 14-oz GiGi all purpose hard wax. Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take long at all for the wax to melt! Once I had enough volume of melted wax, I started pouring this liquid wax into my Sally Hansen tin that was empty. Guess what? It never takes long at all now for me to melt this GiGi hard wax using my Sally Hansen wax warmer kit!!! It takes me maybe only 15-20 minutes now to melt the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this result, maybe my theory is right about Sally Hansen wax&#x27;s not having a low melting point since I have a completely different experience with GiGi all purpose hard wax. So, if taking too long to melt the was is the only complaint you have about this Sally Hansen wax warmer, perhaps you want to try what I&#x27;ve done before you decide to pitch this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years for all my facial hair removal and it works perfectly for me. I can&#x27;t imagine how much money I would have spent if I&#x27;d gone to the salon rather than used this each time. I believe reviewers who are having trouble with heating are not putting the canister into the heater far enough. As long as you find the right amount of time to leave the wax on without letting it harden too much, using this wax should be easy and effective. It takes off over 95% of my hair each time, and I have dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this product! We wet through a little hard time and couldn&#x27;t always get to the salon. I used it once only because I just prefer shaving because it only takes me about 5 minutes but my mom uses this product all the time. It is great and definitely removes all of the hair!</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with Sally products but was glad to see this in the store. Sally had this same wax several years ago in a microwavable version but I have been unable to find it. It still works the same and wonderfully well; gets a good percentage of the hair, no strips to have to deal with. Having used it before, I know to leave it to dry a little longer then the instructions said. So, make sure it is not too hot when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have a steady hand to use this product. It does not wash off if you accidentally get some where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for four stars and not five is the time needed to use this product. When I first used it, it took almost 3 hours to melt the wax. The more you use (the more empty the container gets), the shorter the time it takes to melt. So, make sure you plan ahead and have time to wait for the wax to melt completely.</li>
            <li> I purchased a store brand (CVS) wax warmer kit @ 2 years ago and it just recently stopped working.  I ordered the Sally Hansen warmer and am hoping that this one lasts longer.  I love the convenience of the warmer because I can turn it on to warm up and by the time I am done my shower I can use it.  I hated having to run up and down steps to the microwave to heat the wax and then burn myself because the wax was way too hot.</li>
