            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long when you spray it on for a day recommended cologne.</li>
            <li> last a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: The sour note from the original Issey is missing, and i find it a little sweeter over the 2013 edition.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t  appreciate the smell on my husband&#x27;s for that long, it actually disappear that quick considering the expensive price.</li>
            <li> On my dry skin lasts for about 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> double the volume for half the price.</li>
            <li> Totally as expected.</li>
            <li> (but i would-not call it a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; because it serves it purpose): the cap is really tight, so opening and closing the cap takes work...but a tight cap does mean that there is seal, so no juice evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually purchased the wrong scent.</li>
            <li> Am trying to find out the authenticity of this cologne if its real or fake.</li>

            <li> I purchased this item on a guess because my husband loves Issey Miyake cologne. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it smelled. My husband loves it and I do too. The bottle is also so beautiful. I hit the nail on the head with that one. This will be a constant smell good for my man.</li>
            <li> Awesome price smells fantastic quick shipping</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful present for my husband. Something simple and easy</li>
            <li> WHY CAN&#x27;T I BY L&#x27;EAU  BLEAU ?</li>
            <li> Smell like egg... Usually issey r good stuff. Downside is that I can&#x27;t  return this cologne .  Will look into others</li>
            <li> I use this fragrance in 2007 and I liked it a lot, now buy a second occasion and I changed the fragrance in the short time has a good presence, but a longer time is weakened. I prefer the last edition. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Am trying to find out the authenticity of this cologne if its real or fake. It doesn&#x27;t last long when you spray it on for a day recommended cologne. The smell is ok but its not lasting as I know Issey Meyaki normally does.&lt;br /&gt;I Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Bought the original Issey from a department store, but when i saw this summer edition on amazon it really is bargain....double the volume for half the price.

(this is just my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: Love the bottle! The color of the cap is especially eye capturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con (but i would-not call it a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; because it serves it purpose): the cap is really tight, so opening and closing the cap takes work...but a tight cap does mean that there is seal, so no juice evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason i bought it: needed a new summer smell, and cheapest (price wise) out of all the Issey summer line-up.</li>

            <li> 3 sprays will make any woman turn there head and ask you what you are wearing!! very good summer fragrance that becomes stronger with body heat or sweat.
