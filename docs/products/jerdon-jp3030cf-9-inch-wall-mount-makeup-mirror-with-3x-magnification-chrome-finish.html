            <li>Nice finish, fits nicely on my wall, easy to install.</li>
            <li>I liked this one because of the easy height adjustment.  </li>
            <li>I love how I can just tuck the mirror up against the wall.  </li>
            <li>Had one of these in the bath area at a Best Western in Apalachicola, FL during Christmas visit.</li>
            <li>We both love the amount of adjustability this morror has.</li>
            <li>The mirror looks great on the wall and the magnification is very clear.</li>
            <li>Looks great and the 3x&#x27;s is clear.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to adjust to any position I want.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install .</li>
            <li>Was easy to put up and adjust....</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Had seen in a hotel and found on site easily.</li>
            <li>the mirror is quite pretty and the finish looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful mirror, large enough to see all, and</li>
            <li>One side is magnified, which is really nice for putting mascara on with my 40-ish old eyes :).</li>
            <li>Overall a very nice wall mirror..</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love this shaving mirror but be sure to mount it where it is convenient to shave (near electrical outlet, shaving sink, adequate light etc.)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The best feature is that it moves up and down so my husband, who is much taller than me, can use it too.</li>
            <li>This mirror installed easily, with one screw at the top and one at the bottom (easy to install because you can use the mounting hardware as a motif and then pencil-in the holes directly on the wall!) and feels very sturdy to me.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t sound like much of a difference, it feels like a huge difference when using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very first thing I did when I got home was order one.  </li>
            <li>Very crisp image, mirror can be raised or lowered, extended, tilted, swiveled, rotated.  </li>
            <li>mirror is perfect when attempting to tame wild hair!</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The first one was bronze and no longer went with our bathroom decor.  </li>
            <li>I first used one of these in a motel and was determined to find out the info</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>If you will be using your mirror daily, you will be glad</li>
            <li>We first saw one of these in a fancy motel room and it has met with the approval of She</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it to anyone that desires a wall mounted mirror.  </li>
            <li>My wife seen one of these mounted in the Dimond Center hotel in Anchorage and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>The ability to raise and lower the arm is very convenient for all heights of family members</li>
            <li>Only cost $37.09 and I got free shipping from vendor through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The normal bathroom mirror above the sink is fine</li>
            <li>Had to have  one, so naturally checked Amazon first.</li>
            <li>I would love it if it was lit but didn&#x27;t want to mess with cords r wiring..</li>
            <li>otherwise, spend a little more and get the Jerdon with lighted periphery.</li>
            <li>The mirror easily moves up and down the sliding pole to set and stay at any height.</li>
            <li>It is adjustable for height and angle for me to be able to use both hands when needed for hair and other head related needs.</li>
            <li>It has a standard and a 2X magnification side and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>(so much that it&#x27;s hard to clean the mirror without fear of breaking something).  </li>
            <li>But with my new Jerdon JP3030CF 3X wall mounted mirror, I can actually see up close!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really solid, all metal parts, and classy looking.</li>
            <li>Our daughter moved away and was tired of not being able to see the back of her hair.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had this mirror in a bathroom in a very humid Southern climate for about a year now with no signs of rust or other issues.</li>
            <li>It can be raised up and down, and everything on it swivels, so I can see the back of my head in my main mirror for styling my hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good looking well made mirror and is easy to install. The finish is very nice and gives a good appearance on the wall. This is the best of the mirrors listed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I stayed at a very nice hotel that had this mirror attached to the wall. It had a sticker on it with the brand and model number, so I wrote it down and looked it up online. I thought it would be a lot more expensive. It&#x27;s really solid, all metal parts, and classy looking. I installed it myself no problem. One side is magnified, which is really nice for putting mascara on with my 40-ish old eyes :). It can be raised up and down, and everything on it swivels, so I can see the back of my head in my main mirror for styling my hair. Very happy with this mirror!</li>
            <li> Love this shaving mirror but be sure to mount it where it is convenient to shave (near electrical outlet, shaving sink, adequate light etc.) and at the proper height.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and sturdy. Great for my daughter&#x27;s bathroom. It cannot compare to my Restoration Hardware version in my bathroom but that is much, much more expensive. For the money I think this is terrific.</li>
            <li> I am short and nearsighted. Not a good combination.  But with my new Jerdon JP3030CF 3X wall mounted mirror, I can actually see up close! I saw one at a motel just recently with the label and model # on it.  Just had to have one just like it.    The very first thing I did when I got home was order one.  Tickled pink.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it loves it loves it.  You have to have good lighting (which we do) otherwise, spend a little more and get the Jerdon with lighted periphery. you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> The wall mounted mirror is perfect when attempting to tame wild hair! It is adjustable for height and angle for me to be able to use both hands when needed for hair and other head related needs. The normal bathroom mirror above the sink is fine but I couldn&#x27;t see the back of me. Now with this adjustable mirror I get a 360 view. NICE!!!</li>
            <li> Very crisp image, mirror can be raised or lowered, extended, tilted, swiveled, rotated.  It is so easy to adjust to any position I want.  Great for applying makeup and styling hair.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.  I liked this one because of the easy height adjustment.  I love how I can just tuck the mirror up against the wall.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best Mirror ever ! Easy to install . Adjust to accomadate to anyone&#x27;s height . A very attractive fixture that works !</li>
            <li> Great seller, quick delivery!!! I like this mirror but I wished that the extension arm was a little longer. I could have ordered the 5x mirror with the extra extension arm but I have a 5x stand mirror I don&#x27;t like it cause my eye take to long to adjust. I do recommend it for those who don&#x27;t need the extra extension. It&#x27;s a nice sturdy mirror.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive mirror that can be easily installed. It has a standard and a 2X magnification side and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the second Jerdon wall mounted mirror that we&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one was bronze and no longer went with our bathroom decor.  It&#x27;s very easy to install and we especially like the ability to adjust the height for everyone in our household.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for  - PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is well made and gives an excellent view.</li>
            <li> Great mirror and excellent quality.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone that desires a wall mounted mirror.  My wife seen one of these mounted in the Dimond Center hotel in Anchorage and fell in love with it so I got the makers name and ordered it.</li>
            <li> This wall mount mirror is the best!  I first used one of these in a motel and was determined to find out the info so I could order one for our 5th wheel.  The best feature is that it moves up and down so my husband, who is much taller than me, can use it too. It adjusts to any angle and is a \\&quot;must have!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror, large enough to see all, and the 3X is perfect. Any magnification larger than that is very uncomfortable for what i want to see. Nice finish, fits nicely on my wall, easy to install. The ability to raise and lower the arm is very convenient for all heights of family members</li>
            <li> Had one of these in the bath area at a Best Western in Apalachicola, FL during Christmas visit. Had to have  one, so naturally checked Amazon first. Great price, rapid delivery and quick install.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!  Don&#x27;t know what I did without it!! Everyone in my family comes and uses my mirror now. Really do love it!!!</li>
            <li> Was easy to put up and adjust....the mirror is quite pretty and the finish looks nice.  I would love it if it was lit but didn&#x27;t want to mess with cords r wiring.. Overall a very nice wall mirror..</li>
            <li> Mirror is as expected and works well.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!  It is exactly what I wanted.  Easy to install.  Looks great and the 3x&#x27;s is clear.  Thank you Thank you Thank you</li>
            <li> This mirror is somewhat flimsy.  The nut to adjust the mirror up and down is stripped and does not work.  There was also a small scratch on the mirror when I un-boxed it.  There is a lot of movement in the arm (so much that it&#x27;s hard to clean the mirror without fear of breaking something).  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a lemon or &amp;#34;if it is what it is,&amp;#34; but the mirror is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Our daughter moved away and was tired of not being able to see the back of her hair.  She requested a mirror for her birthday just like the one in our home.  This one is better!  She&#x27;s short, her husband is tall and this is adjustable.  The chrome frame around the mirror is very attractive and goes with her fixtures.  It was easy to install and has just the perfect amount of magnification.</li>
            <li> A resort we stayed at in Brigantine, NJ had this same mirror in the unit&#x27;s bathroom. Both my wife and I loved it. Got manufactures name from product sticker and checked out online. This mirror has features that magnifying mirrors at 5X&#x27;s the price don&#x27;t have. Received mirror in short order and installed with no hassle. We both love the amount of adjustability this morror has. Excellent quality and appears very durable. Would make a great Christmas or birthday gift for your family members. Only cost $37.09 and I got free shipping from vendor through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mirror looks great on the wall and the magnification is very clear. Assembly was a little confusing, but I figured it out. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this item. Had seen in a hotel and found on site easily. Would recommend this item</li>
            <li> I took the info off the mirror and ordered two as soon as I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference in area between a nine inch mirror ( 63.62 sq inches ) compared to an eight inch one ( 50.27 sq inches ).  While it doesn&#x27;t sound like much of a difference, it feels like a huge difference when using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to step up to the nine inch size for the additional cost.  If you will be using your mirror daily, you will be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mirror and checking out the lighted versions, I am so glad I bought this one instead of a lighted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great mirror!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I was tired of leaning the 2&#x27; over my bathroom sink countertop to try to see in the main mirror. This mirror installed easily, with one screw at the top and one at the bottom (easy to install because you can use the mounting hardware as a motif and then pencil-in the holes directly on the wall!) and feels very sturdy to me. I have mine drilled into the drywall only (no stud) and have not had any issue feeling like it it&#x27;s going to break loose. I used the mounting hardware included which helps a little to improve hold. The mirror easily moves up and down the sliding pole to set and stay at any height. The only con I have is that the small screw located at six o&#x27;clock on the semi-circle frame occasionally comes loose. When that happens, the mirror wobbles a bit but all you have to do is use your fingers or a screwdriver to re-tighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve had this mirror in a bathroom in a very humid Southern climate for about a year now with no signs of rust or other issues.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  We first saw one of these in a fancy motel room and it has met with the approval of She Whose Approval Must Be Met With.</li>
