    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>No breakouts happened, which is great!  </li>
            <li>The lack of a fragrance is great!  </li>
            <li>; I think they&#x27;re the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>The cloths are perfect for removing eye make up in one swoop; may need two for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For that purpose, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel,</li>
            <li>They are very handy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, just not that awesome for makeup.</li>
            <li>These wipes are great for taking makeup off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Great for on-the-go cleaning, sweaty faces, makeup removal, etc.</li>
            <li>They come in convenient packaging which makes them great for traveling or on the go.  </li>
            <li>the wholesome soap is now available in cleansing cloths!!!</li>
            <li>No need for water, so they are good to travel with.  </li>
            <li>These cleansing cloths are really good -- but not perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have always loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the Cetaphil brand and looked forward to using these cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li>both say, &amp;#34;good stuff, good times.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are good removing makeup, like they claim to, as I can see the makeup on the wipe after wiping my face.</li>
            <li>However, I don’t feel like I’m getting a really good cleansing with these wipes.</li>
            <li>There are a number of good points about these cloths:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, these cloths get skin wonderfully clean (including my waterproof/long-wear mascara and eyeliner).</li>
            <li>I liked the cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>my wife used these and liked them.  </li>
            <li>My opinions are my own though</li>
            <li>This is a nice cleansing wipe</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, they were effective at removing makeup (I should add that this was not waterproof makeup).</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleansing cloths are great also for an after workout wipe!  </li>
            <li>They are handy to carry on a trip or to the gym.</li>
            <li>These are nice cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li>The cloths have a pleasant smell, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>I took off one star because of the price; I would have liked more wipes for the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cetaphil every since a dermatologist recommended it many years ago.</li>
            <li>Instead, the packaging is more like what I&#x27;ve seen with baby wipes.</li>
            <li>I wound up using these as refreshing wipes while traveling (on a plane</li>
            <li>love that much:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>use two of these to cleanse, and I was able to wipe everything.</li>
            <li>I will say this is the best for sensitive skin, but if you are looking for a makeup remover wipe, you might want to try something else unless you wear light makeup.  </li>
            <li>Mostly for that reason, I&#x27;m sticking with the Ponds cloths.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any residue, but I did feel like I had to wash my face again to do a more thorough job.  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE these Cetaphil cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li>I love using cetaphil cleanser - it cleans without drying out your skin or leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>I love the way these cleansing cloths feel.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging could be better as well.</li>
            <li>Please make a more transportable container though.  </li>
            <li>It is narrower than most, but it is longer.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of cleaning cloths and these are probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love my cetaphil cleanser, so when I was looking for a makeup removing cloth</li>
            <li>I love to workout, and found that it&#x27;s nice and cool on my skin as well as</li>
            <li>They are cool and refreshing and nice to get all the dirt off my face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>So I think these would be great for people with very sensitive, smooth skin who don&#x27;t need the kind of make-up removal and exfoliating effects that I need.</li>
            <li>Still, I am giving this a high rating because I think Cetaphil is a great product, and I think I will find a use for these pre-treated cleaning cloths.</li>
            <li>Really happy with these, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But for a simple cleansing cloth at the end of a day that you didn&#x27;t wear makeup, these are good!</li>
            <li>The easy to open/close dispenser keeps the cloths from drying out.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s prone to breakout easily.  </li>
            <li>These cloths make it so easy.  </li>
            <li>Even though I feel clean (and it&#x27;s absolutely better than nothing), it still feels like there&#x27;s a fine film or cleansing residue.</li>
            <li>If you want to use a wipe, this would be a fine one to use.</li>
            <li>These are fine and basically they do what they claim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these cleansing cloths and I would recommend them, just not for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths are a handy thing to have in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin but effective.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was ok, but just not enough of a really good</li>
            <li>As a long time user of Cetaphil, I was happy to see they came out with a cloth version.  </li>
            <li>but I would not use them to clean off waterproof or eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some from a dermatologist-very pricey and was very upset with their inability to do really anything...plus the cloth was virtually indestructible-not good for the landfill.</li>
            <li>One cloth is all it takes to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance-free, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about smelling &amp;#34;like a girl...eewwww,&amp;#34; and it leaves your skin feeling clean without any of that sticky residue</li>
            <li>With Cetaphil wipes, I feel like I need to use another cleanser to get that refreshed, really clean feeling.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and did a pretty good job getting my makeup off.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a special need that justifies it, I would think there must be cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, and remove most grime and make-up.</li>
            <li>I love Cetaphil lotions and washes because they are so gentle.</li>
            <li>The cleaning &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word) are both stronger and very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will just not do a good enough job, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Full stop.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cleansing cloth is adequate to feel clean, but doesn&#x27;t exfoliate or scrub the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it is odorless and really easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>only thing that somewhat spoils them for me is that they are so smooth, and so mild, that I don&#x27;t feel like they effectively remove makeup --</li>
            <li>while being both GENTLE and EFFECTIVE, I would highly recommend these cleaning cloths!</li>
            <li>Also, throwing them in my bag to go to the beach or whenever I could use a quick face rinse</li>
            <li>and keep the wipes around for quick cleanings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product from seller was quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these, I&#x27;m so glad I discovered them.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil is my favorite gentle daily face cleanser by far - smooth, great on sensitive skin, and works wonderfully well: these cetaphil gentle skin cleansing cloths are no different.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good deal, especially for the Cetaphil brand.  </li>
            <li>Because they are damp, not wet, I was able to clean my eyes without getting any of the solution in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t left feeling all that great as I felt the need to lather and rinse the residue off, but I refrained just to see what the Cetaphil wipe would do to my skin, and luckily I found it left my face feeling soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>When I first used the cleansing cloths, they made my skin feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel like my face got as clean vs. using the regular liquid cleanser, but it was nice to use without having to turn the water on in winter.  </li>
            <li>The package is easy to use, keeps the cloths moist, and you get a decent amount of cloths of 25 per package.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li>For evenings when I am tired and want to wash my face easily...these are perfect.</li>
            <li>That said, the convenience factor may be worth it to some.</li>
            <li>size is right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy these again!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, I don&#x27;t honestly know if it was just a faulty first wipe, but the very first cleansing wipe was actually very dry.  </li>
            <li>The Ponds are equally good but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>These wipe do a pretty good job of removing nearly all of my make-up - all that is left after I use them</li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what.</li>
            <li>Even a 30 second exposure in the eye area did not remove most of my eyeshadow or any eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second time I tried using the product, the wipe had more liquid in it, and I found it a bit easier to get my makeup off.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different cleansing cloths and they have all made me break out.</li>
            <li>The cloth is softer than most baby wipes, and yet durable enough for the tack.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil skin cleansing cloths work pretty well for removing my makeup.  </li>
            <li>These Cetaphil wipes are only ok.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive however and this product is not oil free.</li>
            <li>It did take most of my makep off after a lot of scrubbing, but that of course left my skin irritated.</li>
            <li>There are nights where it seems like too much trouble to wash your face, but it isn&#x27;t a good idea to go to bed with make-up still on.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; student of facial cleansing -- good enough for government work, but not superlative.</li>
            <li>I mostly use them to remove makeup at the airport after a long flight if I wanted to refresh/</li>
            <li>They are really long -- much longer than most cleansing cloths I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;These wipes are good for nights where you are too tired to do a full face wash, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them every day.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t seem to have any irritating ingredients (such as alcohol, and certain botanicals), which is excellent.</li>
            <li>However, the price is pretty high, and you&#x27;re just as well off with a gentle face cleanser and your hands.</li>
            <li>The one I got this time is milky in consistency and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all - my skin LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>However, in trying to make these cloths gentle, they don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>I really had to scrub</li>
            <li>Very practical packaging</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I got a sample of these Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths from Influester.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>Have been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing lotion nightly for 18 years.</li>
            <li>Does it make me look younger-NO, but is very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need a wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really cleans the sweat off my face before it has a chance to sink in and cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I really like these Cetaphil wipes.</li>
            <li>However, whether I would buy them again depends on just *how much* of a premium price is being charged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works ok on just surface dirt but not much else.</li>
            <li>to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face after the gym, but when I couldn&#x27;t get straight home for a shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use this product daily, but as a backup for travel, sports,  or those too tired to wash my face nights, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and neutral, not perfumey; each cloth is large enough to remove the day&#x27;s make-up; the texture is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw these wipes in the store because i use only use cetaphil cleaning and lotion products on my face.  </li>
            <li>The first one I purchased was definitely much more like liquid soap (the one that dried out and irritated my skin).  </li>
            <li>They left my skin feeling clean and not filmy like some wipes do.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t necessarily leave my skin feeling clean either.</li>
            <li>Left my skin clean without the feel of chemicals, and the cloth also feels</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive facial skin but surprisingly, these cleansing cloths were gentle enough for me to use on my face even though Cetaphil Cleanser (the one in the pump bottle) does irritate and dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally still use this, and use a gentle face cleanser as well that also removes makeup.  </li>
            <li>The cloths are no different - left my face clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the main thing for which I use wipes.  </li>
            <li>Useful for cleaning and such, but the price seems high to me for an item of this type.  </li>
            <li>They may be better for people with less sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>the negative side, and the reason I can give them only there stars, is that it takes twice as many of these cloths to clean my face as it does Ponds cloths.  </li>
            <li>I now use them to clean and they will absolutely not TEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are focused on detailed facial cleaning, so the size is smaller.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and thick and soft.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft but for me, that didn&#x27;t work out well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These are pretty basic cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with cleansing cloths from other brands such as Alba or Yes to Carrots.</li>
            <li>With other wipes, my face feels refreshed and clean afterwards, and I sometimes don’t feel the need to cleanse with another face cleanser.</li>
            <li>This definitely doesn&#x27;t replace the tried and true daily cleanser in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the few times I did (without rinsing since I didn&#x27;t have access to water) I was perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil cleansers are a gentle cleanser, so this is probably why you don’t get that deep down clean with these wipes.</li>
            <li>so I would only use if you&#x27;re not planning on scrubbing too much.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and had no problems using these cleansing cloths as part of her nightly routine.</li>
            <li>They are oh so soft</li>
            <li>I like that they too have no scent that can irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and they take off my makeup with ease.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and they don&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing it &#x27;again&#x27; even though it was rough on my skin the first time around as a temporary fill in for my normal brand</li>
            <li>I tried my best to use it to get my makeup off, but it was stubborn, and my face was red and streaked with faint black lines when I finished, so it still needed additional cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the portability of the cloths - particularly on vacation when you don&#x27;t want to pack a bottle of facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t dry me out (and don&#x27;t cost a fortune), and Cetaphil does a great job of keeping the moisture in.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that these would be individually wrapped, which would make it easy to tuck a few into every purse and travel bag.</li>
            <li>Oh, at the end of a long day, it really is tempting to use a cleansing cloth (or make-up remover cloth).</li>
            <li>/&gt;She found these cleansing cloths to be very convenient to carry either in her Baggalini or day pack, and used them as needed when we were on the go: to freshen up on the plane, to clean up after a messy buffet meal, to wipe off &amp;#34;the elements&amp;#34; after a beach stop, or to just moisten her skin in well-heated but dry surroundings during a family visit on the frozen tundra of Minnesota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally a makeup wipe for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I not only have sensitive skin, but I also have oily skin</li>
            <li>They do leave eye makeup (mascara and liner, particularly) behind, which hasn&#x27;t bothered me, but they&#x27;re an awesome stopgap between getting down and dirty and getting squeaky clean in the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these for regular nightly cleanings, but rather for a quick wipe after working out or on nights when I&#x27;m really, really lazy.</li>
            <li>Other cleansing cloths that claim to be hypo-allergenic have caused skin reactions on me after just one use, so I do think that these would be gentle enough for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were very dry out of the package (so much so that I scoured the directions to see if I needed to wet it to activate it or something).</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> No breakouts happened, which is great!  </li>
            <li> The lack of a fragrance is great!  </li>
            <li> ; I think they&#x27;re the perfect size.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are perfect for removing eye make up in one swoop; may need two for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For that purpose, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel,</li>
            <li> They are very handy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, just not that awesome for makeup.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great for taking makeup off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great for on-the-go cleaning, sweaty faces, makeup removal, etc.</li>
            <li> They come in convenient packaging which makes them great for traveling or on the go.  </li>
            <li> the wholesome soap is now available in cleansing cloths!!!</li>
            <li> No need for water, so they are good to travel with.  </li>
            <li> These cleansing cloths are really good -- but not perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have always loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Cetaphil brand and looked forward to using these cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> both say, &amp;#34;good stuff, good times.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They are good removing makeup, like they claim to, as I can see the makeup on the wipe after wiping my face.</li>
            <li> However, I don’t feel like I’m getting a really good cleansing with these wipes.</li>
            <li> There are a number of good points about these cloths:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, these cloths get skin wonderfully clean (including my waterproof/long-wear mascara and eyeliner).</li>
            <li> I liked the cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> my wife used these and liked them.  </li>
            <li> My opinions are my own though</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleansing wipe</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, they were effective at removing makeup (I should add that this was not waterproof makeup).</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleansing cloths are great also for an after workout wipe!  </li>
            <li> They are handy to carry on a trip or to the gym.</li>
            <li> These are nice cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> The cloths have a pleasant smell, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star because of the price; I would have liked more wipes for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil every since a dermatologist recommended it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Instead, the packaging is more like what I&#x27;ve seen with baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I wound up using these as refreshing wipes while traveling (on a plane</li>
            <li> love that much:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> use two of these to cleanse, and I was able to wipe everything.</li>
            <li> I will say this is the best for sensitive skin, but if you are looking for a makeup remover wipe, you might want to try something else unless you wear light makeup.  </li>
            <li> Mostly for that reason, I&#x27;m sticking with the Ponds cloths.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any residue, but I did feel like I had to wash my face again to do a more thorough job.  </li>
            <li> I really LOVE these Cetaphil cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> I love using cetaphil cleanser - it cleans without drying out your skin or leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> I love the way these cleansing cloths feel.</li>
            <li> I think the packaging could be better as well.</li>
            <li> Please make a more transportable container though.  </li>
            <li> It is narrower than most, but it is longer.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cleaning cloths and these are probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love my cetaphil cleanser, so when I was looking for a makeup removing cloth</li>
            <li> I love to workout, and found that it&#x27;s nice and cool on my skin as well as</li>
            <li> They are cool and refreshing and nice to get all the dirt off my face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> So I think these would be great for people with very sensitive, smooth skin who don&#x27;t need the kind of make-up removal and exfoliating effects that I need.</li>
            <li> Still, I am giving this a high rating because I think Cetaphil is a great product, and I think I will find a use for these pre-treated cleaning cloths.</li>
            <li> Really happy with these, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But for a simple cleansing cloth at the end of a day that you didn&#x27;t wear makeup, these are good!</li>
            <li> The easy to open/close dispenser keeps the cloths from drying out.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s prone to breakout easily.  </li>
            <li> These cloths make it so easy.  </li>
            <li> Even though I feel clean (and it&#x27;s absolutely better than nothing), it still feels like there&#x27;s a fine film or cleansing residue.</li>
            <li> If you want to use a wipe, this would be a fine one to use.</li>
            <li> These are fine and basically they do what they claim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these cleansing cloths and I would recommend them, just not for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths are a handy thing to have in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin but effective.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was ok, but just not enough of a really good</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Cetaphil, I was happy to see they came out with a cloth version.  </li>
            <li> but I would not use them to clean off waterproof or eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some from a dermatologist-very pricey and was very upset with their inability to do really anything...plus the cloth was virtually indestructible-not good for the landfill.</li>
            <li> One cloth is all it takes to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance-free, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about smelling &amp;#34;like a girl...eewwww,&amp;#34; and it leaves your skin feeling clean without any of that sticky residue</li>
            <li> With Cetaphil wipes, I feel like I need to use another cleanser to get that refreshed, really clean feeling.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and did a pretty good job getting my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a special need that justifies it, I would think there must be cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> They are gentle, and remove most grime and make-up.</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil lotions and washes because they are so gentle.</li>
            <li> The cleaning &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word) are both stronger and very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will just not do a good enough job, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Full stop.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cleansing cloth is adequate to feel clean, but doesn&#x27;t exfoliate or scrub the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it is odorless and really easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> only thing that somewhat spoils them for me is that they are so smooth, and so mild, that I don&#x27;t feel like they effectively remove makeup --</li>
            <li> while being both GENTLE and EFFECTIVE, I would highly recommend these cleaning cloths!</li>
            <li> Also, throwing them in my bag to go to the beach or whenever I could use a quick face rinse</li>
            <li> and keep the wipes around for quick cleanings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product from seller was quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these, I&#x27;m so glad I discovered them.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil is my favorite gentle daily face cleanser by far - smooth, great on sensitive skin, and works wonderfully well: these cetaphil gentle skin cleansing cloths are no different.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good deal, especially for the Cetaphil brand.  </li>
            <li> Because they are damp, not wet, I was able to clean my eyes without getting any of the solution in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t left feeling all that great as I felt the need to lather and rinse the residue off, but I refrained just to see what the Cetaphil wipe would do to my skin, and luckily I found it left my face feeling soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> When I first used the cleansing cloths, they made my skin feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel like my face got as clean vs. using the regular liquid cleanser, but it was nice to use without having to turn the water on in winter.  </li>
            <li> The package is easy to use, keeps the cloths moist, and you get a decent amount of cloths of 25 per package.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have sensitive skin and most products</li>
            <li> For evenings when I am tired and want to wash my face easily...these are perfect.</li>
            <li> That said, the convenience factor may be worth it to some.</li>
            <li> size is right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy these again!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I don&#x27;t honestly know if it was just a faulty first wipe, but the very first cleansing wipe was actually very dry.  </li>
            <li> The Ponds are equally good but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> These wipe do a pretty good job of removing nearly all of my make-up - all that is left after I use them</li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what.</li>
            <li> Even a 30 second exposure in the eye area did not remove most of my eyeshadow or any eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The second time I tried using the product, the wipe had more liquid in it, and I found it a bit easier to get my makeup off.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different cleansing cloths and they have all made me break out.</li>
            <li> The cloth is softer than most baby wipes, and yet durable enough for the tack.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil skin cleansing cloths work pretty well for removing my makeup.  </li>
            <li> These Cetaphil wipes are only ok.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive however and this product is not oil free.</li>
            <li> It did take most of my makep off after a lot of scrubbing, but that of course left my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> There are nights where it seems like too much trouble to wash your face, but it isn&#x27;t a good idea to go to bed with make-up still on.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; student of facial cleansing -- good enough for government work, but not superlative.</li>
            <li> I mostly use them to remove makeup at the airport after a long flight if I wanted to refresh/</li>
            <li> They are really long -- much longer than most cleansing cloths I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;These wipes are good for nights where you are too tired to do a full face wash, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them every day.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t seem to have any irritating ingredients (such as alcohol, and certain botanicals), which is excellent.</li>
            <li> However, the price is pretty high, and you&#x27;re just as well off with a gentle face cleanser and your hands.</li>
            <li> The one I got this time is milky in consistency and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all - my skin LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> However, in trying to make these cloths gentle, they don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> I really had to scrub</li>
            <li> Very practical packaging</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I got a sample of these Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths from Influester.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Have been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing lotion nightly for 18 years.</li>
            <li> Does it make me look younger-NO, but is very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need a wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really cleans the sweat off my face before it has a chance to sink in and cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I really like these Cetaphil wipes.</li>
            <li> However, whether I would buy them again depends on just *how much* of a premium price is being charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works ok on just surface dirt but not much else.</li>
            <li> to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face after the gym, but when I couldn&#x27;t get straight home for a shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use this product daily, but as a backup for travel, sports,  or those too tired to wash my face nights, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and neutral, not perfumey; each cloth is large enough to remove the day&#x27;s make-up; the texture is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw these wipes in the store because i use only use cetaphil cleaning and lotion products on my face.  </li>
            <li> The first one I purchased was definitely much more like liquid soap (the one that dried out and irritated my skin).  </li>
            <li> They left my skin feeling clean and not filmy like some wipes do.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t necessarily leave my skin feeling clean either.</li>
            <li> Left my skin clean without the feel of chemicals, and the cloth also feels</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive facial skin but surprisingly, these cleansing cloths were gentle enough for me to use on my face even though Cetaphil Cleanser (the one in the pump bottle) does irritate and dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally still use this, and use a gentle face cleanser as well that also removes makeup.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are no different - left my face clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the main thing for which I use wipes.  </li>
            <li> Useful for cleaning and such, but the price seems high to me for an item of this type.  </li>
            <li> They may be better for people with less sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> the negative side, and the reason I can give them only there stars, is that it takes twice as many of these cloths to clean my face as it does Ponds cloths.  </li>
            <li> I now use them to clean and they will absolutely not TEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are focused on detailed facial cleaning, so the size is smaller.  </li>
            <li> They are nice and thick and soft.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft but for me, that didn&#x27;t work out well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These are pretty basic cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with cleansing cloths from other brands such as Alba or Yes to Carrots.</li>
            <li> With other wipes, my face feels refreshed and clean afterwards, and I sometimes don’t feel the need to cleanse with another face cleanser.</li>
            <li> This definitely doesn&#x27;t replace the tried and true daily cleanser in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the few times I did (without rinsing since I didn&#x27;t have access to water) I was perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil cleansers are a gentle cleanser, so this is probably why you don’t get that deep down clean with these wipes.</li>
            <li> so I would only use if you&#x27;re not planning on scrubbing too much.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and had no problems using these cleansing cloths as part of her nightly routine.</li>
            <li> They are oh so soft</li>
            <li> I like that they too have no scent that can irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and they take off my makeup with ease.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and they don&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing it &#x27;again&#x27; even though it was rough on my skin the first time around as a temporary fill in for my normal brand</li>
            <li> I tried my best to use it to get my makeup off, but it was stubborn, and my face was red and streaked with faint black lines when I finished, so it still needed additional cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the portability of the cloths - particularly on vacation when you don&#x27;t want to pack a bottle of facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t dry me out (and don&#x27;t cost a fortune), and Cetaphil does a great job of keeping the moisture in.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that these would be individually wrapped, which would make it easy to tuck a few into every purse and travel bag.</li>
            <li> Oh, at the end of a long day, it really is tempting to use a cleansing cloth (or make-up remover cloth).</li>
            <li> /&gt;She found these cleansing cloths to be very convenient to carry either in her Baggalini or day pack, and used them as needed when we were on the go: to freshen up on the plane, to clean up after a messy buffet meal, to wipe off &amp;#34;the elements&amp;#34; after a beach stop, or to just moisten her skin in well-heated but dry surroundings during a family visit on the frozen tundra of Minnesota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally a makeup wipe for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I not only have sensitive skin, but I also have oily skin</li>
            <li> They do leave eye makeup (mascara and liner, particularly) behind, which hasn&#x27;t bothered me, but they&#x27;re an awesome stopgap between getting down and dirty and getting squeaky clean in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for regular nightly cleanings, but rather for a quick wipe after working out or on nights when I&#x27;m really, really lazy.</li>
            <li> Other cleansing cloths that claim to be hypo-allergenic have caused skin reactions on me after just one use, so I do think that these would be gentle enough for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were very dry out of the package (so much so that I scoured the directions to see if I needed to wet it to activate it or something).</li>
            <li> the one I have now reads for \\&quot;all skin types\\&quot;, while the one I had previously was for \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my daily facial cleaning though as I prefer a wet washcloth or cleaning liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> uses:&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself taking them camping or on long hikes.</li>
            <li> like that these are very soft on my skin and they have very little scent.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave and residue.</li>
            <li> Other products that I&#x27;ve used (Ponds cleansing cloths) come in a pouch sealed by tape, and once the tape gets wet, they don&#x27;t seal well for future use.  </li>
            <li> , I can see them staying moist with the lid closed for a long time</li>
            <li> If you sell a product for nightly cleansing-you should include at least 30...and price it for the general public.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> They get almost everything off (I only wear eyeshadow, liner and mascara), although they&#x27;re a little scratchy</li>
            <li> I have tried different name brand products, but I&#x27;ve found a few broke me out, and others didn&#x27;t get all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li> Really not even helpful to try and dissolve before washing</li>
            <li> Not exactly.  </li>
            <li> other wipes sometimes leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other person said, they are not very &#x27;green&#x27;: there is unnecessary cardboard packaging.</li>
            <li> They are damper/more moist than average for face wipes</li>
            <li> re-do my makeup and also to wipe down my hands.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin horribly like many other cleansing cloths do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cover shuts tightly</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser closes tightly and I&#x27;ve not had any issue with them drying out.</li>
            <li> I did not try to scrub since based on the exposure test it does not clean eye makeup well.  </li>
            <li> is a little mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cetaphil cleanser was never great at removing make up unless you added corn starch to make it a scrub and was definitely not for use in the eye area.</li>
            <li> complaint-two few cloths in the package for the price.</li>
            <li> But they do leave a bit of uncomfortable residue on my face, so I generally wind up splashing some water on my face or using a wash cloth anyway.</li>
            <li> After a long day, I usually dread removing make up, too lazy, tired, etc.  </li>
            <li> I usually use one, sometimes two, after a workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I felt these were a bit small.  </li>
            <li> The quick swipe of all make-up...followed in a few days by nasty breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still had to rub quite hard, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any negative skin reactions to this product:</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time taking off eye makeup with these.</li>
            <li> They seem relatively expensive, however, for the amount of cloths that you receive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that I bought a 2-pack and will now need to find something else.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I tried them.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem removing my eye makeup, base, powder, or blush with these cloths.  </li>
            <li> and I am shocked that it happened with cetaphil!</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> These wipes are great for taking makeup off at the end of the day. They get almost everything off (I only wear eyeshadow, liner and mascara), although they&#x27;re a little scratchy so I would only use if you&#x27;re not planning on scrubbing too much. I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t dry me out (and don&#x27;t cost a fortune), and Cetaphil does a great job of keeping the moisture in.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Cetaphil, I was happy to see they came out with a cloth version.  The package is easy to use, keeps the cloths moist, and you get a decent amount of cloths of 25 per package.  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel like my face got as clean vs. using the regular liquid cleanser, but it was nice to use without having to turn the water on in winter.  These cloths do not need water to rinse, basically, you wipe and and go, done.  I don&#x27;t think I would use this product daily, but as a backup for travel, sports,  or those too tired to wash my face nights, it&#x27;s perfect.  The package is a lot easier to throw in a bag and go than the liquid version of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleansing wipes. They are very soft and did a pretty good job getting my makeup off. That being said, I don&#x27;t feel like this can replace an exfoliating face wash or wipe. I still felt like I need to use something else too wash my face after.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is my favorite gentle daily face cleanser by far - smooth, great on sensitive skin, and works wonderfully well: these cetaphil gentle skin cleansing cloths are no different.  Great for on-the-go cleaning, sweaty faces, makeup removal, etc. while being both GENTLE and EFFECTIVE, I would highly recommend these cleaning cloths!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive facial skin but surprisingly, these cleansing cloths were gentle enough for me to use on my face even though Cetaphil Cleanser (the one in the pump bottle) does irritate and dry out my skin.  I mostly use them to remove makeup at the airport after a long flight if I wanted to refresh/re-do my makeup and also to wipe down my hands.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t use them on my face daily but the few times I did (without rinsing since I didn&#x27;t have access to water) I was perfectly fine.  Other cleansing cloths that claim to be hypo-allergenic have caused skin reactions on me after just one use, so I do think that these would be gentle enough for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Felt like I should make amends to my earlier comment that Cetaphil Cleanser (in the pump bottle) irritates and dries out my skin.  I ended up purchasing it &#x27;again&#x27; even though it was rough on my skin the first time around as a temporary fill in for my normal brand and this is when I realized there are TWO versions of this cleanser!  The first one I purchased was definitely much more like liquid soap (the one that dried out and irritated my skin).  The one I got this time is milky in consistency and doesn&#x27;t really lather at all - my skin LOVES it.  The bottles both look the same but for reference the one I have now reads for \\&quot;all skin types\\&quot;, while the one I had previously was for \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil every since a dermatologist recommended it many years ago. I love that it is odorless and really easy on sensitive skin. I was hoping that these would be individually wrapped, which would make it easy to tuck a few into every purse and travel bag. Instead, the packaging is more like what I&#x27;ve seen with baby wipes. All the cloths are in one compartment, which means they all travel together. I suppose that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for a lot of people, but I don&#x27;t tend to have room for something this big in the bags I carry. Still, I am giving this a high rating because I think Cetaphil is a great product, and I think I will find a use for these pre-treated cleaning cloths. I just haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what.</li>
            <li> Basically, these do what they say. They are quite portable and convenient. I don&#x27;t use these for regular nightly cleanings, but rather for a quick wipe after working out or on nights when I&#x27;m really, really lazy. They are gentle, and remove most grime and make-up. But they do leave a bit of uncomfortable residue on my face, so I generally wind up splashing some water on my face or using a wash cloth anyway.</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil lotions and washes because they are so gentle. However, in trying to make these cloths gentle, they don&#x27;t really do the job. I had a very hard time taking off eye makeup with these. I really had to scrub and I don&#x27;t like to do that over the eye area. It did a passable job cleaning off facial makeup. I wound up using these as refreshing wipes while traveling (on a plane or when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup.) They are very soft but for me, that didn&#x27;t work out well.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use these wipes (I prefer to use men&#x27;s products even though they are probably the same stuff) my wife used these and liked them.  She told me that  at seven bucks it&#x27;s a pretty good deal, especially for the Cetaphil brand.  She has sensitive skin and had no problems using these cleansing cloths as part of her nightly routine. The easy to open/close dispenser keeps the cloths from drying out.  No need for water, so they are good to travel with.  I took off one star because of the price; I would have liked more wipes for the price.</li>
            <li> These cleansing cloths are really good -- but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They don&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have sensitive skin and most products don&#x27;t work with my skin)&lt;br /&gt;- They are oh so soft&lt;br /&gt;- They are really long -- much longer than most cleansing cloths I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;- Very practical packaging, I can see them staying moist with the lid closed for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t love that much:&lt;br /&gt;- As other person said, they are not very &#x27;green&#x27;: there is unnecessary cardboard packaging. What&#x27;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt;- They are not as moist as I like my cleansing cloths to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best uses:&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself taking them camping or on long hikes. Also, throwing them in my bag to go to the beach or whenever I could use a quick face rinse and I don&#x27;t have a sink nearby. I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my daily facial cleaning though as I prefer a wet washcloth or cleaning liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these cleansing cloths and I would recommend them, just not for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got a sample of these Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths from Influester. My opinions are my own though</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleansing wipe but I would not use them to clean off waterproof or eye makeup.  This works well as an after work out facial cleanser.  Even a 30 second exposure in the eye area did not remove most of my eyeshadow or any eyeliner.  I did not try to scrub since based on the exposure test it does not clean eye makeup well.  The cetaphil cleanser was never great at removing make up unless you added corn starch to make it a scrub and was definitely not for use in the eye area. I will not buy this again since it does not offer a lot of cleansing power.</li>
            <li> There are nights where it seems like too much trouble to wash your face, but it isn&#x27;t a good idea to go to bed with make-up still on. That&#x27;s when Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleansing Cloths are a handy thing to have in your bathroom. These wipe do a pretty good job of removing nearly all of my make-up - all that is left after I use them is a little mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two of these to cleanse, and I was able to wipe everything. Because they are damp, not wet, I was able to clean my eyes without getting any of the solution in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are good for nights where you are too tired to do a full face wash, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them every day. For my regular cleansing, I will stick to [[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and keep the wipes around for quick cleanings.</li>
            <li> Have been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing lotion nightly for 18 years. have always loved it. Does it make me look younger-NO, but is very soothing on the skin. I was shocked to find how good these cleansing cloths were-they removed ALL eye-make-up-always the most difficult and with no residual left on the skin. I purchased some from a dermatologist-very pricey and was very upset with their inability to do really anything...plus the cloth was virtually indestructible-not good for the landfill.I now use them to clean and they will absolutely not TEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint-two few cloths in the package for the price. If you sell a product for nightly cleansing-you should include at least 30...and price it for the general public. Amazon&#x27;s price was ok, but just not enough of a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product from seller was quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> These are pretty basic cleansing cloths. They do not contain any added fragrance, which is definitely a point in their favor. They also don&#x27;t seem to have any irritating ingredients (such as alcohol, and certain botanicals), which is excellent. However, the price is pretty high, and you&#x27;re just as well off with a gentle face cleanser and your hands. You don&#x27;t really need a wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, they were effective at removing makeup (I should add that this was not waterproof makeup). If you want to use a wipe, this would be a fine one to use.</li>
            <li> I not only have sensitive skin, but I also have oily skin that&#x27;s prone to breakout easily.  So I took a chance, and decided on this makeup removing wipe as I needed something that worked all angles for my face.  I have tried different name brand products, but I&#x27;ve found a few broke me out, and others didn&#x27;t get all the makeup off.  (As a side note I am a lover of liquid eyeliner that does not like to leave my skin when I&#x27;m removing my makeup.) When I first opened the package, I don&#x27;t honestly know if it was just a faulty first wipe, but the very first cleansing wipe was actually very dry.  I tried my best to use it to get my makeup off, but it was stubborn, and my face was red and streaked with faint black lines when I finished, so it still needed additional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried using the product, the wipe had more liquid in it, and I found it a bit easier to get my makeup off.  I still had to rub quite hard, but it does work.  My skin wasn&#x27;t left feeling all that great as I felt the need to lather and rinse the residue off, but I refrained just to see what the Cetaphil wipe would do to my skin, and luckily I found it left my face feeling soft and nice.  No breakouts happened, which is great!  I will say this is the best for sensitive skin, but if you are looking for a makeup remover wipe, you might want to try something else unless you wear light makeup.  I normally still use this, and use a gentle face cleanser as well that also removes makeup.  Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleansing cloths are great also for an after workout wipe!  I love to workout, and found that it&#x27;s nice and cool on my skin as well as really cleans the sweat off my face before it has a chance to sink in and cause breakouts.  It&#x27;s a very good product, just not that awesome for makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like these Cetaphil wipes. They are handy to carry on a trip or to the gym. They work well removing dirt and makeup. They left my skin feeling clean and not filmy like some wipes do. They are a bit pricey so I will still use my Cetaphil cleanser at home.</li>
            <li> I have used many different cleansing cloths and they have all made me break out. These do not!!! For evenings when I am tired and want to wash my face easily...these are perfect. I have been using them for a month and they have not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My first reaction to these Cetaphil cloths was: &amp;#34;Okay, these are small baby wipes&amp;#34;.  Not exactly.  These are focused on detailed facial cleaning, so the size is smaller.  The cloth is softer than most baby wipes, and yet durable enough for the tack.  The cleaning &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word) are both stronger and very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a high-quality product.  In my opinion, they earn a premium price compared to using baby wipes for the same task.  However, whether I would buy them again depends on just *how much* of a premium price is being charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Cetaphil brand and looked forward to using these cleansing cloths.  When I first used the cleansing cloths, they made my skin feel fresh and clean.  I have very sensitive skin and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which was reassuring.  The lack of a fragrance is great!  They come in convenient packaging which makes them great for traveling or on the go.  They seem relatively expensive, however, for the amount of cloths that you receive.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cover shuts tightly so they stay moist&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove mascara well, not even water based&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove waterproof sunscreen well. Really not even helpful to try and dissolve before washing&lt;br /&gt;Works ok on just surface dirt but not much else.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil skin cleansing cloths work pretty well for removing my makeup.  I have no problem removing my eye makeup, base, powder, or blush with these cloths.  Even water-proof mascara washes off nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that these are very soft on my skin and they have very little scent.  I also like the size of each cloth; I think they&#x27;re the perfect size.  Lastly, I&#x27;m a fan of the snap-shut case.  Other products that I&#x27;ve used (Ponds cleansing cloths) come in a pouch sealed by tape, and once the tape gets wet, they don&#x27;t seal well for future use.  I think this makes the Cetaphil cloths a winner for those that travel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, and the reason I can give them only there stars, is that it takes twice as many of these cloths to clean my face as it does Ponds cloths.  Doubling up cloths each night makes this suddenly a lot more expensive than the Ponds cloths.  Mostly for that reason, I&#x27;m sticking with the Ponds cloths.  The Ponds are equally good but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil products for years. This definitely doesn&#x27;t replace the tried and true daily cleanser in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any negative skin reactions to this product: no blotches, hives or irritation. However, it didn&#x27;t necessarily leave my skin feeling clean either. I didn&#x27;t notice any residue, but I did feel like I had to wash my face again to do a more thorough job.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with cleansing cloths from other brands such as Alba or Yes to Carrots.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE these Cetaphil cleansing cloths.  After a long day, I usually dread removing make up, too lazy, tired, etc.  These cloths make it so easy.  One cloth is all it takes to clean my face.  The cloths have a pleasant smell, which is important to me.  They are nice and thick and soft.  Gentle on the skin but effective.  I will definitely be buying more of these, I&#x27;m so glad I discovered them.  Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  Really happy with these, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife while we were preparing to hit the road for an extended vacation including cruising, beach, pool, city touring, and family visit. She uses Cetaphil skin lotions regularly and just likes the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She found these cleansing cloths to be very convenient to carry either in her Baggalini or day pack, and used them as needed when we were on the go: to freshen up on the plane, to clean up after a messy buffet meal, to wipe off &amp;#34;the elements&amp;#34; after a beach stop, or to just moisten her skin in well-heated but dry surroundings during a family visit on the frozen tundra of Minnesota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used them a couple of times. It&#x27;s fragrance-free, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about smelling &amp;#34;like a girl...eewwww,&amp;#34; and it leaves your skin feeling clean without any of that sticky residue other wipes sometimes leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both say, &amp;#34;good stuff, good times.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are nice cleansing cloths. They aren&#x27;t heavy-duty, and struggle with heavy eye makeup (or really, mascara at all). But for a simple cleansing cloth at the end of a day that you didn&#x27;t wear makeup, these are good! I didn&#x27;t notice any blemishes after a week of use. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin horribly like many other cleansing cloths do. I would not recommend these for habitual cleaning of your face after wearing makeup, this and any cleansing cloth will just not do a good enough job, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love using cetaphil cleanser - it cleans without drying out your skin or leaving any residue.  The cloths are no different - left my face clean and fresh.  I like that they too have no scent that can irritate sensitive skin.  The cloths are perfect for removing eye make up in one swoop; may need two for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the portability of the cloths - particularly on vacation when you don&#x27;t want to pack a bottle of facial cleanser.  They are very handy!</li>
            <li> The gym.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive, breakout-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The veritable holy trinity of problematic complexions. I got this item in hopes that I could keep it in my gym bag (in a Ziploc!) to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face after the gym, but when I couldn&#x27;t get straight home for a shower. For that purpose, it&#x27;s excellent. Full stop. It gets cosmetics, grime, sweat, dirt, etc., off of my face. The texture of the cleansing cloth is adequate to feel clean, but doesn&#x27;t exfoliate or scrub the surface of my skin. I usually use one, sometimes two, after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser closes tightly and I&#x27;ve not had any issue with them drying out. The packaging also hasn&#x27;t leaked at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not a substitute for regular Cetaphil + water cleansing. Even though I feel clean (and it&#x27;s absolutely better than nothing), it still feels like there&#x27;s a fine film or cleansing residue. They&#x27;re the &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; student of facial cleansing -- good enough for government work, but not superlative. They do leave eye makeup (mascara and liner, particularly) behind, which hasn&#x27;t bothered me, but they&#x27;re an awesome stopgap between getting down and dirty and getting squeaky clean in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the way these cleansing cloths feel. They are soft and they take off my makeup with ease. I&#x27;ll certainly buy these again!</li>
            <li> These are fine and basically they do what they claim. Useful for cleaning and such, but the price seems high to me for an item of this type.  Unless you have a special need that justifies it, I would think there must be cheaper alternatives. That said, the convenience factor may be worth it to some. I think the packaging could be better as well. Basically a plastic bag with a plastic cap. Also, I felt these were a bit small.  So my rating is &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; (3 stars).</li>
            <li> Finally a makeup wipe for sensitive skin!  Please make a more transportable container though.  This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of face wipes, and I’ve found one or two that are favorites.  These Cetaphil wipes are only ok. They are good removing makeup, like they claim to, as I can see the makeup on the wipe after wiping my face. However, I don’t feel like I’m getting a really good cleansing with these wipes. With other wipes, my face feels refreshed and clean afterwards, and I sometimes don’t feel the need to cleanse with another face cleanser. With Cetaphil wipes, I feel like I need to use another cleanser to get that refreshed, really clean feeling. Cetaphil cleansers are a gentle cleanser, so this is probably why you don’t get that deep down clean with these wipes. I like the convenience of the wipes for my face, but I probably would not use these wipes again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands and was eager to try this one since Cetaphil soap / cleanser has been the go-to product for dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;It did not disappoint.  Left my skin clean without the feel of chemicals, and the cloth also feels good.&lt;br /&gt;The size is right.  It is narrower than most, but it is longer.&lt;br /&gt;Glad the wholesome soap is now available in cleansing cloths!!!</li>
            <li> There are a number of good points about these cloths:&lt;br /&gt;1.  They are larger than some on the market&lt;br /&gt;2.  They are damper/more moist than average for face wipes&lt;br /&gt;3.  They are non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that somewhat spoils them for me is that they are so smooth, and so mild, that I don&#x27;t feel like they effectively remove makeup -- and that&#x27;s the main thing for which I use wipes.  Also, they don&#x27;t exfoliate, and that&#x27;s something I need too.  So I think these would be great for people with very sensitive, smooth skin who don&#x27;t need the kind of make-up removal and exfoliating effects that I need.</li>
            <li> Oh, at the end of a long day, it really is tempting to use a cleansing cloth (or make-up remover cloth). The quick swipe of all make-up...followed in a few days by nasty breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with the Cetaphil cleansing cloths! The smell is fresh and neutral, not perfumey; each cloth is large enough to remove the day&#x27;s make-up; the texture is very gentle. Best of all, these cloths get skin wonderfully clean (including my waterproof/long-wear mascara and eyeliner). They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and they don&#x27;t cause breakouts. Perfect for travel, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are going to become a part of my regular routine!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cleaning cloths and these are probably my favorite. They are cool and refreshing and nice to get all the dirt off my face at the end of the day. They don&#x27;t remove eye makeup but that isn&#x27;t their intention. I like to use them after I have taken off my eye makeup. They don&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave and residue.</li>
            <li> They may be better for people with less sensitive skin.  To me, they leave a greasy film and caused some breakouts.  My skin is sensitive however and this product is not oil free.</li>
            <li> I love my cetaphil cleanser, so when I was looking for a makeup removing cloth I immediately turned to these. But I was very disappointed. They were very dry out of the package (so much so that I scoured the directions to see if I needed to wet it to activate it or something). It did take most of my makep off after a lot of scrubbing, but that of course left my skin irritated. And I had to wash my face with cleanser afterwards to get the rest off. I&#x27;m sad that I bought a 2-pack and will now need to find something else.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw these wipes in the store because i use only use cetaphil cleaning and lotion products on my face.  I used the wipes 2 nights in a row and here I am 5 days later with the driest eyes and lids I have ever had!  I am sorry I tried them.  I have never had this experience with a makeup remover and I am shocked that it happened with cetaphil!</li>
