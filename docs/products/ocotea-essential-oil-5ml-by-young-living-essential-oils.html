    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the product is just as good.</li>
            <li>As I learn more about all the ways in which Ocotea can help, I know I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>fast delivery great product</li>
            <li>Seemed to help with blood sugar but can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff!!  </li>
            <li>How can I be comfortable using this, when I have no idea</li>
            <li>The seller packaged it securely and the product was sent in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>The glucose readings are more consistent.  </li>
            <li>After just six days of taking a drop of Ocotea a day in four drops of Olive Oil all of my sweet cravings are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did come quickly, sealed and full, though.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it for awhile until you see the effects, so buy two the first time.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s a bit hot, but</li>
            <li>Love essential oils.</li>
            <li>The price is very high for the amount of product.</li>
            <li>I have really appreciated getting this oil.  </li>
            <li>I really did not know why, until I started using it.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it brings down the numbers depending, however on what I ate the day before.</li>
            <li>I did purchase this mainly to see if it would aid my insulin requirements (Type 1), as I have heard that it could help pancreatic function.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet, similar to Cinnamon, and the taste is similar, but a little more bitter.</li>
            <li>I only took it orally for about a week, because my blood sugars actually trended higher (don&#x27;t know if the Ocotea was at all/partially/wholey to blame).</li>
            <li>I sent them pictures of the broken top.  </li>

            <li> how long it&#x27;s been open, who opened it, or if the contents are even what is on the label?</li>
            <li> I have not used it for a long enough time to fully evaluate.  </li>
            <li> I find that I need it only about once a week, so at the rate of one drop per week, this little bottle will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived with the seal on the bottle broken.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Tasted awful!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> fast delivery great product</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me.  Was told it would help with my diabetes and lower my blood sugar and it didn&#x27;t.  Tasted awful!!!!</li>
            <li> I take a sniff of this prior to testing my blood sugar. Most of the time it brings down the numbers depending, however on what I ate the day before. Yet the product has a balancing affect overall in my experience. I am not diabetic but do monitor the blood glucose levels daily as at one time in my life i was pre diabetic and I am no longer thus.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This stuff has balanced my blood sugar and lowered my blood pressure. I put it under my tongue and my heart stops pounding. It&#x27;s like cinnamon but not spicy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  No difference at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help me, but may on others.</li>
            <li> I did purchase this mainly to see if it would aid my insulin requirements (Type 1), as I have heard that it could help pancreatic function.  I only took it orally for about a week, because my blood sugars actually trended higher (don&#x27;t know if the Ocotea was at all/partially/wholey to blame). It did come quickly, sealed and full, though.  The smell is sweet, similar to Cinnamon, and the taste is similar, but a little more bitter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for several reasons. It helps with fibro pain, helps even out blood sugar levels, and helps to curb my appetite!</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff!!  Will be ordering again in the immediate future.</li>
            <li> This oil has already been opened! How can I be comfortable using this, when I have no idea how long it&#x27;s been open, who opened it, or if the contents are even what is on the label? I would never use any medicine or food items that have been opened and/or tampered with.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for a long enough time to fully evaluate.  It does seem to lower blood sugar.</li>
            <li> The price is very high for the amount of product. You have to use it for awhile until you see the effects, so buy two the first time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with the seal on the bottle broken. I sent them pictures of the broken top.  North American sent me a replacement bottle and a prepaid envelope to return the damaged product for investigation of the problem. Excellent customer service.Hopefully the product is just as good.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a digestive supplement.  It works, it&#x27;s a bit hot, but hey.</li>
            <li> Love essential oils. Definitely helped curve cravings. Seemed to help with blood sugar but can&#x27;t say for sure. Seems to help with yeast infection.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference in my glucose problems when using ocotea.  The glucose readings are more consistent.  As I learn more about all the ways in which Ocotea can help, I know I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> After just six days of taking a drop of Ocotea a day in four drops of Olive Oil all of my sweet cravings are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a BIG issue with sweets, but now I have zero desire for them.</li>
            <li> I have really appreciated getting this oil.  Ocotea has been helpful with regulating my blood sugar!  I recommend it to others. The seller packaged it securely and the product was sent in a timely fashion.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Didnt see a difference after several uses</li>
            <li> I had heard of this oil but not realized that it was something that would benefit me until my local YL Distributor had me use her Zyto machine. The Compass Report it produced called for Ocotea for me. I really did not know why, until I started using it. It is balancing hormones. I find that I need it only about once a week, so at the rate of one drop per week, this little bottle will last a very long time.  YL has oils of unparalleled purity and quality. I have tried all the others. None come close to YL&#x27;s oils.</li>
