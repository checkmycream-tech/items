    <ol>
            <li>Great source of energy</li>
            <li>I was happy.</li>
            <li>doesnt work good as well.</li>
            <li>It doesnt work that good cause</li>
            <li>So, I bought this product because I read that cleansing your blood/kidneys/liver is a good way to battle allergies.  </li>
            <li>but you need to use it for the full 21 days to get the best benefit from it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Sweet.  </li>
            <li>The comments about it being gassy are also true so take it at night rather than in the morning before work.    </li>
            <li>As other people have commented, it does not taste great</li>
            <li>It purifies blood, which inturn gives a super glowing face if used for atleast 2 months.</li>
            <li>it works very well!!</li>
            <li>I used it many years back and thought it was worth buying - then.</li>
            <li>Good for my little one</li>
            <li>If you have a very strong stomach, this may work for you (I really don&#x27;t know, as two doses isn&#x27;t enough to feel a difference).  </li>
            <li>They did not seem to have the bigger size I ordered but that ok since I was not charged anymore.</li>
            <li>I almost gagged upon taking the first tablespoon.  </li>
            <li>I was able to last two doses.  </li>
            <li>found locally for a more reasonable price</li>
            <li>This cleared my skin very well, at first I was a skeptic</li>
            <li>Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>Safi is a blood purifier that really works</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem.    </li>
            <li>Tighter controls were introduced in the UK to make licensees responsible for ensuring quality of imported medicines and testing factory supplies of their ingredients before preparing the medicines.</li>
            <li>My items were sent earlier than expected and the best part was the packaging - each of the bottles were wrapped with plastic (incase of leakage) which was the issue when I had bought them from some other vendor.</li>
            <li>improvements were very visible the day after first dose, which certainly surprised me.    </li>
            <li>the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom Department of Health reported that samples of Safi contained high levels of arsenic.[1]</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not exactly horrible and reminds me of a Hungarian herbal alcoholic drink called Unicum.</li>
            <li>So right now i am planning to stop taking Safi to see if my breakouts is due to this product.</li>
            <li>To see how well this product work for me , it not only clear up the boils, but old scraps and my face is much clear now than before.  </li>
            <li>Later I just decided to ask a storeowner and they had the same exact thing for only $4!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is wayyy too expensive online!! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find it in my local Desi stores so I bought it here. Later I just decided to ask a storeowner and they had the same exact thing for only $4!! Should have checked the stores before buying it here!</li>
            <li> My items were sent earlier than expected and the best part was the packaging - each of the bottles were wrapped with plastic (incase of leakage) which was the issue when I had bought them from some other vendor. They did not seem to have the bigger size I ordered but that ok since I was not charged anymore. Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> Safi is a Unani medicine which claims to be a blood-purifier. It is produced by Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) in Ghaziabad India, as well as in Pakistan and in Bangladesh. According to the package, it &amp;#34;corrects the digestive system, relieves constipation, prevents and cures boils, pimples, and skin eruptions.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August 2005 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom Department of Health reported that samples of Safi contained high levels of arsenic.[1] The next month Health Canada issued a warning that Safi was &amp;#34;found to contain arsenic levels in excess of 40 times the maximum allowable concentration for drugs&amp;#34;[2] and people who had used the product were told to contact their physician.[3] The products had never been authorized for sale in Canada, but authorities suspect they may have been sold there, and they had been for sale in USA.[3] Products had been not allowed to enter Canada and Australia</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 7 years now. Lost 9Kgs/ 20lbs within 6months and still maintaining the weight. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product. I used it many years back and thought it was worth buying - then. When I looked at this newer version, I noticed that the ingredients had changed, which explains why I might not have gotten the results that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Safi is a blood purifier that really works but you need to use it for the full 21 days to get the best benefit from it.</li>
            <li> Good for my little one</li>
            <li> Tastes bad, but helps in clearing the skin. It purifies blood, which inturn gives a super glowing face if used for atleast 2 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty and it tastes awful.  I couldnt take the taste anymore and had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Great source of energy</li>
            <li> doesnt work good as well. Taste horrible!!! It doesnt work that good cause the pimples come back I was expecting a little better</li>
            <li> I having problems with boils.  When I bought this product man! I was happy. To see how well this product work for me , it not only clear up the boils, but old scraps and my face is much clear now than before.  For anyone out needed help. Use this product.  I will admit it does taste bitter,  but you will get over it.  Thank you for all your help.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product because I read that cleansing your blood/kidneys/liver is a good way to battle allergies.  Being that I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything, I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try.  The problem with this stuff is that it&#x27;s disgusting.  It looks like blood.  It tastes like a mix of worscheshire sauce, garlic and something dead.  I almost gagged upon taking the first tablespoon.  And you&#x27;re supposed to take it daily.  I was able to last two doses.  I simply can&#x27;t handle the smell, much less the taste.  If you have a very strong stomach, this may work for you (I really don&#x27;t know, as two doses isn&#x27;t enough to feel a difference).  Gag.</li>
            <li> not as expected. no noticeable change in skin.  Rather gassy side effect.&lt;br /&gt;Very Sweet.  Tolerable.  yet undesireable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It helps my tooth pain and I do notice my face is glowing however i have breakouts on my face which is non stop. So right now i am planning to stop taking Safi to see if my breakouts is due to this product.</li>
            <li> This cleared my skin very well, at first I was a skeptic but it definitely works</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with curing an unknown skin condition (caused by either plant or insect) and improvements were very visible the day after first dose, which certainly surprised me.    As other people have commented, it does not taste great but it&#x27;s not exactly horrible and reminds me of a Hungarian herbal alcoholic drink called Unicum. Let&#x27;s just say that I drank it neat and it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem.    The comments about it being gassy are also true so take it at night rather than in the morning before work.    Another thing is that although there is still attached to Safi a story that it contains arsenic or heavy metals, these stories date from almost a decade ago when, in the UK, MHRA authorities seized a number of bottles presenced with arsenic following reports from Canada.     Follow-up seizures found no further arsenic presence elsewhere so this instance was likely a contamination of a batch.   Such contaminations circa 2005 were not exclusive to bottles of Safi but were found in other imported medicines.  Tighter controls were introduced in the UK to make licensees responsible for ensuring quality of imported medicines and testing factory supplies of their ingredients before preparing the medicines. Ireland as well as other countries followed and although medicines such as Safi may have disappeared from shelves during that period they are now back quite legitimately.    So there is no truth to the rumour that Safi as a product contains arsenic or heavy metals as part of its ingredients. It&#x27;s actually composed of herbal and homeopathic ingredients.  I&#x27;ve personally just researched this to my satisfaction and can find no further report of contaminations after 2005.</li>
            <li> found locally for a more reasonable price</li>
            <li> They say taste is only till your tounge! Bear it coz it works very well!!</li>
