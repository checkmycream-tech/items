            <li>Great cream for oily skin!</li>
            <li>Best for acne prone skin and oily/combination skin types.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me, and your skin gets quite oily throughout the day, this one is the best for applying after you wash your face in the morning</li>
            <li>but it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame I had to go to another country to get the best in oil control</li>
            <li>awesome product!!!  </li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It works great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally love, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>it was just as good as Laniege&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin so this can work good during summer</li>
            <li>stuff is a really good moisturizer for the morning</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>First thing, THIS THING SMELLS WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>Light weight non greasy face gel...smells good and feels good once on.</li>
            <li>I just liked the smell of Laniege more.</li>
            <li>Love this product and received it before specter.</li>
            <li>smells lovely-light and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and this moisturizer really is my favorite at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this underneath, my skin looks neither shiny nor matte, more of a satin finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m worried that I will not be able to use this when my skin is drier in the winter.</li>
            <li>well, most quality balms do not have water in the formulation anyway.</li>
            <li>are more educated now</li>
            <li>But my skin is a bit oilier than most.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin very clean without over drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product would be perfect for people with dry to combination skin, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>It feels like a loose gel and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I made the switch as it significantly reduced the shine on my face, and I can confidently go outside without worrrying about my face becoming a reflector.</li>
            <li>I apply this after my more moisturizing products, and bought this as kind of a &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; for my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and actually works!</li>
            <li>Chia Seed Mist Toner throughout the day to keep skin moist and fresh looking</li>
            <li>It does moisturize pretty well, but kind of has a sticky residue - similar to a makeup primer.</li>
            <li>and I love the texture, especially for the spring/summer months.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I have OFF THE CHARTS oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use to much or it feels kind of tacky/sticky on your face.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, it felt light on my skin yet hydrating enough for my combination-oily skin type, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with a smooth and matte finish, which is exactly what I was looking for, so I can&#x27;t be happier about that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for teens, but for those of us past that stage that need a little more moisture throughout the day, this product doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>This gel moisturizer has worked really well for my super sensitive dry/dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>if you use too much it&#x27;ll feel sticky and my face felt sticky the whole day..</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really sink in all the way.  </li>
            <li>However, having a very oily complexion with the biggest pores in the world, I decided to give this a try since it has the Sebum Control feature.</li>
            <li>That being said, I don&#x27;t think this product controls sebum as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a bit sticky, it absorbs into the skin within a few minutes and it leaves a nice complexion, whilst also evening out</li>
            <li>I previously used The Face Shop Chia Seed Water Moisture Holding Seed Cream (the light green coloured one) and loved it.</li>
            <li>but i will not put something on my face that doesnt have a detailed ingredient list and its not natural</li>
            <li>I guess it works ok, makes my face feel a bit tight</li>
            <li>And if you haven&#x27;t used &amp;#34;The Face Shop&amp;#34; products before, I highly recommend checking out what they have.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff as a morning moisturizer after I apply all of my other skin goodies, and this really does a fantastic job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing first, I have super oily skin; if I wash my face and lightly moisturize, I would still need at least 2 oil blot sheets to fix my face, two hours later.</li>
            <li>far not causing any breakouts (1 week use), really like the texture and the scent, I&#x27;m just curious why it&#x27;s so cheap on amazone while the store sells this for $38 bucks.....</li>
            <li>I pretty much blot about once a day a now and only on my nose.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that this product attracted me is that it&#x27;s a sebum control moisturizer, so the second thing I will think is that this is not gonna be a greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I do make sure to use the smallest amount as the other reviews have suggested, and it hasn&#x27;t left a sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have it on your face when you apply it, because it is so watery, but still thick enough to be a cream, and it also feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s sensitive</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had problems with Korean skin products so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of ingredients in skincare products.</li>
            <li>but if you put too much of it on you&#x27;re left with sticky skin!</li>
            <li>it evaporates fastly, and very moisture, but smell is similar with facial peel off pack.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>At first it left my face red, but I think my skin has gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>My sensitive didn&#x27;t react adversely to it, so I can broadly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This is easily remedied by using only a tiny, tiny amount (which preserves the product too, go figure), and then rubbing it in everywhere and patting it down</li>
            <li>I periodically do searches on the internet to see what&#x27;s new in oil control because the truth is that oil control products have come a long way.</li>
            <li>smell is very subtle and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face.</li>

            <li> Just a bit of the product goes a long way for the entire facial area.</li>
            <li> This product has gone a LONG way to helping me achieve that goal.  </li>
            <li> , I can see it not moisturizing enough during other seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my face tends to get dry after I do that).</li>
            <li> My skin is not so oily or not so dry.  </li>
            <li> but as long as they ship it here, I&#x27;ll be buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune trying to control oil.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not contain silicones, harsh fragrance, essential oils, vitamin E, or cetearyl or stearyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> It does help keeping oil production down, but careful on the amount, a little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s minimally moisturizing, but it does help keep my face less oily and less shiny.</li>
            <li> I may be slightly allergic to it, so I may not be using it anymore</li>
            <li> Still a bit too heavy for the warmer months, but it works well for winter and spring!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I usually use a tinted Gel Cream foundation as a sunscreen and moisturizer after this, and it leaves my skin shiny and has never really absorbed.</li>
            <li> my pale skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the effect until I will finish using it..</li>
            <li> stuff is for sebum control, and I&#x27;ve noticed it does keep my usual oily complexion at bay.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t solve acne  problems, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with using it as a moisturizer for dry skin on your face in the winter time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sick of my face being an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> and i know that Chia Seed Oil is and &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that is extracted from the chia seed in a cold pressed process and i know that chia seed oil is very expensive so that being said, there must not be but trace amounts of chia seed oil in this.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great cream for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product and received it before specter.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, without being overly heavy or greasy. Still a bit too heavy for the warmer months, but it works well for winter and spring!&lt;br /&gt;Also smells lovely-light and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is great for teens, but for those of us past that stage that need a little more moisture throughout the day, this product doesn&#x27;t cut it. My sensitive didn&#x27;t react adversely to it, so I can broadly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Best for acne prone skin and oily/combination skin types. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have it on your face when you apply it, because it is so watery, but still thick enough to be a cream, and it also feels very refreshing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very subtle and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face. As for the sebum control, it does help, mind you it doesn&#x27;t solve acne  problems, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with using it as a moisturizer for dry skin on your face in the winter time. It is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and your skin gets quite oily throughout the day, this one is the best for applying after you wash your face in the morning (my face tends to get dry after I do that). It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Get this product! And if you haven&#x27;t used &amp;#34;The Face Shop&amp;#34; products before, I highly recommend checking out what they have.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product I have ever purchased. Keeps the skin very clean without over drying. Just a bit of the product goes a long way for the entire facial area. Results are noticeable. Love it.</li>
            <li> I guess it works ok, makes my face feel a bit tight but I guess it is decreasing the oils produced but I still need to use blotting paper</li>
            <li> I like this product. But it&#x27;s too bad I used it after I used Laniege&#x27;s Snow Crystal Water Sleeping Pack. I didn&#x27;t feel that this one controlled my sebum but as a sleeping mask it was just as good as Laniege&#x27;s. I just liked the smell of Laniege more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started taking care of my skin and pores and this is a must have for me. Sebum control is oil control basically and I sometimes get oily skin during the day. This product feels so good on my skin. It feels like a loose gel and smells very nice. I use this at night and use the moisture holding one in the morning. My skin&#x27;s sensitive but I&#x27;ve never had problems with Korean skin products so far and this moisturizer really is my favorite at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Care Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foam Wash&lt;br /&gt;2. Toner&lt;br /&gt;3. Emulsion&lt;br /&gt;4. Essence&lt;br /&gt;5. Moisturizer (Chia Seed Sebum Control)&lt;br /&gt;6. BB Cream&lt;br /&gt;7. Chia Seed Mist Toner throughout the day to keep skin moist and fresh looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week face masks are also used for extra moisture and essence to the skin.</li>
            <li> Light weight non greasy face gel...smells good and feels good once on. Be careful not to use to much or it feels kind of tacky/sticky on your face. Works well under make up to keep oil under control.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than I expected.  I may be slightly allergic to it, so I may not be using it anymore but it smells wonderful and I love the texture, especially for the spring/summer months.</li>
            <li> It does help keeping oil production down, but careful on the amount, a little goes a long way, so if you use too much it&#x27;ll feel sticky and my face felt sticky the whole day.. it doesn&#x27;t really sink in all the way.  I have combo skin so this can work good during summer, I can see it not moisturizing enough during other seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far not causing any breakouts (1 week use), really like the texture and the scent, I&#x27;m just curious why it&#x27;s so cheap on amazone while the store sells this for $38 bucks.....</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and actually works! Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It cools the face after washing.  Feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I previously used The Face Shop Chia Seed Water Moisture Holding Seed Cream (the light green coloured one) and loved it. However, having a very oily complexion with the biggest pores in the world, I decided to give this a try since it has the Sebum Control feature. I&#x27;m glad that I made the switch as it significantly reduced the shine on my face, and I can confidently go outside without worrrying about my face becoming a reflector.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the effect until I will finish using it..</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have OFF THE CHARTS oily skin.  And anything I can find that says &amp;#34;sebum control&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; I buy it.  I have spent a fortune trying to control oil.  I&#x27;m 45 years old and I&#x27;m sick of my face being an oil slick.  I periodically do searches on the internet to see what&#x27;s new in oil control because the truth is that oil control products have come a long way. But my ultimate goal is to not have to blot with something every couple of hours.  This product has gone a LONG way to helping me achieve that goal.  I pretty much blot about once a day a now and only on my nose.  It&#x27;s a shame I had to go to another country to get the best in oil control lol but as long as they ship it here, I&#x27;ll be buying it!!!</li>
            <li> awesome product!!!  It works great on my skin.  My skin is not so oily or not so dry.  If you have moderate skin, use it.  You will like it.</li>
            <li> The first thing that this product attracted me is that it&#x27;s a sebum control moisturizer, so the second thing I will think is that this is not gonna be a greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After application I found this product way to sticky for my combination/oily skin, guess what? I broke out the second day of usage.&lt;br /&gt;this product would be perfect for people with dry to combination skin, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This gel moisturizer has worked really well for my super sensitive dry/dehydrated skin. I would actually rate it closer to a 4.5, but for my skin, it rounds up to a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of ingredients in skincare products. This moisturizer does not contain silicones, harsh fragrance, essential oils, vitamin E, or cetearyl or stearyl alcohol. I apply this after my more moisturizing products, and bought this as kind of a &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; for my other moisturizers. I think that it&#x27;s minimally moisturizing, but it does help keep my face less oily and less shiny. I apply this night and day, and I haven&#x27;t had to apply powder throughout the day since I started using it. I&#x27;ve even left my apartment without powder because I forgot. I usually use a tinted Gel Cream foundation as a sunscreen and moisturizer after this, and it leaves my skin shiny and has never really absorbed. With this underneath, my skin looks neither shiny nor matte, more of a satin finish. I do make sure to use the smallest amount as the other reviews have suggested, and it hasn&#x27;t left a sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this is the alcohol. At first it left my face red, but I think my skin has gotten used to it. I&#x27;m worried that I will not be able to use this when my skin is drier in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff as a morning moisturizer after I apply all of my other skin goodies, and this really does a fantastic job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is for sebum control, and I&#x27;ve noticed it does keep my usual oily complexion at bay. I&#x27;m left with a smooth and matte finish, which is exactly what I was looking for, so I can&#x27;t be happier about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not TOO fond of is how sticky this stuff is. It&#x27;s a gel-like consistency but if you put too much of it on you&#x27;re left with sticky skin! This is easily remedied by using only a tiny, tiny amount (which preserves the product too, go figure), and then rubbing it in everywhere and patting it down gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a really good moisturizer for the morning and I&#x27;ll totally continue using this in my regimen! Although it&#x27;s a bit sticky, it absorbs into the skin within a few minutes and it leaves a nice complexion, whilst also evening out my pale skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally love, awesome stuff! I&#x27;d have given it 4.5 stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sticky. it evaporates fastly, and very moisture, but smell is similar with facial peel off pack.&lt;br /&gt;also i think it is a winter product not for summer.</li>
            <li> i can not find an ingredient list for this product anywhere. i even went to their website. they say 100% chia seed INSTEAD of water... well, most quality balms do not have water in the formulation anyway. So, is this misleading??? i think so. This product is from Asia and they may have different regulations but that being said, i want &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; products because of the ingredient safety and the label regulations.&lt;br /&gt;i did buy this product but i will not put something on my face that doesnt have a detailed ingredient list and its not natural, you can tell be looking at it and smelling it. I also don&#x27;t believe in tricky wording.&lt;br /&gt;We are more educated now and i know that Chia Seed Oil is and &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that is extracted from the chia seed in a cold pressed process and i know that chia seed oil is very expensive so that being said, there must not be but trace amounts of chia seed oil in this. They also claim &amp;#34;no oil&#x27;, well chia seed oil is an oil.</li>
            <li> First thing, THIS THING SMELLS WONDERFUL. First thing first, I have super oily skin; if I wash my face and lightly moisturize, I would still need at least 2 oil blot sheets to fix my face, two hours later. Yes, it&#x27;s that bad. That being said, I don&#x27;t think this product controls sebum as much as I had hoped. But my skin is a bit oilier than most. It does moisturize pretty well, but kind of has a sticky residue - similar to a makeup primer. Overall, good product but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again since it didn&#x27;t work too well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Brought as a present for my cousin and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it felt light on my skin yet hydrating enough for my combination-oily skin type, definitely will buy again.</li>
