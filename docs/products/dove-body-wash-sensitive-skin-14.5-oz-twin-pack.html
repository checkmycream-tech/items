            <li>TREMENDOUSLY OVERPRICED</li>
            <li>The fact is, there is a distinct perfume aroma, whether or not you added a chemical for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My bathtub becomes slippery from Dove,  My skin feels clean and soft, but it&#x27;s not exceptional..</li>
            <li>the off-chance some social media rep from the manufacturer is out there...</li>
            <li>I also have very dry skin because of the dry climate we live in, the Dove Sensitive  Skin Body Wash helps to alleviate that too.  </li>

            <li> This product has a very strong sour odor.  If you are expecting the nice dove odor of old, this isn&#x27;t it.  This alone shuts down my lungs and I can&#x27;t imagine using it on my skin.  If you like the strongest of  toiletry odors and aren&#x27;t sensitive to them, maybe you would like it.  I do not.</li>
            <li> The soap is liked by me and my grand-daughter.</li>
            <li> It does not pour out of container.  It comes out  in a glob .  My bathtub becomes slippery from Dove,  My skin feels clean and soft, but it&#x27;s not exceptional..</li>
            <li> Dove. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> smelled terrible  &amp; felt like watered down with no soap to lather.  Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always buy this body wash, and was happy to see a great deal like this on here! Packaged well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly without a lot of over packing.  No complaints, everything as expected.</li>
            <li> This product has changed.  It now includes &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient.  If you have sensitive skin like me, you can expect a breakout promptly.  You can call to inform/complain to the company and expect them to send you some coupons for more of the product that caused the problem in the first place</li>
            <li> After I purchased this product, marketed as &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; (same as their bar soap, which is truly unscented), I was disappointed to find out upon first (and last) use that this product is heavily scented.  If the reason you buy unscented products is due to allergies, sensitivities, sinus issues, etc., be FOREWARNED that Dove/Unilever has dropped the ball on this product.  I have contacted them and they acknowledged the issue.  Hopefully it will result in a future unscented product that is correctly labeled and marketed.  This product went right in the trash can.</li>
            <li> My kids have dry skin and eczema. This body wash is very gentle; it doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness or rashes.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that my son does not break out from. He even breaks out from baby wash!</li>
            <li> TREMENDOUSLY OVERPRICED</li>
            <li> The bottle says it&#x27;s unscented. This literally could not be further from the truth. If you put a cheap cologne next to it and test them side by side, you will find the Dove has a &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the off-chance some social media rep from the manufacturer is out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to hear a semantic argument about &amp;#34;no fragrances added&amp;#34; or some such nonsense. I think people know &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;no smell&amp;#34;. The fact is, there is a distinct perfume aroma, whether or not you added a chemical for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone within 15 feet of this product would know unequivocally that this is a scented product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be ashamed of yourselves.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; great scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful.  Creamy and thick it leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, feels more like lotion then soap but rinses well.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle body wash for sensitive skin.  I also have very dry skin because of the dry climate we live in, the Dove Sensitive  Skin Body Wash helps to alleviate that too.  I highly recommend Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;prescribed&amp;#34; by my dermatologist.  very easy on skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap and there is even a light scent that I don&#x27;t get from the bar soap.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my daughter she&#x27;s loves it.</li>
            <li> only soap I  use and love it</li>
