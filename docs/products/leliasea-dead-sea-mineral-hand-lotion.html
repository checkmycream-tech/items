            <li> My hands are constantly dry. It’s either the cold air or the heat, plus a lot of activities I do take a lot out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream, not a lotion, and creams are so much better than lotions as they are thicker, rub in easier and do a better job at protecting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this has a pleasant, fresh scent that smells and feels clean without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream absorbs quickly and does not leave your hands greasy. You can put it on, and then continue with your paperwork or typing, and even use a touch screen without leaving a film behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and I must say I am super impressed with this, and it is my go to hand cream now.</li>

            <li> I love this thick, creamy hand cream. It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly. This has a lovely fresh scent.  I use it on my hands, elbows, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;The minerals and vitamin E seem to keep my hands and elbows hydrated and smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I began noticing a difference within a couple of weeks of usage.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to facilitate a review. All opinions are mine and based on my own use and experience with the item.</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with items made from the Dead Sea and the LeliaSea Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream is another great product that I love the scent of as well as how it makes my skin feel. So soft and luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I use it I feel like my hands have been to a spa. The tube is just the right size to have in your handbag, on your night stand, or even by the sink for after you have done the dishes. I received this as part of a promotion in order to facilitate a unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> My sister in law has very dry cracked hands in the winter and summer. When I see a hand cream I immediately think of her. She works with babies so she washes her hands so many times a day that it leaves her hands in bad condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let her try LeliaSea Hand cream and at first she did not see a difference. After almost 3 weeks of using the cream daily she started to see an improvement with her cracked fingers. They started to heal and she had less dry skin and her hands started not to crack. It has helped her tremendously. She said her skin feels much better especially on her fingers. I received LeliaSea Hand cream complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream! Even when my hands are extra dry, I get immediate results after using this wonderful cream. It feels so light &amp; silky on my skin &amp; I love the subtle floral fragrance. It does not leave any greasy or sticky feeling, just soft smooth skin. The 1.7 ounce tube is perfect for me to drop into my purse when I’m away from home so that I can enjoy this hand cream all day no matter where I am. And I have gotten so many positive comments from friends who I have let try this cream for themselves. This is such a high quality product &amp; I will definitely continue to use this because my skin loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed above are 100% my own based on my personal use of the product.</li>
            <li> I deal with biohazardous materials at work. I need to wash my hands quite often for safety reasons. This leaves my hands quite dry and rough. I apply the Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream and my skin feels silky soft and smooth. However, it does wash off and one needs to re-apply. The scent is quite subtle and not overpowering. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It says hand cream, but what I received was body lotion.  It smells nice and works well as a body lotion, but I really wanted it for my hands and it is just too light for that.  UPDATE:  I was contacted by the LeliaSea since my review above stated I ordered hand cream and received body lotion (I had 3 stars, so am changing to 5 starts now).  They offered to make it better, but I told them it was my fault since I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the label and started using the product.  When I realized it was body lotion, I simply placed it in the bathroom and started using it after I shower.  I love the fragrance and the lotion moisturizes well.  I highly recommend LeliaSea products since their company really cares about your satisfaction!</li>
            <li> best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love the light scent and the feel of the hand cream, it&#x27;s creamy.  I had surgery on one of my hands; now that I can get that hand wet and lotion it, this lotion goes on very well.  Not greasy, a big plus for me and it&#x27;s not sticky, soaks in quickly leaving my hands feeling soft.  I highly recommend this product.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really smooth lotion that goes on very well and absorbs well - however I think it will take another tube before my &#x27;elderly&#x27; dry skin does not soak it in like a sponge! This is surely what I need but a bit expensive for long term use</li>
            <li> This hand cream is outstanding on dry hands.  I can always tell when winter is coming by the dryness of my skin, so I tried this hand cream and I&#x27;m very impressed how well it soothes and softens my hands.  It smells good, it feels good and the price is good.</li>
            <li> This cream has a lovely feel - not greasy at all - and a marvelous light scent. It may seem a little pricey, but a very little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I  also love that it is paraben-free. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  Only drawback is it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this cream. Leaves unpleasant waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> Short result once i wash may hand, all the softness goes away</li>
            <li> I gave this product to a friend  who just delivered to twin girls and  who has to wash her hands frequently due to having to change diapers for  her twins  She loves this product and am planning o order some more for her and for myself, as well.</li>
