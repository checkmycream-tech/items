            <li>This Ready, Set</li>

            <li>Never have I found such a smooth, rich, and creamy foundation that actually stays on for longer then 5 hours!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The coverage is light to medium, and covers up minor flaws.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my face smooth and itast long after hours.</li>
            <li>and still leaves a natural look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always hard for me to find the perfect color (I actually have 305) in drugstore foundations, so I usually stick to bb creams and tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just too old, but it so didn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m used to high-end make-up, so this was watery and disappointing. Maybe my skin is just too old, but it so didn&#x27;t work. My skin is also dry and this was not a good product for dry skin. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. It is amazing!!! It is not make my face feel like it is matted down with tons of product. Its light and it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing foundation at all.</li>

            <li> So I actually use this in a shade down, in 210. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is light to medium, and covers up minor flaws.&lt;br /&gt;It settles to a matte/powdery finish on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I set it with the Ready Set Gorgeous Pressed Powder for a completely matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks amazing.</li>

            <li> This foundation it&#x27;s pretty cool ...specially for a girl ...it works well enough and protects your face and gives you a good look üòÅ</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with Covergirl Ready, Set Gorgeous foundation! I have always struggled finding a liquid foundation that perfectly matches my skin tone but doesn&#x27;t make my skin look like the bottle threw up on it. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it comes in a bigger bottle &amp; if doesn&#x27;t... It should :)</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this foundation. I have always been a fan of covergirl products and this one didn&#x27;t change my mind. It makes my face look even. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have foundation on and I love that!! Very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Stays on without any oily residue. Blends in easily and lasts all day. This Ready, Set, Gorgeous is my top choice for foundation.</li>
            <li> This foundation is okay, but doesn&#x27;t completely agree with my face. It provides nice coverage but is slightly shiny upon application and within a few hours of wearing it, my face becomes oily.</li>
            <li> smooth, not oily, and affordable</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation! It&#x27;s always hard for me to find the perfect color (I actually have 305) in drugstore foundations, so I usually stick to bb creams and tinted moisturizers. They&#x27;re lighter and don&#x27;t feel too heavy. I have combination skin, but this was amazing, it feels light, but it still covers in acne marks and doesn&#x27;t settle into my skin. and still leaves a natural look! I LOVE IT! I do use powder over it, but if you don&#x27;t want to! It lasts all day, and is super quick for school, totally recommend it! I got this to try out as a test product, but I fell in love! My mom even got it in her shade to wear!</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation for everyday wear. It blends out easily and provides medium coverage. No oxidizing and does not look cakey.</li>
            <li> Can have as much or as little coverage as you need, its very buildable. Keeps my skin from looking oily and has a nice matte finish. I set it with a powder and it stays all day!</li>
            <li> I love this! I am very picky when it comes to foundation because I have such combination skin but I like to only have one kind of foundatin that works when my skin constantly changes.  This did just the trick and something I love about it is that it hides like all my miss colored skin and redness but you can still see my freckles.  I also liked it a lot because i didn&#x27;t feel like I had to use a powder over the top of it.  The colors blend really nicely with my skin color I was very satisfied.  By the way I got this as a sample to try and I have already went back to get more.  I use it all the time for cheerleading now.</li>
            <li> OMG. Never have I found such a smooth, rich, and creamy foundation that actually stays on for longer then 5 hours! It doesnt smear and it doesnt run if I am working out or sweating from the summer heat! :) I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This foundation is amazing. I live it better than their outlast foundation. Buy it from ulta it is on sale</li>
            <li> Absolutely great foundation! Full, even coverage for all day. The only thing is, by the end of my typically over 12 hour days, my face looks a little oily, but that could very well be just my skin. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my friends ,and will continue to use this!</li>
