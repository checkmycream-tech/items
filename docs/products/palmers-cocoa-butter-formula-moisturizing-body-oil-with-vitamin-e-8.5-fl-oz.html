            <li>My wife loved this oil.</li>
            <li>I’m a fan of a lot of Palmers’ products and was looking for a good body oil</li>
            <li>You can trust the Palmer&#x27;s name, and we all know that cocoa butter is good for the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good oil to use as there is no smell or greasiness to it.  </li>
            <li>fairly greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with the Palmers Stretch Mark Lotion just for good measure.  </li>
            <li>Smells Good</li>
            <li>This stuff is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good end of shower moisturizer which is how I use it.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it on my legs after shaving as it provides an excellent method of moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is very lightly scented and does a great job at softening skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think it makes skin feel lovely!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years now and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>I love Palmers!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I brought this to avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy and I must say this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs so nicely into the skin, does not feel greasy, and leaves an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is just an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my body nice and oily, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice</li>
            <li>Nice chocolate smell too.</li>
            <li>I thought I was reviewing the oil that has added antioxidants, which i like better, but this is good too.</li>
            <li>its nice moisturizing and nice smell ...</li>
            <li>My burn area is healing nicely and I am not bothered with the dryness associated with the healing process plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about grease and oil all over my clothes or bed.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but does not linger.</li>
            <li>I use it as lotion and it comes in handy in the winter months.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of my childhood and is cocoa buttery and kind of beachy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent body oil, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and has a pleasant clean scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best one I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on smoothly and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>Great product, speedy delivery, priced right and no hassle shopping.....</li>
            <li>It works great to soothe and heal hot spots on your dog, but be warned...</li>
            <li>On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won’t be buying again.</li>
            <li>but I thought this would be a great thing to just put in a spray bottle and use for quick and easy moisture application.  </li>
            <li>it is a great moisturing oil, not greasy and dries quicky, I get a great deal of sun and it works well to heal and repair dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like this product however it would be better if it came in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and if you put it on before bedtime it really makes your skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite after-shower oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil I&#x27;ve mostly been using it to lighten up my stretch marks because my palmers stretch mark cream wasn&#x27;t doing the job</li>
            <li>I felt like I needed more.</li>
            <li>so I am always pleased with this</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>My favorite oil ever.</li>
            <li>My skin feel moist, healthy and shiny when I use this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>this oil leaves my skin nice n smooth.</li>
            <li>much better than any baby oil</li>
            <li>my mum love it</li>
            <li>I like the value of getting more for my money.  </li>
            <li>This product is actually quite excellent.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>It makes my skin better; therefore, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I love all Palmer&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this at the end of a shower then rinse it off.</li>
            <li>both love it.</li>
            <li>but my skin reacts better to this</li>
            <li>The smell of this is what I really love.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>It is the best investment in my bodily regime I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li>this item is one that we buy all the time, its not on auto order, but it should be, clean, fresh, wonderful scent, smooth, light and all around great body oil, used by my grandmother on all us kids since the summers of the 60s and now many moons later, Palmers is one that I would put on my grandkids if I had them, get some, you will love it!</li>
            <li>Leaves a very nice almost chocolatey scent and my skin feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the light fragrance</li>
            <li>If used after the bath with wet skin, gives excellent esults.</li>
            <li>: Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals, low price, smells so good, &amp; it works!</li>
            <li>Even though it is body oil, it is easy for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately my husband does not appreciate me smelling so strongly like cocoa</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>use this right after the shower and follow up with lotion or Palmer&#x27;s CCB cream for a beautiful soft skin</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling and looking so much better after using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula moisturizing body oil; it really does softens and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m a little impressed.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, have never tried coco butter anything, so it was a real treat that my sensitive pregnant stomach loved the smell, yay for that!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s products and I use their cocoa butter lotion all the time</li>
            <li>This product smells fantastic but does not soften as well as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated out of the shower and my husband loves the smell-</li>
            <li>Light fragrance and non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin glow...and smells fantastic...</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling silky smooth and not as oily as one would think.</li>
            <li>silky smooth.</li>
            <li>lotion on top, because I have super dry skin (kinda like the LOC method naturals use for their hair, except with no leave in lol).</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT moisturizing oil...absorbs smoothly and keeps skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She feels it is better than lotion since it does not become sticky to the body and makes her hot.</li>
            <li>Yet, i love this product most because it make my skin really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my pores on my face and remove makeup.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
            <li>great pdt for dry skin</li>
            <li>This product is perfect after shaving, it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>your dog may love it too much and want to lick your skin when you have it on and try to chew the lid off of the bottle like mine did.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ideal for some real moisturizing for dry skin...</li>
            <li>I got it quickly thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Following the instructions for after shower use has lead to a 25% more softer me :)</li>
            <li>I saw the price &amp; quickly put it in my basket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast absorbing, leaves a nice cocoa scent afterwards.</li>
            <li>Its lightly scented and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to comment further because its very subjective.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll buy some more!</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and soft.  </li>
            <li>Great for the winter months - and year round.</li>
            <li>I get golden or brown.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin SOFT and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t make it sticky as many oils do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even take the extra on my hands afterwards and smooth it through my hair afterwards to give it a shiny and healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite body oil.</li>
            <li>This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp.</li>
            <li>The oil was nice enough</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be floating around the surface of skin, instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It may seem oily when you first put it on but its absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I always use this right before I get out of the shower and put lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>I squirt this all right after the shower before using my towel...</li>
            <li>Also great for dry, cracked feet -- just be sure to be careful walking on uncarpeted floors if you use it on your feet, as it can be very slippery!</li>
            <li>I put it all over when I get out of the shower and by the time I go to get dressed, it is pretty much absorbed.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, works well, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long and is a good value for me since I tend to have very dry skin and need more than just a lotion.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;ve used all kind of body oils and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Your whole self will thank you for using this moisturizing oil!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>First time use of this product and found it greasy and not as water soluable as Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>After I use this, I use the lotion on critical areas I am hoping not to have as many stretch marks on.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really rub this oil around, it kid of gobs up on the skin- my towels needed to be washed right away</li>
            <li>The oil does have a &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; smell, that my dog loves, but other then that, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night and my skin feels nice and soft the next day.  </li>
            <li>I love this butter, and I have been used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I use it before towelling off and it makes my skin incredibly soft and smelling slightly of sweet coconut.</li>
            <li>The only cons is the smell, recommend you to use it at night, and the smell will not be strong after the night.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is waiting for it to soak in enough to get dressed, but that&#x27;s true for many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>pros: inexpensive and works better than the expensive brands like bio oil, not too oily, moisturizes really well after showering or while taking a bath, smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;cons</li>
            <li>The oil is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Continuous use really works well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li>so I really thought I would like this.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 and it really helps with the &amp;#34;crinkly&amp;#34; skin that comes after 50 in the chest area.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s products are very inexpensive compared to others.  </li>
            <li>It took about a week of rubbing it into my skin after a shower for it to really soften my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I thought I&#x27;d really like this oil but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know, it kind of trapped my body heat</li>
            <li>my skin stays moist at the same time looking more alive.</li>
            <li>The only comment I have is that it smells like a dessert when I first put it on - not bad</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cocoa Butter smell is a bit strong, and it&#x27;s not exactly a masculine scent</li>
            <li>It only takes seconds a day to stay moisturized and smell fresh!</li>
            <li>I use Palmer&#x27;s products on a regular and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>My other oils work much better, but pricier.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it will prevent my stretch marks, but this oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a good item to add to my bathwater during my pregnancy to provide some moisture during a long soak.</li>
            <li>The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this oil.  </li>
            <li>I can sweat, exercise, and be in high humidity and not smell.</li>
            <li>The oil is great, but it has a weird baby powder after smell.</li>
            <li>Love this oil vey hydrating and long lasting</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate so moisture mantainance is always a challenge for me.  </li>
            <li>I live that is</li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of this, it&#x27;s definitely #1 with me so far.</li>
            <li>Cocoa butter is good for so much, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil.</li>
            <li>Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn&#x27;t even know I use body oil!)</li>
            <li>LOVE this and have been using it for a few years!</li>
            <li>I put it on after the shower and before I put on cocoa butter and my skin is soft!  </li>
            <li>It is not really oily, a tad, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to Irish spring soap, which can be very drying, but I put this on right after my shower and my skin turns to silk.</li>
            <li>It will make your skin feeling soft and smooth and it last really long.</li>
            <li>I have tried several bath/shower oils, many of them more expensive than this one, and I keep coming back to Palmer&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling silky soft</li>
            <li>I went to Target one day &amp; unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this over the palmers gel which has a much stronger scent and it</li>
            <li>my 4 year old daughter says I smell like a yummy cookie..</li>
            <li>My skin just drinks it up and always feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer a thicker body oil than Palmers offers.</li>
            <li>I now use it all over my body (except for my face) to keep my skin soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>First let it dry then put on any piece of clothing.</li>
            <li>bought this oil accidentally, and now I can not live with out it, really!</li>
            <li>a 1000 x&#x27;s over to anyone who has sensitive/ dry skin or anyone who just wants to have that baby soft feel to their skin again!</li>
            <li>It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while.</li>
            <li>As long as you rub it in and don&#x27;t apply too much its not greasy at all which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I like the product because it makes my skin soft, but I am not fond of the cocoa butter scent in general.</li>
            <li>I normally like Palmer&#x27;s products, but this one fell short.</li>
            <li>With the winter months approaching this along with other Palmer&#x27;s product are excellent to embrace the cold weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen major improvement since I began using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li>Has a subtle good smell that&#x27;s not as heavy as cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft until the next shower.</li>
            <li>I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency.</li>
            <li>I try many body lotion/butter products, such as body shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, victory secret and so on.</li>
            <li>and I tried it on my skin right after I got out of the shower - same dried out</li>
            <li>I used this product twice a day on my stretch marks and the sensitive, dry skin on my legs.</li>
            <li>After using the product a few more times, I realized that I Do NOT love this item.</li>

            <li> My wife loved this oil.</li>
            <li> I’m a fan of a lot of Palmers’ products and was looking for a good body oil</li>
            <li> You can trust the Palmer&#x27;s name, and we all know that cocoa butter is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good oil to use as there is no smell or greasiness to it.  </li>
            <li> fairly greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with the Palmers Stretch Mark Lotion just for good measure.  </li>
            <li> Smells Good</li>
            <li> This stuff is good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good end of shower moisturizer which is how I use it.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it on my legs after shaving as it provides an excellent method of moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is very lightly scented and does a great job at softening skin.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I think it makes skin feel lovely!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years now and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> I love Palmers!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I brought this to avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy and I must say this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs so nicely into the skin, does not feel greasy, and leaves an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This is just an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my body nice and oily, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice</li>
            <li> Nice chocolate smell too.</li>
            <li> I thought I was reviewing the oil that has added antioxidants, which i like better, but this is good too.</li>
            <li> its nice moisturizing and nice smell ...</li>
            <li> My burn area is healing nicely and I am not bothered with the dryness associated with the healing process plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about grease and oil all over my clothes or bed.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but does not linger.</li>
            <li> I use it as lotion and it comes in handy in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my childhood and is cocoa buttery and kind of beachy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent body oil, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and has a pleasant clean scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best one I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on smoothly and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery, priced right and no hassle shopping.....</li>
            <li> It works great to soothe and heal hot spots on your dog, but be warned...</li>
            <li> On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won’t be buying again.</li>
            <li> but I thought this would be a great thing to just put in a spray bottle and use for quick and easy moisture application.  </li>
            <li> it is a great moisturing oil, not greasy and dries quicky, I get a great deal of sun and it works well to heal and repair dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product however it would be better if it came in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and if you put it on before bedtime it really makes your skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite after-shower oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I&#x27;ve mostly been using it to lighten up my stretch marks because my palmers stretch mark cream wasn&#x27;t doing the job</li>
            <li> I felt like I needed more.</li>
            <li> so I am always pleased with this</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> My favorite oil ever.</li>
            <li> My skin feel moist, healthy and shiny when I use this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> this oil leaves my skin nice n smooth.</li>
            <li> much better than any baby oil</li>
            <li> my mum love it</li>
            <li> I like the value of getting more for my money.  </li>
            <li> This product is actually quite excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> It makes my skin better; therefore, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love all Palmer&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this at the end of a shower then rinse it off.</li>
            <li> both love it.</li>
            <li> but my skin reacts better to this</li>
            <li> The smell of this is what I really love.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> It is the best investment in my bodily regime I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li> this item is one that we buy all the time, its not on auto order, but it should be, clean, fresh, wonderful scent, smooth, light and all around great body oil, used by my grandmother on all us kids since the summers of the 60s and now many moons later, Palmers is one that I would put on my grandkids if I had them, get some, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves a very nice almost chocolatey scent and my skin feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the light fragrance</li>
            <li> If used after the bath with wet skin, gives excellent esults.</li>
            <li> : Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals, low price, smells so good, &amp; it works!</li>
            <li> Even though it is body oil, it is easy for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately my husband does not appreciate me smelling so strongly like cocoa</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> use this right after the shower and follow up with lotion or Palmer&#x27;s CCB cream for a beautiful soft skin</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling and looking so much better after using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula moisturizing body oil; it really does softens and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m a little impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, have never tried coco butter anything, so it was a real treat that my sensitive pregnant stomach loved the smell, yay for that!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s products and I use their cocoa butter lotion all the time</li>
            <li> This product smells fantastic but does not soften as well as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated out of the shower and my husband loves the smell-</li>
            <li> Light fragrance and non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin glow...and smells fantastic...</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling silky smooth and not as oily as one would think.</li>
            <li> silky smooth.</li>
            <li> lotion on top, because I have super dry skin (kinda like the LOC method naturals use for their hair, except with no leave in lol).</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT moisturizing oil...absorbs smoothly and keeps skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She feels it is better than lotion since it does not become sticky to the body and makes her hot.</li>
            <li> Yet, i love this product most because it make my skin really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my pores on my face and remove makeup.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> great pdt for dry skin</li>
            <li> This product is perfect after shaving, it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> your dog may love it too much and want to lick your skin when you have it on and try to chew the lid off of the bottle like mine did.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ideal for some real moisturizing for dry skin...</li>
            <li> I got it quickly thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Following the instructions for after shower use has lead to a 25% more softer me :)</li>
            <li> I saw the price &amp; quickly put it in my basket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast absorbing, leaves a nice cocoa scent afterwards.</li>
            <li> Its lightly scented and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to comment further because its very subjective.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll buy some more!</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and soft.  </li>
            <li> Great for the winter months - and year round.</li>
            <li> I get golden or brown.</li>
            <li> and I love how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin SOFT and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t make it sticky as many oils do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even take the extra on my hands afterwards and smooth it through my hair afterwards to give it a shiny and healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite body oil.</li>
            <li> This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp.</li>
            <li> The oil was nice enough</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be floating around the surface of skin, instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It may seem oily when you first put it on but its absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I always use this right before I get out of the shower and put lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I squirt this all right after the shower before using my towel...</li>
            <li> Also great for dry, cracked feet -- just be sure to be careful walking on uncarpeted floors if you use it on your feet, as it can be very slippery!</li>
            <li> I put it all over when I get out of the shower and by the time I go to get dressed, it is pretty much absorbed.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, works well, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long and is a good value for me since I tend to have very dry skin and need more than just a lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;ve used all kind of body oils and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Your whole self will thank you for using this moisturizing oil!</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> First time use of this product and found it greasy and not as water soluable as Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> After I use this, I use the lotion on critical areas I am hoping not to have as many stretch marks on.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really rub this oil around, it kid of gobs up on the skin- my towels needed to be washed right away</li>
            <li> The oil does have a &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; smell, that my dog loves, but other then that, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and my skin feels nice and soft the next day.  </li>
            <li> I love this butter, and I have been used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it before towelling off and it makes my skin incredibly soft and smelling slightly of sweet coconut.</li>
            <li> The only cons is the smell, recommend you to use it at night, and the smell will not be strong after the night.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is waiting for it to soak in enough to get dressed, but that&#x27;s true for many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> pros: inexpensive and works better than the expensive brands like bio oil, not too oily, moisturizes really well after showering or while taking a bath, smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;cons</li>
            <li> The oil is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Continuous use really works well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li> so I really thought I would like this.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 and it really helps with the &amp;#34;crinkly&amp;#34; skin that comes after 50 in the chest area.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s products are very inexpensive compared to others.  </li>
            <li> It took about a week of rubbing it into my skin after a shower for it to really soften my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I thought I&#x27;d really like this oil but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know, it kind of trapped my body heat</li>
            <li> my skin stays moist at the same time looking more alive.</li>
            <li> The only comment I have is that it smells like a dessert when I first put it on - not bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cocoa Butter smell is a bit strong, and it&#x27;s not exactly a masculine scent</li>
            <li> It only takes seconds a day to stay moisturized and smell fresh!</li>
            <li> I use Palmer&#x27;s products on a regular and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> My other oils work much better, but pricier.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it will prevent my stretch marks, but this oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a good item to add to my bathwater during my pregnancy to provide some moisture during a long soak.</li>
            <li> The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this oil.  </li>
            <li> I can sweat, exercise, and be in high humidity and not smell.</li>
            <li> The oil is great, but it has a weird baby powder after smell.</li>
            <li> Love this oil vey hydrating and long lasting</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate so moisture mantainance is always a challenge for me.  </li>
            <li> I live that is</li>
            <li> even though I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of this, it&#x27;s definitely #1 with me so far.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter is good for so much, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil.</li>
            <li> Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn&#x27;t even know I use body oil!)</li>
            <li> LOVE this and have been using it for a few years!</li>
            <li> I put it on after the shower and before I put on cocoa butter and my skin is soft!  </li>
            <li> It is not really oily, a tad, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to Irish spring soap, which can be very drying, but I put this on right after my shower and my skin turns to silk.</li>
            <li> It will make your skin feeling soft and smooth and it last really long.</li>
            <li> I have tried several bath/shower oils, many of them more expensive than this one, and I keep coming back to Palmer&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling silky soft</li>
            <li> I went to Target one day &amp; unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this over the palmers gel which has a much stronger scent and it</li>
            <li> my 4 year old daughter says I smell like a yummy cookie..</li>
            <li> My skin just drinks it up and always feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I prefer a thicker body oil than Palmers offers.</li>
            <li> I now use it all over my body (except for my face) to keep my skin soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> First let it dry then put on any piece of clothing.</li>
            <li> bought this oil accidentally, and now I can not live with out it, really!</li>
            <li> a 1000 x&#x27;s over to anyone who has sensitive/ dry skin or anyone who just wants to have that baby soft feel to their skin again!</li>
            <li> It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while.</li>
            <li> As long as you rub it in and don&#x27;t apply too much its not greasy at all which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it makes my skin soft, but I am not fond of the cocoa butter scent in general.</li>
            <li> I normally like Palmer&#x27;s products, but this one fell short.</li>
            <li> With the winter months approaching this along with other Palmer&#x27;s product are excellent to embrace the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen major improvement since I began using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Has a subtle good smell that&#x27;s not as heavy as cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft until the next shower.</li>
            <li> I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency.</li>
            <li> I try many body lotion/butter products, such as body shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, victory secret and so on.</li>
            <li> and I tried it on my skin right after I got out of the shower - same dried out</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day on my stretch marks and the sensitive, dry skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> After using the product a few more times, I realized that I Do NOT love this item.</li>
            <li> That one is better, a little less heavy.  </li>
            <li> About a month ago my stretch marks were VERY obvious from a long distance</li>
            <li> I have exceedingly dry skin, and regular body lotions don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I recently operated and because of that my skin was quite dry and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking shiny and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get red or pink.</li>
            <li> its moisturize so well and lasts long time ..</li>
            <li> It requires only a little to go a long way which basically means this bottle will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did have his mixed up with another version that has other added antioxidants or whatever.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on dry skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one having dry skin or just needs shiny glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps smoothen that Winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is dry.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to any and everyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were so big and dark</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so a single bottle will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I apply this oil EVERY TIME after the bath, my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter, I have tried all kinds of oil when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and even through a harsh Western NY winter, I didn&#x27;t struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most other body oils faint to a cooking oil scent after a few hours, or not quickly absorbed by the skin thus getting everything else greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder and harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I use it after the shower while still wet.</li>
            <li> i would say the only downside is that it smells heavily of chocolate.</li>
            <li> I put in on while still wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin gets super dry from the cold weather and in the summer from the AZ sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Over a period of time, skin gets nourished due to the presence of Vitamin E and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky nor slick like oils of the same price.</li>
            <li> The skin therapy oil lighten dark spots and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few oils lately and this one has the advantage of a bit larger container.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter but using this stuff made my dry skin 10x worse.  </li>
            <li> Once you put a little product on your hands, then your hands are too slippery to handle the bottle.</li>
            <li> Like a little pampering party.</li>
            <li> Staple, everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but after a few minutes that smell dissipates and the baby powder smell remains.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Having used baby oil in the past, I was shocked at how quickly this was used up.</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I apply small portions and it absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li> I usually put this on then layer  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m using everyday after shower!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for not being ashy.</li>
            <li> I did not notice the effects because I could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Not really effective as a standalone moisturizer, though.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds a bit icky</li>
            <li> It softens and slowly tones the skin and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had received serious burns on my legs and ankles.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells, well, not good.</li>
            <li> This stuff dried me out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was quite thin and runny, so a lot of it was lost in the process of trying to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of oils, from Baby Oil made by Johnson and Johnson to Neutrogena Sesame Oil, and all of them fall behind this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have become addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the baby powder scent was overpowering so I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Smell is very very bad like as &amp;#34; Ant &amp; Roach Killer Spray &amp;#34; .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for MONTHS now and finally got around to using it today. And it is wonderful! Put it in after my shower. I recently switched to Irish spring soap, which can be very drying, but I put this on right after my shower and my skin turns to silk. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this as a tanning oil. When I use it I just don&#x27;t burn. I don&#x27;t get red or pink. I get golden or brown. It is amazing. I love it. And it&#x27;s cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells, well, not good.</li>
            <li> pros: inexpensive and works better than the expensive brands like bio oil, not too oily, moisturizes really well after showering or while taking a bath, smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;cons: none at all!</li>
            <li> Keeps my body nice and oily, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Great oil!  Smells good, but not too strong.  The oil is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT BUT A BIT TOO WATERY</li>
            <li> I like this product however it would be better if it came in a spray bottle. Once you put a little product on your hands, then your hands are too slippery to handle the bottle.</li>
            <li> Palmers products are awesome.  Skin feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and I can already see a difference in my skin.  Waiting to see what it does for my post-pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Non greasy. Like a little pampering party. Every night.</li>
            <li> It really works!! The skin therapy oil lighten dark spots and it&#x27;s not oily. First let it dry then put on any piece of clothing. It will not bleed though .</li>
            <li> This product smells fantastic but does not soften as well as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate cake !</li>
            <li> Palmers cocoa butter oil</li>
            <li> use this right after the shower and follow up with lotion or Palmer&#x27;s CCB cream for a beautiful soft skin</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic. I use it every day as I get out of the shower. Great for the winter months - and year round.</li>
            <li> This oil makes your skin feel sooo good.  It is not really oily, a tad, but not bad.  Smells really good and if you put it on before bedtime it really makes your skin feel great.  Continuous use really works well.</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery, priced right and no hassle shopping.....what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It helps with pregnancy stretch marks and overall moisturizing.  Good price too.  Soaks in well too so it doesn&#x27;t get clothing/bedding oily.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Its like crack. I use it in the tub when I take baths and when I get out. I have very dry skin and this keeps me moisterized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s products and I use their cocoa butter lotion all the time but I thought this would be a great thing to just put in a spray bottle and use for quick and easy moisture application.  This stuff dried me out like crazy.  I have dry skin in the winter but using this stuff made my dry skin 10x worse.  My skin looked like paper.  I was super disappointed.  I tried it on dry skin and I tried it on my skin right after I got out of the shower - same dried out results.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice but I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Staple, everyday moisturizer.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop producing this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling and looking so much better after using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula moisturizing body oil; it really does softens and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite after-shower oil. I use it before towelling off and it makes my skin incredibly soft and smelling slightly of sweet coconut. I have tried several bath/shower oils, many of them more expensive than this one, and I keep coming back to Palmer&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I bought this Palmer&#x27;s oil as an add on to my order.  I think it makes skin feel lovely!  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. I always use this right before I get out of the shower and put lotion afterwards. It will make your skin feeling soft and smooth and it last really long.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best for moisturizing. I use it every night before bed and even through a harsh Western NY winter, I didn&#x27;t struggle with dry skin. The scent is very light and soft.  It doesn&#x27;t overpower at all.</li>
            <li> this item is one that we buy all the time, its not on auto order, but it should be, clean, fresh, wonderful scent, smooth, light and all around great body oil, used by my grandmother on all us kids since the summers of the 60s and now many moons later, Palmers is one that I would put on my grandkids if I had them, get some, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil I&#x27;ve mostly been using it to lighten up my stretch marks because my palmers stretch mark cream wasn&#x27;t doing the job and I must say I&#x27;m a little impressed. About a month ago my stretch marks were VERY obvious from a long distance and I believe they are lightening up only after about a month of usage. I didn&#x27;t expect much from it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking shiny and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to miss this in your shelf for winter season. My wife loved this oil. Over a period of time, skin gets nourished due to the presence of Vitamin E and Cocoa Butter. Its lightly scented and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to comment further because its very subjective. I would recommend this product to any one having dry skin or just needs shiny glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s delivery was on time and well packed, arrived without any damages. Try this product, you will not regret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years now and love it! In the winter, my skin gets super dry from the cold weather and in the summer from the AZ sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the winter months, I put it on every time I come out of the shower and always before bed. During the summer, I mix it with my Neutrogena face moisturizer and then apply it so I don&#x27;t feel sticky and I get the added benefit of my sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that some people don&#x27;t like the smell of cocoa butter, but I personally haven&#x27;t found one yet... and I think it smells great!</li>
            <li> I like to use this coming out of the shower in the winter. Helps smoothen that Winter dry skin.  Nice chocolate smell too.</li>
            <li> I’m a fan of a lot of Palmers’ products and was looking for a good body oil so I really thought I would like this. Having used baby oil in the past, I was shocked at how quickly this was used up. The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month. The consistency was quite thin and runny, so a lot of it was lost in the process of trying to apply. Then – possibly because of thinness? -  I felt like I needed more. I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency. On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won’t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I brought this to avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy and I must say this product is amazing. Its light weight, great moisturizer without being greasy and the smell is wonderful. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I use this in my bath and I love how soft it makes my skin and it has helped fade the scar and  marks I do have so I am always pleased with this</li>
            <li> I am not the person who writes reviews, but for this product i decide to write.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this oil accidentally, and now I can not live with out it, really! I apply this oil EVERY TIME after the bath, my skin is very dry so i have to do it. It makes my skin SOFT and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t make it sticky as many oils do.&lt;br /&gt;Price is amazing! it lasts forever. I apply small portions and it absorbs immediately. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy after use, long-lasting, and smells great. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> My favorite oil ever. For some reason they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore? I don&#x27;t know why. THis is the only oil I&#x27;ll use on my skin!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Have used many products and this works the best .</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated out of the shower and my husband loves the smell- I win this round.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- After using the product a few more times, I realized that I Do NOT love this item. If you don&#x27;t really rub this oil around, it kid of gobs up on the skin- my towels needed to be washed right away and I don&#x27;t know, it kind of trapped my body heat in- I didn&#x27;t like the way it made me feel.</li>
            <li> The oil is great, but it has a weird baby powder after smell. When you use it initially it does smell like cocoa butter (like the body butter), but after a few minutes that smell dissipates and the baby powder smell remains. Otherwise, it&#x27;s body oil that works as intended.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s harder and harder to find in the stores. It moisturizes and has a pleasant clean scent. I use it after the shower while still wet. It only takes seconds a day to stay moisturized and smell fresh!</li>
            <li> This is the best body moisturizer I have ever used. I have exceedingly dry skin, and regular body lotions don&#x27;t work. This oil absorbs so nicely into the skin, does not feel greasy, and leaves an amazing scent. A little goes a long way, so a single bottle will last for quite a while. You can trust the Palmer&#x27;s name, and we all know that cocoa butter is good for the skin. My skin feel moist, healthy and shiny when I use this. I even take the extra on my hands afterwards and smooth it through my hair afterwards to give it a shiny and healthy sheen. Cocoa butter is good for so much, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil. Also great for dry, cracked feet -- just be sure to be careful walking on uncarpeted floors if you use it on your feet, as it can be very slippery! But your feet will thank you! Your whole self will thank you for using this moisturizing oil!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great. It may seem oily when you first put it on but its absorbs rather quickly. I usually put this on then layer  lotion on top, because I have super dry skin (kinda like the LOC method naturals use for their hair, except with no leave in lol). This works well for me and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry. I try many body lotion/butter products, such as body shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, victory secret and so on. Yet, i love this product most because it make my skin really soft and moisturized. I use this body oil with Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula cream. Even though it is body oil, it is easy for my skin to absorb. The only cons is the smell, recommend you to use it at night, and the smell will not be strong after the night.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make bath bombs.  It is a good oil to use as there is no smell or greasiness to it.  It was reasonably priced. I got it quickly thru Amazon.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved! And I&#x27;m using everyday after shower! Next time I&#x27;ll buy some more! Thank you everybody. I didn&#x27;t know it was so good!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- moisturize and soften your skin.  I also use it to clean my pores on my face and remove makeup.  It works great to soothe and heal hot spots on your dog, but be warned...your dog may love it too much and want to lick your skin when you have it on and try to chew the lid off of the bottle like mine did.  The only issue I have is waiting for it to soak in enough to get dressed, but that&#x27;s true for many moisturizers.  I also use Palmers face oil at night.  Update...I did have his mixed up with another version that has other added antioxidants or whatever.  That one is better, a little less heavy.  But this one is still very good.  Update:  I thought I was reviewing the oil that has added antioxidants, which i like better, but this is good too.</li>
            <li> Excellent body oil, I highly recommend it. Has a subtle good smell that&#x27;s not as heavy as cocoa butter smell. Leaves skin feeling silky soft</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing. i would say the only downside is that it smells heavily of chocolate.</li>
            <li> this oil leaves my skin nice n smooth. not like lotions. my skin stays moist at the same time looking more alive. and the fact it is cocoa butter. much better than any baby oil I know on the market.</li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged. Other than that, a good item to add to my bathwater during my pregnancy to provide some moisture during a long soak. Not really effective as a standalone moisturizer, though. Light fragrance and non-greasy feel. Would purchase again, exclusively for use in bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions for after shower use has lead to a 25% more softer me :)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my husband does not appreciate me smelling so strongly like cocoa so I can only give it 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> its nice moisturizing and nice smell ...its moisturize so well and lasts long time ..my mum love it</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle in October 2014, and I&#x27;ve been using this to help fade my scar. I&#x27;ve seen major improvement since I began using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase a body oil ever since I received one as a sample. I went to Target one day &amp; unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer&#x27;s stuff. I didn&#x27;t even know they had a body oil! I saw the price &amp; quickly put it in my basket. This stuff works so well! Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn&#x27;t even know I use body oil!). 4 reasons you should purchase this: Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals, low price, smells so good, &amp; it works!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite body oil. It&#x27;s fast absorbing, leaves a nice cocoa scent afterwards. I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;ve used all kind of body oils and moisturizers. Most other body oils faint to a cooking oil scent after a few hours, or not quickly absorbed by the skin thus getting everything else greasy. I&#x27;m sticking with Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This oil is very lightly scented and does a great job at softening skin.  I have bought a few oils lately and this one has the advantage of a bit larger container.  I like the value of getting more for my money.  Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is actually quite excellent. It has a slightly different and stronger smell than the jar cocoa butter. It requires only a little to go a long way which basically means this bottle will last for a very long time. I tend to use it on my legs after shaving as it provides an excellent method of moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin. As long as you rub it in and don&#x27;t apply too much its not greasy at all which is a plus. Would definitely recommend this over the palmers gel which has a much stronger scent and it fairly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially great for when you don&#x27;t want to use the jar cocoa butter but still want that well oiled sheen look without feeling greasy b</li>
            <li> This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp. It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while. I love this oil</li>
            <li> This product is perfect after shaving, it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long. I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;m 70 and it really helps with the &amp;#34;crinkly&amp;#34; skin that comes after 50 in the chest area. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate them, but softens them so they&#x27;re not so obvious.</li>
            <li> I use Palmer&#x27;s products on a regular and I am never disappointed. With the winter months approaching this along with other Palmer&#x27;s product are excellent to embrace the cold weather.</li>
            <li> This oil is a very nice moisturizer.  I love this butter, and I have been used it for a long time. It makes my skin better; therefore, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> First time use of this product and found it greasy and not as water soluable as Vitamin E oil. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now. I use it every day after I get out of the shower. I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks! This oil keeps my stomach and thighs well moisturized. Sometimes I had a layer of regular cocoa butter lotion over the oil to help it stay on longer. I think it smells great.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin. I use it every day. Has a great scent, too. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had received serious burns on my legs and ankles. After the healing process began I needed something to keep the wound moist but not greasy. This product fill the bill perfectly. My burn area is healing nicely and I am not bothered with the dryness associated with the healing process plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about grease and oil all over my clothes or bed. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Smell is very very bad like as &amp;#34; Ant &amp; Roach Killer Spray &amp;#34; . Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> OMG, this is EVERYTHING the website says it is!  THE best oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works like nothing else does.</li>
            <li> Pamer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter oil... this is a great moisturizer. step out of the shower and apply immediately. non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;great for the winter!</li>
            <li> Silky skin without the grease or film. LOVE this and have been using it for a few years! A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> This is just an amazing product. I put it all over when I get out of the shower and by the time I go to get dressed, it is pretty much absorbed. I love the smell, have never tried coco butter anything, so it was a real treat that my sensitive pregnant stomach loved the smell, yay for that! After I use this, I use the lotion on critical areas I am hoping not to have as many stretch marks on. :) Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love all Palmer&#x27;s products.  I use this in the shower.  Apply after and towel off.  Keeps skin smooth and moist.  Palmer&#x27;s products are very inexpensive compared to others.  A must have for the winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this on my tummy post baby.  My stretch marks were so big and dark it looked like a bear clawed me.  Ive been using this for over 6 months now and the stretch marks are fading.  Although it does not say it works on stretch marks, my mom told me it works and it has.  I use it with the Palmers Stretch Mark Lotion just for good measure.  So I suppose either or both of them could work :P</li>
            <li> Estoy enamorada de este aceite, yo lo uso mezclado con mis cremas corporales y la piel me queda de maravilla! Excelente!</li>
            <li> Best Purchase Ever! I bought this oil because I figured might as well give it a shot to prevent pregnancy stretch marks. Not sure if it will prevent my stretch marks, but this oil is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling soft until the next shower. The oil does have a &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; smell, that my dog loves, but other then that, it&#x27;s pretty amazing. It&#x27;s not sticky nor slick like oils of the same price. It&#x27;s leaves my cuticles, elbows and my feet feeling moistened, while I don&#x27;t see any of rubbing off on my clothing. I&#x27;ve tried all types of oils, from Baby Oil made by Johnson and Johnson to Neutrogena Sesame Oil, and all of them fall behind this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I squirt this all right after the shower before using my towel...so the oil mixes with the water...it makes my skin glow...and smells fantastic...my 4 year old daughter says I smell like a yummy cookie..and my husband loves it too....it&#x27;s ideal for some real moisturizing for dry skin...there&#x27;s nothing like it and i love it!</li>
            <li> This product is Great!! I put in on while still wet in the shower. My skin just drinks it up and always feels silky and soft. I love Palmers!</li>
            <li> Love this oil vey hydrating and long lasting</li>
            <li> This is the best. Smells Good As Well</li>
            <li> This stuff is good and I put it in a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she gave birth to our second child. She loves this product. She feels it is better than lotion since it does not become sticky to the body and makes her hot. Product does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> I love to use this at the end of a shower then rinse it off. Leaves a very nice almost chocolatey scent and my skin feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put it on after the shower and before I put on cocoa butter and my skin is soft!  Smells nice but does not linger.</li>
            <li> I normally like Palmer&#x27;s products, but this one fell short. The oil was nice enough but I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent. It smells like a combination on cocoa butter (which I like) and baby powder (which I don&#x27;t like). Unfortunately the baby powder scent was overpowering so I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> just Meh. I prefer a thicker body oil than Palmers offers.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to any and everyone with dry skin. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it on his feet and he says that I would have to get a second bottle. It has his feet feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;We both love it.</li>
            <li> It took about a week of rubbing it into my skin after a shower for it to really soften my skin. So I tried a cupful in my bath water and my skin feels amazing! I didn&#x27;t even need the lotion afterwards. Not to mention I dipped my head in the water and my curls are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product a 1000 x&#x27;s over to anyone who has sensitive/ dry skin or anyone who just wants to have that baby soft feel to their skin again! Thank you so much Palmer&#x27;s!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price - you can&#x27;t beat the moisture this puts into your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it as lotion and it comes in handy in the winter months. A little bit goes a long way so it lasts forever! It leaves the skin feeling silky smooth and not as oily as one would think.</li>
            <li> silky smooth. This product helps my body maintain moisture.  I live in a desert climate so moisture mantainance is always a challenge for me.  This product helps me meet that challenge.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT moisturizing oil...absorbs smoothly and keeps skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the \\&quot;Skin Therapy\\&quot; version that Palmer&#x27;s makes but my skin reacts better to this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter smell is a bit strong, and it&#x27;s not exactly a masculine scent but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for not being ashy.</li>
            <li> Love the light fragrance</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter, I have tried all kinds of oil when I get out of the shower.  So far this is the best one I have tried.  It smells great, goes on smoothly and blends in easily.  I live that is also has Vitamin E.  I would highly recommend this oil.  I also use the Palmers cocoa butter lotion which is also very good.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it makes my skin soft, but I am not fond of the cocoa butter scent in general.</li>
            <li> great pdt for dry skin</li>
            <li> it was packaged to prevent damage, arrived on time.  it is a great moisturing oil, not greasy and dries quicky, I get a great deal of sun and it works well to heal and repair dry skin. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell. I did not notice the effects because I could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is what I really love.  It reminds me of my childhood and is cocoa buttery and kind of beachy.  It&#x27;s a good end of shower moisturizer which is how I use it. It lasts pretty long and is a good value for me since I tend to have very dry skin and need more than just a lotion.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and my skin feels nice and soft the next day.  The only comment I have is that it smells like a dessert when I first put it on - not bad, I just prefer a lighter, not-as-sweet scent.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I thought I&#x27;d really like this oil but didn&#x27;t. I feel greasy but don&#x27;t feel moisturized.  The oil seems to be floating around the surface of skin, instead of being absorbed.  My other oils work much better, but pricier.  It&#x27;s oaky for the price, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Please note this is NOT a baby product.  Amazon has incorrectly tagged all these reviews as being for a baby product.    This is a great after-shower oil.  It absorbs quickly, works well, and is reasonably priced.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I don&#x27;t care for the scent of cocoa butter, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.  In fact, I was looking on Amazon to see if by any chance Palmer makes a shower oil in another \\&quot;flavor.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m still experimenting with shower oils but even though I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of this, it&#x27;s definitely #1 with me so far.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I recently operated and because of that my skin was quite dry and dehydrated. I started using this cream mixed with Corporeality my oil and I have become addicted to it. If used after the bath with wet skin, gives excellent esults. I recommend it, I met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I used this product in tandem with Mederma for my stretch marks post-pregnancy. I used this product twice a day on my stretch marks and the sensitive, dry skin on my legs. I don&#x27;t know if it was this or the Mederma that helped my stretch marks, or both, but it definitely helped the skin on my legs. I now use it all over my body (except for my face) to keep my skin soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for five years now. It is the best investment in my bodily regime I&#x27;ve ever done. I use this with cocoa butter lotion and vaseline all over my body (except my face). It softens and slowly tones the skin and blemishes. The best thing about this - and one of my biggest hygiene secrets - is that it eliminates body odor! Not even kidding. I can and have gone days without bathing because of this product. I know that sounds a bit icky but it&#x27;s the truth. I can sweat, exercise, and be in high humidity and not smell. Maybe it&#x27;s the soybean oil and cocoa seed butter. Maybe it&#x27;s the double cocoa layers I have on with the combination of this and the lotion. I don&#x27;t know but it works.</li>
