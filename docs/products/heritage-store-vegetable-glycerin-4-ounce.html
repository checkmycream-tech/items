            <li>im sure heritge does sell good stuff allthough sometimes pricey  </li>
            <li>Most importantly the price was great and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>So glad I was given the recipe and products like this are available at Amazon!</li>
            <li>love this stuff its now a staple product and i will be buying it again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>Love at first use!!!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good vegetable glycerin.</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes the consistency so smooth.</li>
            <li>Love that it is odor free, color free and flavor free.</li>
            <li>I am making my own Vitamin C facial serum and this glycerin, coupled with the Vitamin C powder help me save a great deal of money and the results are the same.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping that this mixed with a good leave in would keep moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very sweet smelling, and tends to attract the bugs around where I live.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and with 4 ounces it should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Pretty much straight glycerin.  </li>
            <li>is very greasy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have anything to say about this</li>
            <li>We use this along with a q-tip to clean our babies tongue when she has a white residue after drinking formula.  </li>
            <li>My new growth has never been this manageable.</li>
            <li>I just add it to the rest of my daily stuff in my spray bottle and my hair has never had this much shine bounce softness</li>
            <li>Apparently, the seal was not tight enough and the glycerin was all over the other items.</li>

            <li> Once it dried it was dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lock in moisture for my thick coarse 4/B hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural and my only complaint about being natural is the new growth is so horrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a oily mess.</li>
            <li> My hair had a weird oily feeling to it.</li>

            <li> Works wonders for creating homemade beauty care products and toothpaste. Love that it is odor free, color free and flavor free. Most importantly the price was great and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; good experience</li>
            <li> I use this product in my homemade cream and I love how it makes the consistency so smooth. It&#x27;s a great product and with 4 ounces it should last me a long time.</li>

            <li> i didn&#x27;t like it i used it on my face and for oily people don&#x27;t use it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> love this stuff its now a staple product and i will be buying it again</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to homemade cosmetics and it&#x27;s been great for the winter. I just add one to three drops to the jojoba oil I use to moisturize my face, and it gives my dehydrated winter skin a nice emollient feel-soft and supple. But I don&#x27;t recommend adding it to anything you use on your face daily, as it might cause breakouts. I added it to lip balm that I made, which has also been nice. I guess you can use it as a sweetener, too, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have anything to say about this I use it and blah that&#x27;s it..</li>
            <li> I order this product with 4 other items, but when the mail arrived, everything inside was oily. Apparently, the seal was not tight enough and the glycerin was all over the other items.</li>
            <li> Great for my DIY Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> This stuff is very sweet smelling, and tends to attract the bugs around where I live. :P BUT I use it in a few different body scrubs I have, and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I have kinky hair and I was hoping that this mixed with a good leave in would keep moisture in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a oily mess.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as advertised - will re-order</li>
            <li> Used for making lip gloss.  As described. No complaints.</li>
            <li> n great im sure heritge does sell good stuff allthough sometimes pricey  however service is great  bih cbjhhd  hgds  vysaD</li>
            <li> We use this along with a q-tip to clean our babies tongue when she has a white residue after drinking formula.  It works well enough with some pressure and she seems to like the taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... different strokes; for different folks.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel.  My hair had a weird oily feeling to it. Once it dried it was dry and flaky.  It didn&#x27;t lock in moisture for my thick coarse 4/B hair.  My hair gulps moisture and this was just not helping.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> Pretty much straight glycerin.  Not much else to comment on it.  I personally use it to enhance a lather when I shave.</li>
            <li> My new growth has never been this manageable. I am a natural and my only complaint about being natural is the new growth is so horrible my beautiful 4b curls was sitting on naps but then I got introduced to GLYCERIN!!!!! I just add it to the rest of my daily stuff in my spray bottle and my hair has never had this much shine bounce softness and it&#x27;s immediate. Love at first use!!!</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price.... worked with all my science experiments</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good vegetable glycerin. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all. I would buy again.</li>
