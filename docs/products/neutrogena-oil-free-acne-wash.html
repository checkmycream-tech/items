            <li>It helps a ton and is great to use in combination with the Aveeno lotion with FPS 15.  </li>
            <li>Well, this facewash, I am proud to say, has both.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and the combination of the scrub particles and the lather it produces give it a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>I love the exfoliation, the smell, the color, and the consistency!!</li>
            <li>So amazing!</li>

            <li>this smells pleasant</li>
            <li>This product is great for acne prone skin and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.  </li>
            <li>Feels good when using it, and does help control acne break outs.</li>
            <li>it is fair to say I know how to do it.  </li>
            <li>I would reccommend this to anyone wanting a good face wash at a fair price.</li>
            <li>It Leaves Your Face Feeling Refreshed &amp; Smelling Good.</li>
            <li>The scrub itself is very nice, it&#x27;s not too aggressive and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>regards to the feel of the product, the microbeads feel refreshing over my skin and the grapefruit smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use this product--in fact, we had it on auto-order (until too many began piling up!).  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub!</li>
            <li>Its very refreshing and provides nice exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, upon using the scrub once a day, my acne has cleared up amazingly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li>This is actually a good product to soften the skin and better the skin tone...</li>
            <li>The scrubby beads feel nice and eliminate the need to use a wash cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice</li>
            <li>Effectively cleans my skin without over drying.</li>
            <li>Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li>After using this for three months I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li>and it smells like grapefruit which is really nice.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon and neutrogena :D</li>
            <li>does a nice job at foaming up and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells nice though</li>
            <li>It does smell nice through.</li>
            <li>so i gave it three stars, smells nice, and feels nice on my skin too.</li>
            <li>This face scrub smells very very delicious and it works great as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It smells great, cleans great, and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I liked this facewash because it smelled good, and it felt like my face was clean when I was done washing.</li>
            <li>Also, the grapefruit scent is wild and wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh fruity Grapefruit smell of this product and have found great deals on it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena for the great product and to Amazon for great pricing and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Great scent and overall a great product for the price that it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will clean oily skin (I require a moisturizer afterward) and it smells great; light and fruity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Salicylic Acid procucts have improved MY skin tremendously (acne, wrinkles &amp; scars)!!</li>
            <li>The product also has a really nice smell - I don&#x27;t find it too strong</li>
            <li>Fun isn&#x27;t always good.</li>
            <li>I will preface this review by saying that if you are looking for a medicated scrub, want or are Ok with chemicals, this review may not be meaningful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is better than most acne systems.  </li>
            <li>Again, the description is not misleading, but having purchased Neutrogena for many years, I did not read it, thinking I knew what I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this item..</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>has made my skin look fantastic!</li>
            <li>I leave thinking I can find something better</li>
            <li>and I love the microbeads in it to help scrub all the dirt away.</li>
            <li>I Got this scrub more then a week ago, and i am not using it anymore.</li>
            <li>i wish this scrub would had more scrubby parts.</li>
            <li>I can see how that wouldn&#x27;t appeal to all people, but it is appealing to us.    </li>
            <li>and I was in the sun more</li>
            <li>He has been using it for 2 months now and his acne has gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li>There are 3 of us who absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best facial wash</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be sure which one</li>
            <li>I was then brought to the hospital to make sure there was no permanent injury to my cornea.  </li>
            <li>I use this product 1-2 times a day, mostly at night, and I love it.</li>
            <li>its so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it would have been A LOT better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than a month</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about this face wash drying out people&#x27;s skin, but I decided to try it anyway since the Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve used before have been fantastic and grapefruit itself is scrumptious!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>can you ask more from face wash?</li>
            <li>I have been using the Neutrogena grape fruit foaming cream for over a year and really love that product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, if you love your kids do not let them suffer with acne.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, if you love your kids do not let them suffer with acne.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer and eye cream, but things seem to be looking better by the day.  </li>
            <li>I happen to love it.</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure...</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have adult-onset acne mostly on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>I wash with it twice a day, and I will continue to buy it and use it unless I find something better.</li>
            <li>, it feels nice to scrub your face a bit and your face feels really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue using this effective product!</li>
            <li>This really is a great face wash and the salicyclic acid in it acts as an exfoliate, great at getting rid of dead skin cells, and the grapefruit increases the PH of your skin reducing acne flare ups.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a product that is voted year after year the best by allure readers.</li>
            <li>and/ or Lush \\&quot;Happy</li>
            <li>and/ or Lush \\&quot;Happy</li>
            <li>The pink grapefruit is Neutrogena&#x27;s best scent.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 yrs old, pre-menopausal and have always prided myself with taking great care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>(I know, sounds like I&#x27;m exaggerating, but it&#x27;s really true!).</li>
            <li>I love that this scrub smells nice and is gentle, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping my breakouts yet</li>
            <li>I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to grab and go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it off and on for 3+ years but in a real skin situation, there are more effective creams out there.</li>
            <li>For some it is too strong.</li>
            <li>I called Neutrogena and the woman was very nice and said that this is not typical of their product.  </li>
            <li>Once I put on a moisturizer my face felt fine.</li>
            <li>So since I cant pay for a quality scrub this one is just fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it has a mild formula so it doesn&#x27;t harm your skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li>Overall it worked GREAT for my skin....</li>
            <li>, I find they work the best for controlling breakouts without being too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it leaves my face feeling smooth, oil-free, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s leaves my skin smooth and prevent brake</li>
            <li>I can not stress how important this is to a teenager.n my chin or along my jawline area</li>
            <li>I can not stress how important this is to a teenager.</li>
            <li>and this helps a lot to cotrol it plus it leaves my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li>In terms of how good this is as an acne wash, my daughter would be in a better position than I to review it (and I bought a second for her).  </li>
            <li>In terms of how good this is as an acne wash, my daughter would be in a better position than I to review it (and I bought a second for her).  </li>
            <li>It not only smells delicious, but lathers up really well and is not too drying on my skin.</li>
            <li>This face wash feels good on my sensitive skin, and I like the fact that it comes infused with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>(and I LOVE the refreshing, grapefruit-y smell), it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I very rarely get breakouts now.</li>
            <li>:) Also, I love the new deal where you can get a discount with Amazon if you place a renewing subscription on the product.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the wash for two days, but my skin just continued to flake; those areas of my skin all feel like they have a mild sunburn on them now, and exfoliating them with a loofa to get rid of the dead skin hasn&#x27;t felt so wonderful after using this scrub.</li>
            <li>However, when I use this regularly it is definitely significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to just use water and a scrub to wash around my nose since it&#x27;s not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>OK first of all, I have no idea how this product has gotten such good ratings on here...</li>
            <li>and I always try to get him to buy something more gentle...</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing, it&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator, and the salicylic acid helps get all the gunk out of your face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and clean</li>
            <li>review is written for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic....</li>
            <li>and then I realize my face is starting to breakout again and find myself back to this awesome scrub/cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It was so severe that I needed an ambulance and the paramedics worked quickly and diligently to get the foaming beads out of my eyes--</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with mild acne.  </li>
            <li>Add a super size at an unbeatable price..</li>
            <li>very well.the beads make exfoliating my hair so easy and it massages my face too leaving it</li>
            <li>It smells great and the little bubbles in the scrub help exfoliate and scrub.</li>
            <li>I just did not realize that Neutrogena is now adding chemicals, effectively turning their back on what established the brand.  </li>
            <li>it might be only me that got this problem since u guys have nice review..</li>
            <li>Bottom line: this grapefruit scrub works well for clearing up acne, but feeling like you have a sunburn after using it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>bonus to this scrub is the smell--it smells like fresh grapefruit</li>
            <li>Salicylate acid is crucial in making this an effective acne face wash.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel fresh</li>
            <li>And if you use it in the morning and night everyday then it makes your face feel smooth wich makes you look good.</li>
            <li>grapefuit smell is just right.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>In The Morning &amp; Right</li>
            <li>The smell is also pleasing, due to the citrus scent, which smells really clean and nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not breakout prone, so this works for me, however, it doesn&#x27;t really stand out as anything special.</li>
            <li>It smells good too, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause my skin to dry out as much as it should.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin, I strongly recommend NOT using this product.</li>
            <li>This 6.7 ounce value size is a great deal (I had to pick one up in a hurry at my local Walgreens and paid 10.99 for the same size).</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>The scrub leaves my skin super soft and clean after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m not hormonal with my acne acting up, this cleans all the dirt and oil away to reveal very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me, and I&#x27;ve had good luck with other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I certainly was getting my money&#x27;s worth for the size</li>
            <li>yes I DO plan on buying more of this product for future uses.)</li>
            <li>first time using this product and the first day</li>
            <li>At first I assumed it might be because it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see many companies these days infuse face washes with anything besides triclosan and basic soap ingrediants.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry and kind of sensitive, although most skin care products don&#x27;t bother my skin much.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it seems gentle</li>
            <li>I believe those other scrubs are much  more the consitancy or sugar/sea salt scrubs, these beads are large, and I am unsure of the effectiveness of them, but as for the formula I enjoy it a lot, and when your face feels really dingy</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has long been known for their products being great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it smells nice, but other that that....</li>
            <li>But lines are natural, use fruit juice instead of chemicals, small better and will leave you feeling and smelling better than this medicated acne product.itten for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic....</li>
            <li>Iv been using clean and clear which had been working</li>
            <li>microbeads make your skin feel soft, smooth, and gently massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of acne face wash, but this is honestly the first brand and type that has consistently worked for me in eliminating acne.</li>
            <li>It has always been a brand which featured mild, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>you like what Neutragena used to be and are looking for a mild, natural product, I would recommend instead</li>
            <li>If you like what Neutragena used to be and are looking for a mild, natural product, I would recommend instead [[ASIN:B004I5FEEK The Body Shop</li>
            <li>But lines are natural, use fruit juice instead of chemicals, small better and will leave you feeling and smelling better than this medicated acne product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other scrubs, and this is the first that I&#x27;ve gotten results with.</li>
            <li>Every thing seemed normal,and then little pimples(the puss kind) started appearing on my cheeks and chin/jaw line.</li>
            <li>I think this product will work for you if your face is very oily.</li>
            <li>I do still need to use spot treatments if I am really stressed out and break out, so</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset with this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena (and</li>
            <li>i didnt use it since i have whole swolen face...</li>
            <li>I really like this srcub/cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product because I have had oily skin and acne</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It does its job, and that&#x27;s all I can really say for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This can be very traumatizing for them</li>
            <li>This can be very traumatizing for them</li>
            <li>really like this face scrub.  </li>
            <li>It Really Brought My Self Confidence Out</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 stars instead of one because the smell is really uplifting.</li>
            <li>it really does smell like real grapefruit.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and I think the price is very manageable.</li>
            <li>i have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and it really helps get you up in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is not as nice as any other grapefruit product I have used (comparing to Lush, the Body shop, Crabtree and Evelyn).  </li>
            <li>but if I stuck with my original facial scrub (which was cheaper)</li>
            <li>They love this over any other soap they&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this facial wash to be anything special</li>
            <li>Works as expected, but really, really, really smells strongly of grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>If you have average skin and love the smell of grapefruit, this product will serve you well.</li>
            <li>Probably three or four days after I started using the scrub, my acne slowed down and my skin felt clearer and softer, but my skin did feel kind of tight, like I needed to put moisturizer on more frequently than normal.</li>
            <li>The less, the better.</li>
            <li>&amp; I Wasn&#x27;t Getting Any More Black Heads.</li>
            <li>I use it especially during the summer months because those are the months when I sweat the most and my skin becomes oil central.</li>
            <li>Take particular care not get this beady scrub in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with my skin since living in the tropics with high humidity, mold,.</li>

            <li>I highly highly recommend</li>
            <li>Other people have had success with this product, however, so I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li>But had a period of adult acne that presented itself as blackheads and this scrub really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the condition.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face really clean and not too dry.</li>
            <li>The scrub cleansed my skin and kept it normal all day.</li>
            <li>and i said to myself maybe its just normal..</li>
            <li>and she said it was junk (I normally use a prescription face wash</li>
            <li>a gret product.the smell is ok too,am not a big rfan of pink grateful</li>
            <li>I really wish that I had protected my face better but it&#x27;s too late for that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>i used to use the neutrogena oil free acne scrub, so i thought this one would be similar with a different smell.</li>

            <li>My skin has cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li>It has little scrubby beads that easily rinse away.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is not a particular moisturizing product, but I don&#x27;t think that is really what it is aiming at anyway.  </li>
            <li>same active ingredient, nicer smell than most (acne medications).  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t hurt me - it makes me feel fresh - it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Local stores sell inexpensive acne kits so read the reviews and go with one that has positive results FOR ACNE.</li>

            <li>At First My Face Was Getting Dry &amp; Red After Using The Product For The First Two Days</li>
            <li>the beads in this are large also, unlike finer scrubs you may have tried such as ProActive...</li>
            <li>It did clear up my acne and blackheads somewhat</li>
            <li>Could be a fluke or could be the wash, but with having consistently clear skin, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s the wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>But, this product did help clear my acne scars</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t find that it dries out my face too much, but again I only use it once a day</li>

            <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive yet oily skin.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin like I do I would recommend you to not use this product.</li>
            <li>Her 18 year old son has acne and she has shown him how to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old and my skin used to break out....</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>but wow</li>
            <li>I bought this product locally but my experience was SO VERY severe that I thought I would warn others.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult</li>
            <li>I just use a natural moisturizer after and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does help with oil control/reduction in my T-zone and limits acne blemishes near the surface.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but i do have combination skin (i&#x27;m a teenager)</li>
            <li>It seems like it is difficult to find a really good face wash these days.</li>
            <li>Now, if I ever purchase their products again, I will have to go back to reading ingredients and approach it as a brand I do not know, because this was a *huge* departure from all their other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I first started using it, my skin would dry out.</li>
            <li>so if yours is more serious you may need a Acne Kit or even see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>so if yours is more serious you may need a Acne Kit or even see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>You can get this exact same thing from your local grocery store for like 6 bucks .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent my occasional cystic acne breakouts because those are so dee under the skin, but they have seemed to clear up faster while using this product as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency toward more natural products, and am usually skeeved out by skincare products with a long list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky, ONE of these products will eliminate your acne but few of us are seldom that fortunate so a combination of products are usually required then we must sift through a variety of name brands and products in order to find the correct formulation or ingredient that will benefit our skin and the extent of our acne problems.</li>
            <li>I recently broke out during finals week more than a month ago and this would usually take a week to two weeks to clear up completely (even that&#x27;s long, though), but using this scrub</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, particularly people who have sensitive skin, for a once or twice daily facial wash.</li>
            <li>you are asking for major blackhead/acne issues.  </li>
            <li>Although not extremely noticeable, my friend recommended I try this product.</li>
            <li>but this stuff dried my face out from the first wash!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to learn the hard way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to learn the hard way.  </li>
            <li>I also found it a little drying, but that could be because my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I only use Neutrogena&#x27;s facial&#x27;s cleansing formula and have been skeptical to try any other products because I have heard through many articles and friends that using too many products will only harm your skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Stress Control Power Clear Scrub instead of this.</li>
            <li>: Salicylic Acid is drying so you may need a sensitive skin type or use the astringent in your T-zone only, no cheeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry guys to post this kind of review..</li>
            <li>I got this scrub because I wanted to try something new and see if something expensive was better.</li>
            <li>I dont feel like I am washing it with pure glitter (as some other microbead washes feel like).</li>
            <li>had been using the product for about one year and a half without incident but one day, for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s posts about the exact same reaction.</li>
            <li>This is at least worth a shot!</li>
            <li>This scrub really out-performed other scrubs in terms of keeping the number of flare ups and blemishes to a minimum.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily hurt or give me more acne, but it didn&#x27;t help my breakout either which was the whole reason i bought it (stupid right?).</li>
            <li>Great smell and fun to use but terrible for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I usually use it once a day (before bed) and it keeps my skin pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>That said,  I purchased this thinking that I was buying an exfoliating scrub from a brand I knew, thinking I was going to be getting something natural, non-irritating, but with a different scent (that their traditional \\&quot;rainbath\\&quot;),  The description is not inaccurate or misleading.  </li>
            <li>It removes the left over makeup really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and flaky!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very soft, though it does dry it up a bit.</li>
            <li>After I use it my face always feels super clean and refreshed, even slightly exfoliated due to the small microbeads.</li>
            <li>I did have some inital breakouts when first using this product which scarred me a little</li>
            <li>The burning merely increased and it got to the point where I could barely see and the scratchiness from the beads was preventing me from being able to move my eyes to even look side to side.  </li>
            <li>I use on my face for a few minutes as a mask when I&#x27;m in the shower, but with this one, my skin started to feel like it was getting a little but burnt and felt a bit tingly, so I wasn&#x27;t able to keep it on my face for very long.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my skin felt very tight, like I had Botox.</li>
            <li>It is not a common or regular occurence, but if this happens, people generally expect a little sting and then after flushing out the eyes with water, relief should follow.  </li>

            <li> regards to the feel of the product, the microbeads feel refreshing over my skin and the grapefruit smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this product--in fact, we had it on auto-order (until too many began piling up!).  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!</li>
            <li> Its very refreshing and provides nice exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, upon using the scrub once a day, my acne has cleared up amazingly.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good product to soften the skin and better the skin tone...</li>
            <li> The scrubby beads feel nice and eliminate the need to use a wash cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li> and it smells nice</li>
            <li> Effectively cleans my skin without over drying.</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> After using this for three months I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li> and it smells like grapefruit which is really nice.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon and neutrogena :D</li>
            <li> does a nice job at foaming up and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> I think it smells nice though</li>
            <li> It does smell nice through.</li>
            <li> so i gave it three stars, smells nice, and feels nice on my skin too.</li>
            <li> This face scrub smells very very delicious and it works great as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It smells great, cleans great, and helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I liked this facewash because it smelled good, and it felt like my face was clean when I was done washing.</li>
            <li> Also, the grapefruit scent is wild and wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh fruity Grapefruit smell of this product and have found great deals on it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena for the great product and to Amazon for great pricing and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Great scent and overall a great product for the price that it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will clean oily skin (I require a moisturizer afterward) and it smells great; light and fruity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Salicylic Acid procucts have improved MY skin tremendously (acne, wrinkles &amp; scars)!!</li>
            <li> The product also has a really nice smell - I don&#x27;t find it too strong</li>
            <li> Fun isn&#x27;t always good.</li>
            <li> I will preface this review by saying that if you are looking for a medicated scrub, want or are Ok with chemicals, this review may not be meaningful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is better than most acne systems.  </li>
            <li> Again, the description is not misleading, but having purchased Neutrogena for many years, I did not read it, thinking I knew what I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this item..</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> has made my skin look fantastic!</li>
            <li> I leave thinking I can find something better</li>
            <li> and I love the microbeads in it to help scrub all the dirt away.</li>
            <li> I Got this scrub more then a week ago, and i am not using it anymore.</li>
            <li> i wish this scrub would had more scrubby parts.</li>
            <li> I can see how that wouldn&#x27;t appeal to all people, but it is appealing to us.    </li>
            <li> and I was in the sun more</li>
            <li> He has been using it for 2 months now and his acne has gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li> There are 3 of us who absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best facial wash</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be sure which one</li>
            <li> I was then brought to the hospital to make sure there was no permanent injury to my cornea.  </li>
            <li> I use this product 1-2 times a day, mostly at night, and I love it.</li>
            <li> its so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think it would have been A LOT better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than a month</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this face wash drying out people&#x27;s skin, but I decided to try it anyway since the Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve used before have been fantastic and grapefruit itself is scrumptious!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> can you ask more from face wash?</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena grape fruit foaming cream for over a year and really love that product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, if you love your kids do not let them suffer with acne.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, if you love your kids do not let them suffer with acne.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer and eye cream, but things seem to be looking better by the day.  </li>
            <li> I happen to love it.</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure...</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I have adult-onset acne mostly on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I wash with it twice a day, and I will continue to buy it and use it unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> , it feels nice to scrub your face a bit and your face feels really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue using this effective product!</li>
            <li> This really is a great face wash and the salicyclic acid in it acts as an exfoliate, great at getting rid of dead skin cells, and the grapefruit increases the PH of your skin reducing acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a product that is voted year after year the best by allure readers.</li>
            <li> and/ or Lush \\&quot;Happy</li>
            <li> and/ or Lush \\&quot;Happy</li>
            <li> The pink grapefruit is Neutrogena&#x27;s best scent.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 yrs old, pre-menopausal and have always prided myself with taking great care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> (I know, sounds like I&#x27;m exaggerating, but it&#x27;s really true!).</li>
            <li> I love that this scrub smells nice and is gentle, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping my breakouts yet</li>
            <li> I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to grab and go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it off and on for 3+ years but in a real skin situation, there are more effective creams out there.</li>
            <li> For some it is too strong.</li>
            <li> I called Neutrogena and the woman was very nice and said that this is not typical of their product.  </li>
            <li> Once I put on a moisturizer my face felt fine.</li>
            <li> So since I cant pay for a quality scrub this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has a mild formula so it doesn&#x27;t harm your skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li> Overall it worked GREAT for my skin....</li>
            <li> , I find they work the best for controlling breakouts without being too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it leaves my face feeling smooth, oil-free, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s leaves my skin smooth and prevent brake</li>
            <li> I can not stress how important this is to a teenager.n my chin or along my jawline area</li>
            <li> I can not stress how important this is to a teenager.</li>
            <li> and this helps a lot to cotrol it plus it leaves my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> In terms of how good this is as an acne wash, my daughter would be in a better position than I to review it (and I bought a second for her).  </li>
            <li> In terms of how good this is as an acne wash, my daughter would be in a better position than I to review it (and I bought a second for her).  </li>
            <li> It not only smells delicious, but lathers up really well and is not too drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash feels good on my sensitive skin, and I like the fact that it comes infused with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> (and I LOVE the refreshing, grapefruit-y smell), it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I very rarely get breakouts now.</li>
            <li> :) Also, I love the new deal where you can get a discount with Amazon if you place a renewing subscription on the product.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the wash for two days, but my skin just continued to flake; those areas of my skin all feel like they have a mild sunburn on them now, and exfoliating them with a loofa to get rid of the dead skin hasn&#x27;t felt so wonderful after using this scrub.</li>
            <li> However, when I use this regularly it is definitely significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to just use water and a scrub to wash around my nose since it&#x27;s not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> OK first of all, I have no idea how this product has gotten such good ratings on here...</li>
            <li> and I always try to get him to buy something more gentle...</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing, it&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator, and the salicylic acid helps get all the gunk out of your face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and clean</li>
            <li> review is written for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic....</li>
            <li> and then I realize my face is starting to breakout again and find myself back to this awesome scrub/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It was so severe that I needed an ambulance and the paramedics worked quickly and diligently to get the foaming beads out of my eyes--</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with mild acne.  </li>
            <li> Add a super size at an unbeatable price..</li>
            <li> very well.the beads make exfoliating my hair so easy and it massages my face too leaving it</li>
            <li> It smells great and the little bubbles in the scrub help exfoliate and scrub.</li>
            <li> I just did not realize that Neutrogena is now adding chemicals, effectively turning their back on what established the brand.  </li>
            <li> it might be only me that got this problem since u guys have nice review..</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this grapefruit scrub works well for clearing up acne, but feeling like you have a sunburn after using it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> bonus to this scrub is the smell--it smells like fresh grapefruit</li>
            <li> Salicylate acid is crucial in making this an effective acne face wash.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel fresh</li>
            <li> And if you use it in the morning and night everyday then it makes your face feel smooth wich makes you look good.</li>
            <li> grapefuit smell is just right.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> In The Morning &amp; Right</li>
            <li> The smell is also pleasing, due to the citrus scent, which smells really clean and nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not breakout prone, so this works for me, however, it doesn&#x27;t really stand out as anything special.</li>
            <li> It smells good too, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause my skin to dry out as much as it should.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin, I strongly recommend NOT using this product.</li>
            <li> This 6.7 ounce value size is a great deal (I had to pick one up in a hurry at my local Walgreens and paid 10.99 for the same size).</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The scrub leaves my skin super soft and clean after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m not hormonal with my acne acting up, this cleans all the dirt and oil away to reveal very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me, and I&#x27;ve had good luck with other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I certainly was getting my money&#x27;s worth for the size</li>
            <li> yes I DO plan on buying more of this product for future uses.)</li>
            <li> first time using this product and the first day</li>
            <li> At first I assumed it might be because it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see many companies these days infuse face washes with anything besides triclosan and basic soap ingrediants.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry and kind of sensitive, although most skin care products don&#x27;t bother my skin much.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it seems gentle</li>
            <li> I believe those other scrubs are much  more the consitancy or sugar/sea salt scrubs, these beads are large, and I am unsure of the effectiveness of them, but as for the formula I enjoy it a lot, and when your face feels really dingy</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has long been known for their products being great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it smells nice, but other that that....</li>
            <li> But lines are natural, use fruit juice instead of chemicals, small better and will leave you feeling and smelling better than this medicated acne product.itten for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic....</li>
            <li> Iv been using clean and clear which had been working</li>
            <li> microbeads make your skin feel soft, smooth, and gently massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of acne face wash, but this is honestly the first brand and type that has consistently worked for me in eliminating acne.</li>
            <li> It has always been a brand which featured mild, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> you like what Neutragena used to be and are looking for a mild, natural product, I would recommend instead</li>
            <li> If you like what Neutragena used to be and are looking for a mild, natural product, I would recommend instead [[ASIN:B004I5FEEK The Body Shop</li>
            <li> But lines are natural, use fruit juice instead of chemicals, small better and will leave you feeling and smelling better than this medicated acne product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other scrubs, and this is the first that I&#x27;ve gotten results with.</li>
            <li> Every thing seemed normal,and then little pimples(the puss kind) started appearing on my cheeks and chin/jaw line.</li>
            <li> I think this product will work for you if your face is very oily.</li>
            <li> I do still need to use spot treatments if I am really stressed out and break out, so</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset with this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena (and</li>
            <li> i didnt use it since i have whole swolen face...</li>
            <li> I really like this srcub/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product because I have had oily skin and acne</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It does its job, and that&#x27;s all I can really say for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This can be very traumatizing for them</li>
            <li> This can be very traumatizing for them</li>
            <li> really like this face scrub.  </li>
            <li> It Really Brought My Self Confidence Out</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 stars instead of one because the smell is really uplifting.</li>
            <li> it really does smell like real grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and I think the price is very manageable.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and it really helps get you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is not as nice as any other grapefruit product I have used (comparing to Lush, the Body shop, Crabtree and Evelyn).  </li>
            <li> but if I stuck with my original facial scrub (which was cheaper)</li>
            <li> They love this over any other soap they&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this facial wash to be anything special</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but really, really, really smells strongly of grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> If you have average skin and love the smell of grapefruit, this product will serve you well.</li>
            <li> Probably three or four days after I started using the scrub, my acne slowed down and my skin felt clearer and softer, but my skin did feel kind of tight, like I needed to put moisturizer on more frequently than normal.</li>
            <li> The less, the better.</li>
            <li> &amp; I Wasn&#x27;t Getting Any More Black Heads.</li>
            <li> I use it especially during the summer months because those are the months when I sweat the most and my skin becomes oil central.</li>
            <li> Take particular care not get this beady scrub in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my skin since living in the tropics with high humidity, mold,.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for people with combination and oily skin.</li>

            <li> Other people have had success with this product, however, so I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li> But had a period of adult acne that presented itself as blackheads and this scrub really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the condition.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face really clean and not too dry.</li>
            <li> The scrub cleansed my skin and kept it normal all day.</li>
            <li> and i said to myself maybe its just normal..</li>
            <li> and she said it was junk (I normally use a prescription face wash</li>
            <li> a gret product.the smell is ok too,am not a big rfan of pink grateful</li>
            <li> I really wish that I had protected my face better but it&#x27;s too late for that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> i used to use the neutrogena oil free acne scrub, so i thought this one would be similar with a different smell.</li>

            <li> My skin has cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li> It has little scrubby beads that easily rinse away.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not a particular moisturizing product, but I don&#x27;t think that is really what it is aiming at anyway.  </li>
            <li> same active ingredient, nicer smell than most (acne medications).  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t hurt me - it makes me feel fresh - it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Local stores sell inexpensive acne kits so read the reviews and go with one that has positive results FOR ACNE.</li>

            <li> At First My Face Was Getting Dry &amp; Red After Using The Product For The First Two Days</li>
            <li> the beads in this are large also, unlike finer scrubs you may have tried such as ProActive...</li>
            <li> It did clear up my acne and blackheads somewhat</li>
            <li> Could be a fluke or could be the wash, but with having consistently clear skin, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s the wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> But, this product did help clear my acne scars</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t find that it dries out my face too much, but again I only use it once a day</li>

            <li> I recommend this to anyone with sensitive yet oily skin.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin like I do I would recommend you to not use this product.</li>
            <li> Her 18 year old son has acne and she has shown him how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and my skin used to break out....</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> but wow</li>
            <li> I bought this product locally but my experience was SO VERY severe that I thought I would warn others.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult</li>
            <li> I just use a natural moisturizer after and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It does help with oil control/reduction in my T-zone and limits acne blemishes near the surface.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but i do have combination skin (i&#x27;m a teenager)</li>
            <li> It seems like it is difficult to find a really good face wash these days.</li>
            <li> Now, if I ever purchase their products again, I will have to go back to reading ingredients and approach it as a brand I do not know, because this was a *huge* departure from all their other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I first started using it, my skin would dry out.</li>
            <li> so if yours is more serious you may need a Acne Kit or even see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> so if yours is more serious you may need a Acne Kit or even see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> You can get this exact same thing from your local grocery store for like 6 bucks .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent my occasional cystic acne breakouts because those are so dee under the skin, but they have seemed to clear up faster while using this product as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency toward more natural products, and am usually skeeved out by skincare products with a long list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky, ONE of these products will eliminate your acne but few of us are seldom that fortunate so a combination of products are usually required then we must sift through a variety of name brands and products in order to find the correct formulation or ingredient that will benefit our skin and the extent of our acne problems.</li>
            <li> I recently broke out during finals week more than a month ago and this would usually take a week to two weeks to clear up completely (even that&#x27;s long, though), but using this scrub</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, particularly people who have sensitive skin, for a once or twice daily facial wash.</li>
            <li> you are asking for major blackhead/acne issues.  </li>
            <li> Although not extremely noticeable, my friend recommended I try this product.</li>
            <li> but this stuff dried my face out from the first wash!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to learn the hard way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to learn the hard way.  </li>
            <li> I also found it a little drying, but that could be because my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I only use Neutrogena&#x27;s facial&#x27;s cleansing formula and have been skeptical to try any other products because I have heard through many articles and friends that using too many products will only harm your skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Stress Control Power Clear Scrub instead of this.</li>
            <li> : Salicylic Acid is drying so you may need a sensitive skin type or use the astringent in your T-zone only, no cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry guys to post this kind of review..</li>
            <li> I got this scrub because I wanted to try something new and see if something expensive was better.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like I am washing it with pure glitter (as some other microbead washes feel like).</li>
            <li> had been using the product for about one year and a half without incident but one day, for the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s posts about the exact same reaction.</li>
            <li> This is at least worth a shot!</li>
            <li> This scrub really out-performed other scrubs in terms of keeping the number of flare ups and blemishes to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily hurt or give me more acne, but it didn&#x27;t help my breakout either which was the whole reason i bought it (stupid right?).</li>
            <li> Great smell and fun to use but terrible for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it once a day (before bed) and it keeps my skin pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> That said,  I purchased this thinking that I was buying an exfoliating scrub from a brand I knew, thinking I was going to be getting something natural, non-irritating, but with a different scent (that their traditional \\&quot;rainbath\\&quot;),  The description is not inaccurate or misleading.  </li>
            <li> It removes the left over makeup really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and flaky!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very soft, though it does dry it up a bit.</li>
            <li> After I use it my face always feels super clean and refreshed, even slightly exfoliated due to the small microbeads.</li>
            <li> I did have some inital breakouts when first using this product which scarred me a little</li>
            <li> The burning merely increased and it got to the point where I could barely see and the scratchiness from the beads was preventing me from being able to move my eyes to even look side to side.  </li>
            <li> I use on my face for a few minutes as a mask when I&#x27;m in the shower, but with this one, my skin started to feel like it was getting a little but burnt and felt a bit tingly, so I wasn&#x27;t able to keep it on my face for very long.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my skin felt very tight, like I had Botox.</li>
            <li> It is not a common or regular occurence, but if this happens, people generally expect a little sting and then after flushing out the eyes with water, relief should follow.  </li>
            <li> For over a week, I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Wash twice daily or the Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Foaming Scrub every other day and the Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent all containing Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> i have also developed allergies and chemical sensitivities due to ambient biotoxins (and treatment for same).  </li>
            <li> eyes become so small because of my both eyelid become swollen and my whole face is so itchy...</li>
            <li> It dries out my skin, making my moisturizer not work as much as it has in the past at all.</li>
            <li> Although, not being breakout prone, I can usually use just about anything and it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I always buy natural products, avoiding harsh chemicals whenever possible (and it is always possible).  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Target for $7.99, which is a little bit more expensive than I usually go for, but I thought that it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin is severely irritated now, 36 hours after the last use, and I have severely dry, itchy skin that flaking and peeling.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin too much, but I try not to rub my dry-prone areas too hard with this scrub, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> this scrub left my skin so dry!</li>
            <li> This scrub made my skin VERY dry around my nose, upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> However, I would suggest not to leave it on too long because it will irritate the skin...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> and it took me forever to find a product that balanced out my skin and kept me oil-free all day long.</li>
            <li> but i dont mind as long as it controls my breakout</li>
            <li> They explained that the harder I tried to get the product out of my eyes, the further under the lid the crystals became lodged--and</li>
            <li> , I feel that might give you wrinkles, or just all around hurt your face in the long run.</li>
            <li> i usually dont have problems with my skin when i try new products.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this product will give you dry skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it will dry your skin out if you don&#x27;t moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.  </li>
            <li> I thought with my age, that the product would dry my skin out, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> the oily parts of my skin started to peel, it made my face so dry.</li>
            <li> And then the next day my upper eyelids started swelling up, my face continued to hurt and felt extremely dry, and my eyes were all dried out.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every single morning.</li>
            <li> product contains Salicylic Acid in roughly the same proportion as other acne systems.  </li>
            <li> When I buckled down and decided to use a single set of products religiously morning and evening, I picked up the Neutrogena grapefruit wash (morning), scrub (evening) and assorted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels very dry, too dry</li>
            <li> so I purchased the Salicylic Acid - Neutrogena Body Acne Body Spray and an ANTIBACTERIAL body wash (any antibacterial wash will do) and his back acne is almost gone in less than a week.</li>
            <li> My skin has always tended to be on the oily side but have, over the past few years, taken creams, anti-aging products really well.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have used prescription benzoyl peroxide products to control acne breakouts; however, I found that they dried up my skin too much (and in some cases, even caused my skin to peel), so I began looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft without being dried out and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After I saw other people&#x27;s same reactions, I calmed down a bit and am hoping it will go away.</li>
            <li> It has definitely cleared up my acne a little bit.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll update as needed over the next few weeks.</li>

            <li> Pink Grapefruit Shower Gel Jumbo - 25.3 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> Although I still have a few spots left, my face cleared up dramatically.</li>
            <li> The scrub is not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I turn to this, use 3 times a week, or I reach for it every 3 days, because this is the renewel time of the skin, so this helps get rid of those dead skin cells, but you dont want to be abrasive to your skin constantly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry at all and a little bit lathers up to go a long way</li>
            <li> For others, maybe not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have serious acne, just some white heads and the occasional cystic pimple on my chin or along my jawline area</li>
            <li> The paramedics had to lay me down on my back and gently pour cold water from the inner corner to flush my eyes out--one eye at a time with my head turned to the side.  </li>
            <li> Neurtrogena is almost synonymous with hypo-allergenic, at least among the major dsrug store brands.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> get monthly breakouts due to the hormones and this has reduced my breakouts</li>
            <li> Maybe for people who have EXTREMELY oily skin would appreciate it but other than that</li>
            <li> I ended up going back to buy his usual apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> But now, about a week after having started using it, the corners of my nose, my nose itself, and my chin have all started to become dry and flake a little bit.</li>
            <li> Be very careful if you insist on using this product...</li>
            <li> Be very careful if you insist on using this product...</li>
            <li> It is suggested by beauty magazine not to use such a scrub everyday, because this is harsh for your skin...</li>
            <li> I have the \\&quot;raccoon look\\&quot; similar to after a bad sunburn, with only the skin around my eyes being normal color.  </li>
            <li> Totally not worth the price .</li>
            <li> , I accidentally got some in my eyes--it rinsed down from my forehead in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure yet, depends how my skin reacts after a long time of use!</li>
            <li> I use it daily, usually 2-3 times!</li>
            <li> But like the other reviewer I must say that this product is no better for my skin than any other.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing an unnaturally uncomfortable situation, and it actually hurts to talk or move my facial muscles in any way.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE on December 11, 2014: I few months ago I read the very bad news that plastic microbeads - the kind in this face wash - are turning up in our rivers and lakes.</li>
            <li> I also like the little beads that are in the face wash</li>
            <li> i got little irrition</li>
            <li> a little bit of product may get in one&#x27;s eyes.  </li>
            <li> And this price is a little pricey for a cleanser.</li>
            <li> but the beads are a little harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now</li>
            <li> a few minutes whiles</li>
            <li> but after a few days it cleared up.</li>
            <li> I also get cystic acne every few months, and I&#x27;ve yet to have one occur since I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate beads also even out your skin tone and remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this twice a day everyday about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> My acne has not magically gone away.</li>
            <li> , i feel so sorry to my son that i couldnt get outside with... :</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to wash around the eyes for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I usually leave every type of face wash</li>
            <li> I called Neutrogena to get my money back, but they cannot pay me for my pain and suffering, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> but he is a lazy teenager and uses it after his nightly shower only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think at some point you grow out of getting small zits,</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I discovered this product and after using it 1-2 times a day for the past year, it has worked wonders at preventing acne without making my skin feel overly tight/dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry for my part in the problem, and I immediately discontinued use of this product and discarded it (in its packaging so at least the beads won&#x27;t run wild in the waste stream).</li>
            <li> ready to stop breaking out like a teenager :(</li>
            <li> , when i wakeup, i was hardly to see.</li>
            <li> but i dont wanna be so rude to people</li>
            <li> My friend is in her late 30&#x27;s and has oily skin</li>
            <li> I gave this one a try and after only one time use, It broke me out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I kept moisturizing, thinking it was because it was cold and windy outside.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it does not work well at reducing existing acne (at least in my case).</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out and the worse part is</li>
            <li> I feel like my eyes are just slowly going to swell shut.</li>
            <li> But they left my face in a bad condition.</li>
            <li> how hard I tried it always somehow got up there!</li>
            <li> Me saying I have bad acne is an understatement, and the constant sand storms just makes it worse.</li>
            <li> so it lasts at least a couple of months!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my pores and acne have decreased since using this scrub.</li>
            <li> Really helpful in keeping a tab on those nasty breakouts.</li>
            <li> Maybe some skin types don&#x27;t, like mine, and I was tired of it.  </li>
            <li> it burned very badly, and I would not recommend for someone with sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I even found some dry oatches around my nose :(  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product used it 3 times and now my face is itching so bad, burning feeling, eyes hurting, small bumps and burn marks on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so irritating!  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> so sad and embarrass to going out .</li>
            <li> your eyesight is at risk if things go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> There are antibiotics and prescription strength products that are not that expensive.</li>
            <li> There are antibiotics and prescription strength products that are not that expensive.</li>
            <li> boy, was i wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to wear make-up because that just makes the flaking worse.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going blind.  </li>
            <li> --I had to use artificial tears to moisten my eyes and the surrounding skin itched like hell.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very disappointing product with awful and painful results.</li>
            <li> However, the beads always went up my nose for an unpleasant feeling, and it seemed no matter</li>
            <li> It has been a terrifying and painful experience to say the least.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to others who have bad acne.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t get this in Trinidad .</li>
            <li> Nearly As Bad</li>
            <li> winkles and I get clogged pores along my jawline which result in whiteheads and painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li> , :(&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Some folks hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST product ever.  </li>
            <li> I am so miserable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible breakouts or sensitivity or anything, but my persistent problem areas are still persisting in being problematic.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awful!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smell and fun to use but terrible for my skin.  It&#x27;s so irritating!  Fun isn&#x27;t always good.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good product to soften the skin and better the skin tone...However, I would suggest not to leave it on too long because it will irritate the skin...Overall it worked GREAT for my skin....</li>
            <li> I love the fresh fruity Grapefruit smell of this product and have found great deals on it here on Amazon.  Both my husband and I use this product--in fact, we had it on auto-order (until too many began piling up!).  Be aware that this is not a particular moisturizing product, but I don&#x27;t think that is really what it is aiming at anyway.  The scrubby beads feel nice and eliminate the need to use a wash cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I love that this scrub smells nice and is gentle, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping my breakouts yet hence the 4 stars. I haven&#x27;t had it long so I&#x27;ll update as needed over the next few weeks. The price is right and it seems gentle so I am relatively happy, but ready to stop breaking out like a teenager :(</li>
            <li> I bought the Neutrogena wash because I kept seeing it on TV and it was 6.7oz and on sale. I have combination skin so I used it wash my T-zone. The first time I used it, my skin felt very tight, like I had Botox. Once I put on a moisturizer my face felt fine. I switched to washing once a day and I still feel that tightness everytime. I even found some dry oatches around my nose :(  I think this product will work for you if your face is very oily. Otherwise, this product will give you dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for over 6 months now and I like it quite a bit.  I usually use it once a day (before bed) and it keeps my skin pretty clear.  I find that some face washes will make my break out but not this one, I didn&#x27;t even have a problem when I switched over to it.  I do still need to use spot treatments if I am really stressed out and break out, so this isn&#x27;t the only product you need to keep acne 100% under control.    The product also has a really nice smell - I don&#x27;t find it too strong but I see how some people might, especially if you like unscented products.  I also like the little beads that are in the face wash, it feels nice to scrub your face a bit and your face feels really clean afterwards.  I also don&#x27;t find that it dries out my face too much, but again I only use it once a day so maybe with increased frequency it would.  I also use face cream before bed and in the morning to keep my skin moisturized.  I really like Neutrogena products, I find they work the best for controlling breakouts without being too harsh on my skin.  If you don&#x27;t mind scented products, I recommend giving this one a try!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has long been known for their products being great on sensitive skin. This is one of those times. After I use it my face always feels super clean and refreshed, even slightly exfoliated due to the small microbeads. It has definitely cleared up my acne a little bit. This is by no means a prescription medication. My acne has not magically gone away. However, when I use this regularly it is definitely significantly reduced. The smell is also pleasing, due to the citrus scent, which smells really clean and nice.  I would recommend this to anyone, particularly people who have sensitive skin, for a once or twice daily facial wash.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products and I like this scrub, but in my experience it&#x27;s just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will clean oily skin (I require a moisturizer afterward) and it smells great; light and fruity.  But had a period of adult acne that presented itself as blackheads and this scrub really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the condition.  I&#x27;ve used it off and on for 3+ years but in a real skin situation, there are more effective creams out there.</li>
            <li> I will preface this review by saying that if you are looking for a medicated scrub, want or are Ok with chemicals, this review may not be meaningful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this thinking I knew the brand.  Neurtrogena is almost synonymous with hypo-allergenic, at least among the major dsrug store brands.  It has always been a brand which featured mild, natural ingredients.  That said,  I purchased this thinking that I was buying an exfoliating scrub from a brand I knew, thinking I was going to be getting something natural, non-irritating, but with a different scent (that their traditional \\&quot;rainbath\\&quot;),  The description is not inaccurate or misleading.  i just had not looked because of extensive experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Salicylic Acid in roughly the same proportion as other acne systems.  This is not what I was looking for.  If you are, maybe you have found what you want: same active ingredient, nicer smell than most (acne medications).  I just did not realize that Neutrogena is now adding chemicals, effectively turning their back on what established the brand.  Now, if I ever purchase their products again, I will have to go back to reading ingredients and approach it as a brand I do not know, because this was a *huge* departure from all their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is better than most acne systems.  It is not as nice as any other grapefruit product I have used (comparing to Lush, the Body shop, Crabtree and Evelyn).  I have had issues with my skin since living in the tropics with high humidity, mold,. ambient staph.  i have also developed allergies and chemical sensitivities due to ambient biotoxins (and treatment for same).  I always buy natural products, avoiding harsh chemicals whenever possible (and it is always possible).  I thought I knew what I was getting from Neutrogena.  Again, the description is not misleading, but having purchased Neutrogena for many years, I did not read it, thinking I knew what I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is written for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic.... in this case it does not.  In terms of how good this is as an acne wash, my daughter would be in a better position than I to review it (and I bought a second for her).  She is, however, also avoiding products with chemicals, including Salicylic Acid.  Believe it or not, her skin has been better using natural products which maintain your natural defense (my dermatologist warned that things which overdry create small tears, creating an opportunity for infection).  Everyone&#x27;s needs are different, so if you are looking for a chemical, medicated product this may work for you.  I go out of my way to avoid same, and thought I knew what I was getting from the brand.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like what Neutragena used to be and are looking for a mild, natural product, I would recommend instead [[ASIN:B004I5FEEK The Body Shop Pink Grapefruit Shower Gel Jumbo - 25.3 fl oz]] and/ or Lush \\&quot;Happy Hippy\\&quot; (which for some reason I can not link, though I have seen Lush products on site).  But lines are natural, use fruit juice instead of chemicals, small better and will leave you feeling and smelling better than this medicated acne product.itten for those, who like myself, think they know the brand and that it means mild, hypo-allergenic.... in this case it does not.

            <li> I have really oily skin and it took me forever to find a product that balanced out my skin and kept me oil-free all day long. I decided to try this one, and I loved it! The scrub cleansed my skin and kept it normal all day. I use it especially during the summer months because those are the months when I sweat the most and my skin becomes oil central. I recommend this to anyone with sensitive yet oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset with this product. I used it on my face for 4-5 days(twice a day). Every thing seemed normal,and then little pimples(the puss kind) started appearing on my cheeks and chin/jaw line. They din&#x27;t seem to stop. I immediately stopped using the product. The pimples dint stop at all. Its been 2 weeks now! The pimples finally stopped coming. But they left my face in a bad condition. I never had pimples like these (at this rate) before. For people with sensitive skin, I strongly recommend NOT using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial scrub when I went home on R&amp;R from Iraq. Me saying I have bad acne is an understatement, and the constant sand storms just makes it worse. HOWEVER, upon using the scrub once a day, my acne has cleared up amazingly. Although I still have a few spots left, my face cleared up dramatically. I do recommend this to others who have bad acne. I&#x27;ve tried many other scrubs, and this is the first that I&#x27;ve gotten results with. Not to mention it leaves my face feeling smooth, oil-free, and comfortable. Thanks Neutrogena (and yes I DO plan on buying more of this product for future uses.)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and I LOVE it! It has the best smell that stays on you even after you&#x27;ve washed your face. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry at all and a little bit lathers up to go a long way so it lasts at least a couple of months! This really is a great face wash and the salicyclic acid in it acts as an exfoliate, great at getting rid of dead skin cells, and the grapefruit increases the PH of your skin reducing acne flare ups. Great all around product for your face!</li>
            <li> The product is great- it works well with my skin and it smells nice :) Also, I love the new deal where you can get a discount with Amazon if you place a renewing subscription on the product.  It saved me a couple bucks every time with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry guys to post this kind of review..but i dont wanna be so rude to people love this item..&lt;br /&gt;guys im also neutrogena fan ever..&lt;br /&gt;but first time using this product and the first day i got little irrition and i said to myself maybe its just normal.. but in second day i used it., when i wakeup, i was hardly to see., :(&lt;br /&gt;my eyes become so small because of my both eyelid become swollen and my whole face is so itchy... i cant stop iching it.. i cant help myself., i dont know what to do..&lt;br /&gt;today i didnt use it since i have whole swolen face... it might be only me that got this problem since u guys have nice review..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please somebody can advice me what to do please?&lt;br /&gt;im so sad and embarrass to going out ., i feel so sorry to my son that i couldnt get outside with... :((((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for reading y review and hoping for some advice since its stil second day of swolen.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. It not only smells delicious, but lathers up really well and is not too drying on my skin. I can feel the microspheres exfoliating my skin and I have to say that my pores and acne have decreased since using this scrub. Another plus about this is that this product is gently enough to use daily. This 6.7 ounce value size is a great deal (I had to pick one up in a hurry at my local Walgreens and paid 10.99 for the same size). I will absolutely continue using this effective product!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! I have a Clarisonic and this works great with it! My skin feels soft without being dried out and a little bit goes a long way! I have oily, acne-prone skin and this scrub has made my skin look fantastic! I very rarely get breakouts now. This is at least worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I really like this srcub/cleanser.  I have used it for almost 2 years now.  I leave thinking I can find something better and then I realize my face is starting to breakout again and find myself back to this awesome scrub/cleanser.  I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews with 1 or 2 stars complaining about this cleanser drying out skin.  Yes, it will dry your skin out if you don&#x27;t moisturizer afterwards.  You should always moisturizer after cleansing otherwise you are asking for major blackhead/acne issues.  So end result, great cleanser/scrub, just need to moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> i got it over three weeks ago and i like it a lot.i find that foaming my face with it and leaving it on my face a few minutes whiles i brush my teeth or do something before finally6 rinsing it off works better.i get monthly breakouts due to the hormones and this has reduced my breakouts very well.the beads make exfoliating my hair so easy and it massages my face too leaving it so smooth.overall a gret product.the smell is ok too,am not a big rfan of pink grateful but i dont mind as long as it controls my breakout</li>
            <li> I purchased this product used it 3 times and now my face is itching so bad, burning feeling, eyes hurting, small bumps and burn marks on my eyelids.  This is the WORST product ever.  Please DO NOT use this product.  I am so miserable. 12/16/14</li>
            <li> This product smells great and I love the microbeads in it to help scrub all the dirt away. It did clear up my acne and blackheads somewhat but if you have sensitive skin like I do I would recommend you to not use this product. It dried my skin out and the worse part is my face would turn red and it felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I Got this scrub more then a week ago, and i am not using it anymore. This scrub made my skin VERY dry around my nose, upper lip and chin. My skin was ( still is ) pealing!&lt;br /&gt;And i usually dont have problems with my skin when i try new products.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells nice, but other that that....&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this wasnt the product i needed for my occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;And i wish this scrub would had more scrubby parts.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scrub because it smells like hops to him (he&#x27;s a homebrewer). I can see how that wouldn&#x27;t appeal to all people, but it is appealing to us.    But like the other reviewer I must say that this product is no better for my skin than any other. I don&#x27;t have terrible breakouts or sensitivity or anything, but my persistent problem areas are still persisting in being problematic.     If you have average skin and love the smell of grapefruit, this product will serve you well.</li>
            <li> The pink grapefruit is Neutrogena&#x27;s best scent.  The scrub is not too rough on the skin. I use it both with and without a wash cloth. It has little scrubby beads that easily rinse away. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and clean.  Smells good too.  Buy from Amazon and save $$$ on this two pack.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because I have had oily skin and acne prone skin growing up. It goes well with the peel I use and it keeps my acne away. I did have some inital breakouts when first using this product which scarred me a little but after a few days it cleared up. Good product!</li>
            <li> OK first of all, I have no idea how this product has gotten such good ratings on here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states on the label that you should use it twice a day but this stuff dried my face out from the first wash! At first I assumed it might be because it&#x27;s summer and I was in the sun more but it&#x27;s definitely not that. I haven&#x27;t been legitimately out in the sun for a while and this stuff burns and makes me feel like I have sun burn ALL DAY. It smells pretty good, but it&#x27;s not worth it. Maybe for people who have EXTREMELY oily skin would appreciate it but other than that, I would not recommend this item EVER. It&#x27;s made my face flake and chap, my lips sore and chapped, and it burns to even put lotion on after. It&#x27;s impossible to wear make-up because that just makes the flaking worse. Overall a very disappointing product with awful and painful results.</li>
            <li> I have a combined skin, and I NEVER had an allergy for ANY skin product I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve bought olay, cleanclear, etc. in Walmart. And I&#x27;ve also bought some brand like clinique, EsteeLauder, Dior, etc. in a department store. NONE of them ever gave me allergy. But this one gave me redness, puffy, itches...and my skin feels very dry, too dry, my skin peels off after I used them. Becareful before you buy it! (I&#x27;m international student, please ignore if I made any mistake,thanks!)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  All over my forehead and jaw line I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of blemishes since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t smell very good. To me, it smells like a combination of celery and body odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product from Neutrogena for 2 years.  I have combination skin and I am 48.  It works wonderfully.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.  My friend is in her late 30&#x27;s and has oily skin and I suggested she use it because she was telling me she cannot find anything to use on her face.  It is working great for her.  Her 18 year old son has acne and she has shown him how to use it.  He has been using it for 2 months now and his acne has gotten significantly better. (His doctor is amazed. The prescription he has didn&#x27;t work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with any type of skin from combination to acne.  There are 3 of us who absolutely love it.  We have the subscription to the Neutrogena Scrub.</li>
            <li> UPDATE on December 11, 2014: I few months ago I read the very bad news that plastic microbeads - the kind in this face wash - are turning up in our rivers and lakes. Search for reports on plastic microbead pollution for details. I&#x27;m very sorry for my part in the problem, and I immediately discontinued use of this product and discarded it (in its packaging so at least the beads won&#x27;t run wild in the waste stream). I now use facial cleansers that don&#x27;t contain plastic microbeads.</li>
            <li> If you like this product then this is a great deal, if you sign up for the subscribe and save it is an awesome deal!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Effectively cleans my skin without over drying. Leaves no residue and the beads gently exfoliate dead skin to reveal a glowing complexion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and my skin used to break out....all the time! It seems no matter what I did, I&#x27;d break out.  I use this scrub every single morning. Not only does it help control my breakouts and oily skin, it gives me such a refreashing feeling in the morning.  Helps me wake up. I dont&#x27; think I&#x27;ll ever switch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this. So amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I can see the difference in one wash no exaggeration. Micro beads made my back heads disappear like wow. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this facial wash to be anything special but wow it&#x27;s best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended! I also use Neutrogena 3in1 acne lotion afterwards. Can&#x27;t be sure which one but my face looks brighter too.</li>
            <li> I only use Neutrogena&#x27;s facial&#x27;s cleansing formula and have been skeptical to try any other products because I have heard through many articles and friends that using too many products will only harm your skin. The less, the better. However, I sometimes have whiteheads around my nose. Although not extremely noticeable, my friend recommended I try this product. I was originally going to just use water and a scrub to wash around my nose since it&#x27;s not as noticeable. However, after I tried this product, I have noticed a difference. I love this product and it has a mild formula so it doesn&#x27;t harm your skin. It smells great and the little bubbles in the scrub help exfoliate and scrub. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this facewash because it smelled good, and it felt like my face was clean when I was done washing. However, the beads always went up my nose for an unpleasant feeling, and it seemed no matter how hard I tried it always somehow got up there! It is also difficult to wash around the eyes for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Great product. Feels good when using it, and does help control acne break outs.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but really, really, really smells strongly of grapefruit.  If you don&#x27;t like that scent, then purchase a different one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product locally but my experience was SO VERY severe that I thought I would warn others.  I am an adult and obviously I&#x27;ve been washing my face my entire life,  so it is fair to say I know how to do it.  Every now and then when we as people shower, wash our face or hair a little bit of product may get in one&#x27;s eyes.  It is not a common or regular occurence, but if this happens, people generally expect a little sting and then after flushing out the eyes with water, relief should follow.  That was NOT my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the product for about one year and a half without incident but one day, for the first time, I accidentally got some in my eyes--it rinsed down from my forehead in the shower.  My eyes began burning so I tried to rinse them using the shower.  The burning merely increased and it got to the point where I could barely see and the scratchiness from the beads was preventing me from being able to move my eyes to even look side to side.  The beads would NOT rinse out and were lodged under my lids.  I was afraid I was going blind.  It was so severe that I needed an ambulance and the paramedics worked quickly and diligently to get the foaming beads out of my eyes--foam was leaking from my eyes--I literally could not see.  I was then brought to the hospital to make sure there was no permanent injury to my cornea.  The chemicals in the face cleanser made it so that my eyes would not produce tears for 2 weeks--I had to use artificial tears to moisten my eyes and the surrounding skin itched like hell.  Thankfully, I suffered no permanent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this stuff gets into your eyes, DO NOT splash in the sink and DO NOT try to flush it out in the shower.  It could lodge the beads under your lids (like it did to me).  The paramedics had to lay me down on my back and gently pour cold water from the inner corner to flush my eyes out--one eye at a time with my head turned to the side.  They explained that the harder I tried to get the product out of my eyes, the further under the lid the crystals became lodged--and the salicylic acid made it a burning nightmare.  I could have gotten any product in my eyes, but this product will NOT dissolve and exit your eyes easily without assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bizarre accident, but a lesson I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to learn the hard way.  Be very careful if you insist on using this product...your eyesight is at risk if things go wrong.o get the product out of my eyes, the further under the lid the crystals became lodged--and the salicylic acid made it a burning nightmare.

            <li> I use this product 1-2 times a day, mostly at night, and I love it. When I&#x27;m not hormonal with my acne acting up, this cleans all the dirt and oil away to reveal very smooth skin. I just use a natural moisturizer after and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li> It is suggested by beauty magazine not to use such a scrub everyday, because this is harsh for your skin... the beads in this are large also, unlike finer scrubs you may have tried such as ProActive... I believe those other scrubs are much  more the consitancy or sugar/sea salt scrubs, these beads are large, and I am unsure of the effectiveness of them, but as for the formula I enjoy it a lot, and when your face feels really dingy I turn to this, use 3 times a week, or I reach for it every 3 days, because this is the renewel time of the skin, so this helps get rid of those dead skin cells, but you dont want to be abrasive to your skin constantly, I feel that might give you wrinkles, or just all around hurt your face in the long run. So since I cant pay for a quality scrub this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> Feels great after washing face. its so refreshing. takes out all stress. Also the scrubbing particles exfoliates the skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> I got this scrub because I wanted to try something new and see if something expensive was better. I bought this at Target for $7.99, which is a little bit more expensive than I usually go for, but I thought that it would be worth it. I was wrong. After using this for three months I can honestly say that it hasn&#x27;t helped at all. It dries out my skin, making my moisturizer not work as much as it has in the past at all. Of course, if I hadn&#x27;t used anything at my breakouts would have been twice as hideous but if I stuck with my original facial scrub (which was cheaper) I think it would have been A LOT better. I recently broke out during finals week more than a month ago and this would usually take a week to two weeks to clear up completely (even that&#x27;s long, though), but using this scrub I STILL HAVE THE EXACT SAME BREAKOUT. It&#x27;s been more than a month and my face hasn&#x27;t cleared up. I would definitely recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Stress Control Power Clear Scrub instead of this. Although, I&#x27;d probably recommend getting this in stores than online since it&#x27;s only $5.99 at Target.</li>
            <li> This product is great for acne prone skin and the smell is amazing. Too bad I can&#x27;t get this in Trinidad .</li>
            <li> Iv been using clean and clear which had been working but I wanted to try something else that a bunch of people used and iv been using it for about a week now and I think it is making me break out especially on my forehead .... Any ideas?</li>
            <li> Best face wash you can buy.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this face wash drying out people&#x27;s skin, but I decided to try it anyway since the Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve used before have been fantastic and grapefruit itself is scrumptious! The scrub itself is very nice, it&#x27;s not too aggressive and has a nice scent. I usually leave every type of face wash I use on my face for a few minutes as a mask when I&#x27;m in the shower, but with this one, my skin started to feel like it was getting a little but burnt and felt a bit tingly, so I wasn&#x27;t able to keep it on my face for very long. Probably three or four days after I started using the scrub, my acne slowed down and my skin felt clearer and softer, but my skin did feel kind of tight, like I needed to put moisturizer on more frequently than normal. But now, about a week after having started using it, the corners of my nose, my nose itself, and my chin have all started to become dry and flake a little bit. I stopped using the wash for two days, but my skin just continued to flake; those areas of my skin all feel like they have a mild sunburn on them now, and exfoliating them with a loofa to get rid of the dead skin hasn&#x27;t felt so wonderful after using this scrub. Bottom line: this grapefruit scrub works well for clearing up acne, but feeling like you have a sunburn after using it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughters use this and it works great.  They love this over any other soap they&#x27;ve used.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency toward more natural products, and am usually skeeved out by skincare products with a long list of ingredients. That being said, this cleanser works so well, that I&#x27;m willing to look past that. It smells great, cleans great, and helps keep my skin clear. A winner.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife; she loves it. She uses it regularly and it smoothes her skin. Thanks Neutrogena for the great product and to Amazon for great pricing and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of acne face wash, but this is honestly the first brand and type that has consistently worked for me in eliminating acne. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts on my forehead, neck, and chin area, and since I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, I&#x27;ve had about four pimples total (I know, sounds like I&#x27;m exaggerating, but it&#x27;s really true!). I also get cystic acne every few months, and I&#x27;ve yet to have one occur since I&#x27;ve used it. Could be a fluke or could be the wash, but with having consistently clear skin, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads make your skin feel soft, smooth, and gently massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus to this scrub is the smell--it smells like fresh grapefruit and I love it.</li>
            <li> Its great! My skin feels fresh and clean but when I first started using it, my skin would dry out.</li>
            <li> just as you would expect!</li>
            <li> Great scent wakes you up in the morning.  Salicylate acid is crucial in making this an effective acne face wash.  Exfoliate beads also even out your skin tone and remove dead skin. Great product for the price. Highly recommend this product for people with combination and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it as my daily cleanser for over a year now and my skin has never looked better. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed every day.</li>
            <li> I have a combination-acne skin and this face wash seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;I been using this product for over 2 years now and didn&#x27;t find something better.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s leaves my skin smooth and prevent brake outs.&lt;br /&gt;What can you ask more from face wash?</li>
            <li> I used this cleanser a total of 4 times (2 days, once in morning, once in evening) and by the last time I used it, my face felt like it was on fire.  I have the \\&quot;raccoon look\\&quot; similar to after a bad sunburn, with only the skin around my eyes being normal color.  My skin is severely irritated now, 36 hours after the last use, and I have severely dry, itchy skin that flaking and peeling.  I called Neutrogena to get my money back, but they cannot pay me for my pain and suffering, unfortunately.  I am experiencing an unnaturally uncomfortable situation, and it actually hurts to talk or move my facial muscles in any way.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a two pack at Target for my husband and myself. My skin is normal to dry and kind of sensitive, although most skin care products don&#x27;t bother my skin much. I&#x27;m not breakout prone, so this works for me, however, it doesn&#x27;t really stand out as anything special. Although, not being breakout prone, I can usually use just about anything and it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. It does its job, and that&#x27;s all I can really say for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, my husband has oily, breakout prone skin and this just exacerbated the problem. I ended up going back to buy his usual apricot scrub. He swears by it and I always try to get him to buy something more gentle...but it works for him, why get involved? This is a man who only uses one product, if any. I expected more from a product that is voted year after year the best by allure readers.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena grape fruit foaming cream for over a year and really love that product. Last week, I just wanna look for a different product for substitution because I think my skin is so used to the foaming cream and the it wasn&#x27;t affective anymore. I gave this one a try and after only one time use, It broke me out like crazy. I had 3 big breakout in just 1 night. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe this just dried out my skin too much. And this price is a little pricey for a cleanser. Gonna go back to my foaming cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product contains Salicylic Acid which uncloggs pores, improves wrinkles (yep!) and helps with the fading of acne &amp; sun damage scars. I&#x27;m 46 and I have combination skin (oily in T-Zone), winkles and I get clogged pores along my jawline which result in whiteheads and painful cystic acne. For over a week, I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Wash twice daily or the Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Foaming Scrub every other day and the Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent all containing Salicylic Acid. I also use a mask containing sulphur on my chin and along my jaw line to help prevent cystic breakouts. If you are lucky, ONE of these products will eliminate your acne but few of us are seldom that fortunate so a combination of products are usually required then we must sift through a variety of name brands and products in order to find the correct formulation or ingredient that will benefit our skin and the extent of our acne problems. Also, the grapefruit scent is wild and wonderful. Often, I&#x27;ve considered using it as a body wash and I probably would if the scent lingered but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Salicylic Acid procucts have improved MY skin tremendously (acne, wrinkles &amp; scars)!! I also apply the astringent to the backs of my arms because I have always had hundreds of tiny pimples there. In less than a week my arms are now soft, smooth and NO PIMPLES!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage son has back acne so I purchased the Salicylic Acid - Neutrogena Body Acne Body Spray and an ANTIBACTERIAL body wash (any antibacterial wash will do) and his back acne is almost gone in less than a week. He should have used the body spray twice daily and the acne would probably be gone by now but he is a lazy teenager and uses it after his nightly shower only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Salicylic Acid is drying so you may need a sensitive skin type or use the astringent in your T-zone only, no cheeks. I do NOT have serious acne, just some white heads and the occasional cystic pimple on my chin or along my jawline area so if yours is more serious you may need a Acne Kit or even see a dermatologist. Local stores sell inexpensive acne kits so read the reviews and go with one that has positive results FOR ACNE. Water consumption also makes a difference by keeping toxins flushed out of the body. Be aware, extra nourishment and moisture is needed when treating wrinkles preferably those that increase collagen. I also use Neutrogena Age Shield Face Oil-Free Sunscreen and I love it. My son&#x27;s on a Majors Travel Baseball Team and he plays for his High School Baseball Team as well so I am at the ball field a LOT!! I really wish that I had protected my face better but it&#x27;s too late for that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you love your kids do not let them suffer with acne. This can be very traumatizing for them so if an over-the-counter kit or product doesn&#x27;t work -- seek medical advice! There are antibiotics and prescription strength products that are not that expensive.

            <li> I used this product for two days, twice a day as recommended. By the second day, my face felt like it was burning, like my face was sunburnt. I kept moisturizing, thinking it was because it was cold and windy outside. And then the next day my upper eyelids started swelling up, my face continued to hurt and felt extremely dry, and my eyes were all dried out. Now, my lower eyelids are swollen too. I feel like my eyes are just slowly going to swell shut. I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s posts about the exact same reaction. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything so I was quite terrified when this started happening. I didn&#x27;t know what it was and didn&#x27;t think it was the scrub since I couldn&#x27;t rationalize why my eyes would swell up from using a facial soap. After I saw other people&#x27;s same reactions, I calmed down a bit and am hoping it will go away. I will never ever use Neutrogena product again. It has been a terrifying and painful experience to say the least.</li>
            <li> I started using this twice a day everyday about a month ago.  It helps a ton and is great to use in combination with the Aveeno lotion with FPS 15.  I highly highly recommend it- oh and it smells like grapefruit which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with mild acne.  It is not too hash.  It smells great and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Great scrub! It&#x27;s a good exfoliator and helps my acne a lot! It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin too much, but I try not to rub my dry-prone areas too hard with this scrub, especially in the winter. Great scent and overall a great product for the price that it is. The scrub leaves my skin super soft and clean after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the price . You can get this exact same thing from your local grocery store for like 6 bucks . Save your money because this &amp;#34;Acne wash&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t even work that well .</li>
            <li> I use this daily in the shower. It smells refreshing, it&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator, and the salicylic acid helps get all the gunk out of your face. I has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is difficult to find a really good face wash these days. Some have the microbeads, but dont lather; while others have a ton of lather but no microbeads. Well, this facewash, I am proud to say, has both. It combinds a generous amount of lather with a moderate amount of beads, so when I wash my face I dont feel like I am washing it with pure glitter (as some other microbead washes feel like). This face wash feels good on my sensitive skin, and I like the fact that it comes infused with Vitamin C. You don&#x27;t see many companies these days infuse face washes with anything besides triclosan and basic soap ingrediants. It smells good too, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause my skin to dry out as much as it should. I would reccommend this to anyone wanting a good face wash at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I am 45 yrs old, pre-menopausal and have always prided myself with taking great care of my skin.  My skin has always tended to be on the oily side but have, over the past few years, taken creams, anti-aging products really well.  For about 6 months my skin has started breaking out, almost forming rashy patches of acne.  It&#x27;s been awful!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different product lines, spending lots of money.  I started using the acne wash scrub about 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  My skin has cleared up completely!  I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer and eye cream, but things seem to be looking better by the day.  I thought with my age, that the product would dry my skin out, but it hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product!  Thanks, Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Perfect face wash. Leaves my face really clean and not too dry. Really helpful in keeping a tab on those nasty breakouts. One of those products that I cannot survive without. Add a super size at an unbeatable price.. Win-win.. thanks amazon and neutrogena :D</li>
            <li> really like this face scrub.  grapefuit smell is just right.  does a nice job at foaming up and scrubbing.  can&#x27;t stand a face wash that doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think at some point you grow out of getting small zits, right?  Maybe some skin types don&#x27;t, like mine, and I was tired of it.  When I buckled down and decided to use a single set of products religiously morning and evening, I picked up the Neutrogena grapefruit wash (morning), scrub (evening) and assorted moisturizers.  I can definitely claim it evened out my skin and there are almost no breakouts.  Good stuff, please don&#x27;t ever change!</li>
            <li> My MUST HAVE face wash! I love the exfoliation, the smell, the color, and the consistency!! It removes the left over makeup really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and flaky!! Watch my video review!! [...]</li>
            <li> this smells pleasant but I have sensitive skin and it almost felt like I was putting a chemical peel on my face. it burned very badly, and I would not recommend for someone with sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I Bought This Product Because My Face Breaks Out When I&#x27;m Stressed. It Took 3 Days To Get Here &amp; It Was Packaged In Bubble Wrap So There Was No Problems There. I Started Using It The Next Morning. I Used It Twice A Day In The Morning &amp; Right Before I Went Too Bed. At First My Face Was Getting Dry &amp; Red After Using The Product For The First Two Days So After I Began To Use It I Would Put Loation On It But I Don&#x27;t Recommend You To Use Ant Loation With Dye In It It Will Only Irratate Your Skin. After About A Week I Started Noticing A Difference. My Face Wasn&#x27;t Breaking Out Nearly As Bad &amp; I Wasn&#x27;t Getting Any More Black Heads. It Really Brought My Self Confidence Out &amp; I Will Be Using This Product Again I Was Very Happy With It. P.S. It Leaves Your Face Feeling Refreshed &amp; Smelling Good.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 2-3 years. I use it every morning in the shower and use another product in the evening.  It has a wonderful scent and the combination of the scrub particles and the lather it produces give it a nice texture.  It does help with oil control/reduction in my T-zone and limits acne blemishes near the surface.  It doesn&#x27;t do much to prevent my occasional cystic acne breakouts because those are so dee under the skin, but they have seemed to clear up faster while using this product as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me! I don&#x27;t say it cures my acne 100% but this helps remove dirt/bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. This product doesn&#x27;t hurt me - it makes me feel fresh - it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. These are all I expect from a scrub.</li>
            <li> This product caused by skin to break out the next morning after I used it.  My skin is now red and there are tiny whiteheads all around my mouth and chin.  It&#x27;s disgusting. I called my dermatologist and she said it was junk (I normally use a prescription face wash but I was using this as a replacement until I refilled my prescription).  She recommended that I use Cortizone 1% twice a day and LOTS of moisturizer because my skin will peel.  It&#x27;s definitely helping, the whiteheads are gone, but my skin is still very red and blotchy.  I called Neutrogena and the woman was very nice and said that this is not typical of their product.  However, I have seen several reviews of this product describing the same thing that happened to me.  She did refund the product and said she would send coupons as well.  Definitely would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Works well but the beads are a little harsh on my face. I think it smells nice though so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work very well for me, and I&#x27;ve had good luck with other Neutrogena products. It does smell nice through.</li>
            <li> I would think I&#x27;d be over having breakouts by now...but no such luck. I use Clinique facial soap and this scrub to keep things well under control. Some folks hate this stuff. I happen to love it. A little goes a long way. For some it is too strong. For others, maybe not strong enough. Your skin will decide whether or not it is for you. One thing is for sure...it smells absolutely wonderful! Take particular care not get this beady scrub in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  Its very refreshing and provides nice exfoliation.  Lasts me about 4 months too. Can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li> this scrub left my skin so dry! i used to use the neutrogena oil free acne scrub, so i thought this one would be similar with a different smell. boy, was i wrong. this is so drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think it&#x27;s the \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; that makes it so drying. why make it foaming? a daily scrub is already enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wonder what the foaming agent in here is. it doesn&#x27;t seem to contain SLS, which dries out my skin without fail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still, i will stay away from all foaming cleansers, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars instead of one because the smell is really uplifting. it really does smell like real grapefruit. not synthetic smelling.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used prescription benzoyl peroxide products to control acne breakouts; however, I found that they dried up my skin too much (and in some cases, even caused my skin to peel), so I began looking for alternatives. Thankfully, I discovered this product and after using it 1-2 times a day for the past year, it has worked wonders at preventing acne without making my skin feel overly tight/dry. However, I found that it does not work well at reducing existing acne (at least in my case). So if I lapse in my usage of this scrub, my acne will start to resurface and I will need to use additional, stronger products to rid myself of them. After my skin clears up again though, I can rely solely on this scrub to prevent further breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the feel of the product, the microbeads feel refreshing over my skin and the grapefruit smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this scrub as a daily preventative measure against acne, but I would not expect it to work miracles on existing acne.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh. Waste-free packaging. Like what it does for my skin. Reasonably priced. Easy to grab and go. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this.</li>
            <li> I have adult-onset acne mostly on my cheeks and forehead. This scrub really out-performed other scrubs in terms of keeping the number of flare ups and blemishes to a minimum. My acne is not gone, however, so be realistic--this is not a miracle product. I wash with it twice a day, and I will continue to buy it and use it unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but i do have combination skin (i&#x27;m a teenager) the oily parts of my skin started to peel, it made my face so dry. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily hurt or give me more acne, but it didn&#x27;t help my breakout either which was the whole reason i bought it (stupid right?). But, this product did help clear my acne scars so i gave it three stars, smells nice, and feels nice on my skin too. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have a very good moisturizer, i might buy it again but i&#x27;m not sure yet, depends how my skin reacts after a long time of use!</li>
            <li> I certainly was getting my money&#x27;s worth for the size and I think the price is very manageable. It leaves my face feeling very soft, though it does dry it up a bit.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin and this helps a lot to cotrol it plus it leaves my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> It made my face feel fresh and it really helps get you up in the morning. And if you use it in the morning and night everyday then it makes your face feel smooth wich makes you look good. I would recommend this to another person.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sons and it seemed to get them through their teen years and beyond.  An excellent product, I just wish it was in stock more often.</li>
            <li> This face scrub smells very very delicious and it works great as a facial cleanser. I use it daily, usually 2-3 times! I would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up a container of this product, and while I think it works well as a basic exfoliator (and I LOVE the refreshing, grapefruit-y smell), it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my breakouts. I also found it a little drying, but that could be because my skin is pretty sensitive.  Other people have had success with this product, however, so I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
