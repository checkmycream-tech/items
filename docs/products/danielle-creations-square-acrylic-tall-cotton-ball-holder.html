            <li> - it looks like glass, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m clumsy!  </li>
            <li> Just put enough so that it fans out from the center, so it&#x27;s easy to grab one while not touching and contaminating any swab ends.</li>
            <li> But we also strive to be fashionable and modern in our small home.</li>
            <li> How &#x27;bout &amp;#34;not flat:.</li>
            <li> It even fits easily in my shallow bathroom cabinet, though it&#x27;s pretty enough to put on the counter.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than anticipated and didn&#x27;t match the other container I bought - both were listed as the same maker</li>
            <li> This was a little smaller than what I was expecting</li>
            <li> So Slightly is that it&#x27;s NOT Very Large</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> No glass is a safety necessity in our bathrooms because of our little kids.</li>
            <li> ( But a little pricey, IMHO)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and well made.</li>
            <li> I was getting bored with the ordinary containers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed but probably will not return as it&#x27;s too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and durable.  </li>
            <li> just seems expensive for a bunch of acrylic</li>
            <li> Also it has one of those annoying UPC code tags on the bottom that is almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> SINCE I HATE HAVING THE OPENED PACK SITTING IN THE BATHROOM.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be but it does look nice. Really looks like glass even though it isn&#x27;t.  Fits a good amount of balls in it. I think I have probably 30-40 in there. No complaints.</li>

The ONLY thing that bothers me Ever So Slightly is that it&#x27;s NOT Very Large, it&#x27;s on the Smallish Size; I wish it was Larger, but other then that, I love this item.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s really don&#x27;t hold a lot of cotton balls like I thought</li>
            <li> The product says it is tall, 5 inches, however it is not it is 3 1/2 inches. Since I wanted tio use it right away I did and threw away the box so I cannot return it.  Also it has one of those annoying UPC code tags on the bottom that is almost impossible to remove.</li>

            <li> Using on top of bathroom vanity for facial cotton, and it looks very nice too.  I also purchased a smaller one for q-tips.</li>
