            <li>All natural and safe!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that Joyal Beauty is a smart company in that they understanding that this type of product must be in a brown bottle with a pump.  </li>
            <li>The serum felt cool and gentle on my hand so I will use it on my face :)</li>
            <li>There is no real smell to it and no irritation as well which happy about.</li>
            <li>This has so far worked nicely as a compliment to a moisturizer and helps make the skin look and feel healthier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After clean my skin, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed</li>
            <li>It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed</li>
            <li>any kind of retinol can make you sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>Retinol is not as intense as retinoid, therefore, more patience must be exhibited.  </li>
            <li>Results are starting to show and my skin feels smooth and healthy!  </li>
            <li>This is so far the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used with such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serum contains a good number of organic ingredients which I was pleased to see; Organic herbal infusion, aloe, jojoba oil, organic camellia sinensis (green tea).</li>
            <li>have super irritable skin, I don’t even use dryer sheets, and I found this product to be  non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>I felt the softness and improvement in my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li>This is not only a gentle and great smelling product but extremely economical.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this retinol serum.</li>
            <li>So many other companies sabotage their own products by putting them in jars where you have to screw the lid on/off - thus exposing the product to air which radically reduces the efficacy of anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>amber glass bottle has a convenient pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Safest and Bioactive Retinol Serum for Face/Eyes and Even For The Most Sensitive Skin!</li>
            <li>I use this at night and have experienced no ill effects, even when combined with other products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy that the serum includes--besides the retinol--a beneficial herbal infusion, witch hazel, hyaluronic acid, aloe, Vitamin E, and green tea extract.  </li>
            <li>The stinging and redness was a huge turn-off and very unattractive.</li>
            <li>So far she is pleased with it</li>
            <li>The combo of vitamin C and retinol according to Dr. oz has a powerful punch.  </li>
            <li>I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed</li>
            <li>Economical; seems to work.</li>
            <li>This is a much better product - it is completely fragrance free, and it is a clear liquid that I can fully attest is a first class firming</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way my skin feels after using this Retinol serum.</li>
            <li>Since I have destroyed my skin in the Miami sun, I have spent my adult life caring for it more than most people.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product they have slowing been reducing in color which is making my face look more younger and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be applied at night after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li>so according to the instructions you use this one after the others (you apply them according to thickness of the serum, thinnest formula first)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also makes skin bright and exfoliates the skin by speeding up dead cell turnover (peeling).</li>
            <li>The directions say to use 1-2 pumps,  I used 2 at first</li>
            <li>, it was almost too much!</li>
            <li>so I expect to see better results in the future.</li>
            <li>I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li>The Joyal contains Retinol at 1% strength, which is pretty much the maximum you will find in over-the-counter beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a night serum and my skin is super soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned, and I can literally see a difference after only a week,</li>
            <li>I really like about the serum</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products.</li>
            <li>I have to notice a real change</li>
            <li>And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  </li>
            <li>recommended usage of this serum is 1x per day at night (after cleansing and toning) and when used accordingly you&#x27;ll experience good overnight results by way of slightly tightened skin and an evenness to your overall tone.</li>
            <li>I would love to try the other products!</li>
            <li>At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now as I have gotten older</li>
            <li>a set of instruction on how to use that particular product.</li>
            <li>But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin</li>
            <li>and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>and wow!!</li>
            <li>far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run between my fingers, but it&#x27;s not a thick and user-friendly as a lotion.  </li>
            <li>What I have found is that this serum at 1% is the right mix for daily use for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess a new bottle will need to be ordered soon.</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty has a very complete skin care line, products that work together well and also can be used in conjunction with others.  </li>
            <li>First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have only just begun to use this product in the last month, it will take a bit of time to see the full benefits.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase again (although a little pricey) &amp; recommend it very highly to others!!!</li>
            <li>Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li>It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C and hyaluronic serum</li>
            <li>This retinol serum is a clear liquid that has no noticeable smell that I could tell.  </li>
            <li>have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The formula is certified vegan and claims to be \\&quot;natural skin care\\&quot; -- as natural as Retinol can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should start to see a difference in your skin in about seven days and definitely in two weeks, although the real power of Retinol is with longterm use.  </li>
            <li>and so far none of the severe dryness or flakiness has occurred.</li>
            <li>I think I am just smelling the natural smell of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li>In the mornings my skin is moist, plum and as soft as silk.</li>
            <li>This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li>Every time I order something from them, I receive a prompt e-mail giving me detailed instruction on the use of the product as well as how to incorporate it with other products of the same line (i.e., in what order to apply, etc.)  </li>
            <li>For the first month, I applied only a tiny amount once a week for two weeks, then twice a week for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other retinol serums that I&#x27;ve used in the past this one leans toward the more gentle side</li>
            <li>Because the active ingredient is sensitive to sunlight be sure to store the bottle someplace dark when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li>In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  </li>
            <li>After about 3 minutes the serum is completely dry and that area of my skin that I applied the serum is much smoother and softer than before.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs readily and leaves only the smallest tackiness for the next 30 or so minutes before I can no longer feel it.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty will send the consumer an email containing very complete directions following a purchase, so there is no question as to how to use their product.  </li>
            <li>Since the first of the year, I have added several different products (serums) and practices to my facial regimen.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say how well this works, only because I&#x27;ve been using products with Retinol for years, and a different one isn&#x27;t likely to have results more dramatic than the others.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is going down fast with being used by two people.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE the fact that Joyal Beauty is a smart company in that they understanding that this type of product must be in a brown bottle with a pump.  </li>
            <li> The serum felt cool and gentle on my hand so I will use it on my face :)</li>
            <li> There is no real smell to it and no irritation as well which happy about.</li>
            <li> This has so far worked nicely as a compliment to a moisturizer and helps make the skin look and feel healthier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After clean my skin, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed</li>
            <li> It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed</li>
            <li> any kind of retinol can make you sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> Retinol is not as intense as retinoid, therefore, more patience must be exhibited.  </li>
            <li> Results are starting to show and my skin feels smooth and healthy!  </li>
            <li> This is so far the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used with such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum contains a good number of organic ingredients which I was pleased to see; Organic herbal infusion, aloe, jojoba oil, organic camellia sinensis (green tea).</li>
            <li> have super irritable skin, I don’t even use dryer sheets, and I found this product to be  non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> I felt the softness and improvement in my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li> This is not only a gentle and great smelling product but extremely economical.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this retinol serum.</li>
            <li> So many other companies sabotage their own products by putting them in jars where you have to screw the lid on/off - thus exposing the product to air which radically reduces the efficacy of anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li> amber glass bottle has a convenient pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Safest and Bioactive Retinol Serum for Face/Eyes and Even For The Most Sensitive Skin!</li>
            <li> I use this at night and have experienced no ill effects, even when combined with other products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that the serum includes--besides the retinol--a beneficial herbal infusion, witch hazel, hyaluronic acid, aloe, Vitamin E, and green tea extract.  </li>
            <li> The stinging and redness was a huge turn-off and very unattractive.</li>
            <li> So far she is pleased with it</li>
            <li> The combo of vitamin C and retinol according to Dr. oz has a powerful punch.  </li>
            <li> I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed</li>
            <li> Economical; seems to work.</li>
            <li> This is a much better product - it is completely fragrance free, and it is a clear liquid that I can fully attest is a first class firming</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way my skin feels after using this Retinol serum.</li>
            <li> Since I have destroyed my skin in the Miami sun, I have spent my adult life caring for it more than most people.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product they have slowing been reducing in color which is making my face look more younger and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be applied at night after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li> so according to the instructions you use this one after the others (you apply them according to thickness of the serum, thinnest formula first)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also makes skin bright and exfoliates the skin by speeding up dead cell turnover (peeling).</li>
            <li> The directions say to use 1-2 pumps,  I used 2 at first</li>
            <li> , it was almost too much!</li>
            <li> so I expect to see better results in the future.</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li> The Joyal contains Retinol at 1% strength, which is pretty much the maximum you will find in over-the-counter beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a night serum and my skin is super soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned, and I can literally see a difference after only a week,</li>
            <li> I really like about the serum</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have to notice a real change</li>
            <li> And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  </li>
            <li> recommended usage of this serum is 1x per day at night (after cleansing and toning) and when used accordingly you&#x27;ll experience good overnight results by way of slightly tightened skin and an evenness to your overall tone.</li>
            <li> I would love to try the other products!</li>
            <li> At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now as I have gotten older</li>
            <li> a set of instruction on how to use that particular product.</li>
            <li> But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin</li>
            <li> and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> and wow!!</li>
            <li> far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run between my fingers, but it&#x27;s not a thick and user-friendly as a lotion.  </li>
            <li> What I have found is that this serum at 1% is the right mix for daily use for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess a new bottle will need to be ordered soon.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty has a very complete skin care line, products that work together well and also can be used in conjunction with others.  </li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have only just begun to use this product in the last month, it will take a bit of time to see the full benefits.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase again (although a little pricey) &amp; recommend it very highly to others!!!</li>
            <li> Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C and hyaluronic serum</li>
            <li> This retinol serum is a clear liquid that has no noticeable smell that I could tell.  </li>
            <li> have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The formula is certified vegan and claims to be \\&quot;natural skin care\\&quot; -- as natural as Retinol can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should start to see a difference in your skin in about seven days and definitely in two weeks, although the real power of Retinol is with longterm use.  </li>
            <li> and so far none of the severe dryness or flakiness has occurred.</li>
            <li> I think I am just smelling the natural smell of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings my skin is moist, plum and as soft as silk.</li>
            <li> This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li> Every time I order something from them, I receive a prompt e-mail giving me detailed instruction on the use of the product as well as how to incorporate it with other products of the same line (i.e., in what order to apply, etc.)  </li>
            <li> For the first month, I applied only a tiny amount once a week for two weeks, then twice a week for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other retinol serums that I&#x27;ve used in the past this one leans toward the more gentle side</li>
            <li> Because the active ingredient is sensitive to sunlight be sure to store the bottle someplace dark when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li> In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 minutes the serum is completely dry and that area of my skin that I applied the serum is much smoother and softer than before.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs readily and leaves only the smallest tackiness for the next 30 or so minutes before I can no longer feel it.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty will send the consumer an email containing very complete directions following a purchase, so there is no question as to how to use their product.  </li>
            <li> Since the first of the year, I have added several different products (serums) and practices to my facial regimen.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say how well this works, only because I&#x27;ve been using products with Retinol for years, and a different one isn&#x27;t likely to have results more dramatic than the others.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is going down fast with being used by two people.  </li>
            <li> I have used prescription strength Retinol in the past while it has work it has been very drying and has caused a lot of redness.</li>
            <li> I usually notice a gentle floral smell hovering in the background.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use even on the delicate skin around the eyes and</li>
            <li> After it dried, I had BABY soft skin!</li>
            <li> Now in my second month, I shall apply (again a tiny amount) every other night.  </li>
            <li> This Joyal Beauty version is a clear serum with a little viscosity.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say yet that it&#x27;s reduced my lines, but my skin feels noticeably softer, even after a long hatless day on the water, as I had today.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once my skin breaks out, it takes long time to heal and always ended up visiting dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> In the old days, models used Preparation H to firm up wrinkles on their face.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried some of skin care new products advertised to help even skin , tone that does not contain Acid in the past, but it didn’t improved my skin tone and it ended up wasting my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since a little goes a long way (about 2 pumps covers the entire face), the bottle should last 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I started using it acouple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer - and</li>
            <li> I know about the effectiveness of Retinol not only due to my dermatologist raving about it but also the results the women in my family have had from years of use.</li>
            <li> it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wait about five minutes for the retinol cream to dry, then apply a lotion.  </li>
            <li> So I have both patches of dry skin and areas of oiliness .</li>
            <li> and now I can go out in the public without covering dark spots.  </li>
            <li> and now I can go out in the public without covering dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I especially search out serums that include witch hazel, as I find that including witch hazel in my skin regime helps keep dark skin spots at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall my skin tone is even and less blotch.  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin tone is even and less blotch.  </li>
            <li> Due to my dry skin, I follow JB&#x27;s instructions explicitly.  </li>
            <li> This Retinol Correcting Serum does not really have a noticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of multiple serious skin breakouts in the past, my skin looks uneven and some areas on my face has large pores.  </li>

            <li> I started using this Retinol Correcting Serum Ultra in combination with two other products from this company: the Vitamin C serum and the hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum.</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve ordered several products from one company, it&#x27;s been up to be to ask questions on the order in which to apply.  </li>
            <li> This serum is clear and slightly viscous, with a subtle herbal fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is trying to keep it from the other family member living in the household.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It contains retinol 1% and hyaluronic acid in a base of mostly botanical extracts and lipids.  </li>
            <li> I adore all of their products that I&#x27;ve tired so far.  </li>
            <li> It contains other ingredients, of course, including botanical hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, green tea, witch hazel, aloe, and vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> Due to having dry skin, I shall incorporate this product slowly.  </li>
            <li> For a month now, I have been applying a squirt and a half of Joyal&#x27;s Retinol Serum after my evening shower.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight chemical fragrance</li>
            <li> applied just a little dab and rubbed it on my hand in a circular motion.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve  been trying Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Dried out skin is also not a factor as you should always follow up application of any type of serum with a moisturizer immediately afterward (product sample provided for review).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very slight and after a few uses you&#x27;ll stop noticing it.</li>
            <li> You just need a small amount and it does work.</li>

            <li> My skin is glowin after just a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> This serum has hardly any scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it every other night to improve the elasticity and renewal of my skin. Highly recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way my skin feels after using this Retinol serum. I can&#x27;t say yet that it&#x27;s reduced my lines, but my skin feels noticeably softer, even after a long hatless day on the water, as I had today.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been unable to use many stronger Retinol serums, and had doubts about this one, but figured &amp;#34;nothing ventured, nothing gained.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had no reaction to the Joyal Beauty Retinol. It is very kind to my sensitive skin, which has shown no signs of redness, flaking or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Serum and Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum. Together, these three products have restored my skin to a level of softness I haven&#x27;t had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by Joyal Beauty for test and review.</li>
            <li> This retinol serum is a clear liquid that has no noticeable smell that I could tell.  The wife is using this as part of her nightly routine.  It absorbs quickly into the skin.  It doesn’t feel greasy or irritate the skin.  This has so far worked nicely as a compliment to a moisturizer and helps make the skin look and feel healthier.  So far she is pleased with it but we will update our review with longer term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Since the first of the year, I have added several different products (serums) and practices to my facial regimen.  I have tried the 2.5% retinol by another company but it is not one that my skin tolerates with daily use.  What I have found is that this serum at 1% is the right mix for daily use for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the fact that it is &amp;#34;100% Fragrance-Free and colorant-free, Paraben-Free, SLS-Free, Non-irritating. Not Tested on Animals. 72% Organic ingredients. Made by FDA-certified lab in USA.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue to use it?  Will I purchase it again when I finish with this bottle?  Will I tell friends?  Yes, yes and yes!!!</li>

Since using it, my skin feels much more soft and has a healthy glow to it. This is a great product. I highly recommend this product to everyone. I look for more great products from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty has a very complete skin care line, products that work together well and also can be used in conjunction with others.  Since I have destroyed my skin in the Miami sun, I have spent my adult life caring for it more than most people.  This organic retinol serum is not as invasive as Retin-A products I was prescribed years ago, and I am loving it.  Joyal Beauty will send the consumer an email containing very complete directions following a purchase, so there is no question as to how to use their product.  I use this at night and have experienced no ill effects, even when combined with other products.  I appreciate that it is dispensed in an amber glass bottle which protects the serum.  Joyal Beauty provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1) Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;2) Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum&lt;br /&gt;3) Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  Once my skin breaks out, it takes long time to heal and always ended up visiting dermatologist.  In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  If skin on my neck doesn’t show any irritation, I know it will be ok to use it on my face.  This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of multiple serious skin breakouts in the past, my skin looks uneven and some areas on my face has large pores.  But I know skin brightening types of products usually contain some types of Acid and/or Vit C, which usually irritates my skin.  So,  I was reluctant to try Joyal Beauty products, since it contains Vit C, Acid and Vit E,  when they asked me to test it and write my review on it.  I’ve tried some of skin care new products advertised to help even skin , tone that does not contain Acid in the past, but it didn’t improved my skin tone and it ended up wasting my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Joyal Beauty has good rating from their customers, I decided to try Joyal Beauty after I did skin tests. My skin test shows no irritation; No breakout from Joyal Beauty products.  So, I start using combination of all 3  Joyal Beauty products as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After clean my skin, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum. I do this in the morning.  At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been now 10 days since I used all 3 products and my skin feels and looks great. Overall my skin tone is even and less blotch.  Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  I didn’t realized how uneven my skin tone was until now.  I always have to put foundation to cover the dark spots on my face before I run to the store and now, I don’t have to put any foundation. It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed and now I can go out in the public without covering dark spots.  My skin tone has not even out completely, but it didn’t get this bad overnight, so I don’t expect overnight miracle from it. But, I know it is doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well. I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  I am so glad that I was introduced to Joyal Beauty product. I know they have other items, which I haven’t tried them yet, but I am planning on trying out other items by Joyal Beauty.ly Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.

            <li> Love tho stuff!  All natural and safe!  Smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Retinol is supposed to be the single-most effective applied product to fight fine lines and aging skin.  This Joyal Beauty version is a clear serum with a little viscosity.  It doesn&#x27;t run between my fingers, but it&#x27;s not a thick and user-friendly as a lotion.  This is designed to be used in conjunction with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say how well this works, only because I&#x27;ve been using products with Retinol for years, and a different one isn&#x27;t likely to have results more dramatic than the others.  But I do know that Retinol works.  The Joyal contains Retinol at 1% strength, which is pretty much the maximum you will find in over-the-counter beauty products.  It contains other ingredients, of course, including botanical hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, green tea, witch hazel, aloe, and vitamin E.  The formula is certified vegan and claims to be \\&quot;natural skin care\\&quot; -- as natural as Retinol can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a pump bottle that dispenses exactly enough to cover my face with one squirt.  I give it another pump for my neck.  The product absorbs readily and leaves only the smallest tackiness for the next 30 or so minutes before I can no longer feel it.  For those who have never used Retinol before:  sometimes it causes small break-outs during the first week.  If you stick with it, you&#x27;ll have fewer break-outs overall.  You should start to see a difference in your skin in about seven days and definitely in two weeks, although the real power of Retinol is with longterm use.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> Excellent!  This is a very good Retinol formula.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I love it!  I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;d started noticing fine lines around my eyes and they are beginning to fill in!  I use this as a night serum and my skin is super soft in the morning. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I watched Dr. oz&#x27;s episode called &#x27;How to Look 10 Years  Younger&#x27;.  He doesn&#x27;t endorse any name brands, but he explains what dosage to look for as well as any other added ingredient that is needed in a product for the best results.  This product met his recommendations for ingredients, and I will say, this works wonders.  I&#x27;m light skinned, and I can literally see a difference after only a week, although, he explained it can take up to 6 months for some people to see results.  So whatever you do, follow the recommendations to use this at night after washing your face and using a skin toner.  Then, apply the cream.  The dermatologist on his show stated you can apply a lotion over the retinol serum.  I wait about five minutes for the retinol cream to dry, then apply a lotion.  My choice for a lotion is coconut oil.  It works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, after washing and applying a toner, I use a vitamin C lotion then a sunblock with vitamin C.  The combo of vitamin C and retinol according to Dr. oz has a powerful punch.  By the way, I went to the drug store, a health food store and Kmart looking for a retinol serum, and frankly, the price of this is excellent.  You don&#x27;t need to spend above 30 bucks or more for an effective retinol serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, take vitamin C supplements.  Dr. Oz said you don&#x27;t need more than 450 mg. a day.  He said your wasting your money if you buy 1000 M.g.  Etc.  good luck, and be patient.  You&#x27;ll feel great if you follow the routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month now and just love what is it doing to my face.  The age spots are slowing going away.  My fine lines have reduced so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I have noticed the most is the reduction of the Rosacea on my cheeks.  Since using this product they have slowing been reducing in color which is making my face look more younger and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is trying to keep it from the other family member living in the household.  He found it and tested it out.  Now he is constantly using it because he loves how it is also improving his facial skin.  The bottle is going down fast with being used by two people.  I guess a new bottle will need to be ordered soon.</li>
            <li> This serum is clear and slightly viscous, with a subtle herbal fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains retinol 1% and hyaluronic acid in a base of mostly botanical extracts and lipids.  It is gentle enough to use even on the delicate skin around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied at night after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer.  Apply sunscreen in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular use will help heal damage caused by ultraviolet radiation from the sun and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber glass bottle has a convenient pump cap that easily dispenses a large drop.  A little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal provided retinol serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic herbal infusion, organic aloe, botanical hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, pentylene glycol, phospholipids, retinol (1%), polysorbate 20, potassium phosphate, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, organic jojoba oil, wheat germ oil, vitamin E, organic Camellia sinensis (green tea), propolis, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexyl glycerin.  Not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been trying Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m really impressed how my skin has been responding. My skin is in an between stage. I use to just have oily skin but now as I have gotten older I&#x27;m noticing my skin is becoming drier. So I have both patches of dry skin and areas of oiliness . I have used prescription strength Retinol in the past while it has work it has been very drying and has caused a lot of redness. So I decided to try Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum to see if it was easier on my skin. I gave it a few weeks and so far none of the severe dryness or flakiness has occurred. My skin is smooth and soft. Fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. Enlarged pores and blemishes in my T-Zone are fading. I use in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid serum at night. After cleansing I apply my hyaluronic acid serum then I apply the Retinol Correcting Serum followed by a moisturizer. During the day I make sure I wear an SPF since any kind of retinol can make you sensitive to the sun. I love the dispenser it is so easy to use just one or two pumps is enough to cover my face &amp; neck. I also love the fact when you order a Joyal product they e-mail a set of instruction on how to use that particular product. It is so helpful. If I have any questions I can just refer back to it. And like all their products this one is  Alcohol-Free, Non-cmedogenic, Non-irritating, Paraben-Free and Phthalate-Free. I would definitely recommend this to any one looking for softer and smoother skin! I receive this product for testing purpose and unbiased evaluation.</li>
            <li> This bottle of correcting Serum is smaller than I thought but it should last quite a while if used regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about the serum is that it is transparent so there is no added color.&lt;br /&gt;NO partum!!! YES I was definitely looking forward to that. Remember, fragrance and perfume are just extra chemicals and they are not necessary for your skin at all. The serum contains a good number of organic ingredients which I was pleased to see; Organic herbal infusion, aloe, jojoba oil, organic camellia sinensis (green tea). Also a bunch of words I cannot pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied just a little dab and rubbed it on my hand in a circular motion. The serum is watery and non-greasy or oily. After about 3 minutes the serum is completely dry and that area of my skin that I applied the serum is much smoother and softer than before. The serum felt cool and gentle on my hand so I will use it on my face :)&lt;br /&gt;There were no signs of irritation or tingling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a discount for the serum to test and review. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Im so happy with this purchase! I would love to try the other products!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free for review and wow!! It works so good my skin is plumper and smoother after one use</li>
            <li> Nice line and I am really enjoying using all the products...Results are starting to show and my skin feels smooth and healthy!  Super great customer communication.. Real nice people to do business with.</li>
            <li> For a month now, I have been applying a squirt and a half of Joyal&#x27;s Retinol Serum after my evening shower.  Retinol is a form of Vitamin A.  It helps rebuild collagen and it also reduces the size of skin pores.  So, over the courses of a month, I have been watching for results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my skin feels firmer and has more buoyancy.  And--very definitely--the pores of my facial skin have tightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that the serum includes--besides the retinol--a beneficial herbal infusion, witch hazel, hyaluronic acid, aloe, Vitamin E, and green tea extract.  I think all those ingredients to be helpful to my skin.  I especially search out serums that include witch hazel, as I find that including witch hazel in my skin regime helps keep dark skin spots at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of Joyal&#x27;s serums have a touch of fragrance:  I usually notice a gentle floral smell hovering in the background.  This Retinol Correcting Serum does not really have a noticeable fragrance.  I think I am just smelling the natural smell of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> In the old days, models used Preparation H to firm up wrinkles on their face.  This is a much better product - it is completely fragrance free, and it is a clear liquid that I can fully attest is a first class firming product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super irritable skin, I don’t even use dryer sheets, and I found this product to be  non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given a sample for a review.</li>
            <li> I have noticed over the last few years that my skin doesn&#x27;t have the brightness and vitality that it used to.  This makes me ssad. But lucky for me, I have been researching different products that claim to rejuvenate and refresh aging skin and I have found a truly worthy company that makes several rejuevenating products.  One of these products is Joyal Retinol Serum!  I started using it acouple weeks ago, started with just a little application in the evening followed by a deep moisturizer and then gradually added a second application in the morning- again followed by moisturizer - and ILlOVE the results. Fine lines are diminished and my skin has that brigthness I&#x27;ve been missing.  I should have started using this ten years ago, but who wknew?  If you are on the fence about retinol...try this one, TODAY!  I did receive a free product from Joyal and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  My review is my own honest opinion and I am happy to declare that I love it!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00T0PCCSO Joyal Beauty®-THE BEST Retinol Serum-Retinol Correcting Serum. Prevent fine lines &amp; wrinkles, Acne treatment, Minimize pores, The MUST-HAVE anti-aging night serum for for visibly smoother, firmer, rejuvenated skin!]]I am a member of Bu view and as a member I am afforded many opportunities to try new products for free.I receive products to try and give back my opinions.In this case, Joyal Beauty ,Amazon.co and Bu Vue provided me with Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum. I was impressed with how well it works.After 5 days, I could tell the difference in the texture of my skin.It felt firmer and softer.I have used Retinol in the past.I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the product.The stinging and redness was a huge turn-off and very unattractive.This was  not the case this time I felt the softness and improvement in my skin quickly.The serum is creamy, not greasy. After use, my skin feels softer, younger  and my foundation has a smoother application. This product has changed my mind about using Retinol.Give it a try, you might  like it too!</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products. I have to notice a real change or else I will move on to something else. Of course you must give products some time to work, your skin may take several regeneration cycles to show changes. I started using this Retinol Correcting Serum Ultra in combination with two other products from this company: the Vitamin C serum and the hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum. The first thing that impressed me after I placed my order was I received an in-depth email for each product regarding the correct way to use it (including the correct order to use each product in) and the benefits of each product. This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums. They arrived in Amber glass bottles with droppers. This serum has hardly any scent. It has a light texture, a little heavier than the Vitamin C and hyaluronic serum so according to the instructions you use this one after the others (you apply them according to thickness of the serum, thinnest formula first) I then massaged it in and tapped all over my face until it was completely absorbed (it only took about one minute) and this also helps increase circulation and boost the effects of the serums. I didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects or problems with itching, rashes or anything like that. The first time I used it my skin felt warm for about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Since I am using three products at once I am assuming the combination of these products gave my skin a triple dose of care and nourishment. Vitamin C for brightening and skin correcting, hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and Retinol for anti-aging. My skin looks bright, even, clear and healthy. I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product sent by Joyal Beauty for testing and review)ngs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product sent by Joyal Beauty for testing and review)</li>
            <li> This product is really, really great. I know about the effectiveness of Retinol not only due to my dermatologist raving about it but also the results the women in my family have had from years of use. I got my free bottle from the company and I am happy to say that it&#x27;s a highly effective formulation. I only use it at night because that&#x27;s what skin professionals recommend for Retinol. In the mornings my skin is moist, plum and as soft as silk. It&#x27;s a step in my skin care regimen that I would never skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes skin bright and exfoliates the skin by speeding up dead cell turnover (peeling). Lastly, I can&#x27;t stress enough the need for SUN PROTECTION when using Retinol products. This is not only a gentle and great smelling product but extremely economical. Since a little goes a long way (about 2 pumps covers the entire face), the bottle should last 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle and effective organic retinol serum. Packaged in a dark amber glass bottle the 1 ounce of gel is distributed a drop at a time through a pump dispenser. There is a slight chemical fragrance but it&#x27;s very slight and after a few uses you&#x27;ll stop noticing it. Because the active ingredient is sensitive to sunlight be sure to store the bottle someplace dark when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended usage of this serum is 1x per day at night (after cleansing and toning) and when used accordingly you&#x27;ll experience good overnight results by way of slightly tightened skin and an evenness to your overall tone. Unlike some other retinol serums that I&#x27;ve used in the past this one leans toward the more gentle side and I have not experienced redness or irritation. Dried out skin is also not a factor as you should always follow up application of any type of serum with a moisturizer immediately afterward (product sample provided for review).</li>
            <li> Excellent product as it performed exactly as the ad stated it would....also tried the Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid.....Loved them all &amp; my skin responded in a positive way.  Will purchase again (although a little pricey) &amp; recommend it very highly to others!!!</li>
            <li> Economical; seems to work.</li>
            <li> This serum works well. I like the way it makes my skin feel, I can actually see an improvement in my skin after using it for 30 days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because there  are many retinol serums that promise to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles etc, honestly didn&#x27;t know, I can proudly say that it is great! The directions say to use 1-2 pumps,  I used 2 at first , it was almost too much! it goes a long way! The serum has a silky feel to it. After it dried, I had BABY soft skin! I love how Moisturizes &amp; hydrates my skin while I sleep!  There is no real smell to it and no irritation as well which happy about. Retinol works slow so I expect to see better results in the future.Since using this I can see a more even tone skin. Overall I am very satisfied with this retinol serum.</li>
            <li> I recently added this Joyal Beauty product to my skincare regimen.  Due to having dry skin, I shall incorporate this product slowly.  This company is wonderful!  Every time I order something from them, I receive a prompt e-mail giving me detailed instruction on the use of the product as well as how to incorporate it with other products of the same line (i.e., in what order to apply, etc.)  How refreshing is that?  In the past when I&#x27;ve ordered several products from one company, it&#x27;s been up to be to ask questions on the order in which to apply.  I LOVE the fact that Joyal Beauty is a smart company in that they understanding that this type of product must be in a brown bottle with a pump.  So many other companies sabotage their own products by putting them in jars where you have to screw the lid on/off - thus exposing the product to air which radically reduces the efficacy of anti-aging ingredients.  I store my JB products in a drawer as well to keep them out of the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have only just begun to use this product in the last month, it will take a bit of time to see the full benefits.  Retinol is not as intense as retinoid, therefore, more patience must be exhibited.  Retinol is also not as drying as retinoid.  Due to my dry skin, I follow JB&#x27;s instructions explicitly.  For the first month, I applied only a tiny amount once a week for two weeks, then twice a week for two weeks.  Now in my second month, I shall apply (again a tiny amount) every other night.  We&#x27;ll see how that goes.  One&#x27;s skin needs time to adjust to this product which is why JB recommends taking it slow.  Eventually in a couple of months, I&#x27;ll be using it every night.  This is a nighttime product only as exposure to sun with this on your skin can create unwanted problems.  In my research, retinol products are a great way to reverse wrinkles, and I was thrilled to find this product.  I adore all of their products that I&#x27;ve tired so far.  Oh, and for the price, this cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> This is so far the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used with such a reasonable price! Returning customer for life!</li>
            <li> Excellent products, better than advertised. My skin is glowin after just a few weeks!  Lines and wrinkles are going away the more I use them. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day. Its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face. Many thanks!</li>
