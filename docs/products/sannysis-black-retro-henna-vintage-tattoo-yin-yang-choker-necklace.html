            <li>I love this necklace, totally worth it</li>
            <li>Overall, extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Too small ,but fit my daugther loved and look nice in her</li>
            <li>This is a great necklace although they should make the elastic part  a little longer.</li>
            <li>It came early and I love the quality of it.</li>
            <li>️ mine also arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I love this choker so much especially because of the yin and yang symbol I adore it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m probably going to buy a couple more when I get my next paycheck</li>
            <li>This is my first choker necklace.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of chokers but thought this was cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive early but the choker is made very well and the symbol looks really nice.</li>

            <li>I was actually very suprised when this item arrived in my mailbox.</li>
            <li>I really wantEd to try something new</li>
            <li>I feel like the actual stretchy part might become loose, but the charm is cute and I&#x27;ll end up attaching it to a belly ring or a charm bracelet.</li>
            <li>It even got here two weeks early ^_^</li>
            <li>I had to use the last chain whole.</li>
            <li>Definitely a choker (a little too small), but it is cute.</li>
