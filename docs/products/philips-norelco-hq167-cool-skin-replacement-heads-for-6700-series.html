            <li>These blades fit perfectly and made all the difference in the performance of my razor!</li>
            <li>this one was still in good condition.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll never get a good shave with these electric razors.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I have found, and they were free shipping eligible.   </li>
            <li>They work great; love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>By warming and wetting your face and whiskers with water and a lubricant (there are many to choose from), you can decrease blade wear by about 60%!</li>
            <li>Ah, much better!</li>
            <li>Husband is happy with the product -- really likes the razor &amp; was happy to get replacement blades for it.</li>
            <li>It was so nice to find a replacement head for this razor for my son, since we could not find it in any store anywhere.</li>
            <li>Great find of original razor head for my razor.</li>

            <li>glad they still make these replacement blades for my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Glad I could find them.</li>
            <li>The ability to use the shaver in the shower is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Am satisfied with the product .  </li>
            <li>Much better shave.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>It is true, if you want to keep your Norelco shaver shaving like new, this is the best way to get your replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These were purchased for an older razor and worked great to give some life to it.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to find and they came quickly, plus the best was decent.</li>
            <li>The ad looked good and the price was very reasonable, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it here at such a great price and free shipping!</li>
            <li>No need to use the regular shaver to get a real nice and close shaving experience.</li>
            <li>None the less, the heads work great, the price is fair, and as often as you may have to replace them, $20 or so isnt that much for a good shave.</li>
            <li>If I knew that replacing the blades in my Norelco was so easy, I would have done it months ago.</li>
            <li>Did precisely the job I required.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this replacement head was the right one for my husband shaver, but it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>He has a very old shaver and was very pleased to get these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding heads that fit an outstanding 10 yr old razor.  </li>
            <li>Perfect fit, the past was right.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco HQ167 Cool Skin Replacement Heads for 6700 Series</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more gentle on your face and can prevent/decrease</li>
            <li>The product was shipped out fast and arrived in my mailbox safe.  </li>
            <li>Received it fast and now my razor wooks good as new.</li>
            <li>And lastly, and this is VERY important, make sure that it blocks both UVA and UVB; not all of them do.</li>
            <li>We will replace much more often, and I did read that a warm face and the insert lotion from Nivea will make the heads last much longer.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor heads, especially for hot and humid climates, such we have in Brazil.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was not a problem to find the right one for his razor at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have always been happy with the rotary heads on my shaver and am still a little nervous about switching to a foil one (I use it to shave my head as well as my face).</li>
            <li>After replacing the blades with these OEM blades I was very suprised at how much faster and better of a cut</li>
            <li>Well worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>Now I rarely use safety razor which I routinely used in shower.</li>
            <li>The items were delivered when promised, the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Product is the right one</li>
            <li>The Nivea cartridges and new blades make shaving a smooth pleasure.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the conveinence and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to get him something he already uses everyday</li>
            <li>I will sure buy again and highly recommend any one looking for a new close shave razor.</li>
            <li>good heads, little expense</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re concerned about healthy skin, skin cancer, and/or want to keep your skin looking young as you get older, it&#x27;s best to apply an after shave lotion on your entire face with SPF shortly after the shave, while your pores are still open.</li>
            <li>The shave I&#x27;m getting now, reminds me of when I first got the razor.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for, in terms of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what was ordered and gotten in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>What a positive difference a new set of shaving heads make!!!  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed at what seemed to be the right price, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>They fit enough for everything to look right, but the blades did not have the room to rotate</li>
            <li>Need new ones buy these they are worth it.</li>
            <li>The HQ167 Cool Skin Replacement Blades makes my older Norelco Razor think it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>While it brought back life to my shaver, I wish the battery were just as easy to replace.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming difficult to find this online, but if you have the Norelco shaver and it&#x27;s in good working order, get it, your skin will thank you for it.</li>
            <li>I need to buy a few more!</li>
            <li>I ended up just buying a new razor for only $20 more.</li>
            <li>I never have a problem with my order or receiving fast.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice the big change in performance I was kind of hoping for but at the same time there were no problems.</li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper than buying a whole new razor!</li>
            <li>However, what Norelco doesn&#x27;t tell you (and the reason why most people buy an Advantage) is that if you use this shaver when your face is warm, wet, and with a lubricant (i.e. shaving in the shower) then you can easily go 2 years without replacing the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for this is because dry shaving with an electric razor is extremely hard on any blade (not just these ones).</li>
            <li>As long as these are available he will never use another razor.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads will keep my shaver like new for another year!  </li>
            <li>My husband said it was like having a brand new one!  </li>
            <li>If you use your Advantage shaver in a dry mode (without lubricant), then replacing the heads yearly is about accurate.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Amazon.com and replace your shaver heads once a year.</li>
            <li>bought the much cheaper chinese version first, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>- I definitely had the right razor for these blades.  </li>
            <li>He said he would once again enjoy saving his face with his Norelco shaver and the new sharp blades.</li>
            <li>But even at that, these heads made my shaver cut like new.</li>
            <li>The Norelco replacement heads work as well as the new blades.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in store cant afford a new razor yet.</li>
            <li>Needed some new razor heads for an obsolete razor.</li>
            <li>I received this new head in a timely manner, it performed just like a new razor when I installed the new heads</li>
            <li>and I didnt want to buy a new Norelco shaver fo rmy husband</li>
            <li>Nelreco recommends you replace the blades once a year and now that I have the new set, I must agree as I could see the immediate difference.</li>
            <li>but my hubby likes his razor, just needed new blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li>heads.&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;I would appreciate a refund and put in a new order for Norelco 6701x shaving heads with housing.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that I get a new set of shaving heads, but the first time that I ordered them through the web.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to ditch my Philips for a Panasonic Nano shaver I wanted, but it seemed to make sense to eke out whatever life was left in my old razor before spending so much money on a new one.</li>
            <li>I finally remembered to order them and it feels like I have a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>Ships very fast, and we should have replaced many years ago, the hardest part was reading the instructions which are very small on the back of the box.  </li>
            <li>i need the complete head housing with the shaving heads&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;what</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to the real thing.</li>
            <li>The blades rubbed up against the underside of the round metal piece that glides against your face, and were only able to rotate spastically.  </li>
            <li>An old razor I&#x27;ve really loved, but expensive to replace the heads, maybe next time will buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>I have a Norelco Cool Skin that&#x27;s about 4 years old and these replacement heads did not fit.  </li>
            <li>New blades make such a difference in the performance of my old razor.  </li>
            <li>They worked as expected, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>It took more than a week to get them, which was a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Apparently none of the pharmacies carries replacement heads anymore.</li>
            <li>I have had my 6701x Norelco shaver for 4 years with the original heads due to my inability to find them at the local stores and the distraction of other goodies when shopping online.</li>
            <li>but I feel that blades are not sharp enough for the cut.</li>

            <li> but my hubby likes his razor, just needed new blades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li> heads.&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;I would appreciate a refund and put in a new order for Norelco 6701x shaving heads with housing.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I get a new set of shaving heads, but the first time that I ordered them through the web.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to ditch my Philips for a Panasonic Nano shaver I wanted, but it seemed to make sense to eke out whatever life was left in my old razor before spending so much money on a new one.</li>
            <li> I finally remembered to order them and it feels like I have a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> Ships very fast, and we should have replaced many years ago, the hardest part was reading the instructions which are very small on the back of the box.  </li>
            <li> i need the complete head housing with the shaving heads&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;what</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to the real thing.</li>
            <li> The blades rubbed up against the underside of the round metal piece that glides against your face, and were only able to rotate spastically.  </li>
            <li> An old razor I&#x27;ve really loved, but expensive to replace the heads, maybe next time will buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco Cool Skin that&#x27;s about 4 years old and these replacement heads did not fit.  </li>
            <li> New blades make such a difference in the performance of my old razor.  </li>
            <li> They worked as expected, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> It took more than a week to get them, which was a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Apparently none of the pharmacies carries replacement heads anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had my 6701x Norelco shaver for 4 years with the original heads due to my inability to find them at the local stores and the distraction of other goodies when shopping online.</li>
            <li> but I feel that blades are not sharp enough for the cut.</li>
            <li> My razor is also less noisey with new blades.</li>
            <li> I use the razor dry and replace the heads once a year.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how dull my blades were until I replaced them with new ones.</li>
            <li> the item came when expected.</li>
            <li> The product worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> The difference - both dry and in shower - is that there is alot less irritation on my face because the hair is being cut rather than pulled on the pitted blades.</li>
            <li> But if you do it once, shouldn&#x27;t  be that hard the next time.  </li>
            <li> Cut shower time in half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s next to impossible to find them in stores where I live.</li>
            <li> The lotion can be a little pricey when you see the size of the bottle you get for your money, but just remember what your buying it for.</li>
            <li> The blades sent to me do not fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> The part number is correct, but the way the circular blades are made they do not fit onto the spindles that project from the razor.  </li>
            <li> It saves me from razor burn though and going to all the trouble or getting the cream and water and all that jazz.</li>
            <li> I was needing new cutting heads for my razor and could not find them in the store anymore.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another set  in a few months!</li>
            <li> Caution:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco tells you to replace the heads every 12 months, however, that can be excessive in some situations.</li>
            <li> The item I purchased was difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I have bee using these blades for the past 5 years.....</li>
            <li> I have had my Nelreco razor for 5 years now and was forced to replace the blades after one of the combs was damaged during a trip to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very hard to find, but on Amazon I know that I can always find what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> Seems like all replacement heads are too expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What can I say? They work, and do the job well.</li>
            <li> Seems like all replacement heads are too expensive. But even at that, these heads made my shaver cut like new. Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> good heads, little expense</li>
            <li> Husband is happy with the product -- really likes the razor &amp; was happy to get replacement blades for it.</li>
            <li> the norelco replacement heads fit my shaver perfectly. The items were delivered when promised, the price was right.  These replacement heads will keep my shaver like new for another year!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads work as well as the new blades.  I am well satisfied with the ordering process, delivery, and product performance.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in store cant afford a new razor yet. Great price. Philips Norelco HQ167 Cool Skin Replacement Heads for 6700 Series</li>
            <li> I could not find replacements for my razor anywhere, whether it was Target, Walmart, etc.  But Amazon had them and they were cheaper than anywhere else.  They work great; love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I have had my 6701x Norelco shaver for 4 years with the original heads due to my inability to find them at the local stores and the distraction of other goodies when shopping online. I finally remembered to order them and it feels like I have a whole new razor. The difference - both dry and in shower - is that there is alot less irritation on my face because the hair is being cut rather than pulled on the pitted blades. I gave up using the shaver for a bit because of the pulling feeling, but now I look forward to shaving with eh Norelco again.    It&#x27;s becoming difficult to find this online, but if you have the Norelco shaver and it&#x27;s in good working order, get it, your skin will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how dull my blades were until I replaced them with new ones. After replacing the blades with these OEM blades I was very suprised at how much faster and better of a cut I am now getting. My razor is also less noisey with new blades. If you have had your razor over 8 months I would suggest you change &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> the item came when expected. glad they still make these replacement blades for my electric shaver. price was acceptable. would buy again.</li>
            <li> The blades sent to me do not fit my razor.  The part number is correct, but the way the circular blades are made they do not fit onto the spindles that project from the razor.  Hence they are unusable.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price on these heads for my old 5715X Norelco. I use the razor dry and replace the heads once a year. It&#x27;s next to impossible to find them in stores where I live. Kinney drugs is the only one that sells them and they are $39.99. Recommend getting them here to anyone.</li>
            <li> These blades fit perfectly and made all the difference in the performance of my razor! I will be purchasing another set  in a few months!</li>
            <li> Glad I could find them. Just what I needed at what seemed to be the right price, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor heads, especially for hot and humid climates, such we have in Brazil.</li>
            <li> The ability to use the shaver in the shower is fantastic!  And the built in shaving gel dispenser is wonderfully convenient.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for an older razor and worked great to give some life to it.  If you can still find these...buy them!</li>
            <li> Needed some new razor heads for an obsolete razor. Great find of original razor head for my razor. Put in use immediately.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement and great price. The shaver works like it did 10 years ago when it was brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this new head in a timely manner, it performed just like a new razor when I installed the new heads</li>
            <li> Outstanding heads that fit an outstanding 10 yr old razor.  Received in 3 days! (including day of order).</li>
            <li> I did not notice the big change in performance I was kind of hoping for but at the same time there were no problems.</li>
            <li> It was so nice to find a replacement head for this razor for my son, since we could not find it in any store anywhere. It came quickly and was not a problem to find the right one for his razor at Amazon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. He has the toughest whiskers. These give him the best shave ever. I got him 2 sets. As long as these are available he will never use another razor. Has been using this electric razor for about 8 years. I will sure buy again and highly recommend any one looking for a new close shave razor. Well worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> The HQ167 Cool Skin Replacement Blades makes my older Norelco Razor think it&#x27;s brand new. The shave I&#x27;m getting now, reminds me of when I first got the razor. The Nivea cartridges and new blades make shaving a smooth pleasure.</li>
            <li> Caution:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco tells you to replace the heads every 12 months, however, that can be excessive in some situations. If you use your Advantage shaver in a dry mode (without lubricant), then replacing the heads yearly is about accurate. However, what Norelco doesn&#x27;t tell you (and the reason why most people buy an Advantage) is that if you use this shaver when your face is warm, wet, and with a lubricant (i.e. shaving in the shower) then you can easily go 2 years without replacing the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for this is because dry shaving with an electric razor is extremely hard on any blade (not just these ones). By warming and wetting your face and whiskers with water and a lubricant (there are many to choose from), you can decrease blade wear by about 60%! It&#x27;s also more gentle on your face and can prevent/decrease razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Care Tip:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re concerned about healthy skin, skin cancer, and/or want to keep your skin looking young as you get older, it&#x27;s best to apply an after shave lotion on your entire face with SPF shortly after the shave, while your pores are still open. You also need to apply it every day, not just on days that you shave. Pay the extra and get an after shave lotion with SPF and NOT a big bottle of generic sun block; you just might end up smelling like coconuts. The lotion can be a little pricey when you see the size of the bottle you get for your money, but just remember what your buying it for. And lastly, and this is VERY important, make sure that it blocks both UVA and UVB; not all of them do.</li>
            <li> They worked as expected, nothing more, nothing less. Perfect fit, the past was right. It took more than a week to get them, which was a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco Cool Skin that&#x27;s about 4 years old and these replacement heads did not fit.  They fit enough for everything to look right, but the blades did not have the room to rotate (so they obviously did not cut).  The blades rubbed up against the underside of the round metal piece that glides against your face, and were only able to rotate spastically.  I had to return and never knew why this didn&#x27;t work - I definitely had the right razor for these blades.  I ended up just buying a new razor for only $20 more.</li>
            <li> I had been all over looking for these replacement heads and I didnt want to buy a new Norelco shaver fo rmy husband this one was still in good condition. It was easy to find and they came quickly, plus the best was decent. I bought 2 just in case.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for, in terms of replacement heads. They work great, and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I have had my Nelreco razor for 5 years now and was forced to replace the blades after one of the combs was damaged during a trip to Hawaii. I ordered the OEM replacement blades and combs from Amazon and was at my door two days later (standard shipping). Received it fast and now my razor wooks good as new. I only had to go to work for two days with a short beard. Nelreco recommends you replace the blades once a year and now that I have the new set, I must agree as I could see the immediate difference. Replace once a year...</li>
            <li> What a positive difference a new set of shaving heads make!!!  This is the second time that I get a new set of shaving heads, but the first time that I ordered them through the web.  The product worked as expected.  No need to use the regular shaver to get a real nice and close shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Have had a Norelco Advantage electric shaver for about 10-12 years. No one carries the replacement heads for it.  Went to Norelco web site and they had them on a link to Amazon and in about 5-6 days I had them and saved about $4.00 over any store that did have them.    JEH-Fort Wayne, Indiana</li>
            <li> New blades make such a difference in the performance of my old razor.  Now it doesn&#x27;t feel like the razor is trying to peel my skin off!</li>
            <li> You dont have any options when buying heads for your Norelco. None the less, the heads work great, the price is fair, and as often as you may have to replace them, $20 or so isnt that much for a good shave.</li>
            <li> I love dealing with Amazon.com!!   I never have a problem with my order or receiving fast.  The replacement heads are very hard to find, but on Amazon I know that I can always find what I&#x27;m looking for.  They are exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> He has a very old shaver and was very pleased to get these replacement heads.  He said he would once again enjoy saving his face with his Norelco shaver and the new sharp blades.</li>
            <li> We could not find this product in the stores anymore but my hubby likes his razor, just needed new blades.  I was pleased to find it here at such a great price and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Finally I found replacement blades for my Norelco that just won&#x27;t die! Fast delivery and good price! I need to buy a few more!</li>
            <li> It is true, if you want to keep your Norelco shaver shaving like new, this is the best way to get your replacement heads. Best price, easy to find, and you do not have to go from store to store looking for them. My store quit carrying my replacement heads, but still carried others. I highly recommend Amazon.com and replace your shaver heads once a year.</li>
            <li> Did precisely the job I required. Am satisfied with the product .  Second order in the course of three weeks which has resulted in re mobilising equipment</li>
            <li> He uses it to shave. Uses the shaving cream with it and loves it. Would like to buy another razor just like this one!</li>
            <li> If I knew that replacing the blades in my Norelco was so easy, I would have done it months ago. Thanks Amazon for the conveinence and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The shaving heads were as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The year-old blades pulled the beard out of my face.  It was time to replace the blades.  Ah, much better!</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite razor, so happy we can get replacements for it! Amazon is always our go to place when we are looking for something!</li>
            <li> An old razor I&#x27;ve really loved, but expensive to replace the heads, maybe next time will buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> The item I purchased was difficult to find locally.  Finally, out of desperation, I called Phillips/Norelco for help.  They put me on hold and found what I needed at Amazon.  And, the price was cheaper than the store retail price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this replacement head was the right one for my husband shaver, but it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Works to cut my husbands facial hair................</li>
            <li> I bought the replacement heads for my husbands razor as a Father&#x27;s Day gift.  He is very pleased with them.  It&#x27;s like having a new razor.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to get him something he already uses everyday and it was much cheaper than buying a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what was ordered and gotten in a timely manner.  Will do business again.</li>
            <li> i need the complete head housing with the shaving heads&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;what you sent me was just the shaving heads.&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;I would appreciate a refund and put in a new order for Norelco 6701x shaving heads with housing.</li>
            <li> I was needing new cutting heads for my razor and could not find them in the store anymore.  So I turned to Amazon.com.  The ad looked good and the price was very reasonable, with free shipping.  I made the purchase.  The product was shipped out fast and arrived in my mailbox safe.  I would purchase from them again.  GREAT JOB!!!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and the razor is like new.</li>
            <li> received as described. bought the much cheaper chinese version first, you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m back to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Ships very fast, and we should have replaced many years ago, the hardest part was reading the instructions which are very small on the back of the box.  But if you do it once, shouldn&#x27;t  be that hard the next time.  My husband said it was like having a brand new one!  We will replace much more often, and I did read that a warm face and the insert lotion from Nivea will make the heads last much longer.</li>
            <li> Works in a pinch but you&#x27;ll never get a good shave with these electric razors. It saves me from razor burn though and going to all the trouble or getting the cream and water and all that jazz.</li>
            <li> I order these yearly for my husband.   This is the best price I have found, and they were free shipping eligible.   Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t changed blades in years. Much better shave. Now I rarely use safety razor which I routinely used in shower. Cut shower time in half.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement blades for Norelco razor.  This was the only place I could find them.  Apparently none of the pharmacies carries replacement heads anymore.</li>
            <li> Product is the right one but I feel that blades are not sharp enough for the cut. It might be a feeling or related to something else.</li>
            <li> I was ready to ditch my Philips for a Panasonic Nano shaver I wanted, but it seemed to make sense to eke out whatever life was left in my old razor before spending so much money on a new one. I have always been happy with the rotary heads on my shaver and am still a little nervous about switching to a foil one (I use it to shave my head as well as my face). While it brought back life to my shaver, I wish the battery were just as easy to replace. But the head replacement has definitely given me another year or two of use out of my Philips.</li>
            <li> I have bee using these blades for the past 5 years..... They are simply the best.  Yes I have tried others, these out perform all the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great replacement shaving heads.</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than promised and it is as advertised</li>
            <li> work very good and the price is nice also. Lot cheaper than at the stores around here. Need new ones buy these they are worth it.</li>
