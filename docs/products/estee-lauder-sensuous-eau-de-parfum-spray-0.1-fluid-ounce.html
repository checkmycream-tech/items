            <li>The best (And only!)</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance from Estee Lauder.  </li>
            <li>Kim :)</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy smelling nice and this one is it.</li>
            <li>If you like any Estee Lauder scents, you will love it.</li>
            <li>She was pleased to get her favorite perfume in a travel size.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>A lovely scent, you will enjoy wearing this parfum.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find my favorite cologne, estee lauder sensuous, in a purse size spray.</li>
            <li>Of course, perhaps it not being a strong over taking scent</li>
            <li>Item arrived as described and sent quickly!  </li>
            <li>This size is perfect to put in a purse or even a little clutch bag.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new perfume.</li>
            <li>Didnt realize it was going to be so small, BUT, its perfect for my purse and</li>
            <li>It is not flowery or really intense, more of a musk woodsy smell?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s clearer as to the true size.</li>
            <li>Also dislike sweet perfumes.  </li>
            <li>product was delivered quickly, would purchase from seller again.  </li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t aware that it was available in that size.</li>
            <li>OH my..it is truly the best smelling perfume I have tried in a long long time.</li>
            <li>Light, soft, feminine scent, which doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery, too light, or too spiced.</li>
            <li>A great perfume for a gift, as it&#x27;s not strongly one category or another.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I will be buying the larger bottle of this with a purse size too for refreshing.</li>
            <li>I had smelled this in a magazine sample a few years back and loved it, so I was excited to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t one specific scent, so it&#x27;s easy for everyone to wear.</li>
            <li>This is the first new scent I have found in almost 25 years!</li>
            <li>The perfume came very fast, so no complaint there.  </li>
            <li>Fast shippment.</li>
            <li>I purchased this around Valentine&#x27;s Day along with some other parfums and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>The full size smaller bottle is 1.0 fl oz</li>
            <li>Very over priced and I wasn&#x27;t aware that this bottle was so small, I could fit it up my nose!  </li>
            <li>For a few dollars more I could have boughten this from a different seller and gotten a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>It almost smells woodsy, but very soft.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s small enough to fit in her purse for refreshing later in the evening.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 4ml, smallest size possible, which is TINY but just right for me because I only wear scents like this on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Very tiny bottle, I was expecting a little more product.</li>
            <li>Photo and actual size very deceiving.</li>
            <li>It is woodsy, yet very feminine at the same time.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a lady who travels frequently.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the small size ( my own fault ), and I wonder if it may be older as the scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li>I smelled this in Boston Store but wanted to try it out first before purchasing the more expensive size.</li>
            <li>Have trouble wearing most perfumes due to the fumes that trigger migraines.  </li>
            <li>My husband was the first to buy me Estee Lauder perfume in Germany when we were both active duty Air Force!  </li>

            <li> You can never go wrong with Sensuous!</li>
            <li> Filling this out is painful.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with the size.</li>

            <li> Great purse size and the smell is wonderful. Just enough for a hint of perfume without being overpowering. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in Boston Store but wanted to try it out first before purchasing the more expensive size. OH my..it is truly the best smelling perfume I have tried in a long long time. It is not flowery or really intense, more of a musk woodsy smell? Soft and pretty. Hubby likes it too...always a bonus. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is it just does not last very long.(Hence the 4 stars) At least not on me, it fades fast and must be reapplied during the day or night. Of course, perhaps it not being a strong over taking scent, that is just how it is. I wish is lasted longer, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I will be buying the larger bottle of this with a purse size too for refreshing. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The best (And only!) perfume I have liked. Light, soft, feminine scent, which doesn&#x27;t smell too flowery, too light, or too spiced. It almost smells woodsy, but very soft. there isn&#x27;t one specific scent, so it&#x27;s easy for everyone to wear. A great perfume for a gift, as it&#x27;s not strongly one category or another.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance from Estee Lauder.  I receive lots of compliments when wearing this fragrance---even my doctors have&lt;br /&gt;made a comment.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find my favorite cologne, estee lauder sensuous, in a purse size spray. However, I don&#x27;t know if it was a mistake or if the seller doesn&#x27;t know there is a difference, but I received sensuous nude instead. I am a little disappointed so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Sensuous! Great product. I was low on money so I ordered this small bottle. I will get a bigger bottle and use this when traveling.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and sent quickly!  No complaints! In good shape even though not in box. Would reccommend this vendor to others.</li>
            <li> My husband was the first to buy me Estee Lauder perfume in Germany when we were both active duty Air Force!  Since wearing their Beautiful perfume, I&#x27;ve tried Beautiful Love (my daughter&#x27;s favorite) and this sensuous perfume!  My hubby&#x27;s favorite is this one; I must say i love it too!  I&#x27;d recommend it.  Has a nice sexy smell to it; just as the name implies!  Kim :)</li>
            <li> This product is just what I expected, as described on site of purchase. Would like to have gotten a larger bottle, but it&#x60;s expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this in a magazine sample a few years back and loved it, so I was excited to see it on amazon. I bought the 4ml, smallest size possible, which is TINY but just right for me because I only wear scents like this on special occasions. so excited to wear it out, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> For the price of the product you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me!!!! Not a satisfied customer here. Basically to me it&#x27;s a sample size for $20. I love the scent but the size is a joke! For a few dollars more I could have boughten this from a different seller and gotten a full size bottle. The full size smaller bottle is 1.0 fl oz my mistake on not reading the amount but I was thinking that is what I was gonna get for the price. Travel size should be in your title so it&#x27;s clearer as to the true size.</li>
            <li> Good price for my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new perfume. Smells great and just the right size for my purse.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so tiny i need a microscope to see it! Very tiny bottle, I was expecting a little more product.</li>
            <li> Very over priced and I wasn&#x27;t aware that this bottle was so small, I could fit it up my nose!  Would never buy again.  Photo and actual size very deceiving.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend because it is her favorite Parfum . She loved it. I was disappointed it was so small.</li>
            <li> A gift for Mom.  This is her signature fragrance.  Of course she was very pleased.  And it&#x27;s small enough to fit in her purse for refreshing later in the evening.  Price okay.</li>
            <li> The perfume came very fast, so no complaint there.  I was surprised by the small size ( my own fault ), and I wonder if it may be older as the scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Have trouble wearing most perfumes due to the fumes that trigger migraines.  Also dislike sweet perfumes.  This is the first new scent I have found in almost 25 years!</li>
            <li> product was delivered quickly, would purchase from seller again.  I order the smaller container because I have alergeries and didn&#x27;t want to spend money on product then couldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> This size is perfect to put in a purse or even a little clutch bag. You never know when you need a little burst of perfume,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy smelling nice and this one is it. It is woodsy, yet very feminine at the same time. If you like any Estee Lauder scents, you will love it. My husband even commented on the scent, which is a rarity. It definitely is a must try.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shippment. Good vendor would deal again.&lt;br /&gt;Very responsive. Filling this out is painful.  I will not do it again.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a lady who travels frequently. She was pleased to get her favorite perfume in a travel size. She wasn&#x27;t aware that it was available in that size. A lot easier to pack and tote I suppose than the standard size.</li>
            <li> A lovely scent, you will enjoy wearing this parfum.  I purchased this around Valentine&#x27;s Day along with some other parfums and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Came to us well packed and timely. Wonderful fragrance and value! This is a great purse size and flight size bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but I was disappointed with the size. I do realize that its a more expensive brand but I felt as if there was no bargain to purchase from here.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Didnt realize it was going to be so small, BUT, its perfect for my purse and the fragrance is awesome. Ive had plenty of compliments on it.  Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
