            <li>It&#x27;s smell wasn&#x27;t quite right, like it had sat around  in storage for awhile before being offered for a discount price.</li>
            <li>and then imagine a freshly showered woman standing by the window, that will describe the scent and soul of Pretty perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>

            <li> Long lasting, about 5 hours, for me it doesnt smell like others floral perfum, when you smell it you know is a &amp;#34;vip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it does last for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> matter the cost of perfume super cheapo or expensive it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>

            <li> Not sure how hard she looked</li>
            <li> Those who are looking for  \\&quot; smoking and complicated, sexy\\&quot; aren&#x27;t going to find it here.  </li>

            <li> The smell of these just makes me smile! I bought it to wear to my wedding in August. Not to mention, the bottle is also gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume than any other fragrance I have ever worn.  It&#x27;s so light yet lasts most of the day.  Can be worn year round.  Very fresh and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable and nice smelling fragrance. I typically wear soft clean floral scents like Shi, Romance, Light Blue, and In Bloom. This fragrance has a very soft almost powdery clean scent. Very feminine and Pretty, just like the name implies!</li>
            <li> very impressed with this seller, as well as the perfume. This is my favorite scent, and I am so glad I found it at a price that I can afford!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> smells fantastic,  but does not last.</li>
            <li> The scent disappears as soon as I spray the perfume...............does not last at all.  Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Im totally happy with this fragrance. My friends and family ask me what perfum is! Everybody like it. Is a floral fragrance, very feminine. Long lasting, about 5 hours, for me it doesnt smell like others floral perfum, when you smell it you know is a &amp;#34;vip&amp;#34; brand, is a floral fragrance for elegant girls and woman, you know is &amp;#34;one of a kind&amp;#34; floral fragrance, is different, so so feminine, fresh and elegant at the same time. Now Im using it about 7 months and I love it! Everyone give compliments. I use it at work, at home, when I go shopping, any time!  I&#x27;ll recommend it, for 20 to 40 years, its great!! The shipping was really fast Good seller and excellent product</li>
            <li> Enjoying wearing this soft lovely fragrance.  Beautifully packaged in a sweet spray bottle.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at Kohls for Christmas gifts for my mom. I walked through the fragrance section and saw Pretty by Elizabeth Arden, I picked it up, smelled it, and decided to spray some on. I headed towards the check out lines, and when i walked up, the guy working the register said \\&quot;, You smell pretty, what kind of perfume is that?\\&quot; and I told him Pretty by Elizabeth Arden, and he laughed and said I guess that&#x27;s why they named it that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new scent and PRETTY was just what I was looking for.  I wear it almost every day!</li>
            <li> Oh my i love this perfume, i would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. Smelled in a department store and my daughter looked it up on amazon. Love it and the price</li>
            <li> Mom loves it.  She mentioned that she tries it at the airports when she travels but could never find it in stores.  Not sure how hard she looked but I got it for her and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a popular fragrance, but I personally rate as \\&quot;mediocre.\\&quot;  It reminds me of Juicy Couture, but less expensive and less overwhelming.  Has a &#x27;flowery&#x27; type scent- of which I prefer the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; notes better.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  It has a nice fresh scent.  The reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I was almost unsure if this was authentic because of the staying power.  Seems like the bottle that I purchased in the mall lasted longer when I sprayed it on than this bottle.  Could be a bad batch or my chemistry?  Who knows. Still a good deal for designer brand perfume.</li>
            <li> Ordered by someone else. Don&#x27;t know how they fell about it</li>
            <li> my boyfriend bought me the whole collection of this and I love it!. I really don&#x27;t like loud smelling perfumes and ones that&#x27;ll leave you with a bad headache but this one is so soft and light and it does last for a long period of time. I only spray a few times and it last me all day. smells so good.</li>
            <li> Love this so much smells amazing and it is 30$ cheaper than macys.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this fragrance for years. I was glad to find it at a good price.I wonder how old it is. It&#x27;s smell wasn&#x27;t quite right, like it had sat around  in storage for awhile before being offered for a discount price. No expiration date on bottle.It was still usable.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, soft not too sweet</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s named Pretty and more than lives up to it&#x27;s name; it could easily be known as \\&quot;Charming.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a floral bouquet, on an oiled walnut table that sits before an open window in a very clean house in the country - during the Spring with the scent of woods rustling the curtain.  If you can picture that and then imagine a freshly showered woman standing by the window, that will describe the scent and soul of Pretty perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  The woods and florals come out very strong, then it&#x27;s all showered and scented woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s often criticized for being \\&quot;unoriginal.\\&quot;  Perhaps it is when compared to other perfumes that are designed to \\&quot;stop rooms.\\&quot;  This was is not, it&#x27;s as if it is intentionally demure.  Natural.  Clean, woody floral.  When taken for what is is, it is very, very charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that, I humbly give it a four rating.  Those who are looking for  \\&quot; smoking and complicated, sexy\\&quot; aren&#x27;t going to find it here.  It&#x27;s a natural beauty, and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 1000 stars if I could&amp;#34;!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost of perfume super cheapo or expensive it doesn&#x27;t last.  It wears off.  I have never smelled this scent before but ordered based on reviews.  TOTALLY IMPRESSED&lt;br /&gt;no perfume last with me.  This is a very clean smell very light kinda florals soft and not overpowering.  This perfume LAST.  I even tubbed and it still was still on my body and smelled great&lt;br /&gt;Great product Ordering more</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and a beautiful  scent :))</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite fragrances and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Light, yet you can smell it and it lasts long.</li>
            <li> This was packaged and brand -new !</li>
