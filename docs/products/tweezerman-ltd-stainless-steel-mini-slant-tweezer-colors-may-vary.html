            <li>Perfectly compact, and I love</li>
            <li>I have tried many tweezers and this one seems to be the best one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a very good reason to buy the full-sized tweezers, but this does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>Very good tweezers, better than what can be found at stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as you&#x27;d expect from this company.</li>
            <li>I purchased a mini slant tweezer about a year ago and it still does a fairly good ob tweezing.  </li>
            <li>and they are just as good as the unit I bought a year ago.  </li>
            <li>Has a good grip to get hairs that have follicles well below the surface.</li>

            <li>than I would if I bought them in the store, which was not the case, but it was a fair price for the tweezers.</li>
            <li>It has a good gripper to get whatever you are tweezing.</li>
            <li>Good tweezers with good grip.</li>
            <li>lol I would have liked another color</li>
            <li>It is good value for your money.  </li>
            <li>They are great for carrying in your purse and come in a handy plastic carrying tube.  </li>
            <li>but I gave it to my mom because she loved them too</li>
            <li>but they are good.</li>

            <li>These are not as good as my revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li>Made of good quality.</li>
            <li>Probably good quality but not for me.</li>
            <li>They stand up to a good amount of abuse without losing their alignment.</li>
            <li>and she loved them</li>
            <li>I bought 3 thinking they are a good price not thinking anyone would make tweezers for Munchkins.</li>
            <li>but they are perfect for a purse and are fantastic for stubborn hairs.  </li>

            <li>After reading all the raving reviews for these tweezers, I somehow thought they were going to be amazing.  </li>
            <li>These are an amazing edition to my grooming supplies.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to pluck out my gray/white hairs and it works amazingly well.  </li>

            <li>UM these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>They hold up great and are perfectly precise.</li>
            <li>The angle at the end is good for plucking and I love the rubberized body.</li>
            <li>So handy to put in your make up bags for on the go</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes the very best tweezers, but I was concerned this LTD Mini might not be as great as the traditional size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand&#x27;s ingrown hair tweezers as well, and all options used were effective in their purpose (although the ingrown hair option wasn&#x27;t as durable as the mini slants).  </li>
            <li>To be fair, that happens to me with most tweezers I buy</li>
            <li>Nice size, work well.</li>
            <li>The transport tube is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>you gotta have good tools and good light to keep the whiskers away.</li>
            <li>Awesome tweezers- fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is effective with tweezing your brows.  </li>
            <li>came with a nice case for storage.</li>
            <li>So what the heck, I own a &amp;#34;tweezeman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are perfectly machined tweezers, the two ends meet perfectly giving a much larger surface area and thus a much higher chance to successfully tweeze what your are trying to tweeze.  </li>
            <li>Nice for travel</li>
            <li>Its also nice that the mini ones are cheaper.</li>
            <li>The travel tube is nice.</li>
            <li>they look nice.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice tube with a cap on it so that it is protected and you also don&#x27;t poke yourself when reaching in a bag to find it.</li>
            <li>They slant just perfectly and grip very well</li>
            <li>Nicely make.</li>
            <li>it is amazing！so nice so comfortable！</li>
            <li>Tweezerman products really are the best.</li>
            <li>These really are the best ones out there.</li>
            <li>By now, it has noticeably lost some of its sharpness and precision, but still works great--- better than most tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Kind of took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I wanted a very good pair of tweezers, so I bought these--more than I&#x27;d paid for tweezers before, but you get what you pay for, right?  </li>
            <li>Very stylish and comes in many colors which is nice.</li>
            <li>Makes shaping my eyebrows quick work and they do a great job.  </li>
            <li>good strong set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Very strong tweezers.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned by far!</li>
            <li>Kind of makes tweezing enjoyable....</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best!</li>
            <li>By far the best tweezers we have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The reviews made it sound like this was the most amazing tweezer!</li>
            <li>Great brand, like the mini tweezers better as they feel more comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li>They work great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman tweezers are good and precise.  </li>
            <li>With the clear case they are perfect for purse and travel.</li>
            <li>Nice gripping to them</li>
            <li>They are by far the best.</li>
            <li>(I know, I know, I&#x27;m kind of a cheapskate), but these are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>These are really great tweezers, and the colors are fun.  </li>
            <li>This is a great pair of tweezers and in such a beautiful color of Aqua.</li>
            <li>Does a fairly descent job, but not as good as the higher priced ones, but then again it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes an excellent product, the tweezers were very sharp and worked great.</li>
            <li>Very fine pinch points which is what I was after.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hairs and this grabs them easily!</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t lose them as easily!</li>
            <li>Sit well in your hand, I don&#x27;t have large hands and these tweezers fit perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Great Tweezer&#x27;s, does their job wonderfully, but would recommend full sized ones if you have larger hands.</li>
            <li>This takes so much frustration out of it, and they are sharpened for life for free by the company, which is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think they would make that big a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are impressive tweezers.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman has the best tweezers-  no other comes even close.</li>
            <li>These are good tweezers, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I bought these for a present and was happy with the price and happy with the free eyebrow brush that came with it!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have owned one of these, and it works great.</li>
            <li>but i was always pretty happy with my cheaper versions until my cheaper ones disappeared.  </li>
            <li>These are not as good as my full size tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>Love the travel size, fits easy in my purse!</li>
            <li>Very, very precise, hairs don&#x27;t slip out when you pull.</li>
            <li>These are very precise and will grip even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought these about six months ago and love them.</li>
            <li>My Dollar Store tweezers have better grip.</li>
            <li>but I love my Tweezermans.</li>
            <li>(ok, maybe not quite</li>
            <li>Perfect size for my tiny hands, too!</li>
            <li>These are the best tweezers I have ever tried in my entire life!!</li>
            <li>okay, will they grip correctly.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for eyebrows and there&#x27;s not a hair I can&#x27;t get hold of.</li>
            <li>Simply put, Tweezerman makes the best and most cost-efficient tweezers.</li>
            <li>This thing is magic.</li>
            <li>Favorite every-day pair of tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not any better than others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another tweezer that was more needle-nose at the tip which does work better than this one.</li>
            <li>precious, no)</li>
            <li>These clip more hairs than pluck them.</li>
            <li>These work better than any pair of tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>and they fall in love immediately.</li>
            <li>Love the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t affect their utility, must my ego. :)</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a better deal</li>
            <li>Tweezerman offers the best tweezers and they will sharpen for free.</li>
            <li>but I did not read :).</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase and overall experience.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with many tweezers over the years that just won&#x27;t get all the hairs I need it to.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tweezer in the world.</li>
            <li>I love that these tweezers come with a plastic tube with a lid.</li>
            <li>I am sure.</li>
            <li>Okay I bought these around 4 months ago</li>
            <li>as well, I recommend you just buy then at the store for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than a Tweezerman for the job.</li>
            <li>they are better than the dollar store variety, but I think you can find better than these at the beauty supply store, or drug store.</li>
            <li>Glad for that</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>Unsatisfied with this since I love Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>Top notch tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and a good value.  </li>
            <li>I love these tweezers, and they are cheaper than the full-size ones.  </li>
            <li>Not the case here - these things are fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend, my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Carrying case is cheap plastic tube, but effective.</li>
            <li>that I ordered two more</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I would get something that is more durable and better at grasping hairs.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love it to pieces.</li>
            <li>Just make sure they&#x27;re washed thoroughly in alcohol before you send them.</li>
            <li>LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Put one quarter on top of another, and try to use those as tweezers.</li>
            <li>so glad I went with to brand.</li>
            <li>But I think they are more hyped up than they should be.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t tweeze/pick up hair any better than the drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>I love the tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Well, I sure don&#x27;t feel that way any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE tweezerman as they have FREE sharpening online!</li>
            <li>Ok, I admit it:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Tweezers are ok to use.  </li>
            <li>my brows have never been better, and I have cultivated a more mischievous look than ever before.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy more tweezers.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints and am satisfied with the Tweezer and the container</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for your make-up bag, extra bathroom, I think I have like four pairs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>Low price, excellent quality!</li>
            <li>I found the tweezers had difficulty gripping eyebrow hair.   </li>
            <li>I have bought many tweezers and clippers and all sorts of Tweezerman products</li>
            <li>If you need more leverage, you should probably be using pliers.</li>
            <li>These are well made and have a precision edge that allows you to grasp even the most stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tweezer.</li>
            <li>the mini Tweezerman is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love their cute colors, I received the Purple tone which was the one I wanted.</li>
            <li>You will love them.  </li>
            <li>I read such excellent reviews of these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Cute colors.  </li>
            <li>Some are better but for the money and to maybe travel.</li>
            <li>Love Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>and I was able to pull the smallest baby hairs out that wouldn&#x27;t have been picked with the crappy store ones that I have.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love tweezerman</li>
            <li>it came with an eyebrow brush for free!</li>
            <li>These are the only tweezers I can use, they work great!</li>
            <li>Cute designs too.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are a no-brainer for anyone who uses tweezers once a week or more often.</li>
            <li>Perfect tip and slant and a quality that will last.  </li>
            <li>Additionally these are even more slippery if your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work better than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>(ingrowns included)!&lt;br /&gt;Basically, Tweezerman never disappoints, and I love these tweezers despite their size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased tweezers at local stores by this manufacturer but the pair I received from this order were not that great!</li>
            <li>Ever since learning just how much better they are by trying out a girlfriend&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  </li>
            <li>I love this mini tweezer.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant on spending more than 3 bucks on tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are really cute</li>
            <li>I never knew you could love a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Rather than gripping onto the hairs for me to pull, it just snips it (</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Comes in a cheap but effective plastic tube for storage.</li>
            <li>Way better than others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of tweezers.</li>
            <li>and she is still looking for better ones.  </li>
            <li>Got the my favorite color purple one.</li>
            <li>Overall--I&#x27;m glad I went with this higher-end brand...</li>
            <li>Much better than at the store.</li>
            <li>or i can handle them better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tweezerman slant tweezers for many years.</li>
            <li>This mini tweezer is just as good as the regular size but great for travel and carrying in my purse.</li>
            <li>These are possibly the best tweezers ever, even though they are mini they fit my hand just fine and are fantastic!!</li>
            <li>this is easily the best personal care tweezer i have ever purchased</li>
            <li>Very precise and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>but the the squeeze part of it is very smooth and easy to bend</li>
            <li>Very precise and easy to control</li>
            <li>Pretty good though.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers I&#x27;ve found in a long time for plucking hairs.</li>
            <li>These are tight, great grip, great size.</li>
            <li>OK product, not sure why it&#x27;s supposed to be the best, honestly, had better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many pairs of locally sold pairs which never work very good, except on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is so hard to find good tweezers, and these are GREAT!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so excited about these!</li>
            <li>I like the minis even better than the full size!</li>
            <li>I love how easy they are to use and pull hairs that are shorter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say most people could handle these easily, the travel size is not a sacrifice of function.  </li>
            <li>The bright color makes it pretty easy to find in my bag.</li>
            <li>i love that i can use the fine tip to dig out any ingrown hairs that may be hiding under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s their policy that they won&#x27;t sharpen them unless they&#x27;re clean, because EW, they don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been using those things for!  </li>
            <li>Work ok, have a problem with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Say this to any woman over a certain age: &amp;#34;10X and  a Tweezerman in good light&amp;#34; and she&#x27;ll automatically bring her hand to her chin.</li>
            <li>Kinda high prices :P</li>
            <li>These are very accurate, strong, and light.</li>
            <li>These are the sharpest most accurate tweezers.  </li>
            <li>The mini works for me because I can get closer to my brows which makes me more accurate.  </li>
            <li>They still work, but they work more like a cheap drugstore tweezer.</li>
            <li>but they are incredibly precise and do their job phenomenally.</li>
            <li>The quality is top notch, they are milled precisely and grip anything.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll enjoy this product much more.</li>
            <li>After going through many pairs of tweezers, I heard that this brand although on the pricey side was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Precise, cute color, ends align.</li>
            <li>Precise gripping.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything available at walmart.</li>
            <li>The work great though for getting small eyebrow hairs and grip the hair great.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money compared to cheapo store kind.</li>
            <li>Good quality stainless steel that doesn&#x27;t oxidize.</li>
            <li>How many times have you been out and wanted a tweezer for a quick emergency :)  </li>
            <li>I have tried other kinds and these seem to grab hairs the best.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and have the perfect grip.</li>
            <li>They are perfectly aligned and sharp and they do not slip.</li>
            <li>They are excellent and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, portable, and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>...that makes these easy to take anywhere.</li>
            <li>They are easy to grip and easy to see in the drawer with the color cover on the side.  </li>
            <li>But, I think the travel size is one reason they are so easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove hair on the neck or plug your eyebrows with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I love tweexerman tweezers they are the best and work well for plugging even the shortest hairs I had a green pair that vanished</li>
            <li>otherwise I could easily misplace them.  </li>
            <li>These are tiny, fit in a travel case, and work incredibly well.</li>
            <li>As a side note, Tweezerman makes it easy to send them in for sharpening.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Even though it is the travel size, it is still just as easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I noticed very quickly they were behaving like my cheaper pairs of tweezers - hair</li>
            <li>Better than their full size tweezers.</li>
            <li>I like them, but the full sized tweezers work better /</li>
            <li>Very sharp honed edges that are great for even getting the smallest of hairs!</li>
            <li>So perfectly cut, very sharp.</li>
            <li>got lots of fine hair out.</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>But works fine.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman was light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>These work super well!</li>
            <li>super cute color.</li>
            <li>tweezer that is worthy of its name!</li>
            <li>Super cute colors (I received mint one).</li>
            <li>I own several, and I love them!</li>
            <li>The tips come perfectly together and the little container they come in to protect them seems so sensible.</li>
            <li>They come with a little tube for storing them in and they&#x27;re just great!</li>
            <li>These little tweezers are great for plucking!</li>
            <li>Best little tweezers ever.</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have stated, I think that these tweezers are pretty great!  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Tweezerman tweezers, however, I found these to be ineffective</li>
            <li>Not as fabulous as its put out to be.</li>
            <li>These are great to have in all your different purses.  </li>
            <li>These are really compact but highly effective tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still give it a five-start review, because now I have two awesome green tweezers.</li>
            <li>I have been cheap ones and the get worn out after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>They do not slip and the grip is extremely precise.</li>
            <li>Precise and accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to buy these after finding cheap drug store tweezers being hit or miss.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these and would repurchase.</li>
            <li>but these are more than worth their cost.  </li>
            <li>These work great for their size, but they are tiny when compared to the once you see at the store.</li>
            <li>and they have great holding power when you have a grip on a hair that seems to reach all the way to the next state.</li>
            <li>Overall these tweezers are a great product.</li>
            <li>They are precise and almost painless to use.</li>
            <li>just not a pink kind of person!)</li>
            <li>Comes with a free brow brush.</li>
            <li>They offer free filing if you send it in to them.</li>
            <li>Cheap rip off.</li>
            <li>I carry these in my travel kit for touch ups and the tips are incredibly precise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too cheap to buy the full-size treezerman freezers.  </li>
            <li>b/c they are cheap and I use them every day.</li>
            <li>no flimsy covering and tweezers are great for removing tiny things (I make jewelry).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave marks and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, plus the free sharpening is a bonus.</li>
            <li>and I mail them to tweezerman for free sharpening.</li>
            <li>they make a great stocking stuffer for your teenage daughters or nieces as well!</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the the numerous and great reviews.  </li>
            <li>And wait until you get one and feel what they put on the handles, the color is spongy and it helps it not slip, fabulous.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the guarantee and free lifetime sharpening that comes with a Tweezerman product either.  </li>
            <li>All wins in my book :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too worried about what color I would receive, I just wanted a pair of Tweezerman tweezers at the lowest price available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was apprehensive about spending so much on tweezers</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a pointy tip that I use for getting out ingrown hairs (gross, but hey, not all of us are great at shaving).</li>
            <li>For a few strays here and there, these tweezers are perfect.</li>
            <li>Great Size-prefer this to the regular size.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman products are such great quality.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never taken advantage of the free sharpening because I never feel like it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this tweezer and the cheap ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Good tweezers so far.  </li>
            <li>Good size, love the smaller size and price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the ideal hair plucker and I can&#x27;t find any other product on amazon that plucks hair out as well as this one</li>
            <li>If u have a teensy hair, it grabs onto it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The small size is perfect to fit in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I have small hands and these fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I like that these are a bit smaller and fit quite nicely into my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are totally worth the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so I declined to spend more than $5 on tweezers at first</li>
            <li>I recommend just sticking with the original sized Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to tweeze so fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more is there to say;)</li>
            <li>These are way  better than the ones you get for $1 and are far more precise at getting the hairs you want plucked.</li>
            <li>These are small but awesome.</li>
            <li>but so far we are very satisfied with them</li>
            <li>This was a gift, and the recipient has shared many thanks since she started using them!</li>
            <li>so I definitely had to get my own pair!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>These tweezers are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Tried many that cost twice as much, but nothing even comes close!</li>
            <li>Additionally I generally like the things I get on Amazon and leave good reviews.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love the size and works great at getting out every little hair.</li>
            <li>Nice little tweezers that do a good job.  </li>
            <li>but despite the high price, I thought I&#x27;d be nice and write a review so sweet.</li>
            <li>These are the best, far better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have them everywhere, and they&#x27;re super precise and well made.</li>
            <li>clean your brow.</li>
            <li>arch that much sharper and more precise.  </li>
            <li>This is the far best one and only tweezer to ever use!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even see,  My wife asked me how much did I buy them for she laughed and said I would never pay that much for tweezers</li>
            <li>I think that she likes the full size ones a little more because they are easier to grip with, but these still work great.</li>
            <li>Very nice and sharp, Easy to use for eye brows.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really make a comment on that because this is my first tweezer from tweezerman, but they are the best I have encountered compared to the drugstore brands such as Revlon, Sally Hansen, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously though, Tweezerman is gentle, effective, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your skin, it is a most brilliant useful tiny tool that I will be using daily.</li>
            <li>Forget buying the Walgrens&#x27; house brand special.</li>
            <li>Nice bonus was the clear storage tube to keep the tweezers clean.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, fits in the hand perfectly, extremely portable and most of all super effective!</li>
            <li>Pros: Smaller size, easy to travel with, same sharp great edges that make it one of the best brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>That is the heads of the tweezers are not well design to align just right to grab fine objects or hair.</li>
            <li>While the sharpness won&#x27;t damage your skin or cut you, it is perfect for grabbing onto tiny hairs that are barely there.</li>
            <li>And that is true.</li>
            <li>They still function, if you find that &#x27;sweet&#x27; spot.</li>
            <li>I love my tweezers so much that I buy them as gifts for others that complain about their drugstore tweezers all the time.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I love these tweezers so much, I wrote I poem about them.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy tweezers, yes even men because no woman wants their man with a uni-brow :)</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I have a couple more pairs ready to use.</li>
            <li>that wouldn&#x27;t make full contact between the blades when tweezing.</li>
            <li>This works as well as the full size Tweezerman tweezers, which is fantastically.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers so much.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers so much.</li>
            <li>Who cares what color they send (some people complained) they are the best tweezers made.</li>
            <li>Good for tiny brow hairs, and wayward chin and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>This is such a good deal.</li>
            <li>These tweezers work very well--better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>BTW I paid full price for these tweezers</li>
            <li>I love these they work really well and haven&#x27;t dulled at all</li>
            <li>Really good at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>Good plucker and a nice size for my do small hands.</li>
            <li>Great for pulling hairs, grabbing small pieces of electronics when I work on them, and very handy to have in general.</li>
            <li>although this was the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size, i really don&#x27;t see the need to buy the full size, other than to have more than one of this really great tool.</li>
            <li>I love this size even more than the original, larger, size.</li>
            <li>I mean they&#x27;re tweezers but these have to be the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Order came very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li>Great tweezers that stay sharp.</li>
            <li>I did end up getting the color shown, but I would have been happy with just about any other color too.</li>
            <li>Other than the color, these tweezers are excellent, with a FAR superior grip and performance than the $20 Revlon tweezers my ex left at my house when we broke up 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>They are adequate but they commit the cardinal sin of tweezing---  </li>
            <li>Product as stated&lt;br /&gt;arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I love that it came with a storage tube and plan to get several more for my purse and travel bag.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t just grab quickly and then yank like a maniac</li>
            <li>and I just happened to get lucky.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first few times.. and it suchs a short period of time its not so great..</li>
            <li>I bought this produce after watching many YouTube videos that highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My wife is extremely picky with her tweezers and wanted an extra one at the condo,&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with these, and not an easy one to please when it comes to the ability to pluck stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Or you&#x27;ll buy another cheap pair totaling the price of these in the first place.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers, stayed sharp for months!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very precise and nice and compact but they&#x27;re sharp!</li>
            <li>Great little tweezers; just had to get used to the mini size, as I always use full size.</li>
            <li>I love this new portable mini-slant tweezer.</li>
            <li>The standard are almost too long but these are perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly after, but it does a pretty good job for the price.</li>
            <li>Very compact and easy to store and take with me in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had a pair for four years and says they work really well and are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re all that &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, since they&#x27;re still easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Worked good to extract the one single stubborn whisker on my chin.  </li>
            <li>I find that the smaller &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size is actually better!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Tweezerman products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first pair (also in travel size) for going on eight years!</li>
            <li>it does exactly what you&#x27;d want it to!</li>
            <li>Great little tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Great little set of tweezer that work like a charm.</li>
            <li>Great little tweezers</li>
            <li>Great little set of tweezers and case.</li>
            <li>These little guys work great.</li>
            <li>However, they are a great size for your purse and come with a little carry case (plastic).  </li>
            <li>Great little pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>They work great and the little carrying bottle is really useful.</li>
            <li>These are nice and sharp, which makes it really easy to pluck hairs, or remove splinters.</li>
            <li>They really grip the fine hairs along my brows, and the angle is just right.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy mine were green.</li>
            <li>Bought a second pair because I just loved my first so much!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you need a more precise tool, like removing tiny chin hairs....</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>The only tweezers I ever want to own.</li>
            <li>If they last even a year I&#x27;ll be thrilled (but hopefully longer)</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t carry the same kind anymore</li>
            <li>When I found these, I was a bit surprised about the price (I was sure that it meant that you would receive the three tweezers pictured, until I read the description), but now that they are here I get it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>however, i can see perhaps the need if someone had arthritis or similar mobility/flexibility limitations -- the full-size may come in handy for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kinda prefer my old one over this, but it will do for now until I find a better one.</li>
            <li>Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what Tweezerman calls the Point) variety for medical needs like splinter removal and ingrown hairs, because they&#x27;re sharper and more precise.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I had to sterilize mine and get him his own pair</li>
            <li>That peace of mind is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I honestly use them daily to combat my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I own a regular sized Tweezerman Tweezer but wanted one for travel/</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>This is so so so worth your money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I think that they are worth the price of them.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>it tweezes effortlessly and is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I received these in red, and the color looks nice.</li>
            <li>I thought there was no way these tweezers could be worth the price - but they are.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers I have ever used, by such a wide margin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>My old dime store pair work better for me than these.</li>
            <li>It took me several days to get used to the angle of the end--but now that I am--I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Far, far superior.</li>
            <li>The little can to storing it is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>These work great for the hairs that are long enough to easily grab, but</li>
            <li>They work great for pulling out small hairs and don&#x27;t slide around on the hair at all, just a quick pull and the hair is out.</li>
            <li>and they work great on those little pesky hairs that no other tweezers seem to be able to grab.</li>
            <li>Yes, they also happily grab and de-root those gnarly grandma chin hairs that unexpectedly appear overnight for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li>But if this also happens to you, fair warning that these Tweezerman&#x27;s are SHARP.</li>
            <li>Not as good as other tweezers you&#x27;ll find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It really is incredibly precise and strong - mine came in a nice green color, which was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I bought these tweezers right after Christmas.  </li>
            <li>got right into the skin.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good, but I was replacing a pair of Tweezerman tweezers that had a sharp pointed tip, and these aren&#x27;t as effective in grabbing the very short hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect tweezers for the past 5 years when I discovered the 20 year old tweezers I was using were no longer made and/or being sold anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Good but too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent tweezers, but nothing fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much luck in being able to tweeze my fine and short chin hairs.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this one comes with a tube, but the tube is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers, will use everyday!</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the extra money, they are actually worth more.</li>
            <li>Their higher price is worth it.</li>
            <li>These will stay quite sharp for a long time and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>I had a large pair floating around in my purse, but I got tired of getting stabbed by them when I&#x27;m rummaging around in there for things, so these were a perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Initially I was blown away by how precise these allowed me to get - pretty easy to grip my brow hairs.</li>
            <li>The size hasn&#x27;t really made a difference, and they come with a great little case.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and good quality</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, but very sharp.</li>
            <li>One  could reasonably expect that for that kind of money you get multiple.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer</li>
            <li>I actually like the small size better than a full size tweezer because I can grip it well and can get better leverage and thus better plucking power.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how easily it got an ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>Before Tweezerman, it was a constant battle to consistently find a good tweezer that could pluck both fine and thick hairs, it was often hit or miss, most didn&#x27;t work well,</li>
            <li>Hard to grab hairs have no chance agsinst these tweezers easy to use to making your face bleed with cheap tweezers and not getting hsir love them</li>
            <li>The tips are also very fine, so if you are removing a small splinter, you will be able to move the tweezers into the skin more deeply than with a blunter pair.  </li>
            <li>The mini slants are best for eyebrows but are also effective for random single hairs that pop up on the face.</li>
            <li>Good quality, but a little pricy.</li>
            <li>Good little tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Hard to grip but does a great job</li>
            <li>work exactly as decribed</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many tweezers that don&#x27;t do the one and only thing they are supposed to do…grab a hair and pull it out!  </li>
            <li>They also last forever unless they get dropped too many times and the alignment becomes too off.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first pair of Tweezerman and</li>
            <li>The ones that cost a dollar at my local pharmacy are much better.</li>
            <li>My second set and I love them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty frugal</li>
            <li>Cheap tweezers don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>They work really well!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t recall the first one shipping with a case.)</li>
            <li>While a name like tweezerman does not conjure up the same cachet as others, don&#x27;t worry; you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li>My first Tweezerman tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I also love the extra eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the tweezer</li>
            <li>Love the smaller size!</li>
            <li>Bought my first pair retail and they worked so well</li>
            <li>there was that big of a difference between cheapie tweezers and something of more quality.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them I think I plucked a pound of hair</li>
            <li>The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tweezers work very well!  </li>
            <li>you can send them back to be sharpened FOR FREE!  </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t find that they can get the itty bitty hairs any better than the generic ones i have.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing a mini tweezer.</li>
            <li>but I refused to pay the higher price that they charged and bought all the discount brands.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers I will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>but then again colors dont make pretty eyebrows</li>
            <li>They are very tiny and I would rate their performance as just OK.</li>
            <li>Grabs every hair on the first try.</li>
            <li>This is the only set I have found that is precise!</li>
            <li>I love its tiny size!</li>
            <li>Never fails at grabbing a hair.</li>
            <li>They are MINI, which I didn&#x27;t realize at first, but that&#x27;s my mistake.  </li>
            <li>so gave these a go figuring the tip was really what mattered!).</li>
            <li>I need to invest in a better pair, but for your basic tweezing needs, these tweezers will suffice.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Wish they were the pretty purple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I kept buying pair after pair of crappy tweezers that would break hairs or not grasp on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When they first arrived.</li>
            <li>My advice for owners: make sure to use these tweezers ONLY for plucking hair.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but works really well!</li>
            <li>size vs the larger size as it seems I can grip it better / have better control when I&#x27;m trying to grab that tiny errant brow hair.</li>
            <li>Got a pair for my husband as well -we&#x27;re always fighting over &amp;#34;the good tweezers&amp;#34;.  Have been using a few months.  </li>
            <li>More like scissors the tweezers, the point where the edges meet is so sharp if you exert any pressure the trapper hair is more likely to get a clean cut than get plucked.  </li>
            <li>The slant makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re plucking &amp; pulling at while the flat, thick handle makes it easy to have a good grip.</li>
            <li>still a great little tweezer, super sharp for precise plucking.</li>
            <li>Defiantly mini but more than fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Theyre small but precise and make eyebrow grooming very easy</li>
            <li>This little mini tweezer is more accurate</li>
            <li>Sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li>Like I mentioned before, I have a mini slant pair for travel and a full-size slant pair for home use, and honestly, I have no preference of one over the other.</li>
            <li>I have 2 tweezermans, so I have one handy when I send in the other one.</li>
            <li>Mine personally lasted for about 6 months before I was starting to notice the tweezers not functioning as great as they first did when they were brand new.</li>
            <li>The slanted, sharp tip makes it easy to precisely get the hair you&#x27;re meaning to pluck.  </li>
            <li>I love tweezerman tweezers, but felt these got dull quicker than most.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best tweezers I have ever used, they are wonderful at getting the tiny baby stray eyebrow hairs which I have found nearly impossible to remove with every other tweezer except these.</li>
            <li>It took three weeks the one time I did it, and my old pair came back as good as new.</li>
            <li>A good Tweezerman should last a while with proper use and care.</li>
            <li>BUT after you&#x27;ve been using them for a while, and then try to use the full size tweezers, I find the full size ones are now awkwardly big!  </li>
            <li>These are far far better than low-end tweezers.  </li>
            <li>The little tweezers that came in my car&#x27;s first aid kit work better!  </li>
            <li>Love it small and easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Came with a clear carry case which I think is cool.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so precise, other tweezers just feel cheap now.</li>
            <li>when i first received these i didn&#x27;t really like them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, which is good for travel</li>
            <li>Good tweezers and I like how small but durable they are.</li>
            <li>Seriously these things are great- plucking my eyebrows no longer results in watery eyes, because I really can&#x27;t feel them being pulled out with these.  </li>
            <li>and they kind of let me down.</li>
            <li>Not bad for little tweezer, can get most hair with them.</li>
            <li>I purchased them at our local military exchange and have been very happy with how well they grip when I&#x27;m tweezing my brows, rarely slipping and making me tug the same hair more than once.  </li>
            <li>I love these tweezers especially since they are easy to take on the go and everyone who has used a set of tweevzerman tweezer&#x27;s know that they are quality, however, i ordered purple and received hot pink.  </li>
            <li>They are easy on wrist and arthritic fingers and comfortably sized, whereas the regular full size Tweezerman tweezers are ridiculously huge and hard to hold, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>- so they will certainly pluck hairs with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you tweeze about it, all the money you spend over the years, buying cheap 1 dollar tweezers that barely work after one tweeze, could be much MUCH better spent on 1 pair of these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It holds brow hair quite tight and is handy.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay for the full sized but these little ones are great at pulling hairs other tweezers</li>
            <li>The ends are very fine and sharp.</li>
            <li>sharp and small, works perfect!  </li>
            <li>The tweezers work well, grasping tiny fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I have bought numerous tweezers and always had problems with fine pick ups.</li>
            <li>These tweezers don&#x27;t close enough to grab the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever just used cheappie tweezers from Target, and i thought they worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It does not get the fine hairs or short ones.</li>
            <li>metal is super solid, and these have enough gripping power to tear skin</li>
            <li>I purchsed this item because we did not have a decent pair of tweezers in the house and no sooner than they arrived, we needed them to pull out cactii needles from hands!  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a little plastic tubing case which is nice because I have not lost them once.</li>
            <li>Nice little carry case for travel.</li>
            <li>Even comes with its own little case.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to transport, easy to use, etc.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking &amp;#34;my tweezers can&#x27;t really grab short or fine hairs&amp;#34; get these.</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated Tweezerman tweezers for about $12.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still great especially for a little makeup bag for your purse</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good pair that will still pull the smallest hair after repeated use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and catches any loose brow or chin hairs on the first try.</li>
            <li>The last time i ordered these tweezers they were super sharp and worked amazingly .</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very used to using this length of tweezers and have been for years.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my grown daughter, but I like it so much I will probably order one for myself.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to cheap ones</li>
            <li>mini slant tweezer is not that much smaller than the regular size tweezer, but it comes in it&#x27;s own plastic case and it&#x27;s very convenient as a portable tweezer.</li>
            <li>:) Both times, I got chosen the pink color.</li>
            <li>I was wondering why I was paying so much for tweezers and when they came I started to wonder again.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a very mini plastic cover</li>
            <li>they work very well.</li>
            <li>What is there to say really?</li>
            <li>she wants 1</li>
            <li>The tweezers cost too much to be made like junk.  </li>
            <li>really, It doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish these weren&#x27;t purple, but there were no color options when I ordered.</li>
            <li>and work very well.</li>
            <li>and they are an absolute steal.  </li>
            <li>I am very choosy about my tweezwers....</li>
            <li>arrived in pink but decided to keep and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper ones don&#x27;t seem to work very well...</li>
            <li>I have hard-to-tame eyebrows and a would-be unibrow thanks to genetics.</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>These seem to be holding up very well</li>
            <li>works very well, even bought one for my daughter</li>
            <li>I never struggled with getting the whole hair out at the root.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very flimsy and do not grab well.</li>
            <li>Not just because I like it so much but also because my daughter lost hers and took mine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even applying that much pressure).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use them much</li>
            <li>Very noticeable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work very well</li>
            <li>Alright tweezers but 11$ is a bit much.</li>
            <li>For $11 I expected more.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see what all the rave reviews were about -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, I have always bought cheap tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old one which still works better.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with teasing my eyebrows and these are by far the best tweezers i have ever used.</li>
            <li>If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Fot that much money I expected a better pair of tweezers</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The most important thing she considers when buying tweezers is how thick the edge is.</li>
            <li>Well, these are pretty &#x27;mini&#x27; as the title suggests - big enough to tweeze my brows but def smaller than what I&#x27;ve been used to (honestly, I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the full size version</li>
            <li>Although these tweezers ultimately get their goal, I don&#x27;t think that they are much better than my old ones.</li>
            <li>But these are not the same quality as my old Tweezermans--they are definitely better than cheapies from Walmart</li>
            <li>Good product, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>and they have a very precise and sharp tip.  </li>
            <li>They do grasp little fine hairs and coarse hairs easily, but watch out!</li>
            <li>Nice sharp clear edges that can grab even the finest of hairs.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize how sharp and effective tweezers can be until I literally couldn&#x27;t pull one eyebrow hair out with my old pair anymore.  </li>
            <li>To the touch, the new ones feel a tiny bit sharper at the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; point, but aren&#x27;t easily distinguishable besides that.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I have better control over  it due to</li>
            <li>They grab even the thinnest of hairs and are able to pull them out when other tweezers won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They are pricey for tweezers and are better than other brands</li>
            <li>so many other tweezers tend to do.</li>
            <li>I love tweezerman tweezers because they are sharp and well-made.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers</li>
            <li>As a result, they provide better grip for removing hair than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>these are sharp and precise; what else can you say about a pair of tweezers?!?  </li>
            <li>These are so much better than the other tweezers I had around.  </li>
            <li>These work better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Tweezerman&#x27;s a few times in the past - they&#x27;ve always been the best!</li>
            <li>They work great and are small enough to carry in your purse/makeup bag</li>
            <li>My needle-nose pair lives in the first aid kit most of the time, because I don&#x27;t want something that sharp anywhere near my eyes.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to use, and comes in a handy little keep-safe tube.</li>
            <li>Great price, less than half of what I paid for my first pair in a store...</li>
            <li>Might just get a fresh new pair of my old version (revlon, with the handles like an eyelash curler), and save these for what it appears they were intended.. Travel.</li>
            <li>I have small hands, so the full size aren&#x27;t always easy for me to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find the older style Tweezerman tweezers that had a less sharp edge, but worked great on brows.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and precise, and get even the smallest hairs the first time.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another type of tweezer as long as these are available.</li>
            <li>Small size is nice for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are small but effective, they hold hair, skin, whatever you want to pull off your body with ease</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m just going to purchase the full size</li>
            <li>However, my current full-sized, stainless steel pair have dulled finally (after a couple of years), so it was nice to use these very sharp and precise ones.</li>
            <li>maybe a little bit too much :-)</li>
            <li>Good little tweezers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They really do &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than your average tweezer!</li>
            <li>Something can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>I cant live without my tweezers!</li>
            <li>Tweezermans come very sharp and grip every hair i love them</li>
            <li>easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2 inches roughly in length.</li>
            <li>I like this smaller one better than the larger.</li>
            <li>The second time and subsequently, everything came together and I am now glad I did purchase this tweezer and would recommend itl</li>
            <li>One thing you should be careful of is that it is possible to poke yourself with them (and pierce your skin) if you get too enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause I was looking for a particular color and was under the impression I had chosen that color and when d-day arrived</li>
            <li>They are precise fitting and grab thin hairs.  </li>
            <li>Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li>For the first few months, however, this tweezer did an AMAZING job at grabbing tiny hairs and just-grown-in brow stubble.</li>
            <li>and I decided to get a second one and possibly send off the first for the free sharpening offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are precisely milled and shaped such that they grip along the entire tweezer face, not just the very tip or along part of the face as many other pairs of tweezers do.  </li>
            <li>They grab when they are supposed to grab &amp; they are small enough to fit in my hand &amp; be able to maneuver around with them.  </li>
            <li>The ends close evenly and tight, which I love.</li>
            <li>High quality and works for on the go time.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these tweezers to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality tweezers at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>High quality and works well for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Tweezerman slant tweezers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers</li>
            <li>High quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>I received a pink one, but that was fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Works better than all the other brands I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Just a cute little tweezer.</li>
            <li>Love the little packing tube as well.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so cute too and it comes with a tube container for the little tweezer.</li>
            <li>These tweezers seem top quality but a little over priced to me.</li>
            <li>I love these little tweezers.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and buy Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I love my tweezers and the little travel tube case</li>
            <li>Due to the small size you need to use more strength for grip, most of the time it just doesnt grip the hair or blackheads.</li>
            <li>I am not sure HOW they differ from my crappy 2 dollar tweezers but they certainly make a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>Sharp and strong, they get the job done.</li>
            <li>I am a penny pincher, and spending this much on tweezers had me nearly in tears</li>
            <li>Will buy a few more.</li>
            <li>Love these... weirdly small but work really well</li>
            <li>My mom used to tell me that Tweezermans are the only brand of tweezers I should buy, so they&#x27;re pretty much all I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, they will last and be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Love the slant, cute colors, seems heavy duty - should last a long time.</li>
            <li>personally I think it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Green is my favorite color</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so much better than my Revlon tweezers that I&#x27;ve been using them everyday.</li>
            <li>but they do the job and are pretty much on the line of basic transportation.  </li>
            <li>Save these lovely little tools for what they are intended or risk needing a new pair.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive mine in hot pink, the very color that I wanted!</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I anticipate, but my eyebrows have never looked better!  </li>
            <li>my Revlon work better for far less cost.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it pinches me so easily, and the pinches HURT, but maybe that;s because I&#x27;ve only been tweezing my eyebrows about once a week for just a year now</li>
            <li>My wife has gone through many tweezer manufacturers and this is the only one that works for her, she uses them daily and will settle for no other.</li>
            <li>The tweezers work great for rmoving very thin cactus stickers.</li>
            <li>And I bought a lot of other brands but they soon broke or were garbage, The tweezers would not come together precisely</li>
            <li>Not as sharp or precise as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li>Mine are green and the little tube is a great size for your purse.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence due the price, go for it, they also come with lifetime sharpening and will replace them for free if the nipper spring breaks.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller size because it comes with its own little storage tube which protects them.  </li>
            <li>I was shipped the blue ones and they came with a little case so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly they are nothing like the tweezers at the drug store, they actually tweeze every time, instead of forcing you to waste time tweezing at things until the tweezers finally align right and tweeze what you are trying to tweeze.   </li>
            <li>pulled my first sliver with them the other day, they were the right tool for the job...</li>
            <li>I purchased two new pairs in the purple color</li>
            <li>I lost mine once and ordered a new pair within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li>Live with the trees and the seas and the breeze, no longer being haunted by that sneeze you could not tweeze.</li>
            <li>I was in the beauty section of target looking for a new pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>I live for tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>Small but very precise.  </li>
            <li>so if you are looking for tweezers that work well for the average hair plucking, these are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>I love these little tweezers!</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the tip alignment is perfect, but it&#x27;s too sharp :(</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace a very old Tweezerman tweezer.</li>
            <li>By hair, I mean, whisker, which I really didn&#x27;t want to confess.  :)</li>
            <li>I bought this brand because the first one I bought several years ago was so tight and pulled hair out from the root so easily.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to grip with no slipping out of the hand.</li>
            <li>only thing I would complain about is that the picture shows a pretty purple tweezer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Its small but able to get out stubborn hairs and makes maintaining eyebrows in between waxings a breeze.</li>
            <li>Sure, they should read the small print, but you can do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li>/&gt;These tweezers are the perfect size for my small hands, although it&#x27;s a travel size so it may be too small for someone with larger hands.  </li>
            <li>The first set I ruined by grasping cellophane wrappers on various makeup containers to rip them off.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is no better than a revlon tweezer and it costs more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, and I thought it was a three pack, but the tweezers overall is really nice.</li>
            <li>Love the small size.</li>
            <li>It cuts hairs rather then pulling them even when squeezing gently.&lt;br /&gt;There are other tweezers by the same brand that are MUCH better</li>
            <li>(note: my only, only regret is that it comes in so many colours -- i actually hoped aloud &amp;#34;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>They just WORK, the way most tweezers should, but usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s efficient, sturdy, and small.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers... I&#x27;ve wasted money regularly on the cheap &amp;#34;check out line&amp;#34; tweezers in the past, but these have the feel that tells me they will last.  </li>
            <li>I actually found that when trying to pull super fine hairs out of my eyebrows, this would actually cut and clip the hair where I applied the pressure – that&#x27;s how sharp they are.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheaper than buying a whole new tweezer!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so easy to use and find all those little hairs.</li>
            <li>Tweezers work great,  a little on the small side</li>
            <li>There are a little small, but work just great.</li>
            <li>No comparison between this new one and my old one.</li>
            <li>It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the price on the tweezerman tweezers, i really expected something extra special!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about them is that they have a surprisingly good grip, which makes for really accurate (and less painful) tweezing!</li>
            <li>Accurate tweezers with tight grasp and sufficient recoil when opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are both too sharp and small to get a good grip.</li>
            <li>These little tweezers are expensive but in my experience they are the best.  </li>
            <li>Love these little tweezers (this is about the fourth I&#x27;ve bought; two I have and one each for two family members).</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re small (but not too small), so that I have better control over tweezing fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Most People dont realize tweezers get dull and</li>
            <li>I believe not doing so made my tweezer more dull.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and you need to protect the tip, but that is easy enough</li>
            <li>Very well made, much better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve used previous.</li>
            <li>make it clear</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>too much money for just regular tweezers.</li>
            <li>These replace a 5 year old pair that I lost.</li>
            <li>but now I won&#x27;t go near my old Revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li>I bought these for travel but find I use them quite frequently.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really be able to thwart an attack with your Tweezermans, but at least you won&#x27;t have a unibrow.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly so far.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried 5-6 so far.</li>
            <li>Wish I had of upgraded my old pair ages ago&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of tweezers, but in several months of near-daily use, they haven&#x27;t lost their sharpness and tweezing abilities!</li>
            <li>My old tweezers lost their precision and some grip, but once I got the hair</li>
            <li>So far, they are terrific, and if they last, they will be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is very Mini and too short for me.</li>
            <li>I recommend for someone that wants a very short tweezer, I would not buy this again, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its products to keep them at their hair-plucking finest.  </li>
            <li>They really do the job and come with a tiny plastic carrying case if you want to stash them in your purse.</li>
            <li>Pulls hair completely out.</li>
            <li>I bought this Mini Slant Tweezer to replace my old tweezers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more of these to keep in my travel stuff and for a spare, etc.</li>
            <li>Pretty decently made, but I find that the one edge is too sharp sometimes and stabs me when I&#x27;m trying to tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The tip of the tweezers are very precise and can easily grab onto and pull out those tricky hairs that seem almost impossible to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little tube it comes in is really useful as well!</li>
            <li>was slipping through, the grip wasn&#x27;t right, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s small and can easily get those stubborn brow hairs out.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get to pick the color, but they are small and easily portable.</li>
            <li>Grabs small hairs easily.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>and I had to dry my tears and invest in a new pair.&lt;br /&gt;After much research I decided on the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>It was a no-brainer than I had to get back on Amazon and order a second one which arrived yesterday and this one has a pretty clear case.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re small and come with a storage tube, I think I&#x27;ll relegate these to my purse as my &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; tweezers and stick with cheaper Revlon ones that actually work better for my day-to-day needs.</li>
            <li>I had the first one for about a year before I left it in Las Vegas by accident during a recent trip.</li>
            <li>- coarse beard hair that older women sprout.</li>
            <li>I would recommend just buying the full size as they are really not that much larger.</li>
            <li>I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27;</li>
            <li>tweezers are small, no question -- but I actually like the size, because you can control them a bit better.</li>
            <li>not bad, a little bit pricy</li>
            <li>I held out such high hopes for these tweezers</li>
            <li>Size is large enough to use with man hands, and small enough to easily store.</li>
            <li>My only caveat is to be careful you don&#x27;t injure yourself with the tips, as they are fine enough to be sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other brand compares!</li>
            <li>These are a little sharp on the ends, so they are really designed for fine tweezing.</li>
            <li>Their size does not make them awkward to use, but somehow the larger tweezers are more comfortable</li>
            <li>Pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li>They work extremely well and the small tube case is handy.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the size as they&#x27;re definitely &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, though they&#x27;re still big enough to be used conveniently and have the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li>They come with a little clear plastic tube that is pretty useless to me (it might be good for travel?).</li>
            <li>My eyebrow area got a little red after I used them they are so precise.  </li>
            <li>but I expected more from it because it was a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>I have used mine for nearly ten years and it&#x27;s still super sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving up and buying a new, different pair.</li>
            <li>After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair.</li>
            <li>I then bought two more and received the pink version and a kelly green not pictured here.</li>
            <li>really did not think tweezers would be such a big deal to me, but here I am.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those annoying nose hairs and daily fight of the uno-brow.</li>
            <li>Very precise, not too sharp, firm grip</li>
            <li>No other tweezers come close.</li>
            <li>if a tweezer is sharp it will grab those pesky little hairs better.  </li>
            <li>I had a favorite pair of tweezers that never let me down for about 8 years but they broke in half</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying such small tweezers, especially for the price, but they are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>yes middle age where suddenly unwanted hair on my face is new for me!  </li>
            <li>This size is okay for travel or your purse but would prefer a larger size for serious use.</li>
            <li>If your tweezers get dull you can send it in with no shipping cost or fee whatsoever and they will sharpen it for you free of charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also Tweezerman provides a lifetime guarantee for the tweezers, sharpening them for free of charge if the tweezers ever become dull.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and took me a little while to be able to work with them.  </li>
            <li>but as a guy I really would&#x27;ve preferred not to have pink.  </li>
            <li>:O  </li>
            <li>Much shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Those Revlons also had a horrendous hot pink trim, so the purple of the Tweezermans is actually somewhat of an improvement,</li>
            <li>The tube it came packaged in is difficult to use but it will store the tweezers effectively when not in use.</li>
            <li>OK, but definately not great.  </li>
            <li>The larger ones that cost around $20 are worth the price, hands down.</li>
            <li>Next time I need a new pair of tweezers I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li>If (when, actually) I lose them, I will buy a new pair of the same.</li>
            <li>This tweezer is amazingly sharp and certainly remove even the smallest hair.</li>
            <li>Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even smaller they would have been good because they have a firm precision that makes them work well even when I am not perfect in tweezing a particular lash!</li>
            <li>They came in their own little tube, too, which will protect them from getting dull bumping around in my drawer.</li>
            <li>It grabs the hairs and it works fine, but it&#x27;s not AMAZING because sometimes, it wouldn&#x27;t grab my smaller hairs.</li>
            <li>but on any of my thinner hairs, it will just cut them right in half!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference from any other pair of tweezers I have owned...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small but works fantastic.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very small and light weight that did not pull my wives, daughters, or sons hair out at all.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and really grab the hair.</li>
            <li>This would not have been a big deal if it were any other color, except for the fact that hot pink is my least favorite color.</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and ordered a new pair because I can not live without them.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the mini pair offers the same performance as the full-size pair in a smaller package.</li>
            <li>The slanted edges fit tightly together, so it works extremely well at grabbing the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li>Pulls the little hairs out on the first try.  </li>
            <li>Plain old stainless steel.</li>
            <li>The smaller size felt odd at first</li>
            <li>The tip is very sharp and grips little hairs very well while getting right next to the root.  </li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t really think that tweezers could be  very different from each other.</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered was mint green.</li>
            <li>I also like the pretty mint green color.</li>
            <li>They work amazing and are small enough that they are more convenient to take with in a purse or make-up bag, but not too small that they are hard to use - I am a tweerman purchaser for life!!</li>
            <li>Super sharp so be careful and pretty small.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first when I read several reviews saying the quality is lower and what not.</li>
            <li>I have bought 5-6 different Tweezerman products after that first little one.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they&#x27;re small and they came with a little container since I had planned to use them in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>quickly became dull after about 1 week of use</li>
            <li>The tweezerman tweezers have a thin edge which makes it easy to grab on to things.</li>
            <li>But it comes in a little case and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>although this little guy is a bit more expensive than others, I feel it is worth the extra money spent.</li>
            <li>that my regular tweezers and is much easier to carry in my purse to pick off those ugly facial hairs that always seem to appear when you look in the car mirror on your way to somewhere important!  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!!</li>
            <li> Very effective for precision plucking.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are very effective, however, I did not receive the color I had ordered.  </li>
            <li> Very nice tweezer.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to hold in your hand to easily shape your eyebrows!  </li>
            <li> amazing price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what i was expecting from tweezers that cost more than $10, but i was impressed when i got</li>
            <li> Great tweezer for a good price.</li>
            <li> This mini freezer comes in a cute container, and the tweezers themselves are the best that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Perfectly compact, and I love</li>
            <li> I have tried many tweezers and this one seems to be the best one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a very good reason to buy the full-sized tweezers, but this does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> Very good tweezers, better than what can be found at stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as you&#x27;d expect from this company.</li>
            <li> I purchased a mini slant tweezer about a year ago and it still does a fairly good ob tweezing.  </li>
            <li> and they are just as good as the unit I bought a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Has a good grip to get hairs that have follicles well below the surface.</li>
            <li> those tweezers were good.</li>
            <li> Good job Tweezerman</li>
            <li> Good product,</li>

            <li> These work really good.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers for a good price.</li>
            <li> than I would if I bought them in the store, which was not the case, but it was a fair price for the tweezers.</li>
            <li> It has a good gripper to get whatever you are tweezing.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers with good grip.</li>
            <li> lol I would have liked another color</li>
            <li> It is good value for your money.  </li>
            <li> They are great for carrying in your purse and come in a handy plastic carrying tube.  </li>
            <li> but I gave it to my mom because she loved them too</li>
            <li> but they are good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, good tweezers.</li>
            <li> and they a a good size.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are good its just spendy.</li>
            <li> I like the tweezer as they are good quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, good product</li>
            <li> did I know how superior they truly are.  </li>
            <li> Even though you can&#x27;t pick the colour, they all look good.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as my revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li> Made of good quality.</li>
            <li> Probably good quality but not for me.</li>
            <li> They stand up to a good amount of abuse without losing their alignment.</li>
            <li> and she loved them</li>
            <li> I bought 3 thinking they are a good price not thinking anyone would make tweezers for Munchkins.</li>
            <li> but they are perfect for a purse and are fantastic for stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> Love love love these!!!</li>
            <li> These work fine but are teeny!!</li>

            <li> Great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I own a couple pairs of these tweezers and I love them!  </li>

            <li> They are simply amazing.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great and accurate tweazers</li>
            <li> they work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the raving reviews for these tweezers, I somehow thought they were going to be amazing.  </li>
            <li> These are an amazing edition to my grooming supplies.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to pluck out my gray/white hairs and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> this is amazing product..</li>
            <li> This things works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Amazing tweezers.</li>
            <li> UM these are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> They hold up great and are perfectly precise.</li>
            <li> The angle at the end is good for plucking and I love the rubberized body.</li>
            <li> So handy to put in your make up bags for on the go</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the very best tweezers, but I was concerned this LTD Mini might not be as great as the traditional size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand&#x27;s ingrown hair tweezers as well, and all options used were effective in their purpose (although the ingrown hair option wasn&#x27;t as durable as the mini slants).  </li>
            <li> To be fair, that happens to me with most tweezers I buy</li>
            <li> Nice size, work well.</li>
            <li> The transport tube is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> you gotta have good tools and good light to keep the whiskers away.</li>
            <li> Awesome tweezers- fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is effective with tweezing your brows.  </li>
            <li> came with a nice case for storage.</li>
            <li> So what the heck, I own a &amp;#34;tweezeman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are perfectly machined tweezers, the two ends meet perfectly giving a much larger surface area and thus a much higher chance to successfully tweeze what your are trying to tweeze.  </li>
            <li> Nice for travel</li>
            <li> Its also nice that the mini ones are cheaper.</li>
            <li> The travel tube is nice.</li>
            <li> they look nice.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice tube with a cap on it so that it is protected and you also don&#x27;t poke yourself when reaching in a bag to find it.</li>
            <li> They slant just perfectly and grip very well</li>
            <li> Nicely make.</li>
            <li> it is amazing！so nice so comfortable！</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products really are the best.</li>
            <li> These really are the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> By now, it has noticeably lost some of its sharpness and precision, but still works great--- better than most tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Kind of took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I wanted a very good pair of tweezers, so I bought these--more than I&#x27;d paid for tweezers before, but you get what you pay for, right?  </li>
            <li> Very stylish and comes in many colors which is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes shaping my eyebrows quick work and they do a great job.  </li>
            <li> good strong set of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Very strong tweezers.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned by far!</li>
            <li> Kind of makes tweezing enjoyable....</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best!</li>
            <li> By far the best tweezers we have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The reviews made it sound like this was the most amazing tweezer!</li>
            <li> Great brand, like the mini tweezers better as they feel more comfortable in my hands.</li>
            <li> They work great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers are good and precise.  </li>
            <li> With the clear case they are perfect for purse and travel.</li>
            <li> Nice gripping to them</li>
            <li> They are by far the best.</li>
            <li> (I know, I know, I&#x27;m kind of a cheapskate), but these are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> These are really great tweezers, and the colors are fun.  </li>
            <li> This is a great pair of tweezers and in such a beautiful color of Aqua.</li>
            <li> Does a fairly descent job, but not as good as the higher priced ones, but then again it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes an excellent product, the tweezers were very sharp and worked great.</li>
            <li> Very fine pinch points which is what I was after.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hairs and this grabs them easily!</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t lose them as easily!</li>
            <li> Sit well in your hand, I don&#x27;t have large hands and these tweezers fit perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Great Tweezer&#x27;s, does their job wonderfully, but would recommend full sized ones if you have larger hands.</li>
            <li> This takes so much frustration out of it, and they are sharpened for life for free by the company, which is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think they would make that big a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are impressive tweezers.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman has the best tweezers-  no other comes even close.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a present and was happy with the price and happy with the free eyebrow brush that came with it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have owned one of these, and it works great.</li>
            <li> but i was always pretty happy with my cheaper versions until my cheaper ones disappeared.  </li>
            <li> These are not as good as my full size tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> Love the travel size, fits easy in my purse!</li>
            <li> Very, very precise, hairs don&#x27;t slip out when you pull.</li>
            <li> These are very precise and will grip even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought these about six months ago and love them.</li>
            <li> My Dollar Store tweezers have better grip.</li>
            <li> but I love my Tweezermans.</li>
            <li> (ok, maybe not quite</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my tiny hands, too!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever tried in my entire life!!</li>
            <li> okay, will they grip correctly.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for eyebrows and there&#x27;s not a hair I can&#x27;t get hold of.</li>
            <li> Simply put, Tweezerman makes the best and most cost-efficient tweezers.</li>
            <li> This thing is magic.</li>
            <li> Favorite every-day pair of tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not any better than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another tweezer that was more needle-nose at the tip which does work better than this one.</li>
            <li> precious, no)</li>
            <li> These clip more hairs than pluck them.</li>
            <li> These work better than any pair of tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> and they fall in love immediately.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t affect their utility, must my ego. :)</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a better deal</li>
            <li> Tweezerman offers the best tweezers and they will sharpen for free.</li>
            <li> but I did not read :).</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and overall experience.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with many tweezers over the years that just won&#x27;t get all the hairs I need it to.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tweezer in the world.</li>
            <li> I love that these tweezers come with a plastic tube with a lid.</li>
            <li> I am sure.</li>
            <li> Okay I bought these around 4 months ago</li>
            <li> as well, I recommend you just buy then at the store for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than a Tweezerman for the job.</li>
            <li> they are better than the dollar store variety, but I think you can find better than these at the beauty supply store, or drug store.</li>
            <li> Glad for that</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with this since I love Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> Top notch tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and a good value.  </li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, and they are cheaper than the full-size ones.  </li>
            <li> Not the case here - these things are fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend, my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Carrying case is cheap plastic tube, but effective.</li>
            <li> that I ordered two more</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I would get something that is more durable and better at grasping hairs.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love it to pieces.</li>
            <li> Just make sure they&#x27;re washed thoroughly in alcohol before you send them.</li>
            <li> LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Put one quarter on top of another, and try to use those as tweezers.</li>
            <li> so glad I went with to brand.</li>
            <li> But I think they are more hyped up than they should be.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t tweeze/pick up hair any better than the drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> I love the tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Well, I sure don&#x27;t feel that way any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE tweezerman as they have FREE sharpening online!</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit it:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Tweezers are ok to use.  </li>
            <li> my brows have never been better, and I have cultivated a more mischievous look than ever before.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy more tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and am satisfied with the Tweezer and the container</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for your make-up bag, extra bathroom, I think I have like four pairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Low price, excellent quality!</li>
            <li> I found the tweezers had difficulty gripping eyebrow hair.   </li>
            <li> I have bought many tweezers and clippers and all sorts of Tweezerman products</li>
            <li> If you need more leverage, you should probably be using pliers.</li>
            <li> These are well made and have a precision edge that allows you to grasp even the most stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite tweezer.</li>
            <li> the mini Tweezerman is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love their cute colors, I received the Purple tone which was the one I wanted.</li>
            <li> You will love them.  </li>
            <li> I read such excellent reviews of these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Cute colors.  </li>
            <li> Some are better but for the money and to maybe travel.</li>
            <li> Love Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> and I was able to pull the smallest baby hairs out that wouldn&#x27;t have been picked with the crappy store ones that I have.  </li>
            <li> Gotta love tweezerman</li>
            <li> it came with an eyebrow brush for free!</li>
            <li> These are the only tweezers I can use, they work great!</li>
            <li> Cute designs too.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are a no-brainer for anyone who uses tweezers once a week or more often.</li>
            <li> Perfect tip and slant and a quality that will last.  </li>
            <li> Additionally these are even more slippery if your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work better than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> (ingrowns included)!&lt;br /&gt;Basically, Tweezerman never disappoints, and I love these tweezers despite their size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased tweezers at local stores by this manufacturer but the pair I received from this order were not that great!</li>
            <li> Ever since learning just how much better they are by trying out a girlfriend&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  </li>
            <li> I love this mini tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant on spending more than 3 bucks on tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are really cute</li>
            <li> I never knew you could love a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Rather than gripping onto the hairs for me to pull, it just snips it (</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Comes in a cheap but effective plastic tube for storage.</li>
            <li> Way better than others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of tweezers.</li>
            <li> and she is still looking for better ones.  </li>
            <li> Got the my favorite color purple one.</li>
            <li> Overall--I&#x27;m glad I went with this higher-end brand...</li>
            <li> Much better than at the store.</li>
            <li> or i can handle them better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezerman slant tweezers for many years.</li>
            <li> This mini tweezer is just as good as the regular size but great for travel and carrying in my purse.</li>
            <li> These are possibly the best tweezers ever, even though they are mini they fit my hand just fine and are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> this is easily the best personal care tweezer i have ever purchased</li>
            <li> Very precise and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> but the the squeeze part of it is very smooth and easy to bend</li>
            <li> Very precise and easy to control</li>
            <li> Pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve found in a long time for plucking hairs.</li>
            <li> These are tight, great grip, great size.</li>
            <li> OK product, not sure why it&#x27;s supposed to be the best, honestly, had better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many pairs of locally sold pairs which never work very good, except on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find good tweezers, and these are GREAT!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m so excited about these!</li>
            <li> I like the minis even better than the full size!</li>
            <li> I love how easy they are to use and pull hairs that are shorter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say most people could handle these easily, the travel size is not a sacrifice of function.  </li>
            <li> The bright color makes it pretty easy to find in my bag.</li>
            <li> i love that i can use the fine tip to dig out any ingrown hairs that may be hiding under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s their policy that they won&#x27;t sharpen them unless they&#x27;re clean, because EW, they don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been using those things for!  </li>
            <li> Work ok, have a problem with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Say this to any woman over a certain age: &amp;#34;10X and  a Tweezerman in good light&amp;#34; and she&#x27;ll automatically bring her hand to her chin.</li>
            <li> Kinda high prices :P</li>
            <li> These are very accurate, strong, and light.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest most accurate tweezers.  </li>
            <li> The mini works for me because I can get closer to my brows which makes me more accurate.  </li>
            <li> They still work, but they work more like a cheap drugstore tweezer.</li>
            <li> but they are incredibly precise and do their job phenomenally.</li>
            <li> The quality is top notch, they are milled precisely and grip anything.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll enjoy this product much more.</li>
            <li> After going through many pairs of tweezers, I heard that this brand although on the pricey side was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Precise, cute color, ends align.</li>
            <li> Precise gripping.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything available at walmart.</li>
            <li> The work great though for getting small eyebrow hairs and grip the hair great.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money compared to cheapo store kind.</li>
            <li> Good quality stainless steel that doesn&#x27;t oxidize.</li>
            <li> How many times have you been out and wanted a tweezer for a quick emergency :)  </li>
            <li> I have tried other kinds and these seem to grab hairs the best.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and have the perfect grip.</li>
            <li> They are perfectly aligned and sharp and they do not slip.</li>
            <li> They are excellent and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, portable, and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> ...that makes these easy to take anywhere.</li>
            <li> They are easy to grip and easy to see in the drawer with the color cover on the side.  </li>
            <li> But, I think the travel size is one reason they are so easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to remove hair on the neck or plug your eyebrows with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I love tweexerman tweezers they are the best and work well for plugging even the shortest hairs I had a green pair that vanished</li>
            <li> otherwise I could easily misplace them.  </li>
            <li> These are tiny, fit in a travel case, and work incredibly well.</li>
            <li> As a side note, Tweezerman makes it easy to send them in for sharpening.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Even though it is the travel size, it is still just as easy to use.</li>
            <li> but I noticed very quickly they were behaving like my cheaper pairs of tweezers - hair</li>
            <li> Better than their full size tweezers.</li>
            <li> I like them, but the full sized tweezers work better /</li>
            <li> Very sharp honed edges that are great for even getting the smallest of hairs!</li>
            <li> So perfectly cut, very sharp.</li>
            <li> got lots of fine hair out.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> But works fine.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman was light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> These work super well!</li>
            <li> super cute color.</li>
            <li> tweezer that is worthy of its name!</li>
            <li> Super cute colors (I received mint one).</li>
            <li> I own several, and I love them!</li>
            <li> The tips come perfectly together and the little container they come in to protect them seems so sensible.</li>
            <li> They come with a little tube for storing them in and they&#x27;re just great!</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are great for plucking!</li>
            <li> Best little tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have stated, I think that these tweezers are pretty great!  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Tweezerman tweezers, however, I found these to be ineffective</li>
            <li> Not as fabulous as its put out to be.</li>
            <li> These are great to have in all your different purses.  </li>
            <li> These are really compact but highly effective tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still give it a five-start review, because now I have two awesome green tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have been cheap ones and the get worn out after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> They do not slip and the grip is extremely precise.</li>
            <li> Precise and accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to buy these after finding cheap drug store tweezers being hit or miss.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> but these are more than worth their cost.  </li>
            <li> These work great for their size, but they are tiny when compared to the once you see at the store.</li>
            <li> and they have great holding power when you have a grip on a hair that seems to reach all the way to the next state.</li>
            <li> Overall these tweezers are a great product.</li>
            <li> They are precise and almost painless to use.</li>
            <li> just not a pink kind of person!)</li>
            <li> Comes with a free brow brush.</li>
            <li> They offer free filing if you send it in to them.</li>
            <li> Cheap rip off.</li>
            <li> I carry these in my travel kit for touch ups and the tips are incredibly precise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap to buy the full-size treezerman freezers.  </li>
            <li> b/c they are cheap and I use them every day.</li>
            <li> no flimsy covering and tweezers are great for removing tiny things (I make jewelry).  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave marks and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, plus the free sharpening is a bonus.</li>
            <li> and I mail them to tweezerman for free sharpening.</li>
            <li> they make a great stocking stuffer for your teenage daughters or nieces as well!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the the numerous and great reviews.  </li>
            <li> And wait until you get one and feel what they put on the handles, the color is spongy and it helps it not slip, fabulous.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the guarantee and free lifetime sharpening that comes with a Tweezerman product either.  </li>
            <li> All wins in my book :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too worried about what color I would receive, I just wanted a pair of Tweezerman tweezers at the lowest price available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was apprehensive about spending so much on tweezers</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a pointy tip that I use for getting out ingrown hairs (gross, but hey, not all of us are great at shaving).</li>
            <li> For a few strays here and there, these tweezers are perfect.</li>
            <li> Great Size-prefer this to the regular size.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are such great quality.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never taken advantage of the free sharpening because I never feel like it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this tweezer and the cheap ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers so far.  </li>
            <li> Good size, love the smaller size and price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the ideal hair plucker and I can&#x27;t find any other product on amazon that plucks hair out as well as this one</li>
            <li> If u have a teensy hair, it grabs onto it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The small size is perfect to fit in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands and these fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like that these are a bit smaller and fit quite nicely into my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are totally worth the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I declined to spend more than $5 on tweezers at first</li>
            <li> I recommend just sticking with the original sized Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to tweeze so fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more is there to say;)</li>
            <li> These are way  better than the ones you get for $1 and are far more precise at getting the hairs you want plucked.</li>
            <li> These are small but awesome.</li>
            <li> but so far we are very satisfied with them</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and the recipient has shared many thanks since she started using them!</li>
            <li> so I definitely had to get my own pair!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Tried many that cost twice as much, but nothing even comes close!</li>
            <li> Additionally I generally like the things I get on Amazon and leave good reviews.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love the size and works great at getting out every little hair.</li>
            <li> Nice little tweezers that do a good job.  </li>
            <li> but despite the high price, I thought I&#x27;d be nice and write a review so sweet.</li>
            <li> These are the best, far better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have them everywhere, and they&#x27;re super precise and well made.</li>
            <li> clean your brow.</li>
            <li> arch that much sharper and more precise.  </li>
            <li> This is the far best one and only tweezer to ever use!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even see,  My wife asked me how much did I buy them for she laughed and said I would never pay that much for tweezers</li>
            <li> I think that she likes the full size ones a little more because they are easier to grip with, but these still work great.</li>
            <li> Very nice and sharp, Easy to use for eye brows.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really make a comment on that because this is my first tweezer from tweezerman, but they are the best I have encountered compared to the drugstore brands such as Revlon, Sally Hansen, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously though, Tweezerman is gentle, effective, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your skin, it is a most brilliant useful tiny tool that I will be using daily.</li>
            <li> Forget buying the Walgrens&#x27; house brand special.</li>
            <li> Nice bonus was the clear storage tube to keep the tweezers clean.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, fits in the hand perfectly, extremely portable and most of all super effective!</li>
            <li> Pros: Smaller size, easy to travel with, same sharp great edges that make it one of the best brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> That is the heads of the tweezers are not well design to align just right to grab fine objects or hair.</li>
            <li> While the sharpness won&#x27;t damage your skin or cut you, it is perfect for grabbing onto tiny hairs that are barely there.</li>
            <li> And that is true.</li>
            <li> They still function, if you find that &#x27;sweet&#x27; spot.</li>
            <li> I love my tweezers so much that I buy them as gifts for others that complain about their drugstore tweezers all the time.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I love these tweezers so much, I wrote I poem about them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy tweezers, yes even men because no woman wants their man with a uni-brow :)</li>
            <li> Meanwhile I have a couple more pairs ready to use.</li>
            <li> that wouldn&#x27;t make full contact between the blades when tweezing.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the full size Tweezerman tweezers, which is fantastically.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers so much.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers so much.</li>
            <li> Who cares what color they send (some people complained) they are the best tweezers made.</li>
            <li> Good for tiny brow hairs, and wayward chin and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This is such a good deal.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well--better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> BTW I paid full price for these tweezers</li>
            <li> I love these they work really well and haven&#x27;t dulled at all</li>
            <li> Really good at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> Good plucker and a nice size for my do small hands.</li>
            <li> Great for pulling hairs, grabbing small pieces of electronics when I work on them, and very handy to have in general.</li>
            <li> although this was the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size, i really don&#x27;t see the need to buy the full size, other than to have more than one of this really great tool.</li>
            <li> I love this size even more than the original, larger, size.</li>
            <li> I mean they&#x27;re tweezers but these have to be the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Order came very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers that stay sharp.</li>
            <li> I did end up getting the color shown, but I would have been happy with just about any other color too.</li>
            <li> Other than the color, these tweezers are excellent, with a FAR superior grip and performance than the $20 Revlon tweezers my ex left at my house when we broke up 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> They are adequate but they commit the cardinal sin of tweezing---  </li>
            <li> Product as stated&lt;br /&gt;arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I love that it came with a storage tube and plan to get several more for my purse and travel bag.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t just grab quickly and then yank like a maniac</li>
            <li> and I just happened to get lucky.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few times.. and it suchs a short period of time its not so great..</li>
            <li> I bought this produce after watching many YouTube videos that highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife is extremely picky with her tweezers and wanted an extra one at the condo,&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with these, and not an easy one to please when it comes to the ability to pluck stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Or you&#x27;ll buy another cheap pair totaling the price of these in the first place.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, stayed sharp for months!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very precise and nice and compact but they&#x27;re sharp!</li>
            <li> Great little tweezers; just had to get used to the mini size, as I always use full size.</li>
            <li> I love this new portable mini-slant tweezer.</li>
            <li> The standard are almost too long but these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly after, but it does a pretty good job for the price.</li>
            <li> Very compact and easy to store and take with me in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had a pair for four years and says they work really well and are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re all that &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, since they&#x27;re still easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Worked good to extract the one single stubborn whisker on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I find that the smaller &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size is actually better!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more Tweezerman products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first pair (also in travel size) for going on eight years!</li>
            <li> it does exactly what you&#x27;d want it to!</li>
            <li> Great little tweezer.  </li>
            <li> Great little set of tweezer that work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great little tweezers</li>
            <li> Great little set of tweezers and case.</li>
            <li> These little guys work great.</li>
            <li> However, they are a great size for your purse and come with a little carry case (plastic).  </li>
            <li> Great little pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> They work great and the little carrying bottle is really useful.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, which makes it really easy to pluck hairs, or remove splinters.</li>
            <li> They really grip the fine hairs along my brows, and the angle is just right.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy mine were green.</li>
            <li> Bought a second pair because I just loved my first so much!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you need a more precise tool, like removing tiny chin hairs....</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> The only tweezers I ever want to own.</li>
            <li> If they last even a year I&#x27;ll be thrilled (but hopefully longer)</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t carry the same kind anymore</li>
            <li> When I found these, I was a bit surprised about the price (I was sure that it meant that you would receive the three tweezers pictured, until I read the description), but now that they are here I get it.</li>
            <li> Worth it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> however, i can see perhaps the need if someone had arthritis or similar mobility/flexibility limitations -- the full-size may come in handy for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kinda prefer my old one over this, but it will do for now until I find a better one.</li>
            <li> Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what Tweezerman calls the Point) variety for medical needs like splinter removal and ingrown hairs, because they&#x27;re sharper and more precise.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I had to sterilize mine and get him his own pair</li>
            <li> That peace of mind is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I honestly use them daily to combat my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I own a regular sized Tweezerman Tweezer but wanted one for travel/</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> This is so so so worth your money.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I think that they are worth the price of them.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> it tweezes effortlessly and is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I received these in red, and the color looks nice.</li>
            <li> I thought there was no way these tweezers could be worth the price - but they are.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used, by such a wide margin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> My old dime store pair work better for me than these.</li>
            <li> It took me several days to get used to the angle of the end--but now that I am--I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Far, far superior.</li>
            <li> The little can to storing it is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> These work great for the hairs that are long enough to easily grab, but</li>
            <li> They work great for pulling out small hairs and don&#x27;t slide around on the hair at all, just a quick pull and the hair is out.</li>
            <li> and they work great on those little pesky hairs that no other tweezers seem to be able to grab.</li>
            <li> Yes, they also happily grab and de-root those gnarly grandma chin hairs that unexpectedly appear overnight for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li> But if this also happens to you, fair warning that these Tweezerman&#x27;s are SHARP.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other tweezers you&#x27;ll find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It really is incredibly precise and strong - mine came in a nice green color, which was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers right after Christmas.  </li>
            <li> got right into the skin.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good, but I was replacing a pair of Tweezerman tweezers that had a sharp pointed tip, and these aren&#x27;t as effective in grabbing the very short hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect tweezers for the past 5 years when I discovered the 20 year old tweezers I was using were no longer made and/or being sold anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Good but too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent tweezers, but nothing fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so much luck in being able to tweeze my fine and short chin hairs.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this one comes with a tube, but the tube is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, will use everyday!</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the extra money, they are actually worth more.</li>
            <li> Their higher price is worth it.</li>
            <li> These will stay quite sharp for a long time and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> I had a large pair floating around in my purse, but I got tired of getting stabbed by them when I&#x27;m rummaging around in there for things, so these were a perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Initially I was blown away by how precise these allowed me to get - pretty easy to grip my brow hairs.</li>
            <li> The size hasn&#x27;t really made a difference, and they come with a great little case.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and good quality</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, but very sharp.</li>
            <li> One  could reasonably expect that for that kind of money you get multiple.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer</li>
            <li> I actually like the small size better than a full size tweezer because I can grip it well and can get better leverage and thus better plucking power.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how easily it got an ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> Before Tweezerman, it was a constant battle to consistently find a good tweezer that could pluck both fine and thick hairs, it was often hit or miss, most didn&#x27;t work well,</li>
            <li> Hard to grab hairs have no chance agsinst these tweezers easy to use to making your face bleed with cheap tweezers and not getting hsir love them</li>
            <li> The tips are also very fine, so if you are removing a small splinter, you will be able to move the tweezers into the skin more deeply than with a blunter pair.  </li>
            <li> The mini slants are best for eyebrows but are also effective for random single hairs that pop up on the face.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but a little pricy.</li>
            <li> Good little tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Hard to grip but does a great job</li>
            <li> work exactly as decribed</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many tweezers that don&#x27;t do the one and only thing they are supposed to do…grab a hair and pull it out!  </li>
            <li> They also last forever unless they get dropped too many times and the alignment becomes too off.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first pair of Tweezerman and</li>
            <li> The ones that cost a dollar at my local pharmacy are much better.</li>
            <li> My second set and I love them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty frugal</li>
            <li> Cheap tweezers don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> They work really well!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t recall the first one shipping with a case.)</li>
            <li> While a name like tweezerman does not conjure up the same cachet as others, don&#x27;t worry; you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> My first Tweezerman tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I also love the extra eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the tweezer</li>
            <li> Love the smaller size!</li>
            <li> Bought my first pair retail and they worked so well</li>
            <li> there was that big of a difference between cheapie tweezers and something of more quality.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them I think I plucked a pound of hair</li>
            <li> The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well!  </li>
            <li> you can send them back to be sharpened FOR FREE!  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t find that they can get the itty bitty hairs any better than the generic ones i have.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a mini tweezer.</li>
            <li> but I refused to pay the higher price that they charged and bought all the discount brands.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers I will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> but then again colors dont make pretty eyebrows</li>
            <li> They are very tiny and I would rate their performance as just OK.</li>
            <li> Grabs every hair on the first try.</li>
            <li> This is the only set I have found that is precise!</li>
            <li> I love its tiny size!</li>
            <li> Never fails at grabbing a hair.</li>
            <li> They are MINI, which I didn&#x27;t realize at first, but that&#x27;s my mistake.  </li>
            <li> so gave these a go figuring the tip was really what mattered!).</li>
            <li> I need to invest in a better pair, but for your basic tweezing needs, these tweezers will suffice.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Wish they were the pretty purple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I kept buying pair after pair of crappy tweezers that would break hairs or not grasp on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When they first arrived.</li>
            <li> My advice for owners: make sure to use these tweezers ONLY for plucking hair.</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but works really well!</li>
            <li> size vs the larger size as it seems I can grip it better / have better control when I&#x27;m trying to grab that tiny errant brow hair.</li>
            <li> Got a pair for my husband as well -we&#x27;re always fighting over &amp;#34;the good tweezers&amp;#34;.  Have been using a few months.  </li>
            <li> More like scissors the tweezers, the point where the edges meet is so sharp if you exert any pressure the trapper hair is more likely to get a clean cut than get plucked.  </li>
            <li> The slant makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re plucking &amp; pulling at while the flat, thick handle makes it easy to have a good grip.</li>
            <li> still a great little tweezer, super sharp for precise plucking.</li>
            <li> Defiantly mini but more than fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Theyre small but precise and make eyebrow grooming very easy</li>
            <li> This little mini tweezer is more accurate</li>
            <li> Sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li> Like I mentioned before, I have a mini slant pair for travel and a full-size slant pair for home use, and honestly, I have no preference of one over the other.</li>
            <li> I have 2 tweezermans, so I have one handy when I send in the other one.</li>
            <li> Mine personally lasted for about 6 months before I was starting to notice the tweezers not functioning as great as they first did when they were brand new.</li>
            <li> The slanted, sharp tip makes it easy to precisely get the hair you&#x27;re meaning to pluck.  </li>
            <li> I love tweezerman tweezers, but felt these got dull quicker than most.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best tweezers I have ever used, they are wonderful at getting the tiny baby stray eyebrow hairs which I have found nearly impossible to remove with every other tweezer except these.</li>
            <li> It took three weeks the one time I did it, and my old pair came back as good as new.</li>
            <li> A good Tweezerman should last a while with proper use and care.</li>
            <li> BUT after you&#x27;ve been using them for a while, and then try to use the full size tweezers, I find the full size ones are now awkwardly big!  </li>
            <li> These are far far better than low-end tweezers.  </li>
            <li> The little tweezers that came in my car&#x27;s first aid kit work better!  </li>
            <li> Love it small and easy to use also.</li>
            <li> Came with a clear carry case which I think is cool.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so precise, other tweezers just feel cheap now.</li>
            <li> when i first received these i didn&#x27;t really like them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, which is good for travel</li>
            <li> Good tweezers and I like how small but durable they are.</li>
            <li> Seriously these things are great- plucking my eyebrows no longer results in watery eyes, because I really can&#x27;t feel them being pulled out with these.  </li>
            <li> and they kind of let me down.</li>
            <li> Not bad for little tweezer, can get most hair with them.</li>
            <li> I purchased them at our local military exchange and have been very happy with how well they grip when I&#x27;m tweezing my brows, rarely slipping and making me tug the same hair more than once.  </li>
            <li> I love these tweezers especially since they are easy to take on the go and everyone who has used a set of tweevzerman tweezer&#x27;s know that they are quality, however, i ordered purple and received hot pink.  </li>
            <li> They are easy on wrist and arthritic fingers and comfortably sized, whereas the regular full size Tweezerman tweezers are ridiculously huge and hard to hold, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> - so they will certainly pluck hairs with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you tweeze about it, all the money you spend over the years, buying cheap 1 dollar tweezers that barely work after one tweeze, could be much MUCH better spent on 1 pair of these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> It holds brow hair quite tight and is handy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay for the full sized but these little ones are great at pulling hairs other tweezers</li>
            <li> The ends are very fine and sharp.</li>
            <li> sharp and small, works perfect!  </li>
            <li> The tweezers work well, grasping tiny fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous tweezers and always had problems with fine pick ups.</li>
            <li> These tweezers don&#x27;t close enough to grab the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever just used cheappie tweezers from Target, and i thought they worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It does not get the fine hairs or short ones.</li>
            <li> metal is super solid, and these have enough gripping power to tear skin</li>
            <li> I purchsed this item because we did not have a decent pair of tweezers in the house and no sooner than they arrived, we needed them to pull out cactii needles from hands!  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a little plastic tubing case which is nice because I have not lost them once.</li>
            <li> Nice little carry case for travel.</li>
            <li> Even comes with its own little case.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to transport, easy to use, etc.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking &amp;#34;my tweezers can&#x27;t really grab short or fine hairs&amp;#34; get these.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated Tweezerman tweezers for about $12.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still great especially for a little makeup bag for your purse</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good pair that will still pull the smallest hair after repeated use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and catches any loose brow or chin hairs on the first try.</li>
            <li> The last time i ordered these tweezers they were super sharp and worked amazingly .</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very used to using this length of tweezers and have been for years.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my grown daughter, but I like it so much I will probably order one for myself.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to cheap ones</li>
            <li> mini slant tweezer is not that much smaller than the regular size tweezer, but it comes in it&#x27;s own plastic case and it&#x27;s very convenient as a portable tweezer.</li>
            <li> :) Both times, I got chosen the pink color.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why I was paying so much for tweezers and when they came I started to wonder again.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a very mini plastic cover</li>
            <li> they work very well.</li>
            <li> What is there to say really?</li>
            <li> she wants 1</li>
            <li> The tweezers cost too much to be made like junk.  </li>
            <li> really, It doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish these weren&#x27;t purple, but there were no color options when I ordered.</li>
            <li> and work very well.</li>
            <li> and they are an absolute steal.  </li>
            <li> I am very choosy about my tweezwers....</li>
            <li> arrived in pink but decided to keep and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper ones don&#x27;t seem to work very well...</li>
            <li> I have hard-to-tame eyebrows and a would-be unibrow thanks to genetics.</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> These seem to be holding up very well</li>
            <li> works very well, even bought one for my daughter</li>
            <li> I never struggled with getting the whole hair out at the root.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very flimsy and do not grab well.</li>
            <li> Not just because I like it so much but also because my daughter lost hers and took mine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even applying that much pressure).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use them much</li>
            <li> Very noticeable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work very well</li>
            <li> Alright tweezers but 11$ is a bit much.</li>
            <li> For $11 I expected more.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what all the rave reviews were about -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, I have always bought cheap tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old one which still works better.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with teasing my eyebrows and these are by far the best tweezers i have ever used.</li>
            <li> If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> Fot that much money I expected a better pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The most important thing she considers when buying tweezers is how thick the edge is.</li>
            <li> Well, these are pretty &#x27;mini&#x27; as the title suggests - big enough to tweeze my brows but def smaller than what I&#x27;ve been used to (honestly, I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the full size version</li>
            <li> Although these tweezers ultimately get their goal, I don&#x27;t think that they are much better than my old ones.</li>
            <li> But these are not the same quality as my old Tweezermans--they are definitely better than cheapies from Walmart</li>
            <li> Good product, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> and they have a very precise and sharp tip.  </li>
            <li> They do grasp little fine hairs and coarse hairs easily, but watch out!</li>
            <li> Nice sharp clear edges that can grab even the finest of hairs.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize how sharp and effective tweezers can be until I literally couldn&#x27;t pull one eyebrow hair out with my old pair anymore.  </li>
            <li> To the touch, the new ones feel a tiny bit sharper at the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; point, but aren&#x27;t easily distinguishable besides that.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I have better control over  it due to</li>
            <li> They grab even the thinnest of hairs and are able to pull them out when other tweezers won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They are pricey for tweezers and are better than other brands</li>
            <li> so many other tweezers tend to do.</li>
            <li> I love tweezerman tweezers because they are sharp and well-made.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers</li>
            <li> As a result, they provide better grip for removing hair than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> these are sharp and precise; what else can you say about a pair of tweezers?!?  </li>
            <li> These are so much better than the other tweezers I had around.  </li>
            <li> These work better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Tweezerman&#x27;s a few times in the past - they&#x27;ve always been the best!</li>
            <li> They work great and are small enough to carry in your purse/makeup bag</li>
            <li> My needle-nose pair lives in the first aid kit most of the time, because I don&#x27;t want something that sharp anywhere near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to use, and comes in a handy little keep-safe tube.</li>
            <li> Great price, less than half of what I paid for my first pair in a store...</li>
            <li> Might just get a fresh new pair of my old version (revlon, with the handles like an eyelash curler), and save these for what it appears they were intended.. Travel.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so the full size aren&#x27;t always easy for me to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find the older style Tweezerman tweezers that had a less sharp edge, but worked great on brows.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and precise, and get even the smallest hairs the first time.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another type of tweezer as long as these are available.</li>
            <li> Small size is nice for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are small but effective, they hold hair, skin, whatever you want to pull off your body with ease</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m just going to purchase the full size</li>
            <li> However, my current full-sized, stainless steel pair have dulled finally (after a couple of years), so it was nice to use these very sharp and precise ones.</li>
            <li> maybe a little bit too much :-)</li>
            <li> Good little tweezers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They really do &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than your average tweezer!</li>
            <li> Something can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> I cant live without my tweezers!</li>
            <li> Tweezermans come very sharp and grip every hair i love them</li>
            <li> easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2 inches roughly in length.</li>
            <li> I like this smaller one better than the larger.</li>
            <li> The second time and subsequently, everything came together and I am now glad I did purchase this tweezer and would recommend itl</li>
            <li> One thing you should be careful of is that it is possible to poke yourself with them (and pierce your skin) if you get too enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause I was looking for a particular color and was under the impression I had chosen that color and when d-day arrived</li>
            <li> They are precise fitting and grab thin hairs.  </li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li> For the first few months, however, this tweezer did an AMAZING job at grabbing tiny hairs and just-grown-in brow stubble.</li>
            <li> and I decided to get a second one and possibly send off the first for the free sharpening offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are precisely milled and shaped such that they grip along the entire tweezer face, not just the very tip or along part of the face as many other pairs of tweezers do.  </li>
            <li> They grab when they are supposed to grab &amp; they are small enough to fit in my hand &amp; be able to maneuver around with them.  </li>
            <li> The ends close evenly and tight, which I love.</li>
            <li> High quality and works for on the go time.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these tweezers to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality tweezers at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> High quality and works well for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Tweezerman slant tweezers.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers</li>
            <li> High quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I received a pink one, but that was fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Works better than all the other brands I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Just a cute little tweezer.</li>
            <li> Love the little packing tube as well.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so cute too and it comes with a tube container for the little tweezer.</li>
            <li> These tweezers seem top quality but a little over priced to me.</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and buy Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I love my tweezers and the little travel tube case</li>
            <li> Due to the small size you need to use more strength for grip, most of the time it just doesnt grip the hair or blackheads.</li>
            <li> I am not sure HOW they differ from my crappy 2 dollar tweezers but they certainly make a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> Sharp and strong, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am a penny pincher, and spending this much on tweezers had me nearly in tears</li>
            <li> Will buy a few more.</li>
            <li> Love these... weirdly small but work really well</li>
            <li> My mom used to tell me that Tweezermans are the only brand of tweezers I should buy, so they&#x27;re pretty much all I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, they will last and be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Love the slant, cute colors, seems heavy duty - should last a long time.</li>
            <li> personally I think it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Green is my favorite color</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so much better than my Revlon tweezers that I&#x27;ve been using them everyday.</li>
            <li> but they do the job and are pretty much on the line of basic transportation.  </li>
            <li> Save these lovely little tools for what they are intended or risk needing a new pair.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive mine in hot pink, the very color that I wanted!</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I anticipate, but my eyebrows have never looked better!  </li>
            <li> my Revlon work better for far less cost.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it pinches me so easily, and the pinches HURT, but maybe that;s because I&#x27;ve only been tweezing my eyebrows about once a week for just a year now</li>
            <li> My wife has gone through many tweezer manufacturers and this is the only one that works for her, she uses them daily and will settle for no other.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work great for rmoving very thin cactus stickers.</li>
            <li> And I bought a lot of other brands but they soon broke or were garbage, The tweezers would not come together precisely</li>
            <li> Not as sharp or precise as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> Mine are green and the little tube is a great size for your purse.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence due the price, go for it, they also come with lifetime sharpening and will replace them for free if the nipper spring breaks.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size because it comes with its own little storage tube which protects them.  </li>
            <li> I was shipped the blue ones and they came with a little case so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly they are nothing like the tweezers at the drug store, they actually tweeze every time, instead of forcing you to waste time tweezing at things until the tweezers finally align right and tweeze what you are trying to tweeze.   </li>
            <li> pulled my first sliver with them the other day, they were the right tool for the job...</li>
            <li> I purchased two new pairs in the purple color</li>
            <li> I lost mine once and ordered a new pair within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> Live with the trees and the seas and the breeze, no longer being haunted by that sneeze you could not tweeze.</li>
            <li> I was in the beauty section of target looking for a new pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I live for tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> Small but very precise.  </li>
            <li> so if you are looking for tweezers that work well for the average hair plucking, these are absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers!</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the tip alignment is perfect, but it&#x27;s too sharp :(</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a very old Tweezerman tweezer.</li>
            <li> By hair, I mean, whisker, which I really didn&#x27;t want to confess.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because the first one I bought several years ago was so tight and pulled hair out from the root so easily.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to grip with no slipping out of the hand.</li>
            <li> only thing I would complain about is that the picture shows a pretty purple tweezer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Its small but able to get out stubborn hairs and makes maintaining eyebrows in between waxings a breeze.</li>
            <li> Sure, they should read the small print, but you can do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li> /&gt;These tweezers are the perfect size for my small hands, although it&#x27;s a travel size so it may be too small for someone with larger hands.  </li>
            <li> The first set I ruined by grasping cellophane wrappers on various makeup containers to rip them off.  </li>
            <li> To me, this is no better than a revlon tweezer and it costs more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, and I thought it was a three pack, but the tweezers overall is really nice.</li>
            <li> Love the small size.</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs rather then pulling them even when squeezing gently.&lt;br /&gt;There are other tweezers by the same brand that are MUCH better</li>
            <li> (note: my only, only regret is that it comes in so many colours -- i actually hoped aloud &amp;#34;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> They just WORK, the way most tweezers should, but usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s efficient, sturdy, and small.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers... I&#x27;ve wasted money regularly on the cheap &amp;#34;check out line&amp;#34; tweezers in the past, but these have the feel that tells me they will last.  </li>
            <li> I actually found that when trying to pull super fine hairs out of my eyebrows, this would actually cut and clip the hair where I applied the pressure – that&#x27;s how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper than buying a whole new tweezer!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so easy to use and find all those little hairs.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work great,  a little on the small side</li>
            <li> There are a little small, but work just great.</li>
            <li> No comparison between this new one and my old one.</li>
            <li> It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the price on the tweezerman tweezers, i really expected something extra special!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about them is that they have a surprisingly good grip, which makes for really accurate (and less painful) tweezing!</li>
            <li> Accurate tweezers with tight grasp and sufficient recoil when opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are both too sharp and small to get a good grip.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are expensive but in my experience they are the best.  </li>
            <li> Love these little tweezers (this is about the fourth I&#x27;ve bought; two I have and one each for two family members).</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re small (but not too small), so that I have better control over tweezing fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Most People dont realize tweezers get dull and</li>
            <li> I believe not doing so made my tweezer more dull.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and you need to protect the tip, but that is easy enough</li>
            <li> Very well made, much better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve used previous.</li>
            <li> make it clear</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> too much money for just regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> These replace a 5 year old pair that I lost.</li>
            <li> but now I won&#x27;t go near my old Revlon tweezers.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel but find I use them quite frequently.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really be able to thwart an attack with your Tweezermans, but at least you won&#x27;t have a unibrow.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly so far.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried 5-6 so far.</li>
            <li> Wish I had of upgraded my old pair ages ago&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of tweezers, but in several months of near-daily use, they haven&#x27;t lost their sharpness and tweezing abilities!</li>
            <li> My old tweezers lost their precision and some grip, but once I got the hair</li>
            <li> So far, they are terrific, and if they last, they will be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is very Mini and too short for me.</li>
            <li> I recommend for someone that wants a very short tweezer, I would not buy this again, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its products to keep them at their hair-plucking finest.  </li>
            <li> They really do the job and come with a tiny plastic carrying case if you want to stash them in your purse.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair completely out.</li>
            <li> I bought this Mini Slant Tweezer to replace my old tweezers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more of these to keep in my travel stuff and for a spare, etc.</li>
            <li> Pretty decently made, but I find that the one edge is too sharp sometimes and stabs me when I&#x27;m trying to tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The tip of the tweezers are very precise and can easily grab onto and pull out those tricky hairs that seem almost impossible to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little tube it comes in is really useful as well!</li>
            <li> was slipping through, the grip wasn&#x27;t right, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s small and can easily get those stubborn brow hairs out.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get to pick the color, but they are small and easily portable.</li>
            <li> Grabs small hairs easily.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> and I had to dry my tears and invest in a new pair.&lt;br /&gt;After much research I decided on the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> It was a no-brainer than I had to get back on Amazon and order a second one which arrived yesterday and this one has a pretty clear case.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re small and come with a storage tube, I think I&#x27;ll relegate these to my purse as my &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; tweezers and stick with cheaper Revlon ones that actually work better for my day-to-day needs.</li>
            <li> I had the first one for about a year before I left it in Las Vegas by accident during a recent trip.</li>
            <li> - coarse beard hair that older women sprout.</li>
            <li> I would recommend just buying the full size as they are really not that much larger.</li>
            <li> I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27;</li>
            <li> tweezers are small, no question -- but I actually like the size, because you can control them a bit better.</li>
            <li> not bad, a little bit pricy</li>
            <li> I held out such high hopes for these tweezers</li>
            <li> Size is large enough to use with man hands, and small enough to easily store.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is to be careful you don&#x27;t injure yourself with the tips, as they are fine enough to be sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other brand compares!</li>
            <li> These are a little sharp on the ends, so they are really designed for fine tweezing.</li>
            <li> Their size does not make them awkward to use, but somehow the larger tweezers are more comfortable</li>
            <li> Pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well and the small tube case is handy.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to the size as they&#x27;re definitely &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, though they&#x27;re still big enough to be used conveniently and have the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> They come with a little clear plastic tube that is pretty useless to me (it might be good for travel?).</li>
            <li> My eyebrow area got a little red after I used them they are so precise.  </li>
            <li> but I expected more from it because it was a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I have used mine for nearly ten years and it&#x27;s still super sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving up and buying a new, different pair.</li>
            <li> After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair.</li>
            <li> I then bought two more and received the pink version and a kelly green not pictured here.</li>
            <li> really did not think tweezers would be such a big deal to me, but here I am.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those annoying nose hairs and daily fight of the uno-brow.</li>
            <li> Very precise, not too sharp, firm grip</li>
            <li> No other tweezers come close.</li>
            <li> if a tweezer is sharp it will grab those pesky little hairs better.  </li>
            <li> I had a favorite pair of tweezers that never let me down for about 8 years but they broke in half</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying such small tweezers, especially for the price, but they are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> yes middle age where suddenly unwanted hair on my face is new for me!  </li>
            <li> This size is okay for travel or your purse but would prefer a larger size for serious use.</li>
            <li> If your tweezers get dull you can send it in with no shipping cost or fee whatsoever and they will sharpen it for you free of charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also Tweezerman provides a lifetime guarantee for the tweezers, sharpening them for free of charge if the tweezers ever become dull.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and took me a little while to be able to work with them.  </li>
            <li> but as a guy I really would&#x27;ve preferred not to have pink.  </li>
            <li> :O  </li>
            <li> Much shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Those Revlons also had a horrendous hot pink trim, so the purple of the Tweezermans is actually somewhat of an improvement,</li>
            <li> The tube it came packaged in is difficult to use but it will store the tweezers effectively when not in use.</li>
            <li> OK, but definately not great.  </li>
            <li> The larger ones that cost around $20 are worth the price, hands down.</li>
            <li> Next time I need a new pair of tweezers I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> If (when, actually) I lose them, I will buy a new pair of the same.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is amazingly sharp and certainly remove even the smallest hair.</li>
            <li> Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even smaller they would have been good because they have a firm precision that makes them work well even when I am not perfect in tweezing a particular lash!</li>
            <li> They came in their own little tube, too, which will protect them from getting dull bumping around in my drawer.</li>
            <li> It grabs the hairs and it works fine, but it&#x27;s not AMAZING because sometimes, it wouldn&#x27;t grab my smaller hairs.</li>
            <li> but on any of my thinner hairs, it will just cut them right in half!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference from any other pair of tweezers I have owned...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small but works fantastic.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very small and light weight that did not pull my wives, daughters, or sons hair out at all.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and really grab the hair.</li>
            <li> This would not have been a big deal if it were any other color, except for the fact that hot pink is my least favorite color.</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered a new pair because I can not live without them.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the mini pair offers the same performance as the full-size pair in a smaller package.</li>
            <li> The slanted edges fit tightly together, so it works extremely well at grabbing the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> Pulls the little hairs out on the first try.  </li>
            <li> Plain old stainless steel.</li>
            <li> The smaller size felt odd at first</li>
            <li> The tip is very sharp and grips little hairs very well while getting right next to the root.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t really think that tweezers could be  very different from each other.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered was mint green.</li>
            <li> I also like the pretty mint green color.</li>
            <li> They work amazing and are small enough that they are more convenient to take with in a purse or make-up bag, but not too small that they are hard to use - I am a tweerman purchaser for life!!</li>
            <li> Super sharp so be careful and pretty small.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first when I read several reviews saying the quality is lower and what not.</li>
            <li> I have bought 5-6 different Tweezerman products after that first little one.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they&#x27;re small and they came with a little container since I had planned to use them in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> quickly became dull after about 1 week of use</li>
            <li> The tweezerman tweezers have a thin edge which makes it easy to grab on to things.</li>
            <li> But it comes in a little case and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> although this little guy is a bit more expensive than others, I feel it is worth the extra money spent.</li>
            <li> that my regular tweezers and is much easier to carry in my purse to pick off those ugly facial hairs that always seem to appear when you look in the car mirror on your way to somewhere important!  </li>
            <li> I am just used to digging right in with my dull ones that I will throw away.  </li>
            <li> This is such a high quality little tweezer.  </li>
            <li> brand new and sharp again!</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problem with hairs breaking off like some other reviewers</li>
            <li> The only drawback I didn&#x27;t like was when ordering, I was not able to choose my particular design or color that suited my personal preference and only got the color they sent me.</li>
            <li> 12 bucks is a little much for a single pair of mini tweezers.</li>
            <li> I often get tiny coarse neck-hairs of a very dark color and with my old tweezers I&#x27;d have to dig at myself forever to get the tiny hair out or wait until it was long enough to be noticed by everyone.</li>
            <li> At first, I had a hard time justifying a $10+ pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> I tried it on the first few hairs before falling back to my trustee no-brand black tweezers I got from the local store.  </li>
            <li> After pulling a short, dark brow hair, I looked and a nearly invisible, super thin hair had also been pulled.  </li>
            <li> These are almost too sharp and will occasionally pull at my skin if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> They last a long time and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I know it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> just flat out don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> however, i cannot rate it down for that, as it is clearly stated and does what it should.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m far from &#x27;metro&#x27; but these little guys will make you immediately realize how sub-par the generic drug-store brand tweezers perform.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel, but I would buy these for everyday use too if I needed a new pair.</li>
            <li> They work just about as well as my old tweezers that cost probably $10 less.</li>
            <li> The dark grey ones are brand-new, and the purple polka-dot ones are three years old.</li>
            <li> but im definitely not throwing them out because it does work , just alittle harder to use then regular sized tweezers.</li>
            <li> It comes in a little plastic case which helps them to stay straight while be pummeled by the other items in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Can barely use due to size.</li>
            <li> Very precise and gets any tough or small hair.</li>
            <li> As a result, it&#x27;s really ineffective for grasping a single hair or small splinter.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my larger ones but less expensive and more portable.</li>
            <li> These are fine tweezers, don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> They stay sharp, and they are the only tweezer that I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li> One day, I saw this smaller size Tweezerman Slant Tweezer and notice that the price of the smaller one was less than the larger size.</li>
            <li> I returned these because they weren&#x27;t sharp and they were extra big; not minis as described.</li>
            <li> Decent tweezers but not better than any others I got</li>
            <li> Comes with a little clear tube with a lid to keep the tweezers in.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment and cannot compare to any other pair used in the past!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to get a much cheaper pair, but then I remembered how dull the cheaper ones get.</li>
            <li> His are dark grey and manly, and they&#x27;re also new and sharp, so I doubt he&#x27;ll keep using my purple polka-dotted ones.</li>
            <li> Very glad I didn&#x27;t wind up with the ugly pink ones.</li>
            <li> and I have been waxing, shaving, and tweezing for almost as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> gave me a pink one, I&#x27;m not too upset about it because it&#x27;s not like anyone actually watches me tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The lifespan is quite long though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long it took me to bite the bullet and purchase a pair of Tweezermans.</li>
            <li> It only came with one pink tweezers.</li>
            <li> Might be harder to hold for people with larger hands?&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will treat this with care and hopefully keep it a long time.</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had bought these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> The pink tweezer I received was a bit bigger than my thumb.</li>
            <li> Were smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> This works so well for tiny hairs on my face that I rue the time I spent struggling before I found them.</li>
            <li> When it came it was much smaller than expected (though that&#x27;s my fault, should have read the product specifications), but don&#x27;t let that stop you -</li>
            <li> but they are not nearly as precise as my old Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> and you know when you wake up it&#x27;ll be 5 inches long?  </li>
            <li> A wee bit pricy for such a simple product, but they grab little and big hairs both, without being so sharp that they simply cut them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they work any better than less expensive versions.</li>
            <li> Not any better than a way less expensive pair by Revelon.</li>
            <li> but I found a similar pair of tweezers for much less at a local store.</li>
            <li> Every hair I grab with this tweezer actually holds on (where as the drugstore tweezers would only hold on half the time and</li>
            <li> (I know there are other uses, but this is the basic one.)  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well with tiny stubborn eyebrow hairs!</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to break the skin, if you need to.</li>
            <li> they are so sharp that they can actually *cut* off the hairs before you get a chance to yank them out.</li>
            <li> Very small, very well made.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe other people have had the same problem with getting their Tweezermans stolen and used by partners.</li>
            <li> The smaller size takes a little getting used to though, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> The ends is sharp enough and it holds the hair well.  </li>
            <li> other brands don&#x27;t pick up the tiny hairs as well as a tweezerman tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived for so long without these tweezers!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have believed the difference between a three dollar pair of tweezers and the Tweezerman, had I not owned all of the different brands that I have wasted money on all of these years, if I hadn&#x27;t finally bought this pair, and tried them for myself.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a single difference using a compact tweezer.</li>
            <li> I mainly use them for applying eyelashes though which works wonders since it&#x27;s so small!</li>
            <li> The blades are very tight, so it works very well with little to no</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the reason - but they were much too sharp where they touched the skin, and somehow still not effective at grabbing hairs.</li>
            <li> I will probably try a different brand; these tweezers were not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort of returning the regular size Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and felt slightly crazy about paying so much for one pair of tweezers, but they are fairly amazing.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t loose the cap.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t loose them.  </li>
            <li> But they would get dull and I&#x27;ll be out again purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought the smallest tweezerman tweezer.</li>
            <li> The only hang up I have about them is that they are a little sharp so you have to be careful not to grab your skin as it will hurt and very occasionally they will grab a hair and cut it instead of pull it with their sharpness</li>
            <li> I actually think I prefer the small version compared to the larger ones, but this may be because I have short-ish fingers</li>
            <li> I bought a different pair for $2 less,</li>
            <li> I was using a crappy pair that came with a nail kit, and they would end up breaking the hair in half instead of actually pulling it out.  </li>
            <li> too small and does not open wide enough ... would not recommend it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid $12.00 for one single pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> Its definitely a precision instrument; its aligned and clamps tightly without any gaps.  </li>
            <li> They get the tiniest little hairs growing where hairs should never grow on a female!</li>
            <li> The smaller size took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old, dull revlon tweezer</li>
            <li> Trust me, you&#x27;re more likely to lose these tweezers before they dull or fail on you, and if they do become dull, you can just send them back to be sharpened.</li>
            <li> They do not work quite as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these and the only reason is because I have dropped them before and the tips have bent when hitting the floor.</li>
            <li> Just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Pink is my kryptonite and being tortured with it as a kid</li>
            <li> Pink...</li>
            <li> These tweezers did not pull ingrown hairs like I expected them to.</li>
            <li> I try to be careful, but they still get me quite often.  </li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The tweezers were tinier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend the bigger one for everyday use though.</li>
            <li> let mine be pink!&amp;#34; -- and, you guessed it, i got pink.</li>
            <li> I got pink.  </li>
            <li> so well you have to be careful not to pinch your skin.</li>
            <li> so I can accomplish the task in minimal time along with a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 100</li>
            <li> the edges are rough.</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to finally buy this gem.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit smaller than I was expecting, and color was lime green when they showed up.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for price.</li>
            <li> sometimes ridiculously expensive - they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li> Mine also came with an eyebrow brush that pushes up and can be closed too.</li>
            <li> Got the pink one, figures, wish you could choose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned tweezers that worked even remotely this well before.</li>
            <li> They are &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - not great at getting ingrown hairs or things like that, but otherwise no complaints really.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these mini tweezers in pink.  </li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a sharp, tight tweezer that was a cut above what I could find at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger (and some color other than pink), but I knew what I was buying.  </li>
            <li> But after a month or so, I&#x27;ve found that their precision tip is also pretty sharp, and leads to me pulling hairs out half way, which is sooo frustrating.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m a tomboy and low maintenance, and I never thought I&#x27;d actually rave about a pair of tweezers...</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp, so be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they sent me a green tweezer in exactly the same shade as the other one I already had.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and grabs the most annoying hairs just like the regular Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Comes with a plastic tube/case to keep them sharp &amp; protected.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to maintain a hair-free face, and want to catch each hair as it begins to protrude the skin, look at the Tweezerman tweezers that have the sharp pointed tip.</li>
            <li> These are so sharp</li>
            <li> These are extremely well built.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TWO OTHER TWEEZERMAN, AND WANTED THIS ONE FOR TRAVELING.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying other brands and replaced all my tweezers with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> This thing can get any hair on your eyebrow without taking out any other hairs that you weren&#x27;t aiming for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why i haven&#x27;t cashed out the extra $5 to get these instead of the cheaper drugstore tweezers.</li>
            <li> Plus, my partner kept thieving my other pair (and doing lord knows what with them...</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have pointed out that they&#x27;re manufactured in India instead of Italy now.</li>
            <li> Ordered these online after my other tweezerman tweezers were lost in a move.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s due to the shorter length.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I had used other tweezer</li>
            <li> They consistantly grip hairs that other tweezers can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I would never use another brand of tweezers, because I&#x27;ve had plenty of experience with other cheaper brands and the frustration of grabbing at a hair and it just slipping out of grasp is just unbearable!</li>
            <li> but it is not nearly as good at grabbing the hairs as my other 15 year old pair of hand tweezers.</li>
            <li> My use of other tweezer brands has been short-lived.</li>
            <li> ends of the slant tips are relatively sharp.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years and will never use any other brand.</li>
            <li> theyll send you the return shipping label, you send it in, and get it back in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I have cut myself with these because of how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> I got pink!</li>
            <li> and you will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Too sharp?</li>
            <li> Forget other brands.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> The edge is sharp and stays in line over repeated use.</li>
            <li> Small but not tiny.  </li>
            <li> these are SHARP.</li>
            <li> just as someone else mentioned; these make other tweezers seem like putting two pennies together and trying to pull a hair.  </li>
            <li> These actually feel a bit small in my hand (and I have medium hands - size 8 ring).  </li>
            <li> Not much to say other than he does what he&#x27;s supposed to do - tweeze!  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t loose the little plastic lid.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is Amazon not letting us pick a color, since I got stuck with pink, but that&#x27;s an Amazon issue.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re no better than your average tweezers, but they&#x27;re double the price.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and keep them in their little container, however, and be very careful not to drop them.  </li>
            <li> The pink was very pretty and came in a little carrying case so it won&#x27;t get dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other brands but none have worked as well as the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that they of course become dull after a while</li>
            <li> I took one star off simply because they are a little small.  </li>
            <li> The minis are hard to hold for big hands compared to the regular ones, but they don&#x27;t rust, become dull or chip.</li>
            <li> It only loses one star because of the size of it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth the time and frustration you lose trying to grab on to those hairs.</li>
            <li> I realize this does not effective how the product works, but it is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get pink, but got green.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and the points are tight, not allowing hair to slide through the tips.  </li>
            <li> And like a previous reviewer said the ends do not come flat together making it pretty impossible to tweeze anything.</li>
            <li> These have never let me down.</li>
            <li> This is the one, hands down</li>
            <li> Not real Tweezerman products!!</li>
            <li> So sharp!</li>
            <li> I like this product but am a little put off by how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> Rust on one side and what looked like an electrical arc burning thru the paint on the other!</li>
            <li> But, when they say Mini, as they do buried in the middle of the name, they mean MINI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sick of cheap store bought ones that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I learned very quickly not to scrape the tweezer edge against my skin and to be careful not to grasp any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp edges.</li>
            <li> only thing that bothers me is that the tweezers are very small</li>
            <li> I dropped the previous pair that I owned and they no longer worked.</li>
            <li> The thing is, you can go to Target or a drugstore and pay half...</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s less strain when plucking.</li>
            <li> I went to WalMart and bought a pair for about half that price and attempted to use them to remove some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and I see much less irritation in my skin from plucking.</li>
            <li> I got a black one would have preferred a brighter color.</li>
            <li> Why even mess with the rest?  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re just paying for a name and not a true quality product.</li>
            <li> If your pair is solid-colored, the color won&#x27;t scratch off or fade, even if they get thrown around in drawers and crushed in makeup bags the way tweezers usually are.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t use tweezers for anything but hair because it will mess up the alignment of the blades.</li>
            <li> This new one doesn&#x27;t grip at all, so it is useless.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a little plastic holder</li>
            <li> OMG this little thing would miss any hair which i want to pull out~&lt;br /&gt;yes~~~~</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my mini on Amazon but at the store, and it came in a little plastic carrying tube which helps keep the tweezer from snagging on things, and slows the dulling process.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all of those little hairs</li>
            <li> Come with a little protector tube.</li>
            <li> it comes in a little plastic tube that just sits in a zipper compartment.  </li>
            <li> I like the little plastic tube it comes in for storage.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers do what they&#x27;re supposed to...efficiently.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> THis one is a little small/short</li>
            <li> They grab any and every little eyebrow hair/fuzz you want.  </li>
            <li> They come with a durable little case for convenience.</li>
            <li> Come with a little plastic holder to keep them protected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re little, which I like.</li>
            <li> and I like that it comes in a little container.  </li>
            <li> but after a little while either they dulled a bit</li>
            <li> I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those, too.</li>
            <li> For a little background-- I am a woman with black hair and pale skin</li>
            <li> I quickly get frustrated with their inability to grab short, thin eyebrow hairs as well as these can.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> I did find it alittle hard to pull the hairs out because they kept slipping through.</li>
            <li> (I already have a green tweezer).</li>
            <li> I had one that was accidentally washed and dried, so I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful to pull hairs out slowly</li>
            <li> Mine came in green.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with well known beauty product brand tweezers from folks like Revlon and others.</li>
            <li> I use these as my everyday tweezers and not just for travel.  </li>
            <li> It said colors may vary and I got green again</li>
            <li> I misplaced mine</li>
            <li> Bought a few months ago and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip and even get the smaller hairs that have barely broken the surface.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> (I got green, I might have preferred purple, but ...</li>
            <li> I found Tweezerman LTD Mini Slant Tweezers to be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and then they end up missing</li>
            <li> Just remember, color may vary, my tweezers showed up as a mint green,</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezer sending them back did not tweeze</li>
            <li> IT S NOT PRECISE.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s easier for travel and takes up less space!</li>
            <li> They are as sharp as knives, so you don&#x27;t want to drop them or do anything to dull the blades.</li>
            <li> I was so mad at my wife for not telling me I had that much hair in my ear</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers I just received are stiff and broke the hairs over and over.</li>
            <li> have thick dark hair and lots of it, which requires me to pluck my eyebrows everyday.  </li>
            <li> yes, my eyebrows are s hairy mess!  </li>
            <li> Too small to grip any of the little hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin fingers</li>
            <li> When I switched to these, it was like the heavens opened up and unicorns came down to delicately pluck the hair with their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m obsessed with getting all the little facial hairs off my face before they become noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get every little hair without fail and I purchased an extra pair for my daughter away at college</li>
            <li> They get every hair, even those short, broken off, hard to get hairs.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use because of the size.</li>
            <li> Are they too small, is the slant</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> they usually &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair before I can get it out.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the colors may vary part?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you can still send them to Tweezerman to have them sharpened, but that may be something to look into still.</li>
            <li> This is a small, convenient tweezer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re purchasing this because you think you get the 3 tweezers-you&#x27;re wrong only comes one</li>
            <li> Was thinking these might be too small</li>
            <li> these are really small (and i&#x27;m a petite woman).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tweezers in the past</li>
            <li> All the tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past don&#x27;t come close to this product.  </li>
            <li> They are just too small.  </li>
            <li> Other tweezer have problems with not closing all the way, not being sharp, having a weird grip, having a curved end.</li>
            <li> dollars on tweezers over the past couple years and</li>
            <li> The small practical size helps store it anywhere.</li>
            <li> not sure if the pain falling off had lead in it as these tweezers are not made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use these just a few times and cut myself at least twice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s between a 3 and a 4 because although these are quality tools, they are way too small to be any use to a guy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will lose them like I usually do the silver tweezers that I buy in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they justify the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I have small hands</li>
            <li> No more trying to grab hairs 10x ...</li>
            <li> Small, travel size tweezers that get the job done.</li>
            <li> I lost my last Tweezerman and was disappointed in the less expensive replacement I purchased, so went back to this little guy.  </li>
            <li> These are just not a very good item</li>
            <li> Pretty worthless to me as If I have to try twenty times to grab a hair</li>
            <li> , this product does not &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair like some other tweezers do when you&#x27;re trying to pull the hair out-something that drives me crazy with other tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hate nose hairs and the sure grip of this tweezer makes removing them much less painful.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to describe</li>
            <li> Does the job but hard to hold because of its size.  </li>
            <li> It becomes hard to tweeze because they won&#x27;t grab a hold of hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have had other brands in the past from Wal-Mart and would throw them away because they were useless.</li>
            <li> They grab hairs well which can be hard to find with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They go dull after a while</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t grasp hair as if they are already dull.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to grab hair or splinters.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to dull the tip.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather buy cheaper tweezers and have to replace them because I&#x27;m bound to drop them at least once.</li>
            <li> have complained about.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was the color - there was none.</li>
            <li> Unless your like me who loses them.</li>
            <li> It gets those suckers off my face.</li>
            <li> Mos tweezers have  thick edge</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend and I am difficult to please in this area!</li>
            <li> That is not ok!</li>
            <li> My wife would get mad because I used hers, so like a big boy I bought me the Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> I mean I was pulling hair</li>
            <li> Lifetime warranty and not too small at all even though it is labeled as a mini!</li>
            <li> I mean, they&#x27;re tweezers.</li>
            <li> Also, when they say mini, they mean mini.</li>
            <li> These get down to the nitty gritty and pull those hard to grab onto nasty little brow hairs that are hard to see.  </li>
            <li> very small and has no problem removing hair.</li>
            <li> very small but work well</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a hair there, these are guaranteed to pull it, no matter how thin, or small, if it can grab it, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Very small and get the job done.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are very small.</li>
            <li> But this can seriously grab every hair!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine are the grossest shade of green.  </li>
            <li> Small and expensive</li>
            <li> The price is what made me buy these; Tweezerman are usually ultra expensive.  </li>
            <li> At least that ensures I don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li> They are so sharp that instead of pulling out the hairs, they tend to cut them, making them impossible to then pull out.</li>
            <li> The problem is once you drop them, they are useless and become hard to use.  </li>
            <li> But hey Tweezerman stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are actually worse than the Revlon ones that I use.</li>
            <li> It can be a game changer if you have a unibrow.</li>
            <li> Seemed to make doing my eyebrows a lot less painful, my boyfriend who is weak about plucking even let me do his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Seriously, ouch!</li>
            <li> These are, by far,  the worst tweezers I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I hate the color of the pink one that I got.</li>
            <li> Every other tweezer on the market is crap compared to these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with them.</li>
            <li> for the money, I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> measure just shy of 2.75 inches.</li>
            <li> Because when it breaks or fails, you have to add the cost of the one you should have bought to start with.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong buying Tweezerman Tweezers.  </li>
            <li> After criticizing &#x27;expensive&#x27; tweezers for years...</li>
            <li> unfortunately...</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with Tweezerman</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why tweezers are so expensive.</li>
            <li> These tweezers changed my life, for my body is merely a vessel for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers are expensive...</li>
            <li> I use tweezers probably 10 times a day for random things.. anything from plucking hairs (and ingrown hairs) to fixing toys.  </li>
            <li> never thought to buy an expensive one bc</li>
            <li> The tips of the tweezers were very poorly aligned and so did not grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this time they were very dull and didnt work AT ALL :(</li>
            <li> so I was somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t sneeze when you tweeze the trees in your sneeze, But tweeze with the seas and watch the cold ocean breeze seize with each tweeze.</li>
            <li> Once you start using the mini one, you think its awkward</li>
            <li> it seemed like an expensive pair of tweezers!).</li>
            <li> Expensive but gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> But be warned: they&#x27;re also dangerous and painful.</li>
            <li> it becomes a very tedious process.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad.</li>
            <li> your self from a bad purchase and get something else.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad set</li>
            <li> Crazy bad Quality Control!</li>
            <li> Try them, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mostly disappointed considering what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother:(</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> These are terrible, maybe I got a bad pair</li>
            <li> If you are frustrated that yours won&#x27;t grasp those hairs or splinters, THIS is the one!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed at the misleading photo..</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This pair was terrible.</li>
            <li> For a pair of tweezers?! Seemed outrageous.</li>
            <li> Just received and very disappointed!</li>
            <li> these are terrible tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This tweezer is amazingly sharp and certainly remove even the smallest hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these about six months ago and love them. The angle at the end is good for plucking and I love the rubberized body. So much easier to grip with no slipping out of the hand. It also comes with a little plastic tubing case which is nice because I have not lost them once. Next time I need a new pair of tweezers I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Not what they are cracked up to be. My Dollar Store tweezers have better grip.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezerman minis!! So handy to put in your make up bags for on the go</li>
            <li> Very precise and easy to hold.  The best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers.  You have to be careful and keep them in their little container, however, and be very careful not to drop them.  I dropped the previous pair that I owned and they no longer worked.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used. I noticed a cheaper knock off brand in a big box store but I love my Tweezermans.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers and Tweezerman will sharpen them for you!</li>
            <li> Not as fabulous as its put out to be.Sometimes need to tug. And it misses some visible hairs. Pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Great little tweezer.  I like this smaller one better than the larger.</li>
            <li> Very, very precise, hairs don&#x27;t slip out when you pull. Better than their full size tweezers.</li>
            <li> works very well.I recommend</li>
            <li> What can I say, tweezerman is the best brand for tweezers.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, portable, and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the very best tweezers, but I was concerned this LTD Mini might not be as great as the traditional size. It&#x27;s just as good as you&#x27;d expect from this company.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite pair of tweezers!</li>
            <li> It does what is says it does.  Don&#x27;t bother going through any others.</li>
            <li> Been buying these for years...still a great little tweezer, super sharp for precise plucking. Comes with a plastic tube/case to keep them sharp &amp; protected.</li>
            <li> work exactly as decribed</li>
            <li> Great quality tweezers</li>
            <li> best tweezers I have ever owned!  I couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay for the full sized but these little ones are great at pulling hairs other tweezers can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am a penny pincher, and spending this much on tweezers had me nearly in tears (ok, maybe not quite but sheesh it seemed like an expensive pair of tweezers!). The thing is, you can go to Target or a drugstore and pay half...and then you&#x27;ll get the tweezers home and they won&#x27;t work. And you&#x27;ll end up here to buy these anyway. Or you&#x27;ll buy another cheap pair totaling the price of these in the first place. These are tight, great grip, great size. I would totally recommend and I am difficult to please in this area!</li>
            <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll never go back to drugstore tweezers again! They get every hair, even those short, broken off, hard to get hairs. Perfect size for my tiny hands, too!</li>
            <li> They do not work quite as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever!  The tips come perfectly together and the little container they come in to protect them seems so sensible. I will put them in the container after every use to keep them working perfectly.</li>
            <li> great tweezers my wife loves them, much better than the drug store variety.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever tried in my entire life!! I was a little hesitant at first when I read several reviews saying the quality is lower and what not. I can&#x27;t really make a comment on that because this is my first tweezer from tweezerman, but they are the best I have encountered compared to the drugstore brands such as Revlon, Sally Hansen, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read a review saying these tweezers used to be made in Germany but now made in India. And that is true. It is made in India. But hey Tweezerman stands behind their product. If your tweezers get dull you can send it in with no shipping cost or fee whatsoever and they will sharpen it for you free of charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are totally worth the bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I struggled buying this. Are they too small, is the slant okay, will they grip correctly. Why was I worried, they are great.  Even smaller they would have been good because they have a firm precision that makes them work well even when I am not perfect in tweezing a particular lash!</li>
            <li> These are great to have in all your different purses.  High quality and works for on the go time.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever! No other tweezers come close. These are very accurate, strong, and light.</li>
            <li> My husband loves having these around for thorns and splinters.  They are extremely sharp, so be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality as all Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> These are really compact but highly effective tweezers.  I purchased a mini slant tweezer about a year ago and it still does a fairly good ob tweezing.  I purchased two new pairs in the purple color and they are just as good as the unit I bought a year ago.  I&#x27;ve used this brand&#x27;s ingrown hair tweezers as well, and all options used were effective in their purpose (although the ingrown hair option wasn&#x27;t as durable as the mini slants).  The mini slants are best for eyebrows but are also effective for random single hairs that pop up on the face.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get pink, but got green. These are possibly the best tweezers ever, even though they are mini they fit my hand just fine and are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Bought a second pair because I just loved my first so much!</li>
            <li> Worth the investment and cannot compare to any other pair used in the past!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tweezers. I have tried other kinds and these seem to grab hairs the best. I have small hands so I do not know if gripping this would be difficult with larger hands. I&#x27;ve had a few of these and the only reason is because I have dropped them before and the tips have bent when hitting the floor. This is the only tweezer I buy. I also like the different color and design options they offer.</li>
            <li> Something can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> This Tweezerman mini lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. Very well made, much better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve used previous. The blades are very tight, so it works very well with little to no slippage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have issues with its smaller size, but I actually like that they are smaller. I feel as though I have better control over  it due to it&#x27;s petite size; I have to grip it closer to the blades, which increases accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although this little guy is a bit more expensive than others, I feel it is worth the extra money spent. A good Tweezerman should last a while with proper use and care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very used to using this length of tweezers and have been for years. (I thought this was the standard tweezer length.) So length is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would complain about is that the picture shows a pretty purple tweezer. I bought it because I wanted a purple tweezer. (I already have a green tweezer). Unfortunately, they sent me a green tweezer in exactly the same shade as the other one I already had. This is not an error on my part. How strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll still give it a five-start review, because now I have two awesome green tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good, but I was replacing a pair of Tweezerman tweezers that had a sharp pointed tip, and these aren&#x27;t as effective in grabbing the very short hairs. These work great for the hairs that are long enough to easily grab, but I guess I&#x27;m obsessed with getting all the little facial hairs off my face before they become noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made well, and don&#x27;t feel like they will bend, or gap between the arms, so if you are looking for tweezers that work well for the average hair plucking, these are absolutely fine. If you are trying to maintain a hair-free face, and want to catch each hair as it begins to protrude the skin, look at the Tweezerman tweezers that have the sharp pointed tip.</li>
            <li> The best tweezers money can buy.</li>
            <li> Every woman should own a set of these....or two!!! Kind of makes tweezing enjoyable....maybe a little bit too much :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome tweezers. They&#x27;re small but that&#x27;s ok. They work great for pulling out small hairs and don&#x27;t slide around on the hair at all, just a quick pull and the hair is out. Seemed to make doing my eyebrows a lot less painful, my boyfriend who is weak about plucking even let me do his eyebrows. They come with a little tube for storing them in and they&#x27;re just great!</li>
            <li> Accurate tweezers with tight grasp and sufficient recoil when opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grasping end is angled making it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great size for traveling.  Came with a plastic vial to store in.</li>
            <li> These are so sharp they usually &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair before I can get it out.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd pair of these Tweezers I have purchased. They last a long time and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Awesome tweezers. Well worth the money. I have been cheap ones and the get worn out after a couple uses. These are extremely well built. They do a great job.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever had. The size is perfect for me and the case makes sure it stays perfectly aligned. I use it mostly for eyebrows and there&#x27;s not a hair I can&#x27;t get hold of. It makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Ends of the tweezers do not correctly line up... They still function, if you find that &#x27;sweet&#x27; spot.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, a high-quality tweezer that WORKS!  I have gone through so many tweezers that don&#x27;t do the one and only thing they are supposed to do…grab a hair and pull it out!  (I know there are other uses, but this is the basic one.)  Looking closely at these tweezers, you can see that they have been machined to a perfect degree to align perfectly.  They are wonderful, and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect tweezer.  I&#x27;ve bought many pairs of locally sold pairs which never work very good, except on eyebrows.  If you need a more precise tool, like removing tiny chin hairs....these are what you need.  They do not slip and the grip is extremely precise.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well with tiny stubborn eyebrow hairs!</li>
            <li> Simply put, Tweezerman makes the best and most cost-efficient tweezers.</li>
            <li> too small and does not open wide enough ... would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. High quality.</li>
            <li> Works great! Perfectly aligned tips, exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work... I really don&#x27;t see any difference from any other pair of tweezers I have owned...</li>
            <li> TWEEZERMAN IS THE BEST TWEEZER I HAVE USED. I HAVE TWO OTHER TWEEZERMAN, AND WANTED THIS ONE FOR TRAVELING.</li>
            <li> I have been through about 30 different tweezers. These are by far the best! I had one that was accidentally washed and dried, so I had to replace it. I was not disappointed. Would order the same ones again!</li>
            <li> The best tweezers ever. Small size is nice for a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This is a quality tweezer! Will buy a few more.</li>
            <li> Expensive but gets the job done!  If u have a teensy hair, it grabs onto it quickly and easily. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> They get those pesky hairs just above the surface with razor accuracy.  Has a good grip to get hairs that have follicles well below the surface.</li>
            <li> These tweezers will grab the tiniest hairs and pull the entire thing out! They are sharp enough to break the skin, if you need to. By far the best tweezers we have ever purchased. The larger ones that cost around $20 are worth the price, hands down. You&#x27;ll never go back once you try Tweezerman. We won&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another set of tweezers that I lost. Its small but able to get out stubborn hairs and makes maintaining eyebrows in between waxings a breeze. The bright color makes it pretty easy to find in my bag.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever!  I have them everywhere, and they&#x27;re super precise and well made. I stopped buying other brands and replaced all my tweezers with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> those tweezers were good.</li>
            <li> Purple. Eugh. Anyway, still good tweezers.. just wish they would let us choose the color!</li>
            <li> When you take a picture of 3 of an item, and price it for 3 of an item, purchasers are going to assume they&#x27;re buying 3. Sure, they should read the small print, but you can do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop with the deceit, and make the photo show what&#x27;s actually in the box.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever!!!!  Will never buy a different brand</li>
            <li> I held out such high hopes for these tweezers and they kind of let me down. For a little background-- I am a woman with black hair and pale skin and I have been waxing, shaving, and tweezing for almost as long as I can remember. I had a favorite pair of tweezers that never let me down for about 8 years but they broke in half and I had to dry my tears and invest in a new pair.&lt;br /&gt;After much research I decided on the Tweezerman. They are adequate but they commit the cardinal sin of tweezing---  they are so sharp that they can actually *cut* off the hairs before you get a chance to yank them out. That is not ok! Since they&#x27;re small and come with a storage tube, I think I&#x27;ll relegate these to my purse as my &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; tweezers and stick with cheaper Revlon ones that actually work better for my day-to-day needs.</li>
            <li> Great for pulling hairs, grabbing small pieces of electronics when I work on them, and very handy to have in general.</li>
            <li> This thing is magic. I&#x27;m a guy and I need to tweeze my eyebrows every week otherwise they get all bushy. This thing can get any hair on your eyebrow without taking out any other hairs that you weren&#x27;t aiming for. Precise and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;They gave me a pink one, I&#x27;m not too upset about it because it&#x27;s not like anyone actually watches me tweeze my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I had been using one of these tweezers for years and it worked well - seemed like the tweezers may have needed sharpening and I decided to get a second one and possibly send off the first for the free sharpening offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers I just received are stiff and broke the hairs over and over. No comparison between this new one and my old one. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old one which still works better.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work great,  a little on the small side</li>
            <li> Favorite every-day pair of tweezers I have ever owned. The only tweezers I ever want to own. This takes so much frustration out of it, and they are sharpened for life for free by the company, which is AWESOME. They also last forever unless they get dropped too many times and the alignment becomes too off. They are easy on wrist and arthritic fingers and comfortably sized, whereas the regular full size Tweezerman tweezers are ridiculously huge and hard to hold, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
            <li> Small but very precise.  The slanted edges fit tightly together, so it works extremely well at grabbing the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the colors may vary part?</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size because it comes with its own little storage tube which protects them.  I keep one in my purse and one at home.</li>
            <li> The reviews made it sound like this was the most amazing tweezer! It&#x27;s ok, but not any better than others. It is better than the crappy ones, but I still find it is difficult to pull out a hair that is just barely above the surface. I&#x27;ve used another tweezer that was more needle-nose at the tip which does work better than this one.</li>
            <li> These tweezers actually tweeze!  Got a pair for my husband as well -we&#x27;re always fighting over &amp;#34;the good tweezers&amp;#34;.  Have been using a few months.  If they last even a year I&#x27;ll be thrilled (but hopefully longer)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why i haven&#x27;t cashed out the extra $5 to get these instead of the cheaper drugstore tweezers. These are actually surprisingly better! Way easier to pluck hairs out and they have a very precise and sharp tip.  Kinda hard to describe but the the squeeze part of it is very smooth and easy to bend so there&#x27;s less strain when plucking.</li>
            <li> Sharp and effective.  Pulls the little hairs out on the first try.  Great product.</li>
            <li> ...that makes these easy to take anywhere. Just don&#x27;t loose the little plastic lid. I&#x27;ve learned to recap the tube once I take the tweezers out so I won&#x27;t loose the cap. This company is great and re-sharpens to your tweezers FREE for life - see their website.</li>
            <li> Sharp and good quality. Caution not to pull out your skin instead of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Just like I expected.</li>
            <li> The best tweezer ever!</li>
            <li> They are truly the best tweezers</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m a tomboy and low maintenance, and I never thought I&#x27;d actually rave about a pair of tweezers...yet here we are. These rock. It&#x27;s not my first pair of Tweezerman and so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that surprised at the quality. However, my current full-sized, stainless steel pair have dulled finally (after a couple of years), so it was nice to use these very sharp and precise ones. I actually think I prefer the small version compared to the larger ones, but this may be because I have short-ish fingers and they&#x27;re easier for me to hold. Plus, my partner kept thieving my other pair (and doing lord knows what with them...we do not want to know, precious, no), so I think I&#x27;ll give those to him and keep these. These will stay quite sharp for a long time and the price is excellent. I&#x27;m not sure if you can still send them to Tweezerman to have them sharpened, but that may be something to look into still. My only complaint is Amazon not letting us pick a color, since I got stuck with pink, but that&#x27;s an Amazon issue. Pink is my kryptonite and being tortured with it as a kid is probably why I am a tomboy now. Oui.</li>
            <li> The ones that cost a dollar at my local pharmacy are much better. These clip more hairs than pluck them.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have used. I love how easy they are to use and pull hairs that are shorter. These work better than any pair of tweezers I have ever owned. Also works well to pull out splinters.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and misleading. Only one pair of tweezers andthe quality is negligible. Would never buy again</li>
            <li> Good tweezer, fits nicely in the  hand.</li>
            <li> It tweezes. Good job Tweezerman</li>
            <li> Pretty much as expected. Use them weekly.</li>
            <li> Pink... Bummer.  I know they said colors may vary but as a guy I really would&#x27;ve preferred not to have pink.  I may return it and try again or get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have never met a Tweezerman I didn&#x27;t like.  This one has a great hand feel and is easier to use than the longer ones.  I ordered this for my grown daughter, but I like it so much I will probably order one for myself.</li>
            <li> I love these! No other brand compares! I will never go back to cheap ones</li>
            <li> Very precise, not too sharp, firm grip</li>
            <li> I decided to buy these after finding cheap drug store tweezers being hit or miss.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with these and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> The image misleading shows three. One  could reasonably expect that for that kind of money you get multiple.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I found a similar pair of tweezers for much less at a local store.</li>
            <li> It tweezes the hair I want it to tweeze so I&#x27;m happy.  I like the size of it because I put it in my make-up brush bag and it comes with a little plastic holder so I&#x27;m not worried about having it bend out of place.</li>
            <li> I give them as gifts to just about every friend, aunt, coach, etc. in my life and they fall in love immediately. I lost mine once and ordered a new pair within a matter of hours. Try them, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers right after Christmas.  My niece got some in her stockings and she went on and on about how wonderful these are, so I had to try them.  They are easy to grip and easy to see in the drawer with the color cover on the side.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> OMG this little thing would miss any hair which i want to pull out~&lt;br /&gt;yes~~~~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect tweezers for the past 5 years when I discovered the 20 year old tweezers I was using were no longer made and/or being sold anywhere.  But search no more-these tweezers are a life saver!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick dark hair and lots of it, which requires me to pluck my eyebrows everyday.  I can&#x27;t go for 1 day without plucking or my yes, my eyebrows are s hairy mess!  I&#x27;ve tried every type of tweezer, waxing system out there to try to save time, but nothing has worked well for me until I tried these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are the perfect size for my small hands, although it&#x27;s a travel size so it may be too small for someone with larger hands.  But, I think the travel size is one reason they are so easy for me to use.  The tip of the tweezers are very precise and can easily grab onto and pull out those tricky hairs that seem almost impossible to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product does not &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair like some other tweezers do when you&#x27;re trying to pull the hair out-something that drives me crazy with other tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a few more of these to keep in my travel stuff and for a spare, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My go-to over and over.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers.  Love the color.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I thought it was a three pack. 12 bucks is a little much for a single pair of mini tweezers. Very disappointed at the misleading photo..</li>
            <li> It gets rid of pesky unwanted hairs perfectly whether they are in grown hairs or not.  Love it small and easy to use also.</li>
            <li> My wife is extremely picky with her tweezers and wanted an extra one at the condo,&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with these, and not an easy one to please when it comes to the ability to pluck stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice little tweezers that do a good job.  I like the case it comes in, it keeps me from losing them in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers and handy case for traveling</li>
            <li> These work really good. You need to be careful to pull hairs out slowly or you can cut them off with these though. The edges are sharp. I also wish they didn&#x27;t come in such girly colors too but that doesn&#x27;t affect their utility, must my ego. :)</li>
            <li> Great little set of tweezer that work like a charm. Easy to remove hair on the neck or plug your eyebrows with it. Sit well in your hand, I don&#x27;t have large hands and these tweezers fit perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> These are great!!!  Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These will grip ANYTHING</li>
            <li> My second set and I love them.  They get the tiniest little hairs growing where hairs should never grow on a female! The first set I ruined by grasping cellophane wrappers on various makeup containers to rip them off.  Save these lovely little tools for what they are intended or risk needing a new pair.</li>
            <li> Makes shaping my eyebrows quick work and they do a great job.  I bought another Tweezerman for myself but ended up giving them to my girlfriend and she loves them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty frugal so I declined to spend more than $5 on tweezers at first but these are more than worth their cost.  Once you experience the difference you probably won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> Product as stated&lt;br /&gt;arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Tweezerman&#x27;s a few times in the past - they&#x27;ve always been the best! This pair was terrible. Other reviews have pointed out that they&#x27;re manufactured in India instead of Italy now. I don&#x27;t know the reason - but they were much too sharp where they touched the skin, and somehow still not effective at grabbing hairs. I compared them to my current pair, and it looks like they aren&#x27;t as well polished at the tip - you can see bevel marks. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers for a good price.</li>
            <li> These work great for their size, but they are tiny when compared to the once you see at the store. I thought I was getting a better deal than I would if I bought them in the store, which was not the case, but it was a fair price for the tweezers. I was really hoping to find the older style Tweezerman tweezers that had a less sharp edge, but worked great on brows. These are a little sharp on the ends, so they are really designed for fine tweezing.</li>
            <li> BEST TWEAZERS out there.</li>
            <li> Great for removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This is a small, convenient tweezer. Pretty decently made, but I find that the one edge is too sharp sometimes and stabs me when I&#x27;m trying to tweeze my eyebrows. To be fair, that happens to me with most tweezers I buy so it&#x27;s probably just me and not these. But if this also happens to you, fair warning that these Tweezerman&#x27;s are SHARP.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman offers the best tweezers and they will sharpen for free.</li>
            <li> Not bad for little tweezer, can get most hair with them. Nice little carry case for travel.</li>
            <li> More like scissors the tweezers, the point where the edges meet is so sharp if you exert any pressure the trapper hair is more likely to get a clean cut than get plucked.  I tried it on the first few hairs before falling back to my trustee no-brand black tweezers I got from the local store.  Some pieces of hair got cut so close to skin that i&#x27;m worried about ingrown hair now... oh wait, Tweezerman sells ingrown hair tweezers..</li>
            <li> They work amazing and are small enough that they are more convenient to take with in a purse or make-up bag, but not too small that they are hard to use - I am a tweerman purchaser for life!!</li>
            <li> i love that i can use the fine tip to dig out any ingrown hairs that may be hiding under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;for this reason alone, these tweezers are the best i have ever owned and don&#x27;t ever see why i would need to change brands.</li>
            <li> Ordered these online after my other tweezerman tweezers were lost in a move. Great brand, like the mini tweezers better as they feel more comfortable in my hands. Great price, less than half of what I paid for my first pair in a store...</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great.</li>
            <li> Does the job but hard to hold because of its size.  The tube it came packaged in is difficult to use but it will store the tweezers effectively when not in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other brands but none have worked as well as the Tweezerman. I even lucked out that I was sent my favorite color!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned. If I were to lose these, I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Tweezerman tweezers, however, I found these to be ineffective and I think it&#x27;s due to the shorter length. I didn&#x27;t save enough space in my travel bag to justify not packing a standard size tweezers. I recommend just sticking with the original sized Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab hairs. Pretty worthless to me as If I have to try twenty times to grab a hair it becomes a very tedious process. By hair, I mean, whisker, which I really didn&#x27;t want to confess.  :)</li>
            <li> make it clear it is only one pair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re purchasing this because you think you get the 3 tweezers-you&#x27;re wrong only comes one and you get which ever color they send to you which it says in the description box but I did not read :). However, it&#x27;s small and can easily get those stubborn brow hairs out. I mainly use them for applying eyelashes though which works wonders since it&#x27;s so small!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever. Pretty expensive but I think it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> Work well. I missed the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; part when I purchased. But there are a lot of uses I have found for having a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; around! Good error on my part! It has a good gripper to get whatever you are tweezing.</li>
            <li> great for your purse. Once you have tweezerman tweezers you&#x27;ll never want to use another brand</li>
            <li> These tweezers did not pull ingrown hairs like I expected them to. I will probably try a different brand; these tweezers were not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice size, work well.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great! They grab even the thinnest of hairs and are able to pull them out when other tweezers won&#x27;t. The only hang up I have about them is that they are a little sharp so you have to be careful not to grab your skin as it will hurt and very occasionally they will grab a hair and cut it instead of pull it with their sharpness</li>
            <li> Why even mess with the rest?  I own a couple pairs of these tweezers and I love them!  If I could just stop &amp;#34;losing&amp;#34; them I would be so much better off!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the best tweezers, always!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well made, but does not align perfectly. As a result, it&#x27;s really ineffective for grasping a single hair or small splinter.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are actually worse than the Revlon ones that I use. Save your money. Returned these... my Revlon work better for far less cost.</li>
            <li> The best tweezers out there!</li>
            <li> Good tweezers with good grip.</li>
            <li> I wanted a very good pair of tweezers, so I bought these--more than I&#x27;d paid for tweezers before, but you get what you pay for, right?  I was very disappointed.  They nick me and draw blood.  I try to be careful, but they still get me quite often.  I&#x27;m giving up and buying a new, different pair.</li>
            <li> Great tweezer! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and overall experience.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Hard to grab hairs have no chance agsinst these tweezers easy to use to making your face bleed with cheap tweezers and not getting hsir love them</li>
            <li> They work great and well worth the price. Cheap tweezers don&#x27;t work nearly as well. Will buy another pair if they ever wear out or get stolen.</li>
            <li> These are the best, far better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers get the job done! The ends are very fine and sharp. While the sharpness won&#x27;t damage your skin or cut you, it is perfect for grabbing onto tiny hairs that are barely there. I have struggled with many tweezers over the years that just won&#x27;t get all the hairs I need it to. These have never let me down. I wish I would have found these sooner. I bought 3 pairs of them - two for home and one for travel. I&#x27;ll never be without them again. They are simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few times.. and it suchs a short period of time its not so great..</li>
            <li> Most People dont realize tweezers get dull and when they do they wont grip the hairs Tweezermans come very sharp and grip every hair i love them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drop it.  Tweezerman tweezers are good and precise.  They grab the tiniest hairs.  The problem is once you drop them, they are useless and become hard to use.  It becomes hard to tweeze because they won&#x27;t grab a hold of hairs.  They are pricey for tweezers and are better than other brands but I&#x27;d rather buy cheaper tweezers and have to replace them because I&#x27;m bound to drop them at least once.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying such small tweezers, especially for the price, but they are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use them almost daily and they work great on those little pesky hairs that no other tweezers seem to be able to grab.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a sharp, tight tweezer that was a cut above what I could find at the drugstore.  To me, this is no better than a revlon tweezer and it costs more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers especially since they are easy to take on the go and everyone who has used a set of tweevzerman tweezer&#x27;s know that they are quality, however, i ordered purple and received hot pink.  This would not have been a big deal if it were any other color, except for the fact that hot pink is my least favorite color.</li>
            <li> too much money for just regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with them. They pull eyebrow hair better than the expensive pair I had bought for Sephora. They didn&#x27;t carry the same kind anymore so I went looking at Amazon and I thought these might work and they have.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Small, easy to transport, easy to use, etc. Only thing is that they of course become dull after a while but that is to be expected. The lifespan is quite long though. Definitely recommended tweezers.</li>
            <li> The tweezers were tinier than I expected. This may have been because I didn&#x27;t read well when purchasing, but I ended up giving them away, because they were smaller than a standard tweezer size.</li>
            <li> They work really well! I have long, thin fingers and these are actually a lot easier to use than my larger Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my larger ones but less expensive and more portable. The transport tube is a nice touch. Mine came in green.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the best tweezers!  The edges are sharper than you would expect compared to regular tweezers, but these tweezers can grasp the tiniest hairs.  I learned very quickly not to scrape the tweezer edge against my skin and to be careful not to grasp any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini slant tweezer is not that much smaller than the regular size tweezer, but it comes in it&#x27;s own plastic case and it&#x27;s very convenient as a portable tweezer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tweezer in the world. I had the first one for about a year before I left it in Las Vegas by accident during a recent trip. It was a no-brainer than I had to get back on Amazon and order a second one which arrived yesterday and this one has a pretty clear case. (I don&#x27;t recall the first one shipping with a case.) And I&#x27;m back in business now. :) Both times, I got chosen the pink color. I like how they don&#x27;t let you choose and they just send&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, Tweezerman is gentle, effective, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your skin, it is a most brilliant useful tiny tool that I will be using daily.</li>
            <li> BEST. TWEEZERS. EVER. People, it&#x27;s time to believe the hype. I can&#x27;t believe how long it took me to bite the bullet and purchase a pair of Tweezermans. I&#x27;d gone through so many pairs of mediocre tweezers and finally had enough. I love that these tweezers come with a plastic tube with a lid. The slant makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re plucking &amp; pulling at while the flat, thick handle makes it easy to have a good grip.</li>
            <li> What can I say. It&#x27;s very small but works fantastic. This is one of the best tweezer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what i was expecting from tweezers that cost more than $10, but i was impressed when i got them.&lt;br /&gt;The metal is super solid, and these have enough gripping power to tear skin - so they will certainly pluck hairs with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I like these, and i will probably purchase another pair in the future.</li>
            <li> This little mini tweezer is more accurate that my regular tweezers and is much easier to carry in my purse to pick off those ugly facial hairs that always seem to appear when you look in the car mirror on your way to somewhere important!  It comes in a little plastic case which helps them to stay straight while be pummeled by the other items in my purse.  I&#x27;m buying another to replace my regular bathroom tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! I am obsessed with teasing my eyebrows and these are by far the best tweezers i have ever used. Would purchase again!!</li>
            <li> These replace a 5 year old pair that I lost. Great buy and they have great holding power when you have a grip on a hair that seems to reach all the way to the next state. You know what IEan I am sure.</li>
            <li> GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST</li>
            <li> good strong set of tweezers.  very small and has no problem removing hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. I had used other tweezer but this is the best one I had.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will never use another brand tweezers ever again.</li>
            <li> My wife has gone through many tweezer manufacturers and this is the only one that works for her, she uses them daily and will settle for no other. its a plucking thing, get it you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;Also vote out the liberals and the RINOs who don&#x27;t care about our countries future Please.</li>
            <li> Love the travel size, fits easy in my purse! Read the info because you only get one!</li>
            <li> Okay I bought these around 4 months ago and I&#x27;ve been noticing that every now and then it would not grasp eyebrow hairs, and then suddenly today they won&#x27;t grasp ANY HAIRS AT ALL! I&#x27;m never buying these again and recommend others don&#x27;t as well, I recommend you just buy then at the store for a couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> Say this to any woman over a certain age: &amp;#34;10X and  a Tweezerman in good light&amp;#34; and she&#x27;ll automatically bring her hand to her chin. If you&#x27;re one of those women you know: you gotta have good tools and good light to keep the whiskers away. There&#x27;s nothing better than a Tweezerman for the job. Nothing.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, and I thought it was a three pack, but the tweezers overall is really nice. It only came with one pink tweezers.</li>
            <li> Awesome tweezers- fast shipping</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed these tweezers, I have been blown away by the quality at such a low price. Don&#x27;t waste your time with well known beauty product brand tweezers from folks like Revlon and others. You&#x27;re just paying for a name and not a true quality product. While a name like tweezerman does not conjure up the same cachet as others, don&#x27;t worry; you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
            <li> It holds brow hair quite tight and is handy. The protecting tube is a great idea to avoid contaminating or losing it.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased. I definitely plan to buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li> These work fine but are teeny!!</li>
            <li> My first Tweezerman tweezers.  My eyebrow area got a little red after I used them they are so precise.  I am just used to digging right in with my dull ones that I will throw away.  I will be gentler next time.  So for now on....tweezerman it is, excellent tweezers.  Love the small size.</li>
            <li> After losing yet another pair of tweezers, I turned to Amazon to avoid a trip to the pharmacy. When I found these, I was a bit surprised about the price (I was sure that it meant that you would receive the three tweezers pictured, until I read the description), but now that they are here I get it. I had never had tweezers with a steel grip like these have. If (when, actually) I lose them, I will buy a new pair of the same.</li>
            <li> I gave these as stocking stuffers to family members last year and will probably do so again this year.  I use these as my everyday tweezers and not just for travel.  Just because they are mini, doesn&#x27;t minimize the function at all.</li>
            <li> I love this new portable mini-slant tweezer. I also love the extra eyebrow brush. It&#x27;s perfect for when you&#x27;re outdoors and realize that you&#x27;ve got stray eyebrow or chin hairs that you missed. Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are great for plucking!</li>
            <li> Great Tweezer&#x27;s, does their job wonderfully, but would recommend full sized ones if you have larger hands.</li>
            <li> for the money, I am not impressed.  they are better than the dollar store variety, but I think you can find better than these at the beauty supply store, or drug store.</li>
            <li> I love tweexerman tweezers they are the best and work well for plugging even the shortest hairs I had a green pair that vanished so I went ahead and ordered a new pair because I can not live without them. It said colors may vary and I got green again lol I would have liked another color but that is nothing against the tweezers themselves.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. It even comes with a case!</li>
            <li> I ordered this size by mistake while traveling. Can barely use due to size. May return. Get the regular size.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes an excellent product, the tweezers were very sharp and worked great. Also Tweezerman provides a lifetime guarantee for the tweezers, sharpening them for free of charge if the tweezers ever become dull. Mine personally lasted for about 6 months before I was starting to notice the tweezers not functioning as great as they first did when they were brand new. I actually accidentally dropped them on the tip which did them in. Sending the tweezers in for sharpening was very simple; I went online to www.Tweezerman.com filling out a short form/questionnaire and then printing out a receipt for myself and one to include inside the shipment with the tweezers. I shipped them out with the receipt they requested to include that I printed off their website expecting to receive my tweezers back in 4 to 6 weeks. I received updates through email confirming their arrival and also confirming their departure back to me after only 3 weeks. Overall these tweezers are a great product. The only drawback I didn&#x27;t like was when ordering, I was not able to choose my particular design or color that suited my personal preference and only got the color they sent me.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. A wee bit pricy for such a simple product, but they grab little and big hairs both, without being so sharp that they simply cut them.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why I was paying so much for tweezers and when they came I started to wonder again.  It is just one tweezer which comes in a case.  Glad for that otherwise I could easily misplace them.  The first time I tried the tweezer I dont know if I wasnt holding it correctly but I wasnt impressed.  The second time and subsequently, everything came together and I am now glad I did purchase this tweezer and would recommend itl</li>
            <li> These just don&#x27;t work for me at all. I have had better luck with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> The tweezer blade came scratched. Unsatisfied with this since I love Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are expensive but in my experience they are the best.  They consistantly grip hairs that other tweezers can&#x27;t.  Worth it.  Just don&#x27;t lose them!  I misplaced mine so I am ordering another...</li>
            <li> Top notch tweezers.  Worth the money and a good value.  It can be a game changer if you have a unibrow.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are small but effective, they hold hair, skin, whatever you want to pull off your body with ease</li>
            <li> These are tiny, fit in a travel case, and work incredibly well. They are precise and almost painless to use.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, and they are cheaper than the full-size ones.  I&#x27;m sure there is a very good reason to buy the full-sized tweezers, but this does the trick for me.  It doesn&#x27;t break off the hair like so many other tweezers tend to do.</li>
            <li> These work super well! Love them! You don&#x27;t get to pick the color, but they are small and easily portable. It comes in a very mini plastic cover</li>
            <li> Love these... weirdly small but work really well</li>
            <li> Pluck yourself the manly way, with Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> Very fine pinch points which is what I was after.  Came with a clear carry case which I think is cool.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned. They really grip the fine hairs along my brows, and the angle is just right. I&#x27;ve never been able to tweeze so fast!</li>
            <li> One of my biggest gripes is that tools for women are often low quality or don&#x27;t work properly. Not the case here - these things are fantastic! The smaller size felt odd at first but now I won&#x27;t go near my old Revlon tweezers. The first one I ordered was mint green. I then bought two more and received the pink version and a kelly green not pictured here.</li>
            <li> Very small, very well made. You get a lot of accuracy and power when removing splinters. Great price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tweezerman, what more is there to say;)</li>
            <li> Great and accurate tweazers</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling.  It is effective with tweezing your brows.  It is good value for your money.  I recommend the bigger one for everyday use though.</li>
            <li> great tweezer. got lots of fine hair out. came with a nice case for storage.</li>
            <li> Pros: Smaller size, easy to travel with, same sharp great edges that make it one of the best brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smaller size is easier to lose. Might be harder to hold for people with larger hands?&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Great little tweezers; just had to get used to the mini size, as I always use full size.</li>
            <li> Carrying case is cheap plastic tube, but effective. Great for purse or makeup bag! Grabs small hairs easily. Bought a few months ago and have had no issues. Love the smaller size!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman has the best tweezers that I have EVER-EVER-EVER used. Absolutely worth the price. They&#x27;re SO great at grabbing even the finest hair. I would never use another brand of tweezers, because I&#x27;ve had plenty of experience with other cheaper brands and the frustration of grabbing at a hair and it just slipping out of grasp is just unbearable! These are just great :)</li>
            <li> I love tweezerman tweezers because they are sharp and well-made. The pink was very pretty and came in a little carrying case so it won&#x27;t get dirty. These are way  better than the ones you get for $1 and are far more precise at getting the hairs you want plucked.</li>
            <li> What can you say about tweezers.  Nice sharp clear edges that can grab even the finest of hairs. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. Bought my first pair retail and they worked so well that I ordered two more so I could have one pair at work and another in my purse. I&#x27;ve never had so much luck in being able to tweeze my fine and short chin hairs.</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs rather then pulling them even when squeezing gently.&lt;br /&gt;There are other tweezers by the same brand that are MUCH better so I was somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers for my daughter.  I have had Tweezerman tweezers for over 15 years.  I would not purchase another brand.  These listed are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; tweezers, which I didn&#x27;t realize, but they still are great!</li>
            <li> My esthetician uses the Tweezerman brand and recommended them to me. They are perfect! I have had other brands in the past from Wal-Mart and would throw them away because they were useless. These tweezers are sharp and the points are tight, not allowing hair to slide through the tips.  Highly recommend these tweezers to everyone.</li>
            <li> this is easily the best personal care tweezer i have ever purchased and i do not regret it one bit. although this was the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size, i really don&#x27;t see the need to buy the full size, other than to have more than one of this really great tool. however, i can see perhaps the need if someone had arthritis or similar mobility/flexibility limitations -- the full-size may come in handy for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will treat this with care and hopefully keep it a long time. (note: my only, only regret is that it comes in so many colours -- i actually hoped aloud &amp;#34;don&#x27;t let mine be pink!&amp;#34; -- and, you guessed it, i got pink. however, i cannot rate it down for that, as it is clearly stated and does what it should. just not a pink kind of person!) :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old, dull revlon tweezer and I like the size of this tweezer but I expected more from it because it was a little pricey.  I kinda prefer my old one over this, but it will do for now until I find a better one.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs! That is... those  hairs these tweezers actually can grip. Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m flabbergasted. I keep reading about how wonderful they are... well, not for me. I have about six \\&quot;granny hairs\\&quot; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout. I&#x27;m NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those, too. Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners. THAT is the best tweezer I ever used. It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1397325896&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;revlon+tweezer</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned. They don&#x27;t slip and even get the smaller hairs that have barely broken the surface. One thing you should be careful of is that it is possible to poke yourself with them (and pierce your skin) if you get too enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as my full size tweezerman tweezers. They still work, but they work more like a cheap drugstore tweezer. I would recommend just buying the full size as they are really not that much larger.</li>
            <li> These are small but awesome.</li>
            <li> what can I say they are tweezers but so far we are very satisfied with them they work very well.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these! I already have a pair and they work great! I bought these for a present and was happy with the price and happy with the free eyebrow brush that came with it!</li>
            <li> What is there to say really? Just a cute little tweezer. Comes with a free brow brush. Serves its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to get a much cheaper pair, but then I remembered how dull the cheaper ones get. I decided to spring for a Tweezerman and I am glad I did. They offer free filing if you send it in to them. After having mine for about a year, I think it may finally be time for a filing. They are so tiny that it would only cost a dollar or two to mail them in. Definitely cheaper than buying a whole new tweezer! Great product. I didn&#x27;t buy my mini on Amazon but at the store, and it came in a little plastic carrying tube which helps keep the tweezer from snagging on things, and slows the dulling process. I am not sure if this one comes with a tube, but the tube is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> This is my first pair of Tweezerman tweezers and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  I had no idea there was that big of a difference between cheapie tweezers and something of more quality.  These get down to the nitty gritty and pull those hard to grab onto nasty little brow hairs that are hard to see.  Yes, they also happily grab and de-root those gnarly grandma chin hairs that unexpectedly appear overnight for no apparent reason.  (Where do those come from anyway?)  I took one star off simply because they are a little small.  They are great for carrying in your purse and come in a handy plastic carrying tube.  If I ever need another pair, I will be looking for the same brand.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any problem with hairs breaking off like some other reviewers have complained about.</li>
            <li> These are almost too sharp and will occasionally pull at my skin if I&#x27;m not careful but they are incredibly precise and do their job phenomenally.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price. I love this product... they work amazingly well.  They get even the smallest of hairs and it does not pinch my skin.</li>
            <li> Comes with one, not three like pictures. Very sharp and good quality though</li>
            <li> I fail to understand why this got so many 5-star ratings unless these people have never used a tweezer before. It&#x27;s small, which is good for travel but it is not nearly as good at grabbing the hairs as my other 15 year old pair of hand tweezers. I would not recommend this product. I would get something that is more durable and better at grasping hairs.</li>
            <li> The small size is perfect to fit in my purse.  The case keeps it from getting lost in there too.  The edges are even and the grip on hair, slivers, etc. is solid.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes really great products.  I love my tweezers so much that I buy them as gifts for others that complain about their drugstore tweezers all the time.  This was a gift, and the recipient has shared many thanks since she started using them!</li>
            <li> I think they work great.  But I also bought 1.5 tweezer at Target while waiting for this one.  I have to say they both work equally well.  So what the heck, I own a &amp;#34;tweezeman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hairs and this grabs them easily! Love them.</li>
            <li> One of the best  Tweezer out there I love it to pieces. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> They grab hairs well which can be hard to find with tweezers.  Great value</li>
            <li> Great size for brows.  The standard are almost too long but these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Not real Tweezerman products!! Cheap rip off. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Had to return, but 1plus is I got my $$ back</li>
            <li> My mom used to tell me that Tweezermans are the only brand of tweezers I should buy, so they&#x27;re pretty much all I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have a mini pair, a full-size pair, and a needle-nose pair. They just WORK, the way most tweezers should, but usually don&#x27;t. They last years. The blades are always perfectly in alignment. I&#x27;ve never had a pair bend or break or lose their alignment. If your pair is solid-colored, the color won&#x27;t scratch off or fade, even if they get thrown around in drawers and crushed in makeup bags the way tweezers usually are. My purple polka-dot pair has the dots rubbing off after two years, but besides that, they&#x27;re in perfect condition. My use of other tweezer brands has been short-lived. I quickly get frustrated with their inability to grab short, thin eyebrow hairs as well as these can. Trust me, you&#x27;re more likely to lose these tweezers before they dull or fail on you, and if they do become dull, you can just send them back to be sharpened. As a side note, Tweezerman makes it easy to send them in for sharpening. It took three weeks the one time I did it, and my old pair came back as good as new. Just make sure they&#x27;re washed thoroughly in alcohol before you send them. It&#x27;s their policy that they won&#x27;t sharpen them unless they&#x27;re clean, because EW, they don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been using those things for!  Like I mentioned before, I have a mini slant pair for travel and a full-size slant pair for home use, and honestly, I have no preference of one over the other. In my experience, the mini pair offers the same performance as the full-size pair in a smaller package. Order the pair you think will be easier for you, personally, to use. You get the same quality either way. I use the &amp;#34;Slant&amp;#34; model for eyebrow grooming, and it works great for that. I&#x27;d recommend getting the needle-nose (or what Tweezerman calls the Point) variety for medical needs like splinter removal and ingrown hairs, because they&#x27;re sharper and more precise. But be warned: they&#x27;re also dangerous and painful. My needle-nose pair lives in the first aid kit most of the time, because I don&#x27;t want something that sharp anywhere near my eyes. :O  I can&#x27;t believe other people have had the same problem with getting their Tweezermans stolen and used by partners. Who does that? Who uses someone else&#x27;s gross tweezers? But it&#x27;s happened: one day my boyfriend came out of the bathroom demanding to know where I got my &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; tweezers. Obviously, I had to sterilize mine and get him his own pair so that wouldn&#x27;t happen again, because EW, I don&#x27;t know what he was using those things for! His are dark grey and manly, and they&#x27;re also new and sharp, so I doubt he&#x27;ll keep using my purple polka-dotted ones. That peace of mind is worth every penny. Victory.  EDIT: I just realized since I have a brand-new pair sitting in my apartment now, I should compare it to my three-year-old pair that I&#x27;ve never had sharpened so you can see how they&#x27;ve held up over long-term use. So I&#x27;m including comparison pictures. The dark grey ones are brand-new, and the purple polka-dot ones are three years old. To the touch, the new ones feel a tiny bit sharper at the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; point, but aren&#x27;t easily distinguishable besides that. I&#x27;m also including a mini versus full-size picture. Hope it&#x27;s helpful!</li>
            <li> Small and expensive BUT now I finally have a tweezer that is made precisely enough to work.  If you are frustrated that yours won&#x27;t grasp those hairs or splinters, THIS is the one!</li>
            <li> YEAH I&#x27;m a guy and since I moved up in age I noticed I&#x27;m growing ear hair so once in awhile I have to pluck them &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;.  My wife would get mad because I used hers, so like a big boy I bought me the Tweezerman.  The first time I used them I think I plucked a pound of hair I was so mad at my wife for not telling me I had that much hair in my ear I mean I was pulling hair I couldn&#x27;t even see,  My wife asked me how much did I buy them for she laughed and said I would never pay that much for tweezers well she tried them and guess what yup she wants 1 not only her but my step daughter and my Mom so guess what everybody getting in their stocking this yr for Christmas!</li>
            <li> It says made in Germany, but instead India.  Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Love love love these!!! They grab onto the hairs like they&#x27;re supposed to, and they pull me out! I&#x27;m so sick of cheap store bought ones that don&#x27;t work so I&#x27;m so excited about these!</li>
            <li> LOVE these tweezers. Had a pair before but I gave it to my mom because she loved them too so I definitely had to get my own pair! It gets every hair, no matter how short and the size is perfect. The little tube it comes in is really useful as well!</li>
            <li> Perfect size to hold in your hand to easily shape your eyebrows!  I periodically lose mine so always come here for another pair!  I like the minis even better than the full size!</li>
            <li> After somehow losing my last pair of tweezers on a trip, I was in need of a new pair. I came to Amazon first and saw these highly rated Tweezerman tweezers for about $12. For a pair of tweezers?! Seemed outrageous. I went to WalMart and bought a pair for about half that price and attempted to use them to remove some ingrown hairs. To what should I liken that process? Put one quarter on top of another, and try to use those as tweezers. Yeah, it was about like that. The tips of the tweezers were very poorly aligned and so did not grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back again to Amazon, and I ordered this pair of Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezers. Success! The tips align so perfectly that when the tweezers are squeezed together, it is difficult to see the seam between them--the hallmark of a well machined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both ends of the slant tips are relatively sharp. Not needle sharp, but sharp enough so that only the most deeply buried splinter or hair would require something besides this pair of tweezers to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They measure just shy of 2.75 inches. If this sounds too small for you, you could go for the full length slant tweezers, which, depending on color, are anywhere from 6-10 dollars more. But I have no problems getting a thumb and two fingers on this smaller version, more than enough for any tweezer task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson? I thought I had learned this one, but evidently I need to repeat it for myself: &#x27;The cheapest tool ends up being the most expensive one.&#x27; Why? Because when it breaks or fails, you have to add the cost of the one you should have bought to start with. Start here, and this will be the last pair of tweezers you need.</li>
            <li> Was thinking these might be too small but they are good. With the clear case they are perfect for purse and travel. I prefer slant tip so no problems there. My only disappointment was the color - there was none. Plain old stainless steel.</li>
            <li> These tweezers do the job they are intended to do.  The smaller size takes a little getting used to though, but no big deal.  After reading all the raving reviews for these tweezers, I somehow thought they were going to be amazing.  In my opinion, that&#x27;s not the case.  They work just about as well as my old tweezers that cost probably $10 less.</li>
            <li> sharp and small, works perfect!  Lifetime warranty and not too small at all even though it is labeled as a mini!</li>
            <li> So sharp! Best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned by far! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman has the best tweezers-  no other comes even close.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers so far.  The ends is sharp enough and it holds the hair well.  I got pink.  Would have preferred a different color.  For the price, I actually did thought I was getting three.  But to confirm, you only get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good tweezers.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. These are perfectly machined tweezers, the two ends meet perfectly giving a much larger surface area and thus a much higher chance to successfully tweeze what your are trying to tweeze.  Honestly they are nothing like the tweezers at the drug store, they actually tweeze every time, instead of forcing you to waste time tweezing at things until the tweezers finally align right and tweeze what you are trying to tweeze.   If you tweeze about it, all the money you spend over the years, buying cheap 1 dollar tweezers that barely work after one tweeze, could be much MUCH better spent on 1 pair of these tweezers.  In fact, I love these tweezers so much, I wrote I poem about them.  If you tweeze with these, you&#x27;ll never believe the ease with which these tweeze the hair in your sneeze, You see I now tweeze with the breeze, smelling the cheese with ease as the breeze blows through my sneeze, No longer is my sneeze blocked by trees that I could not tweeze with ease. Please don&#x27;t sneeze when you tweeze the trees in your sneeze, But tweeze with the seas and watch the cold ocean breeze seize with each tweeze. Live with the trees and the seas and the breeze, no longer being haunted by that sneeze you could not tweeze.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well!  I did not realize they were mini but they work - for me - just as well a standard size set of tweezers!</li>
            <li> Best little tweezers ever. Nice gripping to them and they a a good size.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are good its just spendy. I was shipped the blue ones and they came with a little case so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These are an amazing edition to my grooming supplies.  I forgot/didn&#x27;t realize how sharp and effective tweezers can be until I literally couldn&#x27;t pull one eyebrow hair out with my old pair anymore.  I read the reviews on these and they are great.  The best part - you can send them back to be sharpened FOR FREE!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers and I like how small but durable they are.</li>
            <li> Great tweezer for a good price.</li>
            <li> A great tweezer, does the job.</li>
            <li> Best tweezer i&#x27;ve ever had.  Very precise and gets any tough or small hair. Would def Recommend</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great!</li>
            <li> Best pair of tweezer I have tried. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this tweezer got my husband &amp; I and we are both so glad I went with to brand. They are sharp and have the perfect grip. I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy tweezers, yes even men because no woman wants their man with a uni-brow :)</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I expected.  They did come with a case so you don&#x27;t loose them.  Nice for travel</li>
            <li> Great little tweezers</li>
            <li> I like the tweezer as they are good quality. I got the color I wanted, which was the teal. But I think they are more hyped up than they should be. $12 for tweezers is on the pricey side. Hopefully, they will last and be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> OK, but definately not great.  Mostly disappointed considering what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not amazing. It doesn&#x27;t get all of those little hairs I&#x27;m constantly after, but it does a pretty good job for the price. This is the second pair of these tweezers I have owned. The last pair dulled over time and the tips eventually became damaged with accidental drops on my tile floor.</li>
            <li> There are a little small, but work just great.</li>
            <li> These are terrible, maybe I got a bad pair but they don&#x27;t tweeze/pick up hair any better than the drugstore brands.  I thought that with the price and good reviews they would be the best tweezers ever, but not even close.</li>
            <li> love these tweezers!  lifetime sharpening is so awesome!  thank u..........</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest most accurate tweezers.  Makes grooming easier and relatively painless.  I love the tweezerman.  The mini works for me because I can get closer to my brows which makes me more accurate.  Love the little packing tube as well.</li>
            <li> BEST TWEEZERS EVER!!!!!!! GETS EVERY HAIR EVERY TIME! The packaging is so cute too and it comes with a tube container for the little tweezer. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the best tweezers! They are perfectly aligned and sharp and they do not slip. This size is great for my purse.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the best.  They grab the littlest hairs no problem.  Wish I had bought these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This is a great pair of tweezers and in such a beautiful color of Aqua.</li>
            <li> These tweezers seem top quality but a little over priced to me. They work great and the little carrying bottle is really useful.</li>
            <li> Before I bought these, I would have said that all tweezers are created equal. Well, I sure don&#x27;t feel that way any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are small, no question -- but I actually like the size, because you can control them a bit better. They come with a little clear plastic tube that is pretty useless to me (it might be good for travel?). My favorite thing about them is that they have a surprisingly good grip, which makes for really accurate (and less painful) tweezing!</li>
            <li> Fot that much money I expected a better pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezer for eyebrows.  I carry these in my travel kit for touch ups and the tips are incredibly precise.  They grab those teeny hairs like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.  I love these!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years and will never use any other brand. They last forever and are just sharp/precise enough.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, will use everyday!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve owned...can grab even the tiniest hair!!</li>
            <li> very small but work well</li>
            <li> these are really small (and i&#x27;m a petite woman). They do the job well enough though.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well and the small tube case is handy. They grab so well you have to be careful not to pinch your skin.</li>
            <li> Work great. Come with a little protector tube. Defiantly mini but more than fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers, but nothing special. I don&#x27;t think they work any better than less expensive versions.</li>
            <li> great quality! amazing price! and compact just like i like it! Fits in my tiny makeup bag togo. Color was chosen at random,I got the purple one. super cute color. I LOVE tweezerman as they have FREE sharpening online! theyll send you the return shipping label, you send it in, and get it back in a few weeks! brand new and sharp again! I have 2 tweezermans, so I have one handy when I send in the other one. love this brand!</li>
            <li> Decent tweezers but not better than any others I got so I don&#x27;t get why they are so overpriced and overhyped.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. If you are thinking &amp;#34;my tweezers can&#x27;t really grab short or fine hairs&amp;#34; get these. They are sharp and you need to protect the tip, but that is easy enough</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit it:  I&#x27;m too cheap to buy the full-size treezerman freezers.  This mini freezer comes in a cute container, and the tweezers themselves are the best that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers. They work.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever. I have bought every brand in the store, and finally I found these online. They are by far the best. They go dull after a while and I don&#x27;t know how to sharpen them so I end up buying another pair. It&#x27;s okay b/c they are cheap and I use them every day.</li>
            <li> I like tweeter an tools and this is perfect for carrying in my purse</li>
            <li> This is great for your pocketbook.....it comes in a little plastic tube that just sits in a zipper compartment.  How many times have you been out and wanted a tweezer for a quick emergency :)  Now you will have it.  Love these!</li>
            <li> The purple covering keeps coming off.  The tweezers cost too much to be made like junk.  I know, just glue them, ugh!  Tweezers are ok to use.  I bought a different pair for $2 less, no flimsy covering and tweezers are great for removing tiny things (I make jewelry).  Save your $2.00.</li>
            <li> Good but too small for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those annoying nose hairs and daily fight of the uno-brow.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, plus the free sharpening is a bonus. Perfect for brow maintenance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I anticipated, about two inches. But it comes in a little case and does the job very well. This is literally what my eyebrows needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!! They get every little hair without fail and I purchased an extra pair for my daughter away at college</li>
            <li> These are very accurate for tweezing! I like the little plastic tube it comes in for storage. Sharp and strong, they get the job done. (I got green, I might have preferred purple, but ... really, It doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve found in a long time for plucking hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used mine for nearly ten years and it&#x27;s still super sharp. I love that it&#x27;s efficient, sturdy, and small.</li>
            <li> Best hair plucking experience ever.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman are the best tweezers out there. I own several, and I love them!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are definitely worth the money! I find that the smaller &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size is actually better! Once you start using the mini one, you think its awkward BUT after you&#x27;ve been using them for a while, and then try to use the full size tweezers, I find the full size ones are now awkwardly big!  Its also nice that the mini ones are cheaper. I have several pairs and I will wait until 3 or 4 pairs need sharpening and I mail them to tweezerman for free sharpening. Meanwhile I have a couple more pairs ready to use. I cant live without my tweezers! they make a great stocking stuffer for your teenage daughters or nieces as well! I totally recommend these over any others!</li>
            <li> Best tweezer I ever had - picks up the tiniest hairs</li>
            <li> These little tweezers do what they&#x27;re supposed to...efficiently.</li>
            <li> Really great! Would recommend</li>
            <li> Yeah. I mean, they&#x27;re tweezers. I don&#x27;t perform extensive tweezing on my face, but I like to keep the uni-brow hairs under control. I&#x27;ve had tweezers in the past that wouldn&#x27;t make full contact between the blades when tweezing. I&#x27;d have to find the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; in order to get them to grab hairs. Not with these Tweezerman tweezers. These things can grab hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel, purse, and at home.  I honestly use them daily to combat my eyebrows.  Very precise and easy to control</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel but find I use them quite frequently. Keep the plastic tube for storage. It keeps the tips from dulling and protects the arms from coming unaligned.</li>
            <li> Just like the regular size but smaller, however I prefer the reg size just bc I&#x27;m used to it. But it&#x27;s still great especially for a little makeup bag for your purse</li>
            <li> I was in the beauty section of target looking for a new pair of tweezers. overwhelmed by the possibilities, I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did not think tweezers would be such a big deal to me, but here I am. I live for tweezerman tweezers. my brows have never been better, and I have cultivated a more mischievous look than ever before. thank you, tweezerman.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work well, grasping tiny fine hairs. I also like the color that stands out so i don&#x27;t lose them as easily!</li>
            <li> I like this product but am a little put off by how sharp they are. They do grasp little fine hairs and coarse hairs easily, but watch out! I have cut myself with these because of how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> The product is alright. It grabs the hairs and it works fine, but it&#x27;s not AMAZING because sometimes, it wouldn&#x27;t grab my smaller hairs. Also, when they say mini, they mean mini. The pink tweezer I received was a bit bigger than my thumb. I&#x27;ll be using this, but I don&#x27;t think I would ever repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Great little set of tweezers and case. I got pink!</li>
            <li> Works great. The travel tube is nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, good product</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t grasp hair as if they are already dull. I&#x27;d ask for my money back but it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. Now I have to buy more tweezers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman.  Hairs don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the full size Tweezerman tweezers, which is fantastically. I bought these for travel, but I would buy these for everyday use too if I needed a new pair.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers that stay sharp. Size is large enough to use with man hands, and small enough to easily store.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, but very sharp. It can cut you</li>
            <li> With the price on the tweezerman tweezers, i really expected something extra special! These are fine tweezers, don&#x27;t get me wrong... but i don&#x27;t find that they can get the itty bitty hairs any better than the generic ones i have. oh well. maybe they will last longer. they look nice. i wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome, best tweezers ever.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish these weren&#x27;t purple, but there were no color options when I ordered. Other than the color, these tweezers are excellent, with a FAR superior grip and performance than the $20 Revlon tweezers my ex left at my house when we broke up 5 years ago. Those Revlons also had a horrendous hot pink trim, so the purple of the Tweezermans is actually somewhat of an improvement, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus to these tweezers, is that the smaller size makes them way more manageable for ego-lowering tasks like getting those rogue hairs that randomly start sprouting out of your ears when you start pushing 40. The Tweezermans also don&#x27;t stab me at the slightest provocation like the Revlons did. Like in the case of a home invasion, I could have legitimately defended myself with the Revlons. You won&#x27;t really be able to thwart an attack with your Tweezermans, but at least you won&#x27;t have a unibrow.</li>
            <li> Just received and very disappointed! Rust on one side and what looked like an electrical arc burning thru the paint on the other! Crazy bad Quality Control!</li>
            <li> I own a regular sized Tweezerman Tweezer but wanted one for travel/the office and this is just what I needed.  I have no complaints and am satisfied with the Tweezer and the container it comes with.</li>
            <li> I love this size even more than the original, larger, size. They&#x27;re perfect for your make-up bag, extra bathroom, I think I have like four pairs. And their lifetime sharpening is a plus, too!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman are the best.  Very sharp honed edges that are great for even getting the smallest of hairs!</li>
            <li> They work great and are small enough to carry in your purse/makeup bag</li>
            <li> I use Tweezerman everything. This is my first time purchasing a mini tweezer. I don&#x27;t love it but I don&#x27;t hate it. Next time I&#x27;m just going to purchase the full size, it&#x27;s well worth the extra money. For some reason the mini didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li> Much shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Were smaller than expected. This size is okay for travel or your purse but would prefer a larger size for serious use.</li>
            <li> Low price, excellent quality!</li>
            <li> The BEST tweezers. These are sharp and precise, and get even the smallest hairs the first time. They came in their own little tube, too, which will protect them from getting dull bumping around in my drawer.</li>
            <li> does the job for the size of it</li>
            <li> This is a great tweezer to keep in your purse, travel make-up bag or even your car.  It comes in a nice tube with a cap on it so that it is protected and you also don&#x27;t poke yourself when reaching in a bag to find it.</li>
            <li> Very good tweezers, better than what can be found at stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezers.  They remove the tiniest of hairs and splinters too.</li>
            <li> believe the hype. endure the price. clean your brow. feel the beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2 inches roughly in length. don&#x27;t feel like it should be any longer.&lt;br /&gt;can pluck almost any hair, definitely all the noticeable ones&lt;br /&gt; worth it. i&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the the numerous and great reviews.  I was hoping for a great pair of tweezers that would &amp;#34;remove every hair every time&amp;#34; as the description states.  These are, by far,  the worst tweezers I have ever used!  The little tweezers that came in my car&#x27;s first aid kit work better!  Save your money and get a $4 pair from Revlon.</li>
            <li> I mean they&#x27;re tweezers but these have to be the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. Theyre small but precise and make eyebrow grooming very easy</li>
            <li> Works perfectly so far.  I purchased this to pluck out my gray/white hairs and it works amazingly well.  All the tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past don&#x27;t come close to this product.  The size of the tweezer (to hold and to grab hairs) is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ideal hair plucker and I can&#x27;t find any other product on amazon that plucks hair out as well as this one and I&#x27;ve tried 5-6 so far.</li>
            <li> Perfectly compact, and I love that it&#x27;s casing provides added protectant and keeps it sanitary in between uses, especially when I keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I found Tweezerman LTD Mini Slant Tweezers to be a waste of money.  Will not be reordering.   They are just too small.  I found the tweezers had difficulty gripping eyebrow hair.   Will order a larger pair next time.</li>
            <li> pulled my first sliver with them the other day, they were the right tool for the job...</li>
            <li> I have bought many tweezers and clippers and all sorts of Tweezerman products but I refused to pay the higher price that they charged and bought all the discount brands. And I bought a lot of other brands but they soon broke or were garbage, The tweezers would not come together precisely so they wouldn&#x27;t grab anything well. I finally broke down and bought the smallest tweezerman tweezer. I was sold. The quality is top notch, they are milled precisely and grip anything. I have bought 5-6 different Tweezerman products after that first little one. It&#x27;s like comparing a Mercedes or Ferrari to a Yugo, no comparison. They are definitely worth the extra money, they are actually worth more. And wait until you get one and feel what they put on the handles, the color is spongy and it helps it not slip, fabulous. Just buy one and you will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp or precise as I would like them to be. Can find same ones at wal-mart for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers so much. I have small hands and these fit perfectly. You can get the smallest hairs with these. Mine are green and the little tube is a great size for your purse.</li>
            <li> quickly became dull after about 1 week of use</li>
            <li> tweezer that is worthy of its name! works well every time. does not disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Basic tweezers. Rubberized grip. Kinda tiny, but who cares? If you need more leverage, you should probably be using pliers. The business end has precision-machined tips for maximum grip. Consequences will never be THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the wife as an additional pair.  You can not go wrong buying Tweezerman Tweezers.  These are well made and have a precision edge that allows you to grasp even the most stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> Love Tweezerman tweezers!  I like that these are a bit smaller and fit quite nicely into my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t work well. no grasp.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.  These make the hair break off, rather than pulling it out by the roots.  You have to grab with the point and have the hair go diagonally across, to keep from breaking the hair off and leaving the root.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever invented.  other brands don&#x27;t pick up the tiny hairs as well as a tweezerman tweezer.  Love it.  The mini is great for purse size and travel.</li>
            <li> This works so well for tiny hairs on my face that I rue the time I spent struggling before I found them. They slant just perfectly and grip very well so I can accomplish the task in minimal time along with a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in your purse. and work very well.</li>
            <li> After criticizing &#x27;expensive&#x27; tweezers for years... I finally get it! This is so so so worth your money. Just buy one of these and pluck away! Love the slant, cute colors, seems heavy duty - should last a long time. So Happy!</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers so much. They stay sharp, and they are the only tweezer that I have found that actually works. Every other tweezer on the market is crap compared to these. Their higher price is worth it. Other tweezer have problems with not closing all the way, not being sharp, having a weird grip, having a curved end. Not these its like once you buy these, that&#x27;s it your done with buying tweezers for the rest of your days. Unless your like me who loses them.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to use, and comes in a handy little keep-safe tube.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work great for rmoving very thin cactus stickers.</li>
            <li> High quality tweezers at an affordable price. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> Awsome! This is the one, hands down it picks up on the finest ingrown hairs. Tried many that cost twice as much, but nothing even comes close!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent tweezers, but nothing fantastic.  Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I always choose tweezerman and this mini doesnt disappoint!  Perfect for my purse!</li>
            <li> It only loses one star because of the size of it. Hard to grip but does a great job</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezers. No comparison to drugstore tweezers.</li>
            <li> this is my third pair of these...not because they don&#x27;t work well...they are the best tweezers I have ever had! unfortunately...everyone i know &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; them...and then they end up missing and i have to replace them</li>
            <li> High quality and works well for eyebrows.  The thinner style tip on these tweezers makes it easier to grip and pull the hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite tweezer. I&#x27;ve spent 100+ dollars on tweezers over the past couple years and the mini Tweezerman is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers I will definitely recommend this. Totally worth the money compared to cheapo store kind.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but a little pricy. Later on in a corner store  I saw  Tweezerman about 3$  cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers. I keep it in a pouch in my bag for any &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; emergencies. The small practical size helps store it anywhere. I love their cute colors, I received the Purple tone which was the one I wanted. Good buy!</li>
            <li> These work well, but on any of my thinner hairs, it will just cut them right in half! Too sharp?</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so the full size aren&#x27;t always easy for me to maneuver. These mini tweezers are perfect and never miss a hair!</li>
            <li> these are terrible tweezers. they break the hair before I can pull it out.  the edges are rough.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with Tweezerman</li>
            <li> Great quality tweezer. Wish I had of upgraded my old pair ages ago&#x27;</li>
            <li> I bought this produce after watching many YouTube videos that highly recommend it. Very stylish and comes in many colors which is nice. I will never buy another type of tweezer as long as these are available.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Beautiful. Nothing bad. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Not any better than a way less expensive pair by Revelon.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever.  You will love them.  I have bought two now.</li>
            <li> Very sharp edges. Just remember, color may vary, my tweezers showed up as a mint green, oh well, no big deal i guess.</li>
            <li> This is such a high quality little tweezer.  Like many other reviewers I actually like the small size better than a full size tweezer because I can grip it well and can get better leverage and thus better plucking power.  The tip is very sharp and grips little hairs very well while getting right next to the root.  It even gets hairs that I can&#x27;t see even while looking in a magnifying mirror!  The slanted, sharp tip makes it easy to precisely get the hair you&#x27;re meaning to pluck.  You can&#x27;t beat the guarantee and free lifetime sharpening that comes with a Tweezerman product either.  I&#x27;m really impressed with these and they are an absolute steal.  I will definitely be buying more Tweezerman products!</li>
            <li> I read such excellent reviews of these tweezers.  Little did I know how superior they truly are.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are awesome it does suck cause I was looking for a particular color and was under the impression I had chosen that color and when d-day arrived they were not the color anticipated... but then again colors dont make pretty eyebrows</li>
            <li> They are very tiny and I would rate their performance as just OK. Their size does not make them awkward to use, but somehow the larger tweezers are more comfortable</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to finally buy this gem. I am very choosy about my tweezwers....I love these.  I ordered the mini slant in purple....arrived in pink but decided to keep and am glad I did.  Will definitely order another pair for travel toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why tweezers are so expensive. The cheaper ones don&#x27;t seem to work very well... These? You could probably pull a car with them. Perhaps a bit smaller than I was expecting, and color was lime green when they showed up. Minus one star for price.</li>
            <li> Even though it is the travel size, it is still just as easy to use. Even though you can&#x27;t pick the colour, they all look good. Great quality and comes with plastic case.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Grabs every hair on the first try. Only thing is that it pinches me so easily, and the pinches HURT, but maybe that;s because I&#x27;ve only been tweezing my eyebrows about once a week for just a year now so i&#x27;m still a beginner. I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it i&#x27;ll enjoy this product much more. I definitely would recommend these tweezers and if something happens to mine i&#x27;ll be purchasing these again. I&#x27;m only 20 and i&#x27;ve got no job and im a broke as s*** college student so i didn&#x27;t want to pay 12 bucks for tweezers, but Don&#x27;t settle for a cheaper pair, it&#x27;s not worth the time and frustration you lose trying to grab on to those hairs.</li>
            <li> Love Tweezerman!  Who cares what color they send (some people complained) they are the best tweezers made.</li>
            <li> Super cute colors (I received mint one). Works great. I know it will last me a long time. Very compact and easy to store and take with me in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> These tweezers changed my life, for my body is merely a vessel for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good plucker and a nice size for my do small hands. Seems to remove stray eyebrows well.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous tweezers and always had problems with fine pick ups. That is the heads of the tweezers are not well design to align just right to grab fine objects or hair. This is the only set I have found that is precise!</li>
            <li> The last time i ordered these tweezers they were super sharp and worked amazingly . Unfortunately this time they were very dull and didnt work AT ALL :(</li>
            <li> Great tweezers... I&#x27;ve wasted money regularly on the cheap &amp;#34;check out line&amp;#34; tweezers in the past, but these have the feel that tells me they will last.  The hairs I target are actually tweezed (gasp!).</li>
            <li> I love its tiny size! I received mine in purple and it&#x27;s so cute! I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of tweezers, but in several months of near-daily use, they haven&#x27;t lost their sharpness and tweezing abilities! I have hard-to-tame eyebrows and a would-be unibrow thanks to genetics. But this can seriously grab every hair!&lt;br /&gt;If your only hesitation is its bitty size, don&#x27;t even worry about it. I haven&#x27;t noticed a single difference using a compact tweezer. Plus, it&#x27;s easier for travel and takes up less space! All wins in my book :)</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the best.  Before Tweezerman, it was a constant battle to consistently find a good tweezer that could pluck both fine and thick hairs, it was often hit or miss, most didn&#x27;t work well, but with Tweezerman I always get a quality tweezer, no matter if it&#x27;s mini or regular size.</li>
            <li> After going through many pairs of tweezers, I heard that this brand although on the pricey side was fantastic. I wasn&#x27;t too worried about what color I would receive, I just wanted a pair of Tweezerman tweezers at the lowest price available on Amazon. I did end up getting the color shown, but I would have been happy with just about any other color too. These are the absolute best tweezers I have ever used, they are wonderful at getting the tiny baby stray eyebrow hairs which I have found nearly impossible to remove with every other tweezer except these. I love that it came with a storage tube and plan to get several more for my purse and travel bag.  If you are on the fence due the price, go for it, they also come with lifetime sharpening and will replace them for free if the nipper spring breaks. I don&#x27;t know how I lived for so long without these tweezers!</li>
            <li> Just in a smaller size. Good for tiny brow hairs, and wayward chin and nose hairs. Tweezerman makes the best product</li>
            <li> These are precisely milled and shaped such that they grip along the entire tweezer face, not just the very tip or along part of the face as many other pairs of tweezers do.  As a result, they provide better grip for removing hair than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.  The tips are also very fine, so if you are removing a small splinter, you will be able to move the tweezers into the skin more deeply than with a blunter pair.  My only caveat is to be careful you don&#x27;t injure yourself with the tips, as they are fine enough to be sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you need a precision tool.  Keep them in the provided storage case in between uses, and they should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was apprehensive about spending so much on tweezers (I know, I know, I&#x27;m kind of a cheapskate), but these are fantastic!  I was using a crappy pair that came with a nail kit, and they would end up breaking the hair in half instead of actually pulling it out.  When I switched to these, it was like the heavens opened up and unicorns came down to delicately pluck the hair with their teeth.  Seriously these things are great- plucking my eyebrows no longer results in watery eyes, because I really can&#x27;t feel them being pulled out with these.  There&#x27;s also a pointy tip that I use for getting out ingrown hairs (gross, but hey, not all of us are great at shaving).</li>
            <li> Tweezerman tweezers are expensive... sometimes ridiculously expensive - they&#x27;re worth it.  Good quality stainless steel that doesn&#x27;t oxidize. Points and chisel edges that belong on precision instruments not medicine cabinet implements.  Forget other brands.  Forget buying the Walgrens&#x27; house brand special. Spend a little more and buy Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I got purple! Feels so goooood!</li>
            <li> I expected more. These are not as good as my revlon tweezers. They cut the hair rather that pull it.</li>
            <li> My favorite tweezers! Precise, cute color, ends align. THis one is a little small/short but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have believed the difference between a three dollar pair of tweezers and the Tweezerman, had I not owned all of the different brands that I have wasted money on all of these years, if I hadn&#x27;t finally bought this pair, and tried them for myself. If there&#x27;s a hair there, these are guaranteed to pull it, no matter how thin, or small, if it can grab it, it&#x27;s gone. Finally, tweezers that are made to work, and made to last!!</li>
            <li> My friend had a pair of these tweezers and was telling me how she loves them. It is hard to find a good pair that will still pull the smallest hair after repeated use. These seem to be holding up very well and I think that they are worth the price of them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers don&#x27;t close enough to grab the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Nicely make. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> it is amazing！so nice so comfortable！</li>
            <li> Great product.  Precise gripping.  Cute colors.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> these are the best tweezers you&#x27;ll ever buy!  I&#x27;m buying another one just to have an extra.  They grab any and every little eyebrow hair/fuzz you want.  This is a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Great storage for it. Some are better but for the money and to maybe travel. This is such a good deal.</li>
            <li> this is amazing product.. it tweezes effortlessly and is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> My wife uses these tweezers for everything. She&#x27;s had a pair for four years and says they work really well and are easy to handle. The most important thing she considers when buying tweezers is how thick the edge is. Mos tweezers have  thick edge so it&#x27;s hard to grab hair or splinters. The tweezerman tweezers have a thin edge which makes it easy to grab on to things. The minis are hard to hold for big hands compared to the regular ones, but they don&#x27;t rust, become dull or chip. Best tweezers we&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> these are sharp and precise; what else can you say about a pair of tweezers?!?  Love Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well--better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever just used cheappie tweezers from Target, and i thought they worked fine.  That was until I got this.  This things works amazingly well.  Its definitely a precision instrument; its aligned and clamps tightly without any gaps.  I tried it out and I was able to pull the smallest baby hairs out that wouldn&#x27;t have been picked with the crappy store ones that I have.  I won&#x27;t ever go back to chintzy tweezers again.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this item because we did not have a decent pair of tweezers in the house and no sooner than they arrived, we needed them to pull out cactii needles from hands!  Worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> From the picture, I thought there were 3 tweezers in the bag. But it arrives with only one. personally I think it doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> It gets those suckers off my face. Great buy</li>
            <li> works very well, even bought one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Never fails at grabbing a hair. Hate nose hairs and the sure grip of this tweezer makes removing them much less painful. Just wish I could choose colors. I hate the color of the pink one that I got.</li>
            <li> I love my tweezers and the little travel tube case it comes with. Simple!</li>
            <li> Gotta love tweezerman</li>
            <li> These are a smaller version of the Tweezerman. This is the first time I have owned one of these, and it works great. Very sharp and grabs the most annoying hairs just like the regular Tweezerman. These come with a plastic tube to keep them in, so they are great for travel. Mine also came with an eyebrow brush that pushes up and can be closed too. I received these in red, and the color looks nice. Very glad I didn&#x27;t wind up with the ugly pink ones. These are great as backup tweezers or to have on hand in your handbag while away from home.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have stated, I think that these tweezers are pretty great!  I purchased them at our local military exchange and have been very happy with how well they grip when I&#x27;m tweezing my brows, rarely slipping and making me tug the same hair more than once.  The only note that I would make to would-be purchasers is to use some caution -- don&#x27;t just grab quickly and then yank like a maniac or you may lose an eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re that sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products really are the best. I had a large pair floating around in my purse, but I got tired of getting stabbed by them when I&#x27;m rummaging around in there for things, so these were a perfect solution. They come with a durable little case for convenience. Pay attention to the size as they&#x27;re definitely &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, though they&#x27;re still big enough to be used conveniently and have the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> Beware - only one pair.  Incorrectly assumed that this was a pack of 3 tweezers as 3 were pictured in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;Needed and wanted 3 different colors for 3 different people in the household.  Humbug.</li>
            <li> Got the pink one, figures, wish you could choose. Color aside, the best tweezers around! Come with a little plastic holder to keep them protected. With proper care these will last forever. Buy them</li>
            <li> well made. have owned a couple of these. best tweezer i&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> These are really great tweezers, and the colors are fun.  They are MINI, which I didn&#x27;t realize at first, but that&#x27;s my mistake.  The size hasn&#x27;t really made a difference, and they come with a great little case.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, which makes it really easy to pluck hairs, or remove splinters. Love them! plus this one came with a brow brush.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and felt slightly crazy about paying so much for one pair of tweezers, but they are fairly amazing. I am very impressed and I see much less irritation in my skin from plucking.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother:(</li>
            <li> Blades on these are perfect for grabbing the elusive hair.  They are precise fitting and grab thin hairs.  It was a bonus it came with an eyebrow brush for free!</li>
            <li> I will never buy tweezers from another brand again. They&#x27;re little, which I like. The ends close evenly and tight, which I love. I&#x27;ve never owned tweezers that worked even remotely this well before.</li>
            <li> These are the only tweezers I can use, they work great! I highly recommend Tweezerman slant tweezers. Cute designs too.</li>
            <li> Well, these are pretty &#x27;mini&#x27; as the title suggests - big enough to tweeze my brows but def smaller than what I&#x27;ve been used to (honestly, I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the full size version so gave these a go figuring the tip was really what mattered!). Initially I was blown away by how precise these allowed me to get - pretty easy to grip my brow hairs. But after a month or so, I&#x27;ve found that their precision tip is also pretty sharp, and leads to me pulling hairs out half way, which is sooo frustrating. My old tweezers lost their precision and some grip, but once I got the hair I never struggled with getting the whole hair out at the root. Might just get a fresh new pair of my old version (revlon, with the handles like an eyelash curler), and save these for what it appears they were intended.. Travel.</li>
            <li> The price is what made me buy these; Tweezerman are usually ultra expensive.  They are &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - not great at getting ingrown hairs or things like that, but otherwise no complaints really.  I need to invest in a better pair, but for your basic tweezing needs, these tweezers will suffice.</li>
            <li> Green is my favorite color and I just happened to get lucky. You won&#x27;t necessarily get purple. These are the greatest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned and the mini&#x27;s are the perfect size. I think I would find a larger pair unwieldy.  I often get tiny coarse neck-hairs of a very dark color and with my old tweezers I&#x27;d have to dig at myself forever to get the tiny hair out or wait until it was long enough to be noticed by everyone. These tweezers are a no-brainer for anyone who uses tweezers once a week or more often. They&#x27;ll sharpen them for life?! Spend the money. It&#x27;ll save you time and frustration!</li>
            <li> Perfect tip and slant and a quality that will last.  I think the size is great for me.  Why would you need bigger tweezers if you are a female?  I received a pink one, but that was fine with me.  I don&#x27;t accessorize with my tweezers anyway!</li>
            <li> Very strong tweezers.</li>
            <li> I bought these on my daughter&#x27;s recommendation, even though I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending $12 for tweezers.  So far, they are terrific, and if they last, they will be worth the money.  I see that Tweezerman will even sharpen them if they wear out!  Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> Instead id plugging it tears the hair</li>
            <li> These tweezers can&#x27;t be beat, if only the price weren&#x27;t so steep. I but despite the high price, I thought I&#x27;d be nice and write a review so sweet.</li>
            <li> Good size, love the smaller size and price.  These last and last. Nice bonus was the clear storage tube to keep the tweezers clean.</li>
            <li> pulls out the finest smallest hairs</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very precise and nice and compact but they&#x27;re sharp! Be careful!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very small and light weight that did not pull my wives, daughters, or sons hair out at all. These tweezers are very flimsy and do not grab well. Additionally the color started coming off after the third use not sure if the pain falling off had lead in it as these tweezers are not made in the USA. I hope the color paint that came off did not get in my eye if it had lead paint. Oh well.  Additionally these are even more slippery if your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the trash these tweezers go!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your self from a bad purchase and get something else. BTW I paid full price for these tweezers and I do not sell tweezers and am not the competitor. Additionally I generally like the things I get on Amazon and leave good reviews. These are just not a very good item and I trying to help you out from needing to get something else.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought. But works fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing tweezers. I would suggest getting the larger version if you have bigger hands like I do, since after extended use your hands WILL begin to cramp. Not an issue with the tweezers, just an issue with the buyer :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, would recommend to anyone. Girlfriend is also very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love tweezerman tweezers, but felt these got dull quicker than most. Maybe because they are mini? Probably would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality pair of tweezers, this is your ticket. Made of good quality. Very effective for precision plucking. Great value for the money. Even comes with its own little case. I was lucky enough to receive mine in hot pink, the very color that I wanted!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezer sending them back did not tweeze</li>
            <li> The smaller size took a little getting used to but I will definitely be buying more of these. Not just because I like it so much but also because my daughter lost hers and took mine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid $12.00 for one single pair of tweezers! I guess I didn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; print. I thought I was getting 3 mini pairs!&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned &amp;#34;don&#x27;t look at the picture if you want to know what you are getting.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman tweezers! I bought a pair to put in my emergency kit. I&#x27;ve had my first pair (also in travel size) for going on eight years! Happy to know they&#x27;re on Amazon because I can&#x27;t imagine life without them. They&#x27;re so precise, other tweezers just feel cheap now.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers on the market! I initially bought these to use as my travel tweezers but it&#x27;s so much better than my Revlon tweezers that I&#x27;ve been using them everyday. I intend on buying the regular sized Tweezerman next.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the bomb! They work better than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Hands down!</li>
            <li> Awesome pair of tweezers. Very small and get the job done.</li>
            <li> OK product, not sure why it&#x27;s supposed to be the best, honestly, had better.</li>
            <li> I use to buy drug store brand tweezers because they were a fraction of the price. But they would get dull and I&#x27;ll be out again purchasing a new one. One day, I saw this smaller size Tweezerman Slant Tweezer and notice that the price of the smaller one was less than the larger size. So I decided to just get one and see what the rave was all about. UM these are AMAZING. The grip, the quality is superb. Every hair I grab with this tweezer actually holds on (where as the drugstore tweezers would only hold on half the time and where the rest of the time, I just end of pulling on it and not actually pull it out, ouch!) Now I understand why this is a Best Seller!</li>
            <li> This tweezer is absolutely worthless. It does not get the fine hairs or short ones.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I anticipate, but my eyebrows have never looked better!  Actually, this was for my wife and she said these tweezers are great.  I think that she likes the full size ones a little more because they are easier to grip with, but these still work great.</li>
            <li> I thought there was no way these tweezers could be worth the price - but they are. They never miss. I&#x27;ll never buy drugstore brand again.</li>
            <li> This is very Mini and too short for me. Probably good quality but not for me. I recommend for someone that wants a very short tweezer, I would not buy this again, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Grips oto the tiniest hairs!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothers me is that the tweezers are very small</li>
            <li> Tweezerman was light and easy to handle. A solid choice for a pair of tweezers. Does a fairly descent job, but not as good as the higher priced ones, but then again it is cheaper. Overall a solid performer.</li>
            <li> Seriously, ouch! I&#x27;ve tried to use these just a few times and cut myself at least twice. These are both too sharp and small to get a good grip. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be using these for over 10 minutes at a time, I&#x27;d recommend getting the regular sized ones, because my hands cramp up after a while. However, I get my eyebrows waxed once every 2 weeks, and only use these tweezers for touch ups in between waxing sessions. For a few strays here and there, these tweezers are perfect. It&#x27;s been 6 months and I still haven&#x27;t had a hair that they couldn&#x27;t get out (ingrowns included)!&lt;br /&gt;Basically, Tweezerman never disappoints, and I love these tweezers despite their size. BTW, if you didn&#x27;t know this already, Tweezerman tweezers come with lifetime sharpening guarantees!</li>
            <li> Good little tweezers, especially for the price. They stand up to a good amount of abuse without losing their alignment.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> great quality as always from tweezerman..gave them as a gift and she loved them</li>
            <li> The mini slant tweezers are perfect! The edge is sharp and stays in line over repeated use. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers</li>
            <li> Yup.  Turns out, if a tweezer is sharp it will grab those pesky little hairs better.  Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its products to keep them at their hair-plucking finest.  Unfortunately, mine are the grossest shade of green.  Wish they were the pretty purple.</li>
            <li> They really do &#x27;tweeze&#x27; better than your average tweezer!</li>
            <li> Although these tweezers ultimately get their goal, I don&#x27;t think that they are much better than my old ones.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT IT CAME WITH ALL 3!?</li>
            <li> I love these little tweezers! smaller than I thought but I guess I should I saw the &amp;#34;Mini&amp;#34; in the title when I bought it lol. My fault.  Great for taking it in your purse. never know when you will need it! I did find it alittle hard to pull the hairs out because they kept slipping through. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again but im definitely not throwing them out because it does work , just alittle harder to use then regular sized tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased tweezers at local stores by this manufacturer but the pair I received from this order were not that great!</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because the first one I bought several years ago was so tight and pulled hair out from the root so easily.  This new one doesn&#x27;t grip at all, so it is useless.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, but did not recieved the Tweezerman LTD Mini Slant.  Not worth the effort of returning the regular size Tweezerman.  Many years of excellence!</li>
            <li> Tweezers that work.  These really are the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> I have lost these or similar several times over the years (not through any issue with the product) and always buy another.  I bought the cheapest color.  These are far far better than low-end tweezers.  Ever since learning just how much better they are by trying out a girlfriend&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  I don&#x27;t see any advantage with the larger tweezerman over these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s between a 3 and a 4 because although these are quality tools, they are way too small to be any use to a guy. If you have ML to L hands don&#x27;t even look at these. I bought 3 thinking they are a good price not thinking anyone would make tweezers for Munchkins. But, when they say Mini, as they do buried in the middle of the name, they mean MINI. I&#x27;ll be giving all these I ordered away to ladies. Maybe they could use them.</li>
            <li> I got these tweezers based on reviews I&#x27;d seen in magazines and online for their precision. They&#x27;re no better than your average tweezers, but they&#x27;re double the price. At least that ensures I don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li> Tweezers are very effective, however, I did not receive the color I had ordered.  I realize this does not effective how the product works, but it is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> When it came it was much smaller than expected (though that&#x27;s my fault, should have read the product specifications), but don&#x27;t let that stop you - it does exactly what you&#x27;d want it to! It really is incredibly precise and strong - mine came in a nice green color, which was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t really think that tweezers could be  very different from each other. But these are awesome they&#x27;re so easy to use and find all those little hairs.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other tweezers you&#x27;ll find on Amazon.  If you can afford to upgrade, DO IT!  They do read me my morning horoscope though.</li>
            <li> Work ok, have a problem with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best tweezer I have ever owned.  At 44- I now travel with a tweezer in my purse, my make up bag, my car, my medicine cab...yes middle age where suddenly unwanted hair on my face is new for me!  Great Size-prefer this to the regular size.</li>
            <li> I love this mini tweezer.  I bought two and carry one in my handbag for emergencies. So easy to use and catches any loose brow or chin hairs on the first try.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on spending more than 3 bucks on tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I kept buying pair after pair of crappy tweezers that would break hairs or not grasp on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these after reading a review in Marie Claire. These are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grasp the hair at any point and seem to just glide the hair out of the root. I am not sure HOW they differ from my crappy 2 dollar tweezers but they certainly make a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I purchased these mini tweezers in pink.  They are really cute and I like that it comes in a little container.  I don&#x27;t think I will lose them like I usually do the silver tweezers that I buy in the drugstore.  Does the job also!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever used. They are sharp and really grab the hair. Mine didn&#x27;t come with a protector for the tips as the packaged stated, but it did come with a plastic tube to store them in. They are as sharp as knives, so you don&#x27;t want to drop them or do anything to dull the blades.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used, by such a wide margin.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are such great quality.  These are so much better than the other tweezers I had around.  They really do the job and come with a tiny plastic carrying case if you want to stash them in your purse.</li>
            <li> Works better than all the other brands I have tried so far. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I never knew you could love a pair of tweezers.  They grab when they are supposed to grab &amp; they are small enough to fit in my hand &amp; be able to maneuver around with them.  These replaced my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; tweezers &amp; those went into my drawer at work for emergency stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the tip alignment is perfect, but it&#x27;s too sharp :( Rather than gripping onto the hairs for me to pull, it just snips it (and I&#x27;m not even applying that much pressure).</li>
            <li> Great tweezer!  Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> High quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> great for travelling.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the pair I THOUGHT I&#x27;d lost, and had nothing to compare them to. When they first arrived. I thought they were perfect. I didn&#x27;t need to use them much but I noticed very quickly they were behaving like my cheaper pairs of tweezers - hair was slipping through, the grip wasn&#x27;t right, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I found my lost pair and did a bit of comparison. These are NOT regular Tweezerman tweezers! My original one (purchased at Ulta) can be seen at the top, which work perfect even after two years. The bottom pair are the ones I received from Amazon. Very noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;They just flat out don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d say go to Ulta and find a pair that will do the job.</li>
            <li> Order came very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li> Amazing Tweezer, really excellent</li>
            <li> Love these! Work very well</li>
            <li> Tweezers.....what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Small but not tiny.  I&#x27;d say most people could handle these easily, the travel size is not a sacrifice of function.  After pulling a short, dark brow hair, I looked and a nearly invisible, super thin hair had also been pulled.  These get it all.  Can make my brow line/arch that much sharper and more precise.  Very Satisfied.  The tube is perfect for tossing them in my make up bag.  I also like the pretty mint green color.</li>
            <li> I returned these because they weren&#x27;t sharp and they were extra big; not minis as described. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this tweezer last November, so I&#x27;ve had this for about 8 months. By now, it has noticeably lost some of its sharpness and precision, but still works great--- better than most tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. For the first few months, however, this tweezer did an AMAZING job at grabbing tiny hairs and just-grown-in brow stubble. My advice for owners: make sure to use these tweezers ONLY for plucking hair. I believe not doing so made my tweezer more dull. So don&#x27;t use tweezers for anything but hair because it will mess up the alignment of the blades. And that will suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great tweezer! Worth the money, fits in the hand perfectly, extremely portable and most of all super effective!</li>
            <li> Too small to grip any of the little hair. Due to the small size you need to use more strength for grip, most of the time it just doesnt grip the hair or blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love the size and works great at getting out every little hair.</li>
            <li> Alright tweezers but 11$ is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Very nice tweezer. Works perfectly. Small and easy to pack for travel. Comes in a cheap but effective plastic tube for storage. No choice in color so I&#x27;m happy mine were green.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected. Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li> I love these they work really well and haven&#x27;t dulled at all yet I have had them almost a year.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers. Way better than others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Good little tweezers.  Better than anything available at walmart.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of tweezers. Pulls hair completely out.</li>
            <li> Not three. One. I should have read.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to get these as they are supposed to be really great tweezers and she is still looking for better ones.  They were a bit pricey but they do the job and are pretty much on the line of basic transportation.  I&#x27;m not sure they justify the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Worked good to extract the one single stubborn whisker on my chin.  I have tried many tweezers and this one seems to be the best one.</li>
            <li> Lived up to the reviews. These little guys work great.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use because of the size. &amp; breaks the skin if u miss the hair</li>
            <li> Love these little tweezers (this is about the fourth I&#x27;ve bought; two I have and one each for two family members).</li>
            <li> Best brand of tweezers anywhere. This is the 2nd pair I&#x27;ve owned. They hold up great and are perfectly precise.</li>
            <li> I use tweezers probably 10 times a day for random things.. anything from plucking hairs (and ingrown hairs) to fixing toys.  I&#x27;ve also never tried &amp;#34;tweezerman&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve always just picked one up at the drugstore for around $8.  never thought to buy an expensive one bc I honestly didn&#x27;t think they would make that big a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are impressive tweezers. I&#x27;m only going to use these for hairs bc I don&#x27;t want to dull the tip. I was surprised how easily it got an ingrown hair.  got right into the skin. I had to be careful bc some skin came off, too. these are SHARP. which is exactly what I wanted.  just as someone else mentioned; these make other tweezers seem like putting two pennies together and trying to pull a hair.  I actually found that when trying to pull super fine hairs out of my eyebrows, this would actually cut and clip the hair where I applied the pressure – that&#x27;s how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are very small. about the length of my pinky.</li>
            <li> not bad, a little bit pricy</li>
            <li> Got the my favorite color purple one. The little can to storing it is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> Kinda high prices :P but works really well!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, stayed sharp for months!</li>
            <li> I lost my last Tweezerman and was disappointed in the less expensive replacement I purchased, so went back to this little guy.  Not much to say other than he does what he&#x27;s supposed to do - tweeze!  I also like the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size vs the larger size as it seems I can grip it better / have better control when I&#x27;m trying to grab that tiny errant brow hair.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find good tweezers, and these are GREAT!  Super sharp so be careful and pretty small.  Thankfully I have small hands but they are perfect for a purse and are fantastic for stubborn hairs.  FYI-there is only 1 in the package even though it pictures 3.</li>
            <li> These actually feel a bit small in my hand (and I have medium hands - size 8 ring).  Kind of took some getting used to.  However, they are a great size for your purse and come with a little carry case (plastic).  The work great though for getting small eyebrow hairs and grip the hair great.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pair I received just don&#x27;t work... My old dime store pair work better for me than these. And like a previous reviewer said the ends do not come flat together making it pretty impossible to tweeze anything.</li>
            <li> The product does the job.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of these tweezers. They are so sharp that instead of pulling out the hairs, they tend to cut them, making them impossible to then pull out. For $11 I expected more.</li>
            <li> I bought this Mini Slant Tweezer to replace my old tweezers. It took me several days to get used to the angle of the end--but now that I am--I&#x27;m loving it. I like that they&#x27;re small (but not too small), so that I have better control over tweezing fine hairs. Overall--I&#x27;m glad I went with this higher-end brand...the review are well deserved!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for the price. Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Great price. Much better than at the store.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a very old Tweezerman tweezer. I love the fact that they&#x27;re small and they came with a little container since I had planned to use them in my travel bag. But these are not the same quality as my old Tweezermans--they are definitely better than cheapies from Walmart but they are not nearly as precise as my old Tweezerman tweezers. Maybe I just got a bad set but I&#x27;m disappointed. Not what I expected from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> i have heard lots and lots about these tweezers but i was always pretty happy with my cheaper versions until my cheaper ones disappeared.  when i first received these i didn&#x27;t really like them.  They are very sharp and took me a little while to be able to work with them.  initially i would scratch my skin up when i couldn&#x27;t get a hair to come out but after a little while either they dulled a bit or i can handle them better but now i find them to be great tweezers.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Really good at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very nice and sharp, Easy to use for eye brows.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers you can find, fur shore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezerman slant tweezers for many years. They are excellent and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand. I&#x27;ve never taken advantage of the free sharpening because I never feel like it&#x27;s needed. This mini tweezer is just as good as the regular size but great for travel and carrying in my purse.</li>
            <li> Anything tweazerman is awesome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. I got a black one would have preferred a brighter color.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what all the rave reviews were about - I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this tweezer and the cheap ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I think these are the best tweezers I have ever purchased. I don&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re all that &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;, since they&#x27;re still easy to grip. These are very precise and will grip even the most stubborn hairs. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT S NOT PRECISE. THE TIPS CANT HOLD SHORT HAIR ON MY CHIN AND I CANT USE TO PULL ANY SHORT HAIR OUT ON MY CHIN.  RECOMMEND: BUY SOLINGEN BRAND</li>
            <li> Great little pair of tweezers. So perfectly cut, very sharp. Comes with a little clear tube with a lid to keep the tweezers in. The color is also very nice!</li>
            <li> go ahead. These actually work.</li>
            <li> Always good! Now, if only I would stop losing these!</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m far from &#x27;metro&#x27; but these little guys will make you immediately realize how sub-par the generic drug-store brand tweezers perform. At first, I had a hard time justifying a $10+ pair of tweezers but I assure you - you won&#x27;t regret getting this pair of quality tweezers. Far, far superior.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger (and some color other than pink), but I knew what I was buying.  These work better than any other tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, I have always bought cheap tweezers. I have wasted my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get every wayward eye brow hair,  you know when you just start feeling that coarse hair and you know when you wake up it&#x27;ll be 5 inches long?  This can get it!  No more trying to grab hairs 10x ... just once.</li>
            <li> I like them, but the full sized tweezers work better / are easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used! Worth every penny! From now on I will only use Tweezerman tweezers. They grab hold of the finest hairs! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Small, travel size tweezers that get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the far best one and only tweezer to ever use! All the rest don&#x27;t stack up to this TWEEZERMAN, IS THE BEST!</li>
