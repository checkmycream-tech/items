            <li>But, they are cute and seem to be fairly well made.</li>
            <li>Luckly he was nice to walk to my house and give me my package.</li>

            <li>I love the different assortment of colors and the material is great quality.  </li>
            <li>They are vibrantly colored and stay in fairly well.</li>
            <li>it was not painful when worn :)</li>
            <li>Cute set of bows in nice, vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a birthday gift for any little girl.</li>
            <li>Great bows but too large for my 15 month old</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and with the variety, she has a color to match different outfits.</li>
            <li>Very cute the bows are big and come with every color to match any outfit.</li>
            <li>Since they slide in with an alligator type clip (like a bobby pin), you will need to secure the hair first before adding the bow.</li>
            <li>They all need a little super glue to hold the bow in place, but I&#x27;m still happy with them.</li>
            <li>They are a nice size, about as big as my hand.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They were the perfect size for my daughter, not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li>I really like the color variety!</li>
            <li>I got these at a deep discount and I love them.</li>
            <li>The packaging isn&#x27;t fancy, but the bows are cute and in a lot of different colors.  </li>
            <li>But overall love the bows.</li>
            <li>Exactly the size I was hoping and lots of color choices.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, high quality bows at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and vibrant and they are big, not little ones.</li>
            <li>It comes with a clip on the back for easy way to put on the hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the alligator clips don&#x27;t have teeth and slip out easily.</li>
            <li>They are large, though.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my 8 year old, I absolutely loveee them!!</li>
            <li>I just wish grey bows were available</li>
            <li>I bought these for my little niece from another website (same seller) and she loved them.</li>
            <li>the material was of high quality,.</li>
            <li>These are high quality.  </li>
            <li>They were a little (just barely) oversized for a 6 month old, but that made it all the more fun.  </li>
            <li>A little bigger than I expected, but very pretty colors and good quality.</li>
            <li>They were packed in a bag, but shipped by itself in a box, so no issues - just a quick fluff, and they were ready to go.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 4 year old daughter and she loves them.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by the clip, thinking it would fall out, but the bow stayed in my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Seems the clips are a little small for the bows, but overall, great bows.</li>
            <li>The clip on the back makes it easy for my little one to pull these out.  </li>
            <li>I wish the clips were a little longer (or had better grip), because a couple of them fall out of my active 5 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My niece is obsessed with bows and was super excited when she got these.</li>
            <li>I received early before my baby girl left to school.</li>

            <li> I received early before my baby girl left to school.</li>
            <li> These stay in regardless of her hanging from the monkey bars or playing soccer.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d like to see the clips be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The only difficulty my wife has is doing a half up, half down look with my daughter with just using only the bow.  </li>
            <li> They were all shoved into a ziploc bag causing them to be crushed and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> Not too big or too small.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too small, however they aren&#x27;t too big either.</li>
            <li> These bows are nice, but I was a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with the black as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a dark purple instead.</li>
            <li> and it did not easily snag and was not easily disassembled ,.</li>
            <li> Not very tight bows, very sloppy..  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the shipping of the bows.</li>
            <li> My daughter plays hard but loves having her hair done with a bow.  </li>
            <li> so I unfortunately had to return them.</li>
            <li> But was delivered to the wrong address.</li>

            <li> My two granddaughters are thrilled to wear these beautiful hair bows.  The bows are well constructed, and have an alligator clip, covered in ribbon, to attach them to a headband, or into the hair.  The bows don&#x27;t slip, and come in a rainbow of colors.  There are 15 boutique quality bows, and they measure 5.5” each.  I was delighted to purchase these bows during a promotion, to evaluate and share my opinion.  My opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t fancy, but the bows are cute and in a lot of different colors.  My two daughters love them.  They are large, though.  I know it states the size, but I didn&#x27;t realize how big they would be.  But, they are cute and seem to be fairly well made.</li>
            <li> .. the brightly colored bows was a delight for my daughter, she was more beautiful and stood out from the crowd.. the material was of high quality,. and it did not easily snag and was not easily disassembled ,. the big plus it was not painful when worn :)</li>
            <li> Our daughter loves these!  They were a little (just barely) oversized for a 6 month old, but that made it all the more fun.  These are really handy and fun bows that should find use for years to come.</li>
            <li> These bows are soo cute and great quality! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the alligator clips don&#x27;t have teeth and slip out easily.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected, but very pretty colors and good quality.</li>
            <li> The clip on the back makes it easy for my little one to pull these out.  Which she does.  Constantly, lol.</li>
            <li> I received early before my baby girl left to school. But was delivered to the wrong address. My next door neighbor. Luckly he was nice to walk to my house and give me my package. But overall love the bows. Good quality, big beautiful bows and vary nice assortment of vibrant colors!♥</li>
            <li> These are best best collection of bows....so adorable toddlers</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!!! They are the perfect color! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> My 12 yr. old daughter loved these! Good Quality and perfect size for older child</li>
            <li> These bows are awesome! They are a nice size, about as big as my hand. They also have ribbon covered clips making them more comfortable and attractive.  I love having so many color choices!</li>
            <li> Love these bows.  Need to get another set.  They are vibrantly colored and stay in fairly well.</li>
            <li> These are great. However, I&#x27;d like to see the clips be a little bigger. Seems the clips are a little small for the bows, but overall, great bows.</li>
            <li> Not very tight bows, very sloppy..  The picture shown on the site must have been the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Exactly the size I was hoping and lots of color choices.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Great quality</li>
            <li> Great multi-pack of bows. Won&#x27;t buy singles again.</li>
            <li> These bows are beautiful! The colors are bright and vibrant and they are big, not little ones.</li>
            <li> Great value and good quality.</li>
            <li> These are SO amazing! They are great quality and my daughter is so happy to have an abundance of colors! So pleased.</li>
            <li> These bows are great!</li>
            <li> I love these bows, and the variety of the colors in the pack. I just wish grey bows were available</li>
            <li> These are high quality.  My daughter plays hard but loves having her hair done with a bow.  These stay in regardless of her hanging from the monkey bars or playing soccer.</li>
            <li> I wish the clips were a little longer (or had better grip), because a couple of them fall out of my active 5 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the shipping of the bows. They were all shoved into a ziploc bag causing them to be crushed and wrinkled. The size wasn&#x27;t as big as my daughter was hoping for but after straightening and fluffing them, they worked.</li>
            <li> All cute but one Fell apart.. They all need a little super glue to hold the bow in place, but I&#x27;m still happy with them. Really cute.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my little niece from another website (same seller) and she loved them. The colors are bright and with the variety, she has a color to match different outfits.</li>
