            <li>Both hands fit in perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Item still works good bu t we need to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Turned it on and it made a funny noise and started smoking with a clients have inside!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and roomy.</li>
            <li>great quality, function and the opening is great for one or two hands, I really like that I can put my hand in and not have to bump up against the side or anything.  </li>
            <li>But It is what the seller described and it came with all the bulbs which some do not, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>nice to have when using my gel polishes</li>
            <li>This works better than the ones at the Salons I went to.</li>
            <li>And I like Shany&#x27;s a lot more than many others.</li>
            <li>I also wear sunglasses when I use this, better to be safe.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it was a speedy delivery</li>
            <li>This item is even better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this unit because both hands fit in</li>
            <li>so you have to hit power, light then the desired time every time.</li>
            <li>I decided the day I stopped having my nails filled, I would buy one of these.</li>
            <li>item beeps when you turn it on, and when you push each button to change the setting, also beeps when it is finished and the light automatically shuts off when your timer is up.</li>
            <li>Well,I ordered this light in July.</li>
            <li>the unit is nice, was new but looked cheap, after pressing buttons for a bit the paint started to wear off.</li>
            <li>She was excited to get it</li>
            <li>This is hard to find in Alaska- love the fan and the speed in which it dries!!!!</li>
            <li>well the fan is really cool and</li>
            <li>This is such a good to item have.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my Daughters as a present, they are very pleased with the way it dries their nails quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>have mentioned to several people how nice this purchase is and that they should invest in the same&lt;br /&gt;nail dryer.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s important to wear some type of sunscreen on your hands prior do applying your gels, since this wattage is so much higher than most nail lamps.</li>
            <li>Cheap product, no wonder it was such a good deal this is going back.</li>
            <li>The lamps work well, the wattage is great on this product, one of the higher wattage nail lights that you can purchase in the US, I was actually surprised this was for sale on amazon since usually the nail lamps sold are around 9 watts, and the most I have ever seen sold in high end beauty stores is 36 watts.</li>
            <li>This makes painting my daughters nails so much easier!</li>
            <li>exploded on first use</li>
            <li>The second one was ok.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit lower of a speed and power, quieter than the first one.</li>
            <li>Most gels only need 30 sec-1 min of curing, but I like that this product gives you the option to last longer, just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast, but didn&#x27;t work when it got here.</li>
            <li>Be very carfull with this product if you buy it.</li>
            <li>Fast drying thank you</li>
            <li>all in all its great for home use.&lt;br /&gt;i however returned mines, because it apparently looked used.&lt;br /&gt;Inside and outside were extremely scratched, and the cord  was</li>
            <li>I also purchased the USpicyÂ® Highly UV Protective Gloves.</li>
            <li>I just wish the fan was stronger to dry regular polish better.</li>
            <li>I paid for a brand new unit.</li>
            <li>I paid for new, why am I receiving a used product?  </li>
            <li>The second one&#x27;s fan didn&#x27;t work as well as the first one did</li>
            <li>There are a few things I don&#x27;t like about this light.</li>
            <li>When the fan was on it made a loud noise and sounded like it could explode at any moment.</li>
            <li>Especially if you are not the patient sort to wait until your nail polish dries with a fan or naturally.</li>
            <li>This one was okay but not great.</li>
            <li>fit.&lt;br /&gt;The item is lighter in weight than I expected, which is a big plus for me because it is a large nail dryer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s big enough to dry both hands (or feet) at once, and it definitely does a professional job of curing the polish.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for drying your nails.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in Alaska- love the fan and the speed in which it dries!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy. Like the 2,3,5 minute timer options and fan. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> The fan doesnt work as good as i thought it would i was very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. I used it approximately 7 or 8 times. I plug it up, it won&#x27;t even turn on. The money I spent on this, I could have spent at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I received it and immediately, wasnt working. the unit is nice, was new but looked cheap, after pressing buttons for a bit the paint started to wear off. Bought it regardless of other negative reviews but it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> This makes painting my daughters nails so much easier! No more trips to the nail salon!</li>
            <li> This works better than the ones at the Salons I went to. I like this unit because both hands fit in and it works perfect. My nails are done in 20 minutes and last for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> exploded on first use</li>
            <li> I paid for a brand new unit. It came in today and imagin my surprise. ITS A USED UNIT WITH SCRATCHES. IM BERY TICKED OFF</li>
            <li> No need to go back to the salon for me.  I can do my nails at anytime, great quality, function and the opening is great for one or two hands, I really like that I can put my hand in and not have to bump up against the side or anything.  Also the curing works well  because the walls are all mirrored so even the edges of the thumbs get cured.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is the greatest!  I like that it&#x27;s big enough to dry both hands (or feet) at once, and it definitely does a professional job of curing the polish.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast, but didn&#x27;t work when it got here. No power, won&#x27;t turn on. Cheap product, no wonder it was such a good deal this is going back. Too bad it didn&#x27;t work, I really needed a dryer, which is why rushed shipping.</li>
            <li> well the fan is really cool and all and this thing does cure gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;it takes a short while though. all in all its great for home use.&lt;br /&gt;i however returned mines, because it apparently looked used.&lt;br /&gt;Inside and outside were extremely scratched, and the cord  was&lt;br /&gt;stained with some white paint i think.. idk and idc i shouldnt have&lt;br /&gt;recieved a used item, thats just gross. And not to mention all&lt;br /&gt;those scratches. i Mean i dont mind me a few handmedowns&lt;br /&gt;but that damage was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Awesome light. Works great. Both hands fit in perfectly. There are a few things I don&#x27;t like about this light. 1. The buttons face the client so you have to reach over. 2. It shuts off off after every 2,3,6 minutes so you have to hit power, light then the desired time every time. That is kinda time consuming.  But It is what the seller described and it came with all the bulbs which some do not, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> This is such a good to item have. Especially if you are not the patient sort to wait until your nail polish dries with a fan or naturally. I decided the day I stopped having my nails filled, I would buy one of these. And I like Shany&#x27;s a lot more than many others.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Daughters as a present, they are very pleased with the way it dries their nails quickly and efficiently. The timer feature works great and I can see us using this for years to come.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Like the fan in it and the option for the time. And you can put the two hands together.</li>
            <li> Great lamp, however it&#x27;s not a LED lamp. Does amazing with curing gel nail polish!! It&#x27;s big enough to dry both hands at once. I also purchased the USpicyÂ® Highly UV Protective Gloves.</li>
            <li> It is great.  gets the job done...</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and gave it to her for her birthday. She was excited to get it but almost got cut when opening one of the boxes with the bulbs because one of them was broken. Item still works good bu t we need to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a uv lamp and for my at home manicures. This one was okay but not great. When the fan was on it made a loud noise and sounded like it could explode at any moment. It also didn&#x27;t even feel like a fan was on, not even the slightest breeze, so it&#x27;s basically just a uv lamp.</li>
            <li> It works great I have no complaints at the moment. I just wish the fan was stronger to dry regular polish better.</li>
            <li> There was a short in the cord. I had to wiggle the cord in order to get the fan to work. It also looked somewhat used, scratches on the inside. Not work the $$$</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and unfortunately the first one I received had some white gunk on the power cord (looked like when a battery explodes). The second one was ok. The second one&#x27;s fan didn&#x27;t work as well as the first one did, it&#x27;s a bit lower of a speed and power, quieter than the first one. The lamps work well, the wattage is great on this product, one of the higher wattage nail lights that you can purchase in the US, I was actually surprised this was for sale on amazon since usually the nail lamps sold are around 9 watts, and the most I have ever seen sold in high end beauty stores is 36 watts. This is 54 watts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to wear some type of sunscreen on your hands prior do applying your gels, since this wattage is so much higher than most nail lamps. I also wear sunglasses when I use this, better to be safe. There is plenty of space in this lamp for both hands to fit.&lt;br /&gt;The item is lighter in weight than I expected, which is a big plus for me because it is a large nail dryer and I was expecting it to be heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The item beeps when you turn it on, and when you push each button to change the setting, also beeps when it is finished and the light automatically shuts off when your timer is up. The timer sets for 2 min, 3 min, and 5 min. Most gels only need 30 sec-1 min of curing, but I like that this product gives you the option to last longer, just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 months now and well it caught fire today with a clients hand in it. I am not happy about this. It has no woranty I guess. Im not happy about this right now. Be very carfull with this product if you buy it. I just cant belive it caught on fire.......!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems at all. Has the fan and the timer. I am saving a lot on doing these manis and pedis at home.</li>
            <li> nice to have when using my gel polishes</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that I received what is clearly a USED product.  I paid for new, why am I receiving a used product?  There wasn&#x27;t even a manual in the box.</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome nail dryer, it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 nail dryer, works great. I love it, and it was a speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Love it !! Fast drying thank you</li>
            <li> This item is even better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mentioned to several people how nice this purchase is and that they should invest in the same&lt;br /&gt;nail dryer.</li>
            <li> Well,I ordered this light in July. It worked great. I never had a problem until Saturday. Turned it on and it made a funny noise and started smoking with a clients have inside!!!! Thankfully, amazon is still going to refund me on this item. I give amazon 5 stars... This lamp I would give 1. If it didn&#x27;t break it would have gotten 5 stars</li>
