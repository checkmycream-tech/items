            <li>Perfect fit and cheaper than buying local.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll retro fit a warm light LED flexible strip into the lamp</li>
            <li>Packaged fine, arrived safely.  </li>
            <li>I get the more light and magnification I need to see.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Glad to know its available in a nearby town.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find the bulb and avoid having to buy a whole new mirror.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>i like the fact that it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Easy ordering from Amazon  2.</li>
            <li>Easy to change.  </li>
            <li>thy also shipped it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install and it functions well.  </li>
            <li>We own a lighted 5x Zadro mirror that is my wife&#x27;s particular favorite.</li>
            <li>It is what it is  -- works fine in a ZADRO  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>and this one is fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine as a replacement bulb for an over head fixture.</li>
            <li>and this worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>So glad I found the bulb and that it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>and of course it was available and received it in 4 days and works fine.</li>
            <li>But it fit fine the connections everything.</li>
            <li>The bulb is fine, fit&#x27;s my makeup mirror</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this available via Amazon</li>
            <li>My mom had her mirror light burnt out</li>
            <li>It fit, it lit.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what a replacement light bulb is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>For a mag mirror light that fizzled out.</li>
            <li>but I read on one feedback that it fit the mirror I bought.  </li>
            <li>Raced the bulb in my $$ Brookstone light.</li>
            <li>I ordered this light for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I will find another source for this light bulb.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to run all around town looking for an obscure light bulb.</li>
            <li>Repaired my wife makeup mirror light.</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop making these light bulbs.  </li>
            <li>I would tell anyone to order this  light T5</li>
            <li>Cheap way to keep the mirror working</li>
            <li>This replaced the OEM light in my wife&#x27;s make up mirror.</li>
            <li>The light did not work as a replacement, the mirror was burned out.</li>
            <li>She did leave the light on a lot.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s hooked up to an outlet that goes off when the overhead light goes off....</li>
            <li>When the light bulb went out</li>
            <li>but somehow it didn&#x27;t fit to make my mirror work again.</li>
            <li>first the bulb did not work at all, but more importantly, the bulb violated the National Electrical Code, as it did not have ANY markings on it indicating bulb type, wattage, or Kelvin.</li>
            <li>It was ok, not so great illumination for less than a month</li>
            <li>When the original flourescent bulb burned out after 10+ years the order was to get it replaced - fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works like the original.</li>
            <li>I got it to replace the original that accidentally broke.</li>
            <li>The 5x magification is just right for routine face maintenance tasks, and the light makes those tasks easy to see.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new makeup mirror and was thrilled when I found this bulb on line.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for over twenty years and most of those in Hawaii, so I expected it to be corroded upon opening, That was not the case, so I was delighted, and the replacement is the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mirror is the best travel mirror out there by far, and I left a review about it on another page.</li>
            <li>Order was received very quickly and the bulb was exactly right.  </li>
            <li>The Light bulb fit exactly into my existing make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted that I have my mirror back again</li>
            <li>LOVED IT , ITWAS THE DRIGHT SIZE BULB, AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>but the Zadro lamp fit was right.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and packaged correctly.</li>
            <li>I actually think the light is better than the original.</li>
            <li>Love this Lighted mirror and cannot live without the bulb.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>The color is more blue than the one that came with my mirror and took some getting used to, but now it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>A lot better than replacing the entire light.  </li>
            <li>On time, right price.</li>
            <li>yes it was the right size</li>
            <li>It looked like the right size</li>
            <li>and I am grateful that I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new magnifying mirror for a lot more expense.</li>
            <li>and I like it because it put off a little more light than the original</li>
            <li>So, kept the light and ordered a new mirror, since I had a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive replacement for such a nice mirror.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than having to buy a whole new light!</li>
            <li>Perfect lighting, bright and big enough to see even in the dark, yet fits in my big purse.</li>
            <li>This was unavailable at the local home improvement stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got 5 years of more than dailly use from the last bulb.</li>
            <li>This fits my Home Travel 9X/1X Folding Lighted Cosmetic Mirror, which I&#x27;ve had for 8+ years (can&#x27;t remember exact purchase date).  </li>
            <li>First search and was there  4.</li>
            <li>Could have saved a lot of gas money if I came here first.</li>
            <li>The product was well packed, came soon after it was ordered, and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Has the blue glow, different from my previous light, but works great!</li>
            <li>However, it was easy to install and seems to function properly.</li>
            <li>fits my bench light ok, but not exactly what I expected for a T2 type light bulb</li>
            <li>It worked, thanks.</li>
            <li>They got to my home fast and in one piece.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li>I did try calling them, but the automated message gives you their email address and said its much quicker to get a hold of them that way.  </li>
            <li>fast because I think CFLs are being phased out.</li>
            <li>The wattage, size, F5, and 4 prong connection led me to think that it would fit my lamp, but the 4 prongs are on the inside of the circle, not on the outside, so I&#x27;m out of luck.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This informatuion on a light bulb is critical, and mandated.</li>
            <li>I needed a new bulb for my make-up mirror and Zadro had it for a very reasonable price compared to the company I bought my mirror from.</li>
            <li>The bulb was slightly smaller in diameter than the original.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and in tact, ready to use for a back up to my magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>This item saved me from having to put out $90 for a new makeup mirror!</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>Came quickly and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Able to repair my $80.00 make up mirror in a few minutes</li>
            <li>I broke one bulb trying to make it fit, and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle and cost of postage to mail the other one back.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order replacement bulbs just buy new product and save your money.</li>
            <li>I instead purchased a new lighted mirror as a mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on a new one.</li>
            <li>Saved me from buying a new makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I was glad it fitted very little.</li>
            <li>This bulb was actually quite a bit smaller in tube diameter than the original one in makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>Thought they might like to handle this on their own rather than me documenting a bad review for a light bulb.  </li>
            <li>No problems so far.  </li>
            <li>arrived well packaged, a day late, but OK.</li>
            <li>Needed for a luminary kitchen lamp that needed this type of bulb and its the only I&lt;br /&gt;Could find and only I could find online also this bulb is rare to find.</li>
            <li>First I ordered one that had prongs in the wrong side so paid more attention to what I was ordering</li>
            <li>I purchased this item from you because of a previous review that said this brand worked in a different brand light.  </li>
            <li>I am having a hard time finding the lamp that will fit.</li>
            <li>The lamp into which I was putting this thing was apparently DESIGNED with a ballast flaw, however, and therefore Zadro lighted makeup mirrors STINK like fish off ice.</li>
            <li>I could tell my bulb had finally died by the blackened ends near the plug.  </li>
            <li>And thanks to a review I read on Amazon, I decided to try this bulb in my wife&#x27;s Rialto mirror despite the warnings that this bulb may not work in different mirrors other than Zadro mirrors.  </li>
            <li>I was not expected that it had inlet inside the ring, not outside the ring.</li>
            <li>The price on this bulb was half what Rialto wants for a replacement bulb.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the bulb worked better than I thought,my wife said she could see her make up better.</li>
            <li> so all should be okay</li>
            <li> Nice light.</li>
            <li> This one is bright, the magnification is powerful.</li>
            <li> I guess you should make sure this fits the frame of the device you&#x27;re using.</li>

            <li> Bulb has lasted a VERY long time and fits my mirror perfectly!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and cheaper than buying local.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll retro fit a warm light LED flexible strip into the lamp</li>
            <li> Packaged fine, arrived safely.  </li>
            <li> I get the more light and magnification I need to see.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Glad to know its available in a nearby town.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find the bulb and avoid having to buy a whole new mirror.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> i like the fact that it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Easy ordering from Amazon  2.</li>
            <li> Easy to change.  </li>
            <li> thy also shipped it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to install and it functions well.  </li>
            <li> We own a lighted 5x Zadro mirror that is my wife&#x27;s particular favorite.</li>
            <li> It is what it is  -- works fine in a ZADRO  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> and this one is fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine as a replacement bulb for an over head fixture.</li>
            <li> and this worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> So glad I found the bulb and that it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> and of course it was available and received it in 4 days and works fine.</li>
            <li> But it fit fine the connections everything.</li>
            <li> The bulb is fine, fit&#x27;s my makeup mirror</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this available via Amazon</li>
            <li> My mom had her mirror light burnt out</li>
            <li> It fit, it lit.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what a replacement light bulb is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> For a mag mirror light that fizzled out.</li>
            <li> but I read on one feedback that it fit the mirror I bought.  </li>
            <li> Raced the bulb in my $$ Brookstone light.</li>
            <li> I ordered this light for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I will find another source for this light bulb.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to run all around town looking for an obscure light bulb.</li>
            <li> Repaired my wife makeup mirror light.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making these light bulbs.  </li>
            <li> I would tell anyone to order this  light T5</li>
            <li> Cheap way to keep the mirror working</li>
            <li> This replaced the OEM light in my wife&#x27;s make up mirror.</li>
            <li> The light did not work as a replacement, the mirror was burned out.</li>
            <li> She did leave the light on a lot.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s hooked up to an outlet that goes off when the overhead light goes off....</li>
            <li> When the light bulb went out</li>
            <li> but somehow it didn&#x27;t fit to make my mirror work again.</li>
            <li> first the bulb did not work at all, but more importantly, the bulb violated the National Electrical Code, as it did not have ANY markings on it indicating bulb type, wattage, or Kelvin.</li>
            <li> It was ok, not so great illumination for less than a month</li>
            <li> When the original flourescent bulb burned out after 10+ years the order was to get it replaced - fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> I got it to replace the original that accidentally broke.</li>
            <li> The 5x magification is just right for routine face maintenance tasks, and the light makes those tasks easy to see.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new makeup mirror and was thrilled when I found this bulb on line.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for over twenty years and most of those in Hawaii, so I expected it to be corroded upon opening, That was not the case, so I was delighted, and the replacement is the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror is the best travel mirror out there by far, and I left a review about it on another page.</li>
            <li> Order was received very quickly and the bulb was exactly right.  </li>
            <li> The Light bulb fit exactly into my existing make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted that I have my mirror back again</li>
            <li> LOVED IT , ITWAS THE DRIGHT SIZE BULB, AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> but the Zadro lamp fit was right.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and packaged correctly.</li>
            <li> I actually think the light is better than the original.</li>
            <li> Love this Lighted mirror and cannot live without the bulb.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> The color is more blue than the one that came with my mirror and took some getting used to, but now it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> A lot better than replacing the entire light.  </li>
            <li> On time, right price.</li>
            <li> yes it was the right size</li>
            <li> It looked like the right size</li>
            <li> and I am grateful that I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new magnifying mirror for a lot more expense.</li>
            <li> and I like it because it put off a little more light than the original</li>
            <li> So, kept the light and ordered a new mirror, since I had a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li> Very inexpensive replacement for such a nice mirror.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than having to buy a whole new light!</li>
            <li> Perfect lighting, bright and big enough to see even in the dark, yet fits in my big purse.</li>
            <li> This was unavailable at the local home improvement stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got 5 years of more than dailly use from the last bulb.</li>
            <li> This fits my Home Travel 9X/1X Folding Lighted Cosmetic Mirror, which I&#x27;ve had for 8+ years (can&#x27;t remember exact purchase date).  </li>
            <li> First search and was there  4.</li>
            <li> Could have saved a lot of gas money if I came here first.</li>
            <li> The product was well packed, came soon after it was ordered, and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Has the blue glow, different from my previous light, but works great!</li>
            <li> However, it was easy to install and seems to function properly.</li>
            <li> fits my bench light ok, but not exactly what I expected for a T2 type light bulb</li>
            <li> It worked, thanks.</li>
            <li> They got to my home fast and in one piece.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> I did try calling them, but the automated message gives you their email address and said its much quicker to get a hold of them that way.  </li>
            <li> fast because I think CFLs are being phased out.</li>
            <li> The wattage, size, F5, and 4 prong connection led me to think that it would fit my lamp, but the 4 prongs are on the inside of the circle, not on the outside, so I&#x27;m out of luck.  </li>
            <li> Thanks  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> This informatuion on a light bulb is critical, and mandated.</li>
            <li> I needed a new bulb for my make-up mirror and Zadro had it for a very reasonable price compared to the company I bought my mirror from.</li>
            <li> The bulb was slightly smaller in diameter than the original.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and in tact, ready to use for a back up to my magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> This item saved me from having to put out $90 for a new makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Able to repair my $80.00 make up mirror in a few minutes</li>
            <li> I broke one bulb trying to make it fit, and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle and cost of postage to mail the other one back.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order replacement bulbs just buy new product and save your money.</li>
            <li> I instead purchased a new lighted mirror as a mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on a new one.</li>
            <li> Saved me from buying a new makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> I was glad it fitted very little.</li>
            <li> This bulb was actually quite a bit smaller in tube diameter than the original one in makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Thought they might like to handle this on their own rather than me documenting a bad review for a light bulb.  </li>
            <li> No problems so far.  </li>
            <li> arrived well packaged, a day late, but OK.</li>
            <li> Needed for a luminary kitchen lamp that needed this type of bulb and its the only I&lt;br /&gt;Could find and only I could find online also this bulb is rare to find.</li>
            <li> First I ordered one that had prongs in the wrong side so paid more attention to what I was ordering</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from you because of a previous review that said this brand worked in a different brand light.  </li>
            <li> I am having a hard time finding the lamp that will fit.</li>
            <li> The lamp into which I was putting this thing was apparently DESIGNED with a ballast flaw, however, and therefore Zadro lighted makeup mirrors STINK like fish off ice.</li>
            <li> I could tell my bulb had finally died by the blackened ends near the plug.  </li>
            <li> And thanks to a review I read on Amazon, I decided to try this bulb in my wife&#x27;s Rialto mirror despite the warnings that this bulb may not work in different mirrors other than Zadro mirrors.  </li>
            <li> I was not expected that it had inlet inside the ring, not outside the ring.</li>
            <li> The price on this bulb was half what Rialto wants for a replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li> The base indicated only that it used bulb 22W &amp;#34;T5 Flourescent Lamp.&amp;#34;  After using my beloved makeup mirror 2-3 times a day for almost 10 years, the bulb finally burned out.  </li>
            <li> a faint light at the bottom and that all.</li>
            <li> Difficult to fit and get working again, seems to be very sensitive to how the bits are put back into the back of the unit upon reassembly; i.e. possible position effect, or poor connections?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Has a somewhat cold light temperature.</li>
            <li> Not much to review,  it works like it should.  </li>
            <li> Does not fit the lighted mirror and can&#x27;t be sent back.</li>
            <li> We just have to remember to be careful when ordering so</li>
            <li> I may never know whether it is the bulb or some other problem  </li>
            <li> These fluorescent bulbs burn out faster than any other fluorescent bulbs I have used, period.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very carefully and received promptly.  </li>
            <li> The only one I found that works with my ridiculous Magnifying Mirror.</li>
            <li> After a couple months it has about half the wattage that it started out with.</li>
            <li> I just ordered both and replaced both at the same time because my mom had the same trouble and it was actually the ballast that was bad on hers, not the bulb.  </li>
            <li> I do know that it was minimally packaged, and the collar that connects the tube and contains the pins is loose, suggesting it is possibly broken.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I got a Zadro face mirror</li>
            <li> Bulb did not fit well and popped immediately.  </li>
            <li> It could have been to poor packaging or the product had a loose part in any cae</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it does not light up!</li>
            <li> It replaced a hard to find bulb.</li>
            <li> It was really hard finding a replacement bulb for my mirror.  </li>
            <li> Horrible as there are no instructions with the light on how to insert this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not able to wait forever to speak with someone.  </li>
            <li> Broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and had to go to the trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> I may be unfairly reviewing this item.</li>
            <li> we don&#x27;t end up with the wrong items.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive those things are.</li>
            <li> I have had my mirror for 10 years and the bulb or the ballast went bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  I have a Rialto mirror purchased in 2005.  The base indicated only that it used bulb 22W &amp;#34;T5 Flourescent Lamp.&amp;#34;  After using my beloved makeup mirror 2-3 times a day for almost 10 years, the bulb finally burned out.  It was packaged very carefully and received promptly.  Thank you for making this available via Amazon so I didn&#x27;t need to search/drive any further!  I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Needed for a luminary kitchen lamp that needed this type of bulb and its the only I&lt;br /&gt;Could find and only I could find online also this bulb is rare to find.</li>
            <li> I was not expected that it had inlet inside the ring, not outside the ring. I was glad it fitted very little. It worked, thanks.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I got a Zadro face mirror and I love it! the older I get the more light and magnification I need to see.&lt;br /&gt;The light burned out so it was great to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised and was shipped promptly. The lamp into which I was putting this thing was apparently DESIGNED with a ballast flaw, however, and therefore Zadro lighted makeup mirrors STINK like fish off ice. Google them before wasting your money on a replacement lamp for them.</li>
            <li> My mom had her mirror light burnt out so i looked it up on amazon and ordered it and it works great and it came in faster than the est. Time so 5 stars</li>
            <li> IT WAS A PERFECT FIT. I COULD NOT FIND IT LOCALLY.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from you because of a previous review that said this brand worked in a different brand light.  And it does!!</li>
            <li> It fit, it lit.  That&#x27;s what a replacement light bulb is supposed to do.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Not only were the the cheapest I found.  They were perfect! They got to my home fast and in one piece.  When I need them again, I will, for sure, buy them again just like I did.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and cheaper than buying local.</li>
            <li> Just the bulb we were looking for.  We could not find this bulb anywhere in our city.</li>
            <li> fits my bench light ok, but not exactly what I expected for a T2 type light bulb</li>
            <li> Nice, bright, clear light!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the neighbors so I can&#x27;t really comment.</li>
            <li> Thank you,&lt;br /&gt; everything was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> perfect fit &amp; fast delivery to the wifes make up mirror..&amp;#62;Was another brand but hoped the bulbs on visual and some spec would match up and perfect.thanks</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have been requested to provide a review and my opinion has not changed.  The light bulb was extremely poorly packaged and arrived SHATTERED.  It was immediately returned and I was given a refund (my only option).  I will say that the refund was done promptly.  Otherwise, my review stands...inadequate packaging (the bulb was in a flimsy box and shipped in a bubble envelope).</li>
            <li> Peplacement bulb for a makeup mirror.Same bulb I could not find at home,Would have to drive 2 hrs. to get one. Better price at Amazon.com.Saved gas and time.Would and will do again. Appreciate the service and time I received the product.Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and works great</li>
            <li> This bulb was actually quite a bit smaller in tube diameter than the original one in makeup mirror. It still fits the fixture though. It flickers a bit when it&#x27;s on but that may be an issue with my fixture.</li>
            <li> For a mag mirror light that fizzled out. Could not find in the local hardware stores inspite of the folks sending me to multiple places to check. Ships with pads to replace the stock cork that wore out on the mirror, with some wiggling it fits perfiect.</li>
            <li> The item did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Don&#x27;t order replacement bulbs just buy new product and save your money.</li>
            <li> it does not light up! a faint light at the bottom and that all. I plan to return it!!!  deb k</li>
            <li> Fits my Floxite and a great value!</li>
            <li> I may be unfairly reviewing this item. I may never know whether it is the bulb or some other problem  (i.e. the ballast or wiring), but the bulb never worked in my wife&#x27;s mirror. I do know that it was minimally packaged, and the collar that connects the tube and contains the pins is loose, suggesting it is possibly broken. At any rate, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m not paying $6 for return postage for a $10 item. I instead purchased a new lighted mirror as a mother&#x27;s day gift. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> Difficult to fit and get working again, seems to be very sensitive to how the bits are put back into the back of the unit upon reassembly; i.e. possible position effect, or poor connections?&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again - next time I&#x27;ll retro fit a warm light LED flexible strip into the lamp housing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will give more light, run cooler and it wont need replacement in my life time !</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I read on one feedback that it fit the mirror I bought.  Hope it does!</li>
            <li> Item as described and will work for my need.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s Cosmetic Mirror bulb had blown out so I took it to a local electrical supply company, they said it would take a week to get it in. So I thought why not try Amazon? So I did and of course it was available and received it in 4 days and works fine. My wife is happy and like any other husband if the wife is happy everyone is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Bulb did not fit well and popped immediately.  Did not work at all for us. The bulb was slightly smaller in diameter than the original.</li>
            <li> It was ok, not so great illumination for less than a month and then it just stopped working all together.</li>
            <li> It works and arrived unbroken I two days.  We had looked all over to purchase and couldn&#x27;t find.  Raced the bulb in my $$ Brookstone light.</li>
            <li> Packaged fine, arrived safely.  Fits my Brookstone lighted makeup mirror perfectly.  installed one week ago.  No problems so far.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The light does not work  !</li>
            <li> These bulbs were said to last 10,000 hours. Hah. More like 300 hours. I burned through two in 7 years, using them about 20 minutes/day. This time I bought two bulbs so I will have a spare. These fluorescent bulbs burn out faster than any other fluorescent bulbs I have used, period.</li>
            <li> After searching the internet, I found the T5 22W here on amazon for the best price.  It came quickly and in tact, ready to use for a back up to my magnifying mirror.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy to install and the perfect fit!  I&#x27;m very happy to have my mirror back. I bought the mirror at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond but the Zadro lamp fit was right.</li>
            <li> Replacement bulb for makeup mirror. fits correctly, great price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I actually think the light is better than the original. This item saved me from having to put out $90 for a new makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> Not much to review,  it works like it should.  Easy to install.  comes on when I flip the switch on</li>
            <li> I ordered this light for my bathroom.  I couldn&#x27;t find this size in the home improvement stores.  It came quickly and packaged correctly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Tried to replace the bulb in a Rialto mirror from Bed, Bath and Beyond that burnt out in just over a year of use.</li>
            <li> the bulb is perfect for my lighted mirror. also is very bright. i like the fact that it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Emailed customerservice@showerdoordirect.com with no response.  Thought they might like to handle this on their own rather than me documenting a bad review for a light bulb.  I did try calling them, but the automated message gives you their email address and said its much quicker to get a hold of them that way.  After I received no response from the email, I called again.  Unfortunately I was not able to wait forever to speak with someone.  I will find another source for this light bulb.</li>
            <li> Replaced my burnt out bulb and this new one works great!</li>
            <li> I took the 3 screws out from the back and exchanged this for my burned out bulb. I have been using it for many weeks now and I am grateful that I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new magnifying mirror for a lot more expense. Yeah for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just to let everyone know, this bulb fits the &amp;#34;Fluorescent CooliteTM Lighted 8 1/2&amp;#34; Double Sided Swivel Vanity Cosmetic Mirror 8x plus 1x in Satin Nickel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulb is bright and perfectly fit my make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the lighted mirror and can&#x27;t be sent back.</li>
            <li> Works well. Couldn&#x27;t find locally.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to run all around town looking for an obscure light bulb. Description and picture looked like they would work in my mirror and it did. I&#x27;m delighted that I have my mirror back again and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on a new one. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It is what it is  -- works fine in a ZADRO  mirror designed for it.</li>
            <li> It replaced a hard to find bulb.</li>
            <li> Broke while installing...my fault but it could have been built better.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement bulb for my Floxite mirror and it fit perfectly. So, if you can&#x27;t find a Floxite replacement bulb, this will work.</li>
            <li> This one appears &amp;#34;bluer&amp;#34; than the bulb it replaced.  However, it was easy to install and seems to function properly.</li>
            <li> Repaired my wife makeup mirror light. Fit perfectly, works great, thanks</li>
            <li> It still works. The only one I found that works with my ridiculous Magnifying Mirror.</li>
            <li> It was really hard finding a replacement bulb for my mirror.  I was very happy to locate this one.  It works just fine.</li>
            <li> Horrible as there are no instructions with the light on how to insert this.  Returned.</li>
            <li> We own a lighted 5x Zadro mirror that is my wife&#x27;s particular favorite. The 5x magification is just right for routine face maintenance tasks, and the light makes those tasks easy to see. When the original flourescent bulb burned out after 10+ years the order was to get it replaced - fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon and done!</li>
            <li> This was unavailable at the local home improvement stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It fits perfectly in my Rialto makeup mirror.  The color is more blue than the one that came with my mirror and took some getting used to, but now it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll be getting more of these for back-up!</li>
            <li> After a couple months it has about half the wattage that it started out with. Bummer. Will have to buy another brand for my make-up mirror...fast because I think CFLs are being phased out.</li>
            <li> Great on time service and great product. This bulb fit perfectly.  Would buy from this seller again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Has the blue glow, different from my previous light, but works great!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fits my make-up mirror perfectly.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making these light bulbs.  It&#x27;s a good buy and just what we needed in a replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a magnifying lamp I use for sewing.  The wattage, size, F5, and 4 prong connection led me to think that it would fit my lamp, but the 4 prongs are on the inside of the circle, not on the outside, so I&#x27;m out of luck.  I broke one bulb trying to make it fit, and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the hassle and cost of postage to mail the other one back.  I imagine this works great for the make up lamp it was intended for.  I am having a hard time finding the lamp that will fit.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this replacement bulb for a Zadro mirror and it fits and works great, very satisfied with it and the customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a hard-to-find item.  The Light bulb fit exactly into my existing make-up mirror.  I bought extra bulbs in case this item becomes an impossible-to-find item.  The bulb produced bright light.  I got 5 years of more than dailly use from the last bulb.</li>
            <li> the product did not work when received. It could have been to poor packaging or the product had a loose part in any cae I was disappointed and had to go to the trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> On time, right price.</li>
            <li> It did not work when I attempted to replace it.</li>
            <li> This fits my Home Travel 9X/1X Folding Lighted Cosmetic Mirror, which I&#x27;ve had for 8+ years (can&#x27;t remember exact purchase date).  It was easy to install.  I could tell my bulb had finally died by the blackened ends near the plug.  Great price.</li>
            <li> yes it was the right size and I like it because it put off a little more light than the original I would tell anyone to order this  light T5</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new makeup mirror and was thrilled when I found this bulb on line.  It works perfectly for my mirror.</li>
            <li> Able to repair my $80.00 make up mirror in a few minutes</li>
            <li> 1. Easy ordering from Amazon  2. I could not find this item in any store in NYC  3. First search and was there  4. Delivery was only 24 hours - impressive   5. We are very happy with this item and it is working just fine</li>
            <li> Order was received very quickly and the bulb was exactly right.  Thanks  Glad to know its available in a nearby town.</li>
            <li> Easy to change.  Saved me from buying a new makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> First I ordered one that had prongs in the wrong side so paid more attention to what I was ordering and this one is fine.  Comes well packaged.</li>
            <li> I went to Lowes, Home Depot, Radio Shack and several electronics stores and had no luck looking for this bulb as a replacement for my make-up mirror.&lt;br /&gt;To my delight, I found it here.  Could have saved a lot of gas money if I came here first.</li>
            <li> Bulb has lasted a VERY long time and fits my mirror perfectly!</li>
            <li> Bought this replacement for my wifes makeup mirror and it fits perfect. Cheap way to keep the mirror working</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> This replaced the OEM light in my wife&#x27;s make up mirror. Works well there.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and the light worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> thanks for the perfect one, although we had a bit of a time trying to get into the makeup mirror.  I have had it for over twenty years and most of those in Hawaii, so I expected it to be corroded upon opening, That was not the case, so I was delighted, and the replacement is the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to Zadro for great product.</li>
            <li> Broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this bulb on Amazon.  I have had my mirror for 10 years and the bulb or the ballast went bad.  I just ordered both and replaced both at the same time because my mom had the same trouble and it was actually the ballast that was bad on hers, not the bulb.  You can purchase the ballast from Amazon - Search for:  Ballast for Zadro SW and MSW 9&amp;#34; -  that will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and replacement for my wife&#x27;s makeup mirror.  Now I can also squeeze blackheads until my heart is content!</li>
            <li> the bulb worked better than I thought,my wife said she could see her make up better.If she is happy I&#x27;am happy</li>
            <li> It replaced the burnt out bulb with out any problems.</li>
            <li> Love this Lighted mirror and cannot live without the bulb.  I believe it was around  $10-12 andworth every penny...thy also shipped it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I got it to replace the original that accidentally broke. When I opened the box I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, because it look smaller. But it fit fine the connections everything. I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to return it. We just have to remember to be careful when ordering so we don&#x27;t end up with the wrong items. Over all I am happy and thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela</li>
            <li> The bulb is fine, fit&#x27;s my makeup mirror but I found out that the cord had shorted out and so therefore the bulb doesn&#x27;t help me at all.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived well packaged, a day late, but OK.</li>
            <li> I needed a new bulb for my make-up mirror and Zadro had it for a very reasonable price compared to the company I bought my mirror from. Works great.</li>
            <li> This illuminated mirror is the only way I can see to put makeup on without my glasses. I wish all hotels we visit had them.</li>
            <li> Works fine as a replacement bulb for an over head fixture. Has a somewhat cold light temperature.</li>
            <li> The light did not work as a replacement, the mirror was burned out. So, kept the light and ordered a new mirror, since I had a replacement bulb.  She did leave the light on a lot.  Now it&#x27;s hooked up to an outlet that goes off when the overhead light goes off....so all should be okay</li>
            <li> The mirror is the best travel mirror out there by far, and I left a review about it on another page. Nothing compares, so I went ahead and bought a back up bulb just in case I ever need it. Perfect lighting, bright and big enough to see even in the dark, yet fits in my big purse. Love it! Buy the extra bulb if you can, but doubt you&#x27;ll ever need it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  So much cheaper than having to buy a whole new light!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly in my wife&#x27;s mirror.  A lot better than replacing the entire light.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive those things are.</li>
            <li> It is working beautifully!! I&#x27;m very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> LOVED IT , ITWAS THE DRIGHT SIZE BULB, AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT AND IT WAS NO PROBLEM PUTTING IT IN MY MIRROR</li>
            <li> The product was well packed, came soon after it was ordered, and it was exactly what I needed. Very good vendor.</li>
            <li> Nice light. Replaces one that broke. This one is bright, the magnification is powerful. I like that it can be plugged in to recharged.</li>
            <li> The price on this bulb was half what Rialto wants for a replacement bulb.  And thanks to a review I read on Amazon, I decided to try this bulb in my wife&#x27;s Rialto mirror despite the warnings that this bulb may not work in different mirrors other than Zadro mirrors.  The bulb arrived quickly and fit my wife&#x27;s mirror perfectly and works great.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price and the performance of the bulb.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me to have an extra one for my make-up mirror. If I ever need one, I will know where it is. Shipped quickly &amp; arrived in good condition. (I&#x27;m more excited about the mirror!)</li>
            <li> I have a lighted make up mirror that I&#x27;ve come to depend on in my every day grooming.  When the light bulb went out I didn&#x27;t know what to do but thankfully I found it here on Amazon.  The price was great, it arrived on time...and every body&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  It was easy to install and it functions well.  We have had it for some months now and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> The bulb arrived in perfect condition and was the correct replacement.  I would deifinitely purchase from this source again.  I saved over $35 by installing the replacement bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koz</li>
            <li> Works Great thank you</li>
            <li> It looked like the right size but somehow it didn&#x27;t fit to make my mirror work again. Returned and got credit back with no problem. Still hasn&#x27;t found the working bulb yet.</li>
            <li> This fit my mirror perfectly.  I was very happy to find the bulb and avoid having to buy a whole new mirror.  It&#x27;s been about a month and it&#x27;s doing the job.  So glad I found the bulb and that it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> A couple of problems...first the bulb did not work at all, but more importantly, the bulb violated the National Electrical Code, as it did not have ANY markings on it indicating bulb type, wattage, or Kelvin. I am a Master Electrician. This informatuion on a light bulb is critical, and mandated.</li>
            <li> I guess you should make sure this fits the frame of the device you&#x27;re using. Mine was a make up mirror and this worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Works fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this with a chance that it wouldn&#x27;t work in the product I have. But it does! Very inexpensive replacement for such a nice mirror. So anyone looking at this product with a Floxite mirror, it will work!</li>
            <li> this is what I wanted for my mirror.</li>
