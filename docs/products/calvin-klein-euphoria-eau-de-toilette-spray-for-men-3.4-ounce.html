            <li>I always get compliments on my cologne choices, but this one is definitely the most popular!  </li>
            <li>so I looked on Amazon and fount it for $45 free shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and oh my gosh, he smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>As subjective as these things are, I got this after getting a free trial from a makeup place.</li>
            <li>perfect condition, same as buying this in the department store but SO much cheaper.  </li>

            <li>I love the way this smells on me and the first time I had it on my boyfriend said &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>I dont think it is original.</li>

            <li>, women love it and are very attracted to it.</li>
            <li>I smelled this at Sephora and loved the scent, however for this same size bottle it was priced at $68 - on Amazon</li>
            <li>He is very picky about colognes and won&#x27;t wear anything that&#x27;s overwhelming or makes him feel that his scent gets there before he does.</li>
            <li>A rich scent that will make you want to make your husband &amp;#34;late for work&amp;#34;........  :)  Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>but by far this get me the most compliments.</li>
            <li>It is just right for me.</li>
            <li>I on the other hand don&#x27;t think grease with a hint of gasoline is a great choice for cologne even though he seems to have no problem with those particular smells.</li>
            <li>What is that?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m typically a Tommy cologne kind of guy and Armani Mania is one of my favs, but this might be my new favorite and who can beat that price.</li>
            <li>it smells good, but you use it, and in two hours or less you dont have any fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>Spray on just a little, and you are good for the day.</li>
            <li>I am sometimes skeptical about ordering fragrances online, but in this case, it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>This one should last a good while since I will barely use it.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described...</li>
            <li>Intense smells better than the regular one.  </li>
            <li>For context, I am a 24 year old male living in a warm area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but masculine.</li>
            <li>Purchased a smaller bottle at a local store and liked the way it smelled so came here to get a better deal on a larger size.  </li>
            <li>It is quite large in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I should have gotten intense.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and delivery.  </li>
            <li>get the intense one, forget about this one</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really like the scent, and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>went to my local department store to test out different colognes to see what i liked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a change from what my husband usually wears and it&#x27;s nice to have a choice as I do with the 2 perfumes I use.</li>
            <li>and I noticed most guys have that typical smell.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it for almost half that.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sweet, yet still very masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas present for my son it has been his favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much the only cologne I recommend</li>
            <li>I normally wear 360 and just wanted to try it</li>
            <li>We were hesitant to get something new</li>
            <li>my bad  not what I intended purchase its ok too light for me</li>
            <li>So it stinks good.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was half what the same product is in the higher end stores like Macy&#x27;s or Dillards.</li>
            <li>Real deal, not watered down version.</li>

            <li> I should have gotten intense.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery.  </li>
            <li> get the intense one, forget about this one</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really like the scent, and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> went to my local department store to test out different colognes to see what i liked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a change from what my husband usually wears and it&#x27;s nice to have a choice as I do with the 2 perfumes I use.</li>
            <li> and I noticed most guys have that typical smell.</li>
            <li> I was able to find it for almost half that.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sweet, yet still very masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my son it has been his favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much the only cologne I recommend</li>
            <li> I normally wear 360 and just wanted to try it</li>
            <li> We were hesitant to get something new</li>
            <li> my bad  not what I intended purchase its ok too light for me</li>
            <li> So it stinks good.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was half what the same product is in the higher end stores like Macy&#x27;s or Dillards.</li>
            <li> Real deal, not watered down version.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, and it smells just like every other cologne I smelled from kohls.</li>
            <li> It was the large bottle for much less than the little bottle would cost!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> such a waste of money !</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the bottle size.  </li>
            <li> I thought it may be a fake due to the low price but have compared to the big store product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like half the strength of Euphoria that I bought at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> waste of $40.</li>
            <li> just a few sprays is all I need.  </li>
            <li> Not strong at all</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the poor longevity.</li>
            <li> but......a little on the weak side.</li>
            <li> Fake, was watered down heavily with rubbing alcohol, doesnt have the raised numbers on the bottom sticker seal.</li>
            <li> This does not have hardly any fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon and they extended my Prime for a month.</li>
            <li> It was not good</li>
            <li> After about an hour you can only smell it if you put your nose to my shirt or if I bathe in it which is disgusting.</li>
            <li> When women smell me they go crazy</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I hate it !</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ordered for my husband and he loved it. I am sometimes skeptical about ordering fragrances online, but in this case, it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance .good quality</li>
            <li> beautiful I like it excellent, superb, superior, superlative, fine, beautiful babe, beautiful, lovely, cutie, bombshell, peach Thank You my bro</li>
            <li> My son loves this fragrance. I will keep on buying for him, and somebody especial.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 2 years and love it! I prefer wearing it for more professional settings or while dining out.</li>
            <li> The perfume was good.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite! great quick service</li>
            <li> Very very good product, excellent price, and quick shipment.  A good product, Wonderful smell, women love it and are very attracted to it.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, I&#x27;m not that impressed. I bought from kohls so maybe that was my mistake? It doesn&#x27;t last long, and it smells just like every other cologne I smelled from kohls. they all have the same smell and I noticed most guys have that typical smell. nothing unique about it but it does smell pleasant, I will say. After about an hour you can only smell it if you put your nose to my shirt or if I bathe in it which is disgusting. waste of $40. Pi by Givenchy, now that was the only cologne I smelled that was unique! it was almost $70 at kohls so I looked on Amazon and fount it for $45 free shipping. Damn right I bought it!</li>
            <li> This cologne is very nice. Not strong at all just a few sprays is all I need.  When this one runs out I will buy again</li>
            <li> love this cologne get complements every where I go. ordered another bottle just in case . very good for the price</li>
            <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> perfect condition, same as buying this in the department store but SO much cheaper.  It&#x27;s deals like this that make the pricey $79/year AP membership pay off in the end.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing. It&#x27;s sweet and masculine at the same time. The only negative is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> Added this cologne to my collection to join Chanel Blue, Lacoste Sport, and 212.  I smelled this at Sephora and loved the scent, however for this same size bottle it was priced at $68 - on Amazon I was able to find it for almost half that.  My only problem with the order was that I ordered via Prime on January 15th and did not receive the item until January 12th.  I complained to Amazon and they extended my Prime for a month.</li>
            <li> Euphoria for men is great. I get lots and lots of compliments on how I smell. The price on Amazon was half what the same product is in the higher end stores like Macy&#x27;s or Dillards.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing good cologne but by far this get me the most compliments. It&#x27;s a great scent without being overly intrusive. Particularly impressive is that it last well into the day. The packaging was excellent it arrived as advertised with no damage to the merchandise. I highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my son! He was out of it, so we got him more! Great value for the money. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay department store prices. Love Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This item was for my BOO and she loved it..it&#x27;s smells really nice and the price was right...LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Really great product.. The smell is not overpowering but it also does not stay for longer period of time. All in all I think it is a great perfume to have.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells on me and the first time I had it on my boyfriend said &amp;#34;oh my gosh, you smell amazing. What is that?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m typically a Tommy cologne kind of guy and Armani Mania is one of my favs, but this might be my new favorite and who can beat that price. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent on my husband.  This was a replacement for a bottle that he had already finished and surprisingly asked me to repurchase for him.  It lasts a long time and he is always getting compliments on how good he smells when he wears this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells fine. I thought it may be a fake due to the low price but have compared to the big store product and it is the same. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I like it, it does the job but......a little on the weak side. I should have gotten intense. That being said its a nice bottle good price and nice addition to my collection which is growing quick. I have around 20 different colognes now. This one should last a good while since I will barely use it.</li>
            <li> I received the cologne quickly in it&#x27;s originally packaging! It was the large bottle for much less than the little bottle would cost! A much better deal than buying it at a department store!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, recipient was pleased; the fragrance is nice, not cloying, however that has to be seen as a subjective comment; nice size for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have one less thing to fight about because we both agree that this cologne is wonderful! He is very picky about colognes and won&#x27;t wear anything that&#x27;s overwhelming or makes him feel that his scent gets there before he does. He also won&#x27;t wear anything he thinks smells girly or feminine, which rules out anything with any type of floral notes. I on the other hand don&#x27;t think grease with a hint of gasoline is a great choice for cologne even though he seems to have no problem with those particular smells. This cologne has finally put a stop to the war of the smells! We both love it! I have a man who smells as great as he looks and he doesn&#x27;t feel like he smells feminine or overpowering so he will actually wear it. I wish I had known about this product a long time ago. It would have saved us from lots of fighting.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my cologne choices, but this one is definitely the most popular!  I love how it smells, and I feel fresh when I wear it!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my son it has been his favorite for a long time.  He was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> It was not good i think it is fake because i have been using this colone fir many years and this one smells different</li>
            <li> I tried this after smelling a sample in one of those magazines and it&#x27;s a very pleasant &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell. It&#x27;s a change from what my husband usually wears and it&#x27;s nice to have a choice as I do with the 2 perfumes I use. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I got this from my wife for xmas and its a great perfume, love it and she also does..recommended ..</li>
            <li> I always buy this Cologne and this is the best price I have seen for it in a long time. Great product would highly Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fake, was watered down heavily with rubbing alcohol, doesnt have the raised numbers on the bottom sticker seal.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible without being too overbearing. It was a great Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I am glad I listened my daughter&#x27;s advice and purchased it as a gift. All people like and compliment this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It Smells good. Highly recommended. I bought Euphoria before. Intense smells better than the regular one.  Perfect</li>
            <li> I dont think it is original.It smells a bit different. Dont like this cologne. I have got rid of it.</li>
            <li> my bad  not what I intended purchase its ok too light for me</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described...shipped sooner than stated.</li>
            <li> Best store to buy a perfume, definitely I will buy more products from this store. I recommend for all my friends.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only cologne I recommend</li>
            <li> Larger size than I could have even hoped for. It was a great price. Definitely a very very good purchase</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and it replaced the Ralph Laurence Romance cologne for men.  We were hesitant to get something new and this was just perfect.  The only complaint is the bottle size.  The Romance bottle held 6.5 ounces and was smaller in your hand.  The bottle must be indestructible.  It is quite large in your hand.  Other than that - great cologne.</li>
            <li> Very light not overpowering sexy like smell. Very safe buy.</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume.</li>
            <li> It is the most powerull perfume for men I ever smell. My boyfriend love it and me too. I smell the colone all day</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and I love the way he smells in this</li>
            <li> it smells good, but you use it, and in two hours or less you dont have any fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> I hate it ! it smells like nothing ! water in the bottle ! thats it ! such a waste of money !</li>
            <li> As it was described awesome</li>
            <li> I love the scent. Really nice!</li>
            <li> Big bottle. Cheap! This bottle would be $80 at Macys. Very unique mellow scent.  I would definitely recommend this pruduct.</li>
            <li> Purchased a smaller bottle at a local store and liked the way it smelled so came here to get a better deal on a larger size.  Could not beat the price.  Fast shipping and delivery.  Real deal, not watered down version.</li>
            <li> For context, I am a 24 year old male living in a warm area. This scent is very delightful and receives frequent compliments. It tends to lean more citrus in nature which is excellent for those warm daytime uses. My only complaint is the poor longevity. Youll need to spray plenty of this cologne, with frequency, if you expect to last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> get the intense one, forget about this one</li>
            <li> I normally wear 360 and just wanted to try it cause the bottle was so pretty this is a nice pleasant sporty smell</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, stink good. We spayed it on and my wife went nuts. So it stinks good.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is super sexy, and perfect for a casual day or a night out! Would definitely recommend this fragrance- it&#x27;s not too strong and it&#x27;s sweet, yet still very masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and oh my gosh, he smells fabulous.  I don&#x27;t want to let him leave for work!  A rich scent that will make you want to make your husband &amp;#34;late for work&amp;#34;........  :)  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I brought this item because my mother convinced me too, and I was blown away,,,best buy, must have.  You won&#x27;t regret your choice</li>
            <li> fast shipping. I compare this item to the storewhich seem to me are the same. I recommend this product to buy for sure.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells amazing and for the price it is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local department store to test out different colognes to see what i liked and i fell in love with Euphoria for men. But the department store wanted $60 for a 2.5 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I looked it up on amazon and was able to buy the 3.5 ounce bottle for $35! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is just right for me. Spray on just a little, and you are good for the day. When I open my closet I don&#x27;t smell sweaty clothes. I smell EUPHORIA!</li>
            <li> Did not get product and did not get any response to several emails. I have already wasted too much time on this.</li>
            <li> As subjective as these things are, I got this after getting a free trial from a makeup place. My wife likes it and she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind... she picked it out. Anyway, I can&#x27;t give a ton of props to this as a perfect product since the smell does fade over time unlike others i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Euphoria is one of Klein&#x27;s timeless scents. It&#x27;s sweet, but masculine. I&#x27;m always complimented that I &amp;#34;smell great&amp;#34; anytime I spray it on for the day. I love this one...</li>
            <li> This does not have hardly any fragrance.  It&#x27;s like half the strength of Euphoria that I bought at Macy&#x27;s.  I must be misinformed, but I thought eau de toilette should be the same strength no matter where you buy it.  Will not likely buy fragrance online again.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite make perfume. Love to smell it on my hubby, love to smell it around the house when he is not there lol&lt;br /&gt;Its a handsome smell</li>
            <li> Really like the scent, and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many memories. I put it on the keyboard, and enjoy it so much.</li>
            <li> When women smell me they go crazy</li>
