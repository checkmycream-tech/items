            <li>It smells so good and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Original Formula *128 Oz]]</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to find it here</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets very dry in the winter-this lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li>My order was received quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>about right</li>

            <li>This product also arrived ahead of schedule and was VERY reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light, similar to baby powder</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Me and my boyfriend love this product, but we can only get it at the mall.</li>
            <li>purchased the body drench in the one gallon size, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years and was excited to find out that I could get it in that size!</li>
            <li>I love the soft fragrance and how it leaves my skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>Keep the large bottle under the sink in the bathroom and use it every day</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon  </li>
            <li>just have to use much more of it and more often because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li>This is one of many things I&#x27;ve bought in bulk to save money; body wash by EO was the other (which lasted for over a year before purchasing a replacement).</li>
            <li>You will need to buy a gallon pump, super cheap which is also offered on Amazon - I keep it in the container in my room and TWO PUMPS is enough to cover my entire body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product whether you tan or not.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I purchased the gallon size based on all the great ratings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the body drench deep nourishing moisturizer, but that dose not come in bigger sizes like the original, so I thought I would take a chance that is wouldn&#x27;t be that different then the original.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>It has a very \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot; smell that lingers.</li>
            <li>especially if you use it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Ordered this for the wife, much better bargain than the small containers she was buying.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and soft for the day.</li>
            <li>the body wash is light and not a strong scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what grade the ingredients are but overall the lotion feels very cheap to me.</li>
            <li>so I spent too much on lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find this big bottle to keep my refill stock supplied.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and have not spent one day of it tanning.  </li>
            <li>When applying it is very runny and it runs down your body.</li>
            <li>no where near the same consistency and this leaves my skin dry, the deep moisturizer helps my eczema</li>

            <li> I have very, very, very dry skin and the only thing that works for me</li>
            <li> will by it by the gallon as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> In the summer with all the tanning I do and in the winter when the dry skin sets in!</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find in retail stores, so I looked for it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious...</li>
            <li> I have been buying body drench for years and found this bottle to be extremely &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and the fragrance does not interfear with other fragrances</li>
            <li> and I have issues using any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> We do not use any other moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and has little or no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> pump is a little off set not sturdy but if you are just using to refill another bottle</li>
            <li> The pumps never worked so I would purchase one at a store in town for a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother attempting to use it because you&#x27;ll waste a bunch of lotion like I did.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it is not oily and does not leave me feeling like my skin is drenched.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I&#x27;m sending this back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the rave reviews are coming from, but this lotion was not for me.</li>
            <li> Did not think it was as thick as I had thought it would be.</li>
            <li> No smell, not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> It is so thin that when you push pump, lotion goes flying across the counter.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed I should have known it wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li> but this just makes it worst.</li>

            <li> Love this lotion. I have used this for years. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Me and my boyfriend love this product, but we can only get it at the mall. Amazon had a great price and saved us a trip.</li>
            <li> This size is the best buy for the money.  The pumps never worked so I would purchase one at a store in town for a few dollars.  It is a great product. It smells so good and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion and I can&#x27;t find it in person anywhere anymore so I was really excited to find it here and at such a great price!  The best body lotion out there.  In the summer with all the tanning I do and in the winter when the dry skin sets in!</li>
            <li> fell in love with this at my gym, and had to get some for myself. will by it by the gallon as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I&#x27;m sending this back.  I cannot stand the scent of it.  It&#x27;s way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I have been buying body drench for years and found this bottle to be extremely &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;. It is so thin that when you push pump, lotion goes flying across the counter. When applying it is very runny and it runs down your body. Almost like it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;. As far as effectiveness goes, it&#x27;s okay. just have to use much more of it and more often because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for a number of years and is quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is the very best moisturizer that I have ever used.  Keep the large bottle under the sink in the bathroom and use it every day</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent.  Reminds me of diapering my children. Did not think it was as thick as I had thought it would be.</li>
            <li> lightly scented lotion, good price</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the wife, much better bargain than the small containers she was buying.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product, I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  Goes on smoothly, not greasy and feels amazing. No scent!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact I could get a gallon bottle.</li>
            <li> Love Body Drench and the good value from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and love it!  I use it right after I shower and it keeps my skin very soft.  I have dry skin, so this lotion is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using Body Drench for years. Love being able to buy by gallon so I never run out!</li>
            <li> have used this product for years, love it&lt;br /&gt;Tpriced about right and the fragrance does not interfear with other fragrances</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s great especially out here in the desert.  I highly recommend this product whether you tan or not.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion &amp; use it every day. Have tried many others but my skin likes Body Drench the best.</li>
            <li> You know a lotion is exceptional if people keep asking where you got it.  Has a nice, light powdery fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 18 years.  It is not greasy and has little or no fragrance.  Both are pluses in my opinion!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for almost 15 years. It&#x27;s the best one in my opinion. No smell, not too thick or too thin. Great for hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> Body drench is the BEST lotion I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin that gets very dry in the winter-this lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, gender neutral, great for all to use, not greasy but moisturizes very well. Wish it came with a pump though.</li>
            <li> My order was received quickly. I am very happy with the lotion. I love the soft fragrance and how it leaves my skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and years. Great price,  much better to buy in bulk to get better price per volume unit.  Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling post application.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and have not spent one day of it tanning.  This is the perfect daily body moisturizer for all skin types.  LOVE it!  This product also arrived ahead of schedule and was VERY reasonably priced.  Thank you to the perfect seller!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Goes on smooth, not greasy at all and really makes the skin softer</li>
            <li> Perfect for those of us that are serious about moisture! This is one of many things I&#x27;ve bought in bulk to save money; body wash by EO was the other (which lasted for over a year before purchasing a replacement). You will need to buy a gallon pump, super cheap which is also offered on Amazon - I keep it in the container in my room and TWO PUMPS is enough to cover my entire body. The fragrance is very light, similar to baby powder but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming by any means. It keeps my skin hydrated and soft for the day. Definitely happy!</li>
            <li> This is great value but the pump that comes with it is 100% junk.  Completely useless.  Don&#x27;t even bother attempting to use it because you&#x27;ll waste a bunch of lotion like I did.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin. I&#x27;m not sure where the rave reviews are coming from, but this lotion was not for me. It is not greasy, but it has a soapy feel when you put it on. It feels like there&#x27;s a film of soap on me and it left my skin feeling dry. The scent did not agree with me. It has a very \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot; smell that lingers. Unfortunately I purchased the gallon size based on all the great ratings. If you&#x27;re curious... I&#x27;d recommend you go with the smallest size. I&#x27;m not sure what grade the ingredients are but overall the lotion feels very cheap to me.</li>
            <li> Did not like that it did not come with a pump to pump lotion out.  I had to go and buy the pumper.</li>
            <li> Very Good price. Love having it delivered. Soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years!  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!  Great moisturizer without being heavy.  Try it and you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> Been using Body Drench for years and years, glad to be able to get the gallon size.</li>
            <li> ONLY lotion i will use!</li>
            <li> I have used Body Drench for YEARS and I have issues using any other lotion.  It keeps my skin moisturized without a lot of fragrance.  I use it everyday, it is not oily and does not leave me feeling like my skin is drenched.  It soaks in quickly and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find this big bottle to keep my refill stock supplied.  This lotion is somewhat spendy in stores, that is IF you can find it.</li>
            <li> love this lotion non greasy very moisturizing !!!! pump is a little off set not sturdy but if you are just using to refill another bottle it is fine the body wash is light and not a strong scent</li>
            <li> This is a must have for my family! We do not use any other moisturizer! Thank you for providing this at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Best product and well worth the  money...anyone that is not using this needs to...I love it  Thanks Amazon  well done</li>
