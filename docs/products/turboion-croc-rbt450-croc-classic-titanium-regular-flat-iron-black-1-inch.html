            <li>I bought her this CROC2 that was recomended by a friend, she is in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>They both love it.</li>
            <li>I love my croc iron.</li>

            <li>( Just be sure to use a heat defense in your hair )</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had a Croc iron for many years but it died at some point.</li>
            <li>This is truly the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>She says they are good but take too much time to do their job.</li>
            <li>This Croc is by far the BEST flat iron straightener I have invested good money into.</li>
            <li>so i have that fine wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>Next, at first the straightener worked great!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>Plus it leave my hair soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>My hair is soooo curly and the croc 2 makes it stick straight, i love it.  </li>
            <li>only good thing was the process to return this item.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I have been through my fair amount of flat irons.  </li>
            <li>I have had 5 Chi flat irons and I loved them.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair SUPER shiny  4.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really upset (the price was worth it), and it&#x27;s a great iron I&#x27;ve used it before.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly &amp; works well.</li>
            <li>The look is really chic and the contour of the iron makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I liked this flatiron until one day they mysteriously only will go up to 230 degrees.</li>
            <li>This was the most seamless return process I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>They are super fast to returns your emails to you quickly, answers all questions and takes care of their customer.</li>
            <li>I keep it at 430 degrees for my hair and zip right along.  </li>
            <li>So we convinced her it was the right one</li>
            <li>I wanted one of my own because I love that this iron gets 450 degrees (and stays hot!), makes curly or coarse hair straight as a board, and leaves it soft and silky.   </li>
            <li>It does get very hot, depending on how hot you have it so be careful when touching it!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>exact preferred</li>
            <li>This one is definitely in the top.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up quickly and it&#x27;s very hot.</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>so I ended up with semi straight straw.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my bf</li>
            <li>Heats up fast  2.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the wavy curly hair gals!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep it,  just to save the hassle of returning and reordering, but if you&#x27;re really looking for a Croc2</li>
            <li>is by fav because it glides over the hair with a shine that looks so nice on by  African American hair.</li>
            <li>Flattens my hair better and quicker than my old ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast, and the display is simple to use/read.  </li>
            <li>I am a full Mexican</li>
            <li>Only needs one MAYBE two pass overs to straighten super curly hair.    </li>
            <li>It appears to be an older Croc box?  </li>
            <li>Each time I&#x27;ve received the item, they&#x27;ve given me the Croc Classic.</li>
            <li>I got shipped a Croc Classic, not a Croc2.</li>
            <li>The seller&#x27;s sticker on the Croc Classic box even says \\&quot;Croc2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, and yes the sides do get hot, but once I got down the proper way to handle it, I don&#x27;t think I want to be without this one!  </li>
            <li>Positive experience so far (received the iron 2 weeks ago), would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>My wife has a drawer full of flat irons and what not&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did really straighten at higher temps (290-320).</li>
            <li>They are still hot enough to use, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li>I use it at least 3x a week or more and my hair is still soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old granddaughter really wanted one of these last Christmas.</li>
            <li>and I worried that it might not last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I picked up my old CHI.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>early October, I got a message from my granddaughter, it had quit working again and was it still under warranty.</li>
            <li>The titanium base does an excellent job in smoothing the cuticle of the hair.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, colored grey hair and this is the only iron I have tried that works without me having to go over the same strand more than once.  </li>
            <li>The same seller (and other Amazon sellers) sell the Original model for $30-$50 cheaper, so I felt like I was getting ripped off.  </li>
            <li>Yes it gets my hair straight in no time, but it also leaves my hair burnt smelling and incredibly dry.  </li>
            <li>If you hold the right button down and then hit the ON button, it will display a C or an F</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more(different sizes to work with) in the very near future.</li>
            <li>, this straightens it like no other.</li>
            <li>But, I wanted to buy me a new flat iron because, my hairstylist used a Croc just like this one on my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up in just a few seconds and has a digital read out showing it&#x27;s adjustable temperature settings up to 450 degrees (for special treatments)</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell there&#x27;s no difference in the CROC than the cheaper burn and damage your hair flat irons.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly enough no dry looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, kinky curly hair and one pass with the Croc 2 its smooth.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a hairdresser and not easy to please when it comes to flat irons.  </li>
            <li>I will sum up the good and bad points of this iron below.    </li>

            <li> Less burnt smelling still terribly dry looking even after intense conditioning.  </li>
            <li> The Chi ceramic flat iron I&#x27;ve been using for years was starting to age</li>
            <li> and if they are still operating at full force and that the digital display is just broken.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to get this flat iron for her for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> With other flat irons I would have to go over and over the same strand of hair.</li>
            <li> The only difference is it seems that the iron got a little bit less larger than the old one, but my girlfriend said she&#x27;d get used to it.</li>
            <li> If your hair is fragile, due to chemical over-exposure, then turn the heat down and by all means...use a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, course, frizzy, heavy highlighted hair that is totally unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Unless you only need it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have always been dead set on Chi flat irons!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how easy it was to get feedback from the seller, which included a prepaid return envelope.</li>
            <li> After a month of adjusting the temperature down, then down again, I&#x27;ve settled on 230.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Croc 2 straightener a little less than a month ago.  </li>
            <li> for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> Not to mention the &amp;#34;1-inch&amp;#34; plate was barely 3/4ths of an inch long, which was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Chi and have not liked them.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair</li>
            <li> Bad:  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have bad hair days!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> The Chi ceramic flat iron I&#x27;ve been using for years was starting to age and I worried that it might not last much longer.  When a co-worker raved about the CROC I looked into them and settled on the CROC2 Titanium.  I am now in the process of trying to sell the CROC2 to that co-worker.  Yes it gets my hair straight in no time, but it also leaves my hair burnt smelling and incredibly dry.  After a month of adjusting the temperature down, then down again, I&#x27;ve settled on 230.  Less burnt smelling still terribly dry looking even after intense conditioning.  It took more passes to get the hair straight so I ended up with semi straight straw.  Hmmm...thinking I may have permenantly damaged my hair I picked up my old CHI.  Amazingly enough no dry looking hair.  In all fairness my hair is color treated.  Maybe ceramic is just gentler than titanium. As far as I can tell there&#x27;s no difference in the CROC than the cheaper burn and damage your hair flat irons.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did really straighten at higher temps (290-320).</li>
            <li> My hair is soooo curly and the croc 2 makes it stick straight, i love it.  I never thought i could wear my hair this way! I use it at least 3x a week or more and my hair is still soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have always been dead set on Chi flat irons! That was until I decided to buy the Croc 2.  I have very thick, kinky curly hair and one pass with the Croc 2 its smooth.  With other flat irons I would have to go over and over the same strand of hair. This eventually damaged my hair.  Since using the Croc 2 my hair is smoother and healthier.  I just can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner!</li>
            <li> It used to take me 30 min to do my hair, now it takes about 5! Plus it leave my hair soft and healthy! Thanks to my bf I no longer have bad hair days! Best gift ever!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly. Flattens my hair better and quicker than my old ceramic flat iron. Learned it can display and Fahrenheit or Celsius because it would only display up to 230. But I knew the iron was getting hotter than that. If you hold the right button down and then hit the ON button, it will display a C or an F so you can decide how you want the degrees displayed.</li>
            <li> I will sum up the good and bad points of this iron below.    Good:  1. Heats up fast  2. Doesn&#x27;t snag  3. Leaves hair SUPER shiny  4. Only needs one MAYBE two pass overs to straighten super curly hair.    Bad:  1. Nothing. Buy the darn thing.</li>
            <li> I love my Croc2. I am a full Mexican so i have that fine wavy/curly hair, this straightens it like no other. I have tried the Chi and have not liked them. I believe the Titanium plate are way better. This leaves my hair soft. Heats up quickly. It does get very hot, depending on how hot you have it so be careful when touching it! Highly recommend for the wavy curly hair gals!</li>
            <li> I bought the Croc 2 straightener a little less than a month ago.  When I received it, it was a Croc 2 straighener, but did not even come in the box in the picture. It appears to be an older Croc box?  Next, at first the straightener worked great!  Recently two days ago, it will not allow me to put it to a setting above 230degrees.  It used to go up to 400+.  I am very disappointed.  I know the Croc is a great straightener, but do not however trust buying it from anything but a salon from here on, even if I have to pay full retain price!  I do not suggest to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best flat iron I have ever owned. It heats up in just a few seconds and has a digital read out showing it&#x27;s adjustable temperature settings up to 450 degrees (for special treatments) I use it at 380 degrees for my highlighted hair. It leaves my hair silky smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> My wife has a drawer full of flat irons and what not&#x27;s. She says they are good but take too much time to do their job. I bought her this CROC2 that was recomended by a friend, she is in LOVE with it. The Titanium plates do their job faster than any of the $15-45 dollar ones she has. The Digital setting help adjust to you exact preferred temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on her reaction BUY this product. She has recommended it to all her sisters, word is bond!</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to get this flat iron for her for Christmas.  She is a profession hair stylist and a coworker of hers had recommended this product.  They both love it.</li>
            <li> I love my croc iron. This is my second one. The titanium base does an excellent job in smoothing the cuticle of the hair. I love the fact that it is versatile and works on \\&quot;all\\&quot; textures of hair. The look is really chic and the contour of the iron makes it easy to work with. On a scale of 1-10 I give this iron an 11. The price is excellent as well, they retail for much more in the industry. I will be purchasing more(different sizes to work with) in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I liked this flatiron until one day they mysteriously only will go up to 230 degrees. Not sure what happened and if they are still operating at full force and that the digital display is just broken. They are still hot enough to use, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a hairdresser and not easy to please when it comes to flat irons.  We use the 1.5 Croc at our salon for the Keratin treatments.  I wanted one of my own because I love that this iron gets 450 degrees (and stays hot!), makes curly or coarse hair straight as a board, and leaves it soft and silky.   You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I have coarse, colored grey hair and this is the only iron I have tried that works without me having to go over the same strand more than once.  I keep it at 430 degrees for my hair and zip right along.  Experiment with the temperatures.  If your hair is fragile, due to chemical over-exposure, then turn the heat down and by all means...use a heat protectant. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> The product delivered was not a Croc2 as indicated in the description, it was an &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Croc. The same seller (and other Amazon sellers) sell the Original model for $30-$50 cheaper, so I felt like I was getting ripped off.  Not to mention the &amp;#34;1-inch&amp;#34; plate was barely 3/4ths of an inch long, which was highly disappointed.  Overall, I felt like I was sold a knock-off.  I read the reviews but hoped this would not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing was the process to return this item.  I was shocked at how easy it was to get feedback from the seller, which included a prepaid return envelope. (I guess they get a lot of returns.) I mailed the product back and got my refund without any issue.  This was the most seamless return process I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This straightener is soo incredible!! It straightens all hair types and I only have to go over my hair once per section!! I have always been a big Chi fan, but after using the Croc I will never use another type!!</li>
            <li> Great iron, works well, doesn&#x27;t burn hair and also can curl.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, course, frizzy, heavy highlighted hair that is totally unmanageable.  I have no choice but to straighten it daily.  That being said, I have been through my fair amount of flat irons.  This one is definitely in the top.  It heats up super fast, and the display is simple to use/read.  It&#x27;s super light, and yes the sides do get hot, but once I got down the proper way to handle it, I don&#x27;t think I want to be without this one!  Try it!  ( Just be sure to use a heat defense in your hair )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ordering Croc 2 THREE times through Amazon! Each time I&#x27;ve received the item, they&#x27;ve given me the Croc Classic. I&#x27;ve had to return it each time. I don&#x27;t think Amazon actually has the Croc 2 in stock. They should just take this product off their site.</li>
            <li> I have had 5 Chi flat irons and I loved them. But, I wanted to buy me a new flat iron because, my hairstylist used a Croc just like this one on my hair. I loved how it glided so nicely in my corse hair. This Croc is by far the BEST flat iron straightener I have invested good money into. The seller of this Croc has GREAT communication with the customer. They are super fast to returns your emails to you quickly, answers all questions and takes care of their customer. They took VERY GOOD care of me. I would most DEFFINETLY buy from them again!!! They made me a VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!!! 😊</li>
            <li> I got shipped a Croc Classic, not a Croc2. The seller&#x27;s sticker on the Croc Classic box even says \\&quot;Croc2\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not really upset (the price was worth it), and it&#x27;s a great iron I&#x27;ve used it before.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it,  just to save the hassle of returning and reordering, but if you&#x27;re really looking for a Croc2 you may or may not get the newer model from this seller, just a warning.</li>
            <li> great item and seller !</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had a Croc iron for many years but it died at some point. She wanted to have the same iron and this one was one third of the price I paid for the last one. The only difference is it seems that the iron got a little bit less larger than the old one, but my girlfriend said she&#x27;d get used to it. Positive experience so far (received the iron 2 weeks ago), would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> love love love my croc!</li>
            <li> It is my second curling iron.  I purchased this one that was repackaged and it only cost $46.00 what value.  I have others iron by this one is by fav because it glides over the hair with a shine that looks so nice on by  African American hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and it&#x27;s very hot. Makes my hair very soft and smooth. They have a pretty good warranty too!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; works well. Only downside: I didn&#x27;t realize how skinny 1inch is... I have relatively thick hair so this takes me FOREVER to curl it all</li>
            <li> My 16 year old granddaughter really wanted one of these last Christmas. I ordered one on Amazon, it arrived. It said Croc all over it, but we had to look close on the UPS code to see anything that said Croc 2. So we convinced her it was the right one and she loved it. for a little over a month. And it quit. It took two months to get Beauty One to replace it, they kept changing stories, but it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;In early October, I got a message from my granddaughter, it had quit working again and was it still under warranty. After two messages to Beauty One they finally replied that it was not.&lt;br /&gt;So I would NOT buy this product. Unless you only need it for a few months.</li>
