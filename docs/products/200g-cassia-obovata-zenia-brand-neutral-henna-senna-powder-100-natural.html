            <li>made my hair feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>Really impressed with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly silky and shiny - and no shift in color.</li>
            <li>I followed the recommendations of L. Jennewein, and am delighted by the results!</li>
            <li>hair is well-conditioned, with a great deal of shine and 80% reduction in frizz.</li>
            <li>And the price is great.</li>
            <li>so it was a great addition to the mix.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to cover the gray..--mix part Henna -with apple cider vin-part Cassia with apple</li>
            <li>good amount of neutral henna for the price.</li>
            <li>Very good condtioner for mu bleached fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great company to work with, I love the Cassia Obovata.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin &amp; experienced no irritation of any kind, &amp; the amla cleansed my scalp very nicely.</li>
            <li>Smells good and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I use it in my shampoo bars and everyone seems to love it.  </li>
            <li>satisfied.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 3 hours but the longer the better the strength of the color.</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>I definetly love this product and would recommend this seller as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, this stuff is nowhere near as pleasant as henna.</li>
            <li>I chose add sweet almond oil since it makes my hair feel nice alone</li>
            <li>Great customer service, prompt and professional.</li>
            <li>It worked great, the instructions were clear.</li>
            <li>My hair hasnt felt this great since I was a child, it doesnt matter how often I shampoo it, it stays soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Looks like super detailed highlights .</li>
            <li>good stuff...but not enough of it.</li>
            <li>I use a cassia and henna mix to get a nice rich golden copper blonde.</li>
            <li>This  was a very smooth consistency that mixed well &amp; rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>It really strenghten my weak hair and made it strong and healthy again!!!  </li>
            <li>I mixed up a cake-batter consistency of this, olive oil, warm water, and some drops of peppermint oil and saturated my hair for an hour.</li>
            <li>You only have use this once a month because that&#x27;s how effective this hair conditioner works.  </li>
            <li>I used it together with amla, in a 5/1 ratio, mixed into warm coconut milk.</li>
            <li>The smell is like freshly cut hay.</li>
            <li>This made my dark blond and gray hair look more uniform in color (darkens the gray, leaves the natural color alone) and much, much more healthy.  </li>
            <li>-exactly as it said it wouldn&#x27;t do) and my hair was so soft that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>First of all shipping was SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of the Starwest Botanicals Cassia.</li>
            <li>had been using henna on and off for about 3 years, so while this is my first cassia treatment, I do have some experience with plant dyes.</li>
            <li>Thinking it could be a lack of moisture, I added water and lemon juice to the mix, and I still only got the most outer part of each section of hair, but my hair still wasn&#x27;t covered all the way.</li>
            <li>However, make sure you have plenty of time, an old shower cap (stains), old towels and an assistant to brush it on.</li>
            <li>I bought this henna to see if it would change my grey into a brownish gold colour, but that didnt happen this is just great to do deep conditioning but not colour (well not for me), my hair felt softer but the greys were still there, and I tried leaveing it longer than recommended to see if that would work, but the greys were still there, so I am back to the original Jamilla Henna, which gives my greys a reddish colour</li>
            <li>Any oils would be fine to mix with it this last time i added peppermint, lavender, and tea tree oil for added growth stimulation and dandruff</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>And i had to wash my hair to much and still feel it.</li>
            <li>and it stays really moisturized.</li>
            <li>mix together when ready to use...</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping was amazingly fast, even to Alaska.</li>
            <li>My hair grown and is much much stronger I&#x27;ve been using this concoction for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zleBELePfgQ&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player very informative video.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any color change in my hair, and I am glad because it would be extremely blotchy if it did color.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable, straighter and less gray.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of cassia left over to do several more applications and my hair is mid-back length.</li>
            <li>Now I want more white hair to blonde.</li>
            <li>My hair is really soft now afterward</li>
            <li>This turned my white hair a light yellow blonde.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try rinsing my hair out in my stainless steel sink, for quicker cleanup.</li>
            <li>Some of the Henna looked old.</li>
            <li>and i mix it with oils, water and most of the time a thick conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time I have used it, and I have the exact same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use this with amla powder along with sweet almond oil coconut oil and green tea extract.</li>
            <li>A week later, and my hair is still silky soft and no tangles in sight!</li>
            <li>For reference, my hair is long, porous, 3b; i&#x27;m in a very humid climate &amp; do condition-cleansers only.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing the stuff off my hands, my hands feel gritty and dry, like I&#x27;ve used an abrasive soap, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel much different.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural 4a hair</li>

            <li> A little messy to do, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left quite a residue of sludge in the shower - and my hair is quite short, so the problem may be exacerbated for those treating long hair.</li>
            <li> I spread it on dry hair and left it on for about 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order again but alittle goes a long ways and this package will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> i wish it would have had direction on how long to leave it on and what to mix it with.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown with 10% white hair.</li>
            <li> I will use only half the package.</li>
            <li> So anything that can give my hair shine, less frizz, &amp; some internal &#x27;weight&#x27; is a holy grail for me.</li>
            <li> Next time I may try a henna that dyes to cover up my little bit of gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it 2 times in the past week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but I got a headache when I mixed a small portion of this with the Jamila Henna Power.</li>
            <li> I mix it with distilled water (sometimes with a little bit of Vitamin E Skin Oil found at drug stores, GMC ,Walmart or Targets) to consistency of slightly wet mashed potatoes .</li>
            <li> less then half my hair done.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight curl reduction but since Cassia is not permanent, it will return soon.</li>
            <li> This product made my long lifeless hair  look thick and glossy.  </li>
            <li> I then shampooed, roller set and air dried over night.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp  feel like i mad had put a whole lot of peppermint on it before i even had a</li>
            <li> The second this product touched my hair, it became dreaded to the point that I could not coat each strand, so it is just slopped on in random places.</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to rinse out, but I had expected this.  </li>
            <li> This quality of Cassia is horrible, it actually made my hair thinner and redder, instead of fuller and yellower.</li>
            <li> Terrible experience this time.</li>

            <li> Great company to work with, I love the Cassia Obovata.  My hair is more manageable, straighter and less gray. Great customer service, prompt and professional.</li>

            <li> I recently learned about henna for hair strengthening and have used this one time.  I mixed it with 1 can of coconut milk and 1/4 cup coconut oil.  I spread it on dry hair and left it on for about 5 hours.  It was a bit difficult to rinse out, but I had expected this.  I&#x27;ll have to wait to see if it in fact helps my curly hair grow out, but it definitely seems softer.  Next time I may try a henna that dyes to cover up my little bit of gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, I had a lot of the mix leftover and next time I will use only half the package.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp  feel like i mad had put a whole lot of peppermint on it before i even had a less then half my hair done. And i had to wash my hair to much and still feel it.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair conditioner.  You only have use this once a month because that&#x27;s how effective this hair conditioner works.  It really strenghten my weak hair and made it strong and healthy again!!!  I will definitely order again but alittle goes a long ways and this package will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> I recently used the product on my hair for a conditioning treatment. My hair is really soft now afterward and it stays really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this to condition and color grays.  It worked great, the instructions were clear. However, make sure you have plenty of time, an old shower cap (stains), old towels and an assistant to brush it on.</li>
            <li> This turned my white hair a light yellow blonde.I mix it with distilled water (sometimes with a little bit of Vitamin E Skin Oil found at drug stores, GMC ,Walmart or Targets) to consistency of slightly wet mashed potatoes . I leave it on for 3 hours but the longer the better the strength of the color. My hair is dark brown with 10% white hair. Only the white hair had color change, the rest stayed the same. Looks like super detailed highlights . Now I want more white hair to blonde.</li>
            <li> I followed the recommendations of L. Jennewein, and am delighted by the results! I used it prior to going into a sauna for 1/2 hour, then washed it out. My hair is incredibly silky and shiny - and no shift in color. Just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left quite a residue of sludge in the shower - and my hair is quite short, so the problem may be exacerbated for those treating long hair. Next time I&#x27;ll try rinsing my hair out in my stainless steel sink, for quicker cleanup.</li>
            <li> i love this. made my hair feel wonderful. i wish it would have had direction on how long to leave it on and what to mix it with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but I got a headache when I mixed a small portion of this with the Jamila Henna Power. Some of the Henna looked old. I won&#x27;t be purchasing the Jamila Henna Powder again. Terrible experience this time.</li>
            <li> I bought this henna to see if it would change my grey into a brownish gold colour, but that didnt happen this is just great to do deep conditioning but not colour (well not for me), my hair felt softer but the greys were still there, and I tried leaveing it longer than recommended to see if that would work, but the greys were still there, so I am back to the original Jamilla Henna, which gives my greys a reddish colour</li>
            <li> This quality of Cassia is horrible, it actually made my hair thinner and redder, instead of fuller and yellower. Will not buy again. I prefer mehandi.com quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to cover the gray..--mix part Henna -with apple cider vin-part Cassia with apple cider---- let them both sit over night&lt;br /&gt;then mix together when ready to use...let stay on hair for 3- hours... wash/rinse</li>
            <li> This  was a very smooth consistency that mixed well &amp; rinsed easily. I used it together with amla, in a 5/1 ratio, mixed into warm coconut milk. Let it sit for an hour, put in my hair for 3, then coated my hair in conditioner to aid rinsing. I added the amla as I wanted to keep my curls from being too relaxed by the cassia. Really impressed with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is well-conditioned, with a great deal of shine and 80% reduction in frizz. The smell is like freshly cut hay. For reference, my hair is long, porous, 3b; i&#x27;m in a very humid climate &amp; do condition-cleansers only. So anything that can give my hair shine, less frizz, &amp; some internal &#x27;weight&#x27; is a holy grail for me. Bonus: i have sensitive skin &amp; experienced no irritation of any kind, &amp; the amla cleansed my scalp very nicely. And the price is great. Plus the shipping was amazingly fast, even to Alaska.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read of the benefits of neutral henna on several hair forums. So, I mixed it with water, coconut oil and castor oil to a pancake batter consistency then daubed it onto my hair. I wrapped in clingfilm and then waited about 40 mins. I then shampooed, roller set and air dried over night. No color change (yay-exactly as it said it wouldn&#x27;t do) and my hair was so soft that I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it. So now it looks frizzy because I&#x27;ve been playing with the curls. I&#x27;ll probably put it in the hair product rotation though I&#x27;d like to try rhassoul clay as well</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this again. My hair hasnt felt this great since I was a child, it doesnt matter how often I shampoo it, it stays soft and manageable. I noticed a slight curl reduction but since Cassia is not permanent, it will return soon.</li>
            <li> good amount of neutral henna for the price. Smells good and comes off easily. Very good condtioner for mu bleached fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my long lifeless hair  look thick and glossy.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it 2 times in the past week and a half.  Will be reordering soon!</li>
            <li> First of all shipping was SUPER fast. I ordered on tuesday and it was shipped out the same day and i recieved it on thursday. Now moving on to the actiual product, it works wonders. I use it before i shampoo my hair and i mix it with oils, water and most of the time a thick conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling thicker and stronger. I definetly love this product and would recommend this seller as well.</li>
            <li> This product was what i.ordered. I use a cassia and henna mix to get a nice rich golden copper blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4a hair i use this with amla powder along with sweet almond oil coconut oil and green tea extract. I use it once a month it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. My hair grown and is much much stronger I&#x27;ve been using this concoction for about 4 months. I learned about out from YouTube video here&#x27;s the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zleBELePfgQ&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player very informative video. I chose add sweet almond oil since it makes my hair feel nice alone so it was a great addition to the mix. Any oils would be fine to mix with it this last time i added peppermint, lavender, and tea tree oil for added growth stimulation and dandruff</li>
