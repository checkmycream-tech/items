            <li>The hand cream is not greasy,which I love!</li>
            <li>Will purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li>this Arbonne FC5 are my favorite hand lotions!</li>
            <li>I use it every morning on my face after my shower, the smell  is so nice as well.</li>
            <li>This is very hydrating and smells exquisite.</li>
            <li>You will love it,</li>
            <li>This hand cream is the best for my dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and soaks in quickly leaving hands nongreasy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good cream for normal skin.</li>
            <li>a light fragrance</li>
            <li>Works great for dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product since it is natural and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it has a nice clean and fresh smell to it and it fits nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li>I use it as a treat--especially when I haven&#x27;t done anything nice for myself recently.  </li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great for when my cuticles and fingertips feel/look dry, and my skin feels soft and inviting afterwards, and the smell is intoxicating!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do not think I can return a used product if purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about exquisite ingredients combined with skill that can make the world a little better with each experience--and this hand lotion makes a small part my world just a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>My hands are extremely dry and don&#x27;t absorb most lotions, with Arbonne is an exception.</li>
            <li>However,I really like Arbonne products.</li>
            <li>This is my winter lotion and it makes it&#x27;s way through the whole family.  </li>
            <li>I personally recommend putting on right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I have been ordering this lotion for the past several years, we LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The lotion didn&#x27;t really relieve my excema which is what I initially bought it for.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best for just normal moisturizing; I mean, I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s not intended for really chapped and painful hands.  </li>
            <li>wash my hands a lot at work and get dry skin very often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my tired, dried hands.</li>
            <li>Often pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, it is not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell girly!!!&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s something about exquisite ingredients combined with skill that can make the world a little better with each experience--and this hand lotion makes a small part my world just a little bit better.  I use it as a treat--especially when I haven&#x27;t done anything nice for myself recently.  I think it&#x27;s best for just normal moisturizing; I mean, I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s not intended for really chapped and painful hands.  But it&#x27;s great for when my cuticles and fingertips feel/look dry, and my skin feels soft and inviting afterwards, and the smell is intoxicating!  It&#x27;s a \\&quot;spa moment\\&quot; which I get reminded of each time I catch the scent again.  Amazon has the best price that I&#x27;ve seen for it anywhere.  A discontinued hand lotion from Origins and this Arbonne FC5 are my favorite hand lotions!</li>
            <li> goes on easily, not greasy, seems to moisturize well.  worth the price. no lingering odor to conflict with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Arbonne is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used to be a subscriber to Arbonne, basically paying to have the &amp;#34;privilege&amp;#34; to buy their stuff. I am so happy Amazon carries their stuff because I absolutely love this lotion. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it has a nice clean and fresh smell to it and it fits nicely in my purse. My mom lives in the desert and has very dry skin. I recently got her hooked on this lotion as well and she takes it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this lotion for the past several years, we LOVE it! Both for hands and face. I use it every morning on my face after my shower, the smell  is so nice as well.</li>
            <li> This is good used as an all over the body product.. non greasy... a light fragrance and I can always notice a smoother softer feel and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the best for my dry hands.  Only need a little.  Very good product! You will love it,</li>
            <li> This is excellent hand cream. My hands are extremely dry and don&#x27;t absorb most lotions, with Arbonne is an exception. This is very hydrating and smells exquisite.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and soaks in quickly leaving hands nongreasy. A little expensive but have to spoil yourself on somethings sometimes.</li>
            <li> my daughter gave this to me for Christmas and loved it.  I am a Dental Hygienist and wash my hands a lot through the day.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my tired, dried hands.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands a lot at work and get dry skin very often. Often pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, it is not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell girly!!!&lt;br /&gt;1 tube lasts me months.&lt;br /&gt;Not necessary to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;2 or 3 days at a time when things get really dry and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my winter lotion and it makes it&#x27;s way through the whole family.  It is expensive but it is really the only thing that heals your hands and fast.  I personally recommend putting on right before bed.  I see an immediate difference in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this product since it is natural and it smells great. I was told that it would help with eczema, however, and it did not help me at all. I do not think I would order it through Amazon again, because Arbonne has a guarantee where you can return it if it does not help. Unfortunately, I do not think I can return a used product if purchased through Amazon.</li>
