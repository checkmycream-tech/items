            <li>These wipes did a great job cleansing my face without leaving a residue.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!  </li>
            <li>And of course they&#x27;re not going to remove all (or even most) waterproof eye makeup, it&#x27;s well known that the best removers for that have oil in them</li>
            <li>These cleansing wipes remove makeup remarkably well, including eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>These are just as good as washing my face.  </li>
            <li>smells really good and gets rid of all the make up.</li>
            <li>Really Cheap and has an excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Much better buy than in the stores, and, they are delivered to my door!  </li>
            <li>like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better!</li>
            <li>This is definitely a superior product that has changed my skin cleansing routine for the better.</li>
            <li>I use these wipes now instead of Obagi cleansers, as I think they are just as effective, soft and non-irritating, and my skin is perfect now.</li>
            <li>Oil of olay had a version that I liked much better.</li>
            <li>I love it, because it effectively removes my makeup, but does not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>I like these better.  </li>
            <li>It removes most makeup.  </li>
            <li>but you will need more than one to get rid of all your make up.</li>
            <li>Refreshing</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>They always leave my face feeling completely clean and refreshed!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re able to get rid of most waterproof makeup fairly easily, though if I do a full face of foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes are the perfect alternative to soap and water washing.</li>
            <li>Strong perfumy scent.  </li>
            <li>Also, my son now uses these wipes--he is a teen and has acne, but these are great and convenient and oil free.</li>
            <li>They clean well but leave a strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>I have also used the Biore brand of oil free wipes.  </li>
            <li>These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>This is great product when I initially purchased it from the store.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s oil-free because I produce enough oil on my own and do not need any more</li>
            <li>I prefer the oil free.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my purchase of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes.</li>
            <li>works easily and quickly</li>
            <li>The regular product in the blue package smells much better and is an excellent product (for me anyway).</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product when traveling.</li>
            <li>Also, I just don&#x27;t feel 100% clean without washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested it by using toner afterwards and the cotton balls come out clean.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to clean my face in the morning and at night after a long day without the hassle of face wash.</li>
            <li>I have Glucoma and the medicine that I put in my eyes 3-times a day leave a readue on my eye lids and since these pads are oil free that are just right to clean my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products but this is a real miss.</li>
            <li>They work well on make-up but facial cleaners are just as good</li>
            <li>so I was looking for wipes that were oil-free that I could use to wash my face quickly after the gym.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick makeup remover wipe for my non waterproof mascara and eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Super fast, super easy.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these little wipes!</li>
            <li>Smell is not too harsh and does a great job removing make up</li>
            <li>the cost was basically the same as I can get in a storeâ€¦but it was nice not having to leave the house.</li>
            <li>They seem better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i love the original blue pack ones though</li>
            <li>He is now more likely to clean his face often with these because of the convenience.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li>even just using it right below my eyes, makes it sting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They appear to be very gently to your skin.</li>
            <li>It is also a very gentle cleanser and does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I give the Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena deep clean oil free -  </li>
            <li>Really chocked to find this product come out of the Neutrogena brand!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so I use pretty hardcore foundation when I use foundation, but I&#x27;m also acne prone and need something that cleans well.  </li>
            <li>These wipes, like all the others I&#x27;ve tried (which is a lot!), don&#x27;t remove everything, but if I wash my face without using a wipe first there is still makeup coming off on the cotton ball when I use my toner.</li>
            <li>These wipes do work, but you do have to scrub or wipe quite a bit to remove makeup, and there is a stinging effect after cleaning face, most likely from the alcohol.</li>
            <li>After using it for a while, I think it actually is doing a better job at cleaning my face than soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I use the Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover Pads first, and, follow with the wipes.  </li>
            <li>Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.</li>
            <li>They do have alcohol in them, it&#x27;s listed right in the ingredients (as the second ingredient, right after &#x27;water&#x27;), if your skin cannot handle alcohol (which is true about a lot of people&#x27;s skin), then you should avoid things with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>(generally the bi-phase ones get the highest ratings), and this is oil free.  </li>
            <li>kind of burned my eyes a little bit</li>
            <li>x 7.2&amp;#34;) and they are generously moistened - certainly enough to clean your face.</li>
            <li>Great Product, a little pricey, which the would offer larger size packages at a reduce rate.</li>
            <li>I often need to use two wipes, which is why I knocked it down a star, because I feel like makeup cleansing wipes should really be able to clean off an entire face worth of foundation with just the two sides of one wipe.  </li>
            <li>However, the acne washes don&#x27;t really remove makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really like these, I&#x27;ve been using them off and on for years, now.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter and I cut these in 1/2 n</li>
            <li>, my face is much cleaner, and foundation goes on flawlessly thanks to these.</li>
            <li>I am still waiting for a wipe that will let me not have to wash my face but this may be asking for too much.</li>
            <li>all the makeup really does come off,</li>
            <li>It cleans my face really well.  </li>
            <li>it removes water-proof make up very well.</li>
            <li>They work very well removing my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>First of all, I have very sensitive skin, prone to break outs with any oil based products.</li>
            <li>, deep cleans -- really feels cooling and clean.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena does not advertise these wipes for acne prone skin, but salicylic acid is the active ingredient in many acne medications.</li>
            <li>but i usually rinse my face after i use any kind of make up remover</li>
            <li>I have used other Neutrogena products before without any kind of reaction to them, but the Deep Clean oil-free makeup remover cleansing wipes caused one with only one use.</li>
            <li>They are adequately sized (I wish they were a bit larger than 7.4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a decent size and you can use both sides.</li>
            <li>Although the label may say makeup remover, it works perfectly as a quick facial cleanser, leaving my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell of alcohol and it feels rough on my face.</li>
            <li>However, I would highly recommend trying these wipes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>not irritating my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>couldnt live w/out these</li>
            <li>this product can be a little strong in smell but its not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>While they clean pretty well, I can&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
            <li>As yet they have not dried my skin but with frequent use I suspect they might.</li>
            <li>looks like I&#x27;m 30 years old tops.</li>
            <li>The solvent they use smells like the old Aquanet hair spray.  </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face at night they are handy.</li>
            <li>main problem with this product is that I tried to \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; and have it shipped to me monthly for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li>Very strong and unappealing.  </li>
            <li>Theres an Unpleasant smell , otherwise product works great .</li>
            <li>I use a wipe as a pre-wash to get a major head start on removing my makeup before washing my face.</li>
            <li>when I use my toner no more makeup comes off so it really is cleaning my skin very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather lazy at washing my face, so this product is great at removing makeup at the end of the day when I&#x27;m too tired to wash it.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t magically clear my skin completely, but that&#x27;s a lot to ask from such a convenient simple wipe.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just not sure their worth my money.</li>

            <li> this product can be a little strong in smell but its not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> While they clean pretty well, I can&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
            <li> As yet they have not dried my skin but with frequent use I suspect they might.</li>
            <li> looks like I&#x27;m 30 years old tops.</li>
            <li> The solvent they use smells like the old Aquanet hair spray.  </li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face at night they are handy.</li>
            <li> main problem with this product is that I tried to \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; and have it shipped to me monthly for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Very strong and unappealing.  </li>
            <li> Theres an Unpleasant smell , otherwise product works great .</li>
            <li> I use a wipe as a pre-wash to get a major head start on removing my makeup before washing my face.</li>
            <li> when I use my toner no more makeup comes off so it really is cleaning my skin very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather lazy at washing my face, so this product is great at removing makeup at the end of the day when I&#x27;m too tired to wash it.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t magically clear my skin completely, but that&#x27;s a lot to ask from such a convenient simple wipe.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not sure their worth my money.</li>
            <li> So, I just whip out one of these little cloths, and in just a few seconds, my face feels as clean as if I just took a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other wipes similar to these--clean and clear, and Aveena.</li>
            <li> Also, while these directions say wipe over the eyelid, these clearly have salicylic acid, alcohol, and a bunch of other ingredients that are well-known eye irritants.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of makeup and due to my uber-oily skin I have to apply powder often throughout the day so removing all my makeup is no easy (or fun) task.</li>
            <li> The package is small, doesn&#x27;t leak, and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I am a complete fanatic when it comes to my 48-year old skin.</li>
            <li> Looks like there was one other reviewer with the same possible problem.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier and involves less mess than soaps.</li>
            <li> Especially on hot, humid days, my face feels so clogged up and muggy.</li>
            <li> I used these wipes on my week long trip to Europe.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I have been allergic to was noxzema 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> On occasion, if my skin gets dry, I use Aquanil cleanser and these wipes to take off the cleanser, then moisturize with Aquanil.</li>
            <li> My face is dry too when I am done using the wipes.</li>
            <li> These wipes leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> Last thing those of us with sensitive skin need is left behind makeup.  </li>
            <li> put the other half in a ziplock bag for the next night.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could even use them to get off my eye makeup without it burning and stinging as long as I held my eyes tightly shut.</li>
            <li> I am so lazy, and sometimes I can&#x27;t take the 2 minutes of extra effort to wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li> other people have written, it smells like alcohol -- and it acts like alcohol as well!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The wipes work extremely well at removing oil, dirt and other impurities from your skin.</li>
            <li> They are pretty much useless for eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;To address some of the concerns in other reviews:  </li>
            <li> Their price is also affordable (have you seen some of the prices other brands are charging!).</li>
            <li> I have washed my face before bed every single day for the past 20 years, so</li>
            <li> typical routine</li>
            <li> The wipes have an odd smell to them, but all acne wash does.</li>
            <li> It stings slightly as I use the towelette on my face.</li>
            <li> but this was horrible, do not buy the deep clean one!</li>
            <li> this morning I woke up with little bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These were very very irritating on my semi sensitive face...</li>
            <li> I have small little rashes around my face.</li>
            <li> Or as others said, if I&#x27;m too lazy too wash at least I can get a little cleaner by using a wipe.</li>
            <li> usually we wear make up on our eyes!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The past 2 months it was \\&quot;delayed\\&quot; and never ended up coming, they just cancelled that month.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a year, and, don&#x27;t know how I managed in the past without them.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Annoying, right?  </li>
            <li> So using a wipe allows me to not have to work as hard when I wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had a weird reaction based on other reviews</li>
            <li> And the makeup still seems hard to remove with these</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get some of the negative reviews here.</li>
            <li> I can see how these would&#x27;ve helpful if you&#x27;re looking to freshen up from humid weather or after the gym but definitely not in place of taking off your makeup with cold cream or water and cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how well they get even thick</li>
            <li> I use these to remove stage makeup and they work well and cost less than others in expensive dept stores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hard habit to break!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, no, not happy about this product.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any irritation, redness, stinging, dryness, etc from using these.</li>
            <li> Often I just don&#x27;t do it which just makes matters worse .</li>
            <li> Oily skin is simply irritating.</li>
            <li> Smells like dog shampoo, made me want to wash my face after to to the disgusting smell off, i dont have a sensitive nose</li>
            <li> However, they are not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and will be buying these wipes at the store instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of waterproof eye makeup because of the horrific ingredients in the mascara and stuff, but I like Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s, which is a dupe for Lancome&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible acne breakout when I moved to the US and was struggling to find a cleanser for the night that would not make my face oily and itchy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used other Neutrogena products before without any kind of reaction to them, but the Deep Clean oil-free makeup remover cleansing wipes caused one with only one use. I used one wipe before bed on face and neck, following morning I woke up with hives (red itchy rash with raised bumps)  on neck and face. It&#x27;s awful. It has been 18 hours since using the product and hives have not gone away yet. Looks like there was one other reviewer with the same possible problem. It probably won&#x27;t happen to everyone but you might want to try in a small spot first if your prone to allergic reactions. The only other thing I have been allergic to was noxzema 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> These are ok. They clean well but leave a strong alcohol smell. I suppose they would be great for people with oily skin. Mine is combination. As yet they have not dried my skin but with frequent use I suspect they might. I like how well they get even thick make up off thought and when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face at night they are handy. I also like that I can keep them in my car for when I&#x27;m all sweaty and re-apply sunscreen on the go. Oil of olay had a version that I liked much better.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, however, I used it once last night &amp; this morning I woke up with little bumps on my face. I used it the following day and now I definitely realize that this product breaks my face out. I have small little rashes around my face. It has a strong smell of alcohol and it feels rough on my face. Will return it ASAP</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin so I was looking for wipes that were oil-free that I could use to wash my face quickly after the gym.  These were perfect!  Not only were they the only oil-free wipes I could find, but they are not drying at all and don&#x27;t require moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li> These pads are great.  I am so lazy, and sometimes I can&#x27;t take the 2 minutes of extra effort to wash my face at night.  These are just as good as washing my face.  I am a bit scared to really try to remove eye makeup with them (especially mascara), but the few times that I have accidentally touched my eyes didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Really chocked to find this product come out of the Neutrogena brand! Not what I expected at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other people have written, it smells like alcohol -- and it acts like alcohol as well!&lt;br /&gt;The second I put it on my face, my eyes start to water up from the fumes. And if I use it on my eye lids, it burns and stings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I now it probably says somewhere on the package \\&quot;Don&#x27;t get into eyes\\&quot; or something, but ahm, it&#x27;s a make up remover!&lt;br /&gt;And usually we wear make up on our eyes!&lt;br /&gt;But even just using it right below my eyes, makes it sting.&lt;br /&gt;So, no, not happy about this product.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove stage makeup and they work well and cost less than others in expensive dept stores.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase of Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes. Obviously I do not use them for removing make-up. However, I have a skin condition that makes washing my face with soap and water not an option. The Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes are the perfect alternative to soap and water washing. The wipes work extremely well at removing oil, dirt and other impurities from your skin. They do not leave any residue. Just wipe your face and go. They are adequately sized (I wish they were a bit larger than 7.4&amp;#34; x 7.2&amp;#34;) and they are generously moistened - certainly enough to clean your face. I have never experienced any irritation, redness, stinging, dryness, etc from using these. They appear to be very gently to your skin. Also, one of the ingredients is salicylic acid. Neutrogena does not advertise these wipes for acne prone skin, but salicylic acid is the active ingredient in many acne medications. I doubt there is enough in this product to control acne, but it can&#x27;t hurt if you have oily or acne prone skin. All in all I give the Neutrogena Deep Clean Oil Free wipes a 5-star rating. They do what they are supposed to do and they do it well. Their price is also affordable (have you seen some of the prices other brands are charging!). Please remember this is just one person&#x27;s experience and opinion and your mileage may vary. However, I would highly recommend trying these wipes.</li>
            <li> I am a devoted user of the Neutrogena acne wash line.  However, the acne washes don&#x27;t really remove makeup.  Annoying, right?  Last thing those of us with sensitive skin need is left behind makeup.  I started using these wipes to remove makeup.  I have also used the Biore brand of oil free wipes.  These are thicker and softer.  The Biore wipes are scratchier.  I like these better.  However, they are not perfect.  They are pretty much useless for eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typical routine: Wipe off my makeup at some point in the evening.  I then wash my face (could be immediately afterwards, could be just before bed) with my Neutrogena Acne Wash Grapefruit Scrub to exfoliate and get in that salicylic acid.  Also, I just don&#x27;t feel 100% clean without washing my face.  I have washed my face before bed every single day for the past 20 years, so it&#x27;s a hard habit to break!  After that, if I have a pimple, I dab on a spot treatment. I also take a cotton ball and remove remaining eye makeup.  I always end up removing eyeliner and mascara this way.  These pads don&#x27;t get that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a 3.5 star product.  It removes most makeup.  I&#x27;ve tested it by using toner afterwards and the cotton balls come out clean.  But it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup.  To be a 5 star product, it should remove eye makeup too.</li>
            <li> I really like these, I&#x27;ve been using them off and on for years, now.  I have oily skin, so I use pretty hardcore foundation when I use foundation, but I&#x27;m also acne prone and need something that cleans well.  These fit the bill.  They&#x27;re able to get rid of most waterproof makeup fairly easily, though if I do a full face of foundation, powder, etc. I often need to use two wipes, which is why I knocked it down a star, because I feel like makeup cleansing wipes should really be able to clean off an entire face worth of foundation with just the two sides of one wipe.  I haven&#x27;t had them break me out, but that&#x27;s just my skin and all skin will react differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the concerns in other reviews:  They do have alcohol in them, it&#x27;s listed right in the ingredients (as the second ingredient, right after &#x27;water&#x27;), if your skin cannot handle alcohol (which is true about a lot of people&#x27;s skin), then you should avoid things with alcohol.  Also, while these directions say wipe over the eyelid, these clearly have salicylic acid, alcohol, and a bunch of other ingredients that are well-known eye irritants.  When I wipe them over my eyelid, that&#x27;s all I do with them, just take off the eyeshadow and don&#x27;t try to attack my lashes or whatever, and I have yet to have a problem.  And of course they&#x27;re not going to remove all (or even most) waterproof eye makeup, it&#x27;s well known that the best removers for that have oil in them (generally the bi-phase ones get the highest ratings), and this is oil free.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of waterproof eye makeup because of the horrific ingredients in the mascara and stuff, but I like Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s, which is a dupe for Lancome&#x27;s.  Anyway, I was simply too baffled by some of these reviews not to comment.</li>
            <li> Strong perfumy scent.  I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I sent my boyfriend in the store to get me some cleanser wipes and this is what he brought back.  I use these at night and Purpose soap in the AM.  My skin is much brighter and I cut these in 1/2 n put the other half in a ziplock bag for the next night.  couldnt live w/out these, my face is much cleaner, and foundation goes on flawlessly thanks to these.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a superior product that has changed my skin cleansing routine for the better. I am a complete fanatic when it comes to my 48-year old skin. I bought these wipes because I needed something to use when I travel overseas, and I don&#x27;t like carrying soap. This has turned out to be a breakthrough product for me. First of all, I have very sensitive skin, prone to break outs with any oil based products. I use these wipes now instead of Obagi cleansers, as I think they are just as effective, soft and non-irritating, and my skin is perfect now. I get tons of compliments from women and men alike. It is so much easier and involves less mess than soaps. On occasion, if my skin gets dry, I use Aquanil cleanser and these wipes to take off the cleanser, then moisturize with Aquanil. I use this cleansing regimen and alternate retin A, Obagi C Rx serum with hydroquinone, and Obagi C Rx exfoliant and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 30 years old tops. Also, my son now uses these wipes--he is a teen and has acne, but these are great and convenient and oil free. He is now more likely to clean his face often with these because of the convenience. I&#x27;ve tried two other wipes similar to these--clean and clear, and Aveena.</li>
            <li> This is great product when I initially purchased it from the store. When I received it was already open. I didn&#x27;t want to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Like the cleansing towelettes that gets rid of make up in one swipe. This does it&#x27;s job but you will need more than one to get rid of all your make up.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get some of the negative reviews here. This is an oil-free product and it doesn&#x27;t claim to remove eye makeup. I don&#x27;t notice any problem with an alcohol smell or feel; I actually find they leave my skin feeling refreshed. I use a wipe as a pre-wash to get a major head start on removing my makeup before washing my face. I use a lot of makeup and due to my uber-oily skin I have to apply powder often throughout the day so removing all my makeup is no easy (or fun) task. Often I just don&#x27;t do it which just makes matters worse . These wipes, like all the others I&#x27;ve tried (which is a lot!), don&#x27;t remove everything, but if I wash my face without using a wipe first there is still makeup coming off on the cotton ball when I use my toner. So using a wipe allows me to not have to work as hard when I wash. Or as others said, if I&#x27;m too lazy too wash at least I can get a little cleaner by using a wipe. They&#x27;re a decent size and you can use both sides. I love that it&#x27;s oil-free because I produce enough oil on my own and do not need any more, thank you. I am still waiting for a wipe that will let me not have to wash my face but this may be asking for too much.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible acne breakout when I moved to the US and was struggling to find a cleanser for the night that would not make my face oily and itchy. I tried this from my sister when I visited her and loved it! The alcohol actually helped my acne a lot (disinfection, I guess) and I definitely saw an improvement for my skin. I had no itchy breakouts or redness on my face and use this every night. I use a different scrub/cleanser for the mornings. Like I said, works well for me...</li>
            <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> Refreshing and it works</li>
            <li> I can see how these would&#x27;ve helpful if you&#x27;re looking to freshen up from humid weather or after the gym but definitely not in place of taking off your makeup with cold cream or water and cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were very very irritating on my semi sensitive face...I&#x27;ve been looking for a quick makeup remover wipe for my non waterproof mascara and eyeliner. This didn&#x27;t get it off AND left my eyes stinging unbearably. I ended up washing my eyes and face with cleanser instead like I would have without these wipes. 30 minutes later and my cheeks and eye area are still red and irritated. I&#x27;m not sure if I had a weird reaction based on other reviews but personally I will not use these wipes again for a \\&quot;deep clean.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> smells really good and gets rid of all the make up. kind of burned my eyes a little bit but i usually rinse my face after i use any kind of make up remover so it was no big deal.</li>
            <li> Great Product, a little pricey, which the would offer larger size packages at a reduce rate.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup removal. I struggle with acne and I have been using these in the evening to remove my makeup. They don&#x27;t break my face out and remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> great for removing makeup from the face! works easily and quickly, deep cleans -- really feels cooling and clean. not irritating my sensitive skin at all. all the makeup really does come off, when I use my toner no more makeup comes off so it really is cleaning my skin very well and it makes my skin feel refreshed afterward. will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The solvent they use smells like the old Aquanet hair spray.  Very strong and unappealing.  When you wash your face, you should not smell like you just doused yourself with hair spray.  The regular product in the blue package smells much better and is an excellent product (for me anyway).</li>
            <li> great product by Neutrogena. Smell is not too harsh and does a great job removing make up</li>
            <li> These wipes do work, but you do have to scrub or wipe quite a bit to remove makeup, and there is a stinging effect after cleaning face, most likely from the alcohol. My face is dry too when I am done using the wipes. But they do remove a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother for removing make-up. Item works as advertised and I could only hope, that I had this product, during my playing days. Works like a charm on eye-black.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena product is one of the best oil-free makeup removers I have found on the market.  I love it, because it effectively removes my makeup, but does not cause my skin to break out. It is also a very gentle cleanser and does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Oily skin is simply irritating. Especially on hot, humid days, my face feels so clogged up and muggy. Although the label may say makeup remover, it works perfectly as a quick facial cleanser, leaving my skin feeling refreshed. These wipes do have trace amounts of salicylic acid - for you out there who might care.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  It cleans my face really well.  I recommend to all woman and Teens to help keep your face looking great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather lazy at washing my face, so this product is great at removing makeup at the end of the day when I&#x27;m too tired to wash it.  After using it for a while, I think it actually is doing a better job at cleaning my face than soap and water.  Super fast, super easy.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena deep clean oil free -  Theres an Unpleasant smell , otherwise product works great . Even my kids didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> the cost was basically the same as I can get in a storeâ€¦but it was nice not having to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I Received the item before the expecting day. Love the product. Really Cheap and has an excellent quality. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These wipes did a great job cleansing my face without leaving a residue. I could even use them to get off my eye makeup without it burning and stinging as long as I held my eyes tightly shut. They didn&#x27;t magically clear my skin completely, but that&#x27;s a lot to ask from such a convenient simple wipe. The package is small, doesn&#x27;t leak, and is very convenient. Although, it did trigger a search of my carry-on bag at the airport, because I didn&#x27;t think it counted as a liquid. The TSA people said I should have had it out in a big ziploc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem with this product is that I tried to \\&quot;subscribe &amp; save\\&quot; and have it shipped to me monthly for the last 3 months. It only actually came ONE time. The past 2 months it was \\&quot;delayed\\&quot; and never ended up coming, they just cancelled that month. Needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and will be buying these wipes at the store instead.</li>
            <li> I used these wipes on my week long trip to Europe. It was nice to be able to clean my face in the morning and at night after a long day without the hassle of face wash. The wipes have an odd smell to them, but all acne wash does. Regardless these did the trick, stayed moist and I will definitely use them again when I travel.</li>
            <li> While they clean pretty well, I can&#x27;t get past the smell! I hold my nose to use them - I will not be reordering these. I love Neutrogena products but this is a real miss.</li>
            <li> I want to say that these wipes are very good for the reason I use them.  I have Glucoma and the medicine that I put in my eyes 3-times a day leave a readue on my eye lids and since these pads are oil free that are just right to clean my eyelids.</li>
            <li> this product can be a little strong in smell but its not harsh on my skin. it removes water-proof make up very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a year, and, don&#x27;t know how I managed in the past without them.  They work very well removing my makeup.  I use the Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover Pads first, and, follow with the wipes.  I prefer the oil free.  I purchase these every month through Amazon.  Much better buy than in the stores, and, they are delivered to my door!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As ordered is a perfect review. Why? Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.</li>
            <li> These smell like rubbing alcohol, and nothing else. It stings slightly as I use the towelette on my face. I am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup. I will not buy again. These wipes leave my skin too dry. And the makeup still seems hard to remove with these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better! They seem better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product when traveling. Later, I purchased an additional package upon returning home. These cleansing wipes remove makeup remarkably well, including eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Smells like dog shampoo, made me want to wash my face after to to the disgusting smell off, i dont have a sensitive nose but this was horrible, do not buy the deep clean one! i love the original blue pack ones though</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  They always leave my face feeling completely clean and refreshed!  Living in Florida with all its heat and humidity, my face tends to get oily several times a day.  So, I just whip out one of these little cloths, and in just a few seconds, my face feels as clean as if I just took a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they smell great!!!  Love, love, love these little wipes!</li>
            <li> The wipes work well but I&#x27;m just not sure their worth my money. They work well on make-up but facial cleaners are just as good</li>
