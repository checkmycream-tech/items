            <li>I have natural hair, my hair smells great and is manageable to the touch.</li>
            <li>Worked best for when my hair was wet.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>

            <li>This is a good product on Peruvian hair keeps it bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li>it smells so good and leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>This product certainly adds more silicon to the hair follicle.</li>
            <li>It softens and detangles wet hair and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>After reading that silicone products are good for protecting hair against chlorine and salt water I picked up a bottle of this product from my local bss for my vacation.</li>
            <li>Overall, this does a good job but is no miracle worker.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave the product 4 stars becasue the smell is a bit strong but it wears off by day two and the smell is kinda nice afterwards.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, the first time I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>Helps with frizz and flyways, leaves hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft which I Love.  </li>
            <li>my love for this product is immeasurable... makes my weaves soft</li>
            <li>I also use the silicon mix deep treatment which is great as well, but the leave in just reinforces that the deep treatment does.</li>
            <li>Excellent results when added to my other regimen which includes other Dominican products.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product at the Dominican salon</li>
            <li>The bottle looks different and has a pull top</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than the other product I&#x27;d been using, but there are likely many other products equally as good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural but I&#x27;m not like the naturals that go around and hunt people down to tell them about their hair, we all have different hair textures, types etc, so do what works best for you and learn your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and bouncy with this one product that I had to buy it for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft, smooth and straight if used with hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this product and i have relaxed dry hair</li>
            <li>Heavy not as great as the silicon mix deep conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After going to a Domincan stylist my hair is in much better shape than I expected.  </li>
            <li>But the leave in really moisturizes and gets through to her knots &amp; tangles.   </li>
            <li>If too much product is used it leave the hair with a greasy feel and appearance.</li>
            <li>It also has a very chemically smell which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years &amp; find that it really conditions well.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t pull to much hair out..</li>
            <li>this is the only leave in conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, not to mention I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>It keeps her hair neat and seems to have proteins (keratin) that black hair needs to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>so idk how this product would function under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>This product worth double the price.</li>
            <li>This company delivers what it says it would and the prices are more than reasonable There are so many VERY expensive products in the market that just do not deliver the results</li>
            <li>Leaves a residue on hair and weighs hair down , so best to use when hair is wet to help keep in some moisture but not as an everyday hair dressing</li>
            <li>I have fine, fragile, hard to manage AA hair and this leaves my hair soft, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>my hair is still soft!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all natural and it has really brought my hair back to life</li>
            <li>I put about a quarter size in his hair and it drinks in the moisture and returns it to a soft curl.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of old lady lotion.</li>
            <li>So I was definitely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was also very sub par.</li>
            <li>and I use this on my natural hair as well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a naturally curly head girl.</li>
            <li>Smelled good but expensive for a leave in hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have straight blonde hair, if I use too much it makes my hair look wet or greasy</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find anything to make the matted, super dry, stretched out hair!</li>
            <li>My son washes his hair every day, which can be very drying especially with coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have very thick, highlighted blonde hair with low lights and it is color damaged, this leave in product has worked miracles on my hiar, I would highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Granted, I only applied it to wet hair and then hopped in the water and washed it out right after,</li>
            <li>This product is good,leaves my hair soft and the smell is so good,but I bought this 3 weeks ago for $5.80, 2 weeks later</li>
            <li>A dime sized amount is almost too much for my baby fine hair which is a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>and i just put a lil sample on my dry hair and it felt great and silky ill leave a riview when i use it while my hair is wet.</li>
            <li>But I reapplied it a second time and  decided to endure the smell, because it left my hair soft, which was what I hoped for.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it is a bad product, but also didn&#x27;t do anything super special for my hair.</li>
            <li> That is not a problem if you alternate after a month (use every other month).</li>
            <li> Also, because I only use a little, a bottle last me almost a year.</li>
            <li> I use this on my granddaughter&#x27;s very long hair (which I always immediately blow dry).  </li>
            <li> This product gives out fumes if you apply it and then blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all</li>
            <li> It does visibly cut down the appearance of split ends, broken and fly-away hairs, and leaves her hair much smoother and shinier.  </li>
            <li> I relaly like this product, I have curly slightly frizzy hair, and use this after washing my hair before I blow it out.</li>
            <li> I debated buying this because of some reviews I&#x27;d read which cautioned about the fumes if the hair wasn&#x27;t immediately blow dried, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> but I use a little as detangler and yum!</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and is past bra strap length</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the complaints are about.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too expensive now</li>
            <li> does NOTHING like it states, VERY unhappy</li>

            <li> Leaves a residue on hair and weighs hair down , so best to use when hair is wet to help keep in some moisture but not as an everyday hair dressing</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven!  Wish everything smelled this good. I have straight blonde hair, if I use too much it makes my hair look wet or greasy but I use a little as detangler and yum!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!! This product gives out fumes if you apply it and then blow dry your hair. Note that it has chemicals that break into formaldehyde which is a suspected carcinogenic. I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used.  After going to a Domincan stylist my hair is in much better shape than I expected.  I have fine, fragile, hard to manage AA hair and this leaves my hair soft, smooth and silky.  Excellent results when added to my other regimen which includes other Dominican products.</li>
            <li> This is a very good silicon hair conditioner. It smooths out the hair shaft and has a good scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this, since a friend recommended the conditioner.   I used both on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  They are awesome. But the leave in really moisturizes and gets through to her knots &amp; tangles.   I use it every day. It keeps her hair neat and seems to have proteins (keratin) that black hair needs to stay healthy. A great product and find.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at the Dominican salon I go to. They use this products when they rollerset my hair and after leaving the dryer my hair would feel like butter. My hair feels so soft and bouncy with this one product that I had to buy it for my own personal use. After some research I found out the name of the product and order it immediately. My hair is relaxed and is past bra strap length this is the only leave in conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, not to mention I am in love with the smell. This will be my staple leave in from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I would continue to buy and always have in my hair care products. I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for healthy hair items and this is one of my favorites. I&#x27;m natural but I&#x27;m not like the naturals that go around and hunt people down to tell them about their hair, we all have different hair textures, types etc, so do what works best for you and learn your hair. My hair love this and so does my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and i have relaxed dry hair</li>
            <li> You should try this and judge yourself. Stuck on this product like glue for over 5 years!</li>
            <li> i just got my leave in and i just put a lil sample on my dry hair and it felt great and silky ill leave a riview when i use it while my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, its everything I wanted in a Leave-in. I&#x27;m all natural and it has really brought my hair back to life it&#x27;s shines it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all and it&#x27;s very soft which I Love.  I will be ordering this product again 😊😊</li>
            <li> This product certainly adds more silicon to the hair follicle. A dime sized amount is almost too much for my baby fine hair which is a few inches past my shoulders. If too much product is used it leave the hair with a greasy feel and appearance. The Silicon Mix condition is much better.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is a great 1. This is my 1st time purchasing from the buyer and i placed my order on 3/2/11. It is now 3/7/11 and my package still hasn&#x27;t shipped.</li>
            <li> does NOTHING like it states, VERY unhappy</li>
            <li> I have used this leave in, twice.  It works fine, I didn&#x27;t get any fumes from the product.  The fragrance is a floral one.  I have natural hair, my hair smells great and is manageable to the touch.</li>
            <li> I like this product it makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, the first time I rinsed it out. But I reapplied it a second time and  decided to endure the smell, because it left my hair soft, which was what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Smelled good but expensive for a leave in hair conditioner.  I another conditioner that works just as well at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> This product is good,leaves my hair soft and the smell is so good,but I bought this 3 weeks ago for $5.80, 2 weeks later is $15,c&#x27;mon!!it&#x27;s just 8 oz,so plus shipping it&#x27;s way too expensive now,I better stay with Pantene pro V, good price,good product.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice smell and keeps my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> my love for this product is immeasurable... makes my weaves soft</li>
            <li> I am a recent transitioner (7 months) with 3c/4a roots and relaxed ends. After reading that silicone products are good for protecting hair against chlorine and salt water I picked up a bottle of this product from my local bss for my vacation. I can&#x27;t say that it is a bad product, but also didn&#x27;t do anything super special for my hair. Granted, I only applied it to wet hair and then hopped in the water and washed it out right after, so idk how this product would function under normal circumstances. It also has a very chemically smell which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several leave ins, and finally stopped once I began using this product. It softens and detangles wet hair and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Makes her hair look smooth and shinney</li>
            <li> Amazing what it did for my hair replacement system!!  will continue to buy and buy and buy, I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find anything to make the matted, super dry, stretched out hair!</li>
            <li> This product worth double the price. It is hard to find it in stores. I&#x27;m thankful I found it online. It leaves the hair soft, smooth and straight if used with hair dryer. The product can build-up after some time (probably because the proteins). That is not a problem if you alternate after a month (use every other month). Good for healthy hair and even better for dry or process hair. Just one thing keep in mind: Do NOT use too much or it gets sticky (heavy) in your hair. With a bit is enough. The smell is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years &amp; find that it really conditions well.  My son washes his hair every day, which can be very drying especially with coarse hair.  I put about a quarter size in his hair and it drinks in the moisture and returns it to a soft curl.  It is non greasy and has a nice smell.  Also, because I only use a little, a bottle last me almost a year.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea my hair dresser uses it. But unless your blowdrying/ straining it isnt very good. Has a VERY strong smell. Reminds me of old lady lotion. So I wasnt a fan.... didn&#x27;t help my wavy curly hair with its frizzy problem. So I was definitely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was also very sub par. Just some tape over the nozel made me wonder about the product inside the bottle. There was no factory seal on the product. Sketchy..... dont buy save ur $$$</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner it smells good and it de tangles my hair so I don&#x27;t pull to much hair out..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li> Heavy not as great as the silicon mix deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt leave hair shiny just didnt care for it at all.</li>
            <li> I used this product three days ago when I recieved it and my hair is still soft! The only reason I gave the product 4 stars becasue the smell is a bit strong but it wears off by day two and the smell is kinda nice afterwards.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks different and has a pull top but I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product on Peruvian hair keeps it bouncy and soft. Worked best for when my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the complaints are about. This company delivers what it says it would and the prices are more than reasonable There are so many VERY expensive products in the market that just do not deliver the results this one does&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x60;s wife</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see so much of a shine, but it does have a nice scent and it&#x27;s not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I relaly like this product, I have curly slightly frizzy hair, and use this after washing my hair before I blow it out. Helps with frizz and flyways, leaves hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I love love this leave in conditioner it smells so good and leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Oh Silicon Mix how I love you. I wear extensions and I use this on my natural hair as well. My hair texture is a 3B and I&#x27;m a naturally curly head girl. This baby defines my curls as well as my extensions and adds luster to create a sheen to my hair that is so amazing. I also use the silicon mix deep treatment which is great as well, but the leave in just reinforces that the deep treatment does. I have been using this product for about 3 years and I refuse to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Great great great. Love all of their products!!!!</li>
            <li> I debated buying this because of some reviews I&#x27;d read which cautioned about the fumes if the hair wasn&#x27;t immediately blow dried, but I decided to give it a try.  I use this on my granddaughter&#x27;s very long hair (which I always immediately blow dry).  It does visibly cut down the appearance of split ends, broken and fly-away hairs, and leaves her hair much smoother and shinier.  It does a better job than the other product I&#x27;d been using, but there are likely many other products equally as good.  Overall, this does a good job but is no miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Works great for us gray panthers!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have very thick, highlighted blonde hair with low lights and it is color damaged, this leave in product has worked miracles on my hiar, I would highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
