            <li> The bottles of nail polish are pretty small and they don&#x27;t last long on your nails.</li>
            <li> Dryer takes about two minutes to surface dry polish.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish was little small, not to much to work with</li>
            <li> My granddaughters are enjoying it, but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> She recommends for other tweens experimenting with colors.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s all dried up or what.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with this kit.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing for my 6 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> The girls like the nail polish but had no patience to wait for drying (which was very slow).  </li>
            <li> I think she played with it twice before it got pushed to the corner with all the other crap toys.</li>
            <li> Just blows out cold hair - while you press it with your hand.</li>
            <li> The polish that comes with it is water based - so it washes off and looks bad in about an hour.</li>
            <li> Hate to give a bad review, but this is just a bad toy.</li>
            <li> This was not a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; product, and I am extremely disappointed..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I love it I bought it for my 12 year old   and she and her friends loves it very  very much.</li>
            <li> Dryer will not work. Had to return item. No replacement offered. Very cheaply made item. Expected better quality item for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my 6 yrs. old granddaughter for Christmas, she loves it. She loves to paint her nails and nails of her friends.</li>
            <li> My 10-year-old granddaughter says: I like all the nail polish that comes with it and I like the stickers and I like the fan thing.</li>
            <li> It was more like a toy. Definitely for young girls maybe 8 &amp; younger. Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t work. Not sure if it&#x27;s all dried up or what. The nail dryer is ok. Just blows out cold hair - while you press it with your hand. Pretty disappointed with this kit.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is sub-par, but my 6 year-old daughter does not seem to mind. Definitely brings smiles to their faces.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old loves this set. There are lots of colors to experiment with although the bottles are pretty small. It is a good starter set of nail polishes perfect for Tweens.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> If you have a girly girl, this is an amazing buy, and hours of entertainment for the little ones that love to play nails</li>

            <li> I gave it as a gift. I have not heard any complaints, but I haven&#x27;t heard any good coments either.</li>
            <li> Of all the nail polishes that were included, only the yellow one was usable.  This was very disappointing for my 6 year old granddaughter. This was not a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; product, and I am extremely disappointed..</li>
            <li> We ordered this for our niece&#x27;s birthday and when she received it the nail polish in the kit was old and goopy and non-usable. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was little small, not to much to work with so if this is a gift I would suggect getting some extra polish. Other wish its a nice little gift for a growning little girl.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old granddaughter had hours and hours of fun with this gift.  She gave manicures and pedicures to herself, her sister and several cousins and an aunt.  She even had a list of girlfriends lined up for when she returned home.</li>
            <li> Cute little kit, but really not worth the price.  My granddaughters are enjoying it, but I was disappointed.  Expected it to be more substantial.</li>

            <li> She likes bright colors and finishing accessories.  Dryer takes about two minutes to surface dry polish.  She recommends for other tweens experimenting with colors.</li>

            <li> My cousin is about 13 and just starting to get into the more girly aspects of life. This kit is going to make a great Christmas gift. It probably doesn&#x27;t have the best polish or stick on nails, but it is enough to get her started and last until she knows what she&#x27;s doing. The package came quickly and looked like pictured, so no complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my neices birthday who turned 11.. She initially loved it and I thought it was ok.... They dryer is a great addition allthough the polish itself is alittle cheap....</li>
