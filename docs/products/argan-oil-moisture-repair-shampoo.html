            <li>perfect love it wish it had plastic over the bottle entrance otherwise</li>

            <li>I had a pleasant experience with this shampoo .</li>
            <li>Smells *amazing*, and is a great conditioner if you want &amp;#34;silky-soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>&quot; hair isn&#x27;t good.   </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair smelling good too</li>
            <li>Though SF, it still lathers well, which was surprising.</li>
            <li>the smell is kinda musky in a good way.</li>
            <li>Good for color treated hair</li>
            <li>not as good as I thought</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo on a whim because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li>is good.</li>
            <li>Cashier told me that its a very popular product and is amazing.</li>
            <li>And, best thing is, for a fine quality Shampoo and Conditioner, the price is right too!!!</li>
            <li>Its rare that I recommend or am impressed with a shampoo-</li>
            <li>Its got that great Moroccan oil scent to it which I love, just perfumed a smidgen lighter than the</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is wonderful and lather&#x27;s well as the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate is a great substitute for sulfates and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair&#x27;s natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more for my money!</li>
            <li>But the benefits outweigh that factor; I will continue using it and glad I found it!</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely amazing, smells very exotic.</li>
            <li>Partnered with the conditioner, I love my hair again!</li>
            <li>When applying it, I can already feel it is going to make my hair better, and it does!</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Fragrance is pleasant, and leaves the hair very clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used Agadir products for 2 months straight after my Keratin Treatment, and my hair was the best.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair nice after shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>The treatment spray however is awesome, works great on dry hair and control the frizz.</li>
            <li>As soon as I get more cash, i am going to buy and keep a huge stockpile!!</li>
            <li>This is by far on of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, leaves hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>It felt soft immediately, and the smell is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wash with lot&#x27;s of lather and your hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>First of, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I have very light platinum</li>
            <li>I like the nice and strong smell</li>
            <li>Shampoo works like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Cheaper drug store brands seem better to me than this.  </li>
            <li>also it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo hydrates and it also gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this repair shampoo</li>
            <li>Maybe I won&#x27;t have to get so many split ends chopped off.</li>
            <li>Love everything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>more $$$ brands.</li>
            <li>LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and the conditioner from Ulta and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>And I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Was not too sure about it</li>
            <li>and I am officially in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more earthy/sensual.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great price, quality and very convenient.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair felt after just one use.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and smells like a tropical fruit.</li>
            <li>I went to Sally&#x27;s and was eying this product but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li>Go with Argan oil for sure.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is ok.....</li>
            <li>This product has wonderful moisturizing properties and leaves hair clean and silky soft.</li>
            <li>i  think its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Awesome does it&#x27;s job and takes your hair to a whole new level and makes it feel great and fresh and clean</li>
            <li>but when is dry it is perfect!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner is excellent for dry hair.</li>
            <li>The best sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; the only one I will ever use!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is sulfate, paraben, and phosphate free.</li>
            <li>But certainly not the best.</li>
            <li>Sent is a bit strong and it takes a bit more than normal for me to get a good lather</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give it a couple more uses before I&#x27;ll know if it as good as the New Zealand product.  </li>
            <li>Found a product while in New Zealand that is made with the argan and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it with the conditioner and the treatment oil , they work just fine for me .</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite&#x27;s were the oil leave in treatment (LOVE IT!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of shampoo and conditioner available at the drug store as well as the no shampoo baking soda and vinegar route.  </li>
            <li>but I read that happens when you switch to Sulfate Free products either way</li>
            <li>These products smell amazing too, they have a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li>But I was intrigued by the fact it was an affordable Argan oil cleanser and also sulfate free.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil has been the best find for my hair - really helps condition it without turning it into flat, overconditioned hair</li>
            <li>Once I switched to a sulfate free shampoo the very FIRST shampoo I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to help remove a gummy texture from my roots.</li>
            <li>I tried Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo and Conditioner and, although it seemed to be okay at first, my hair stopped liking it.</li>
            <li>Certainly the highest quality and most affordable argan oil line available.</li>
            <li>Hair never feels as clean as it should.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed anything special</li>
            <li>but once I have the right amount it lathers well!</li>
            <li>I used Wen Hair Care products before this and wen hair care was also very good, but it was just too heavy.</li>
            <li>Made my hair INCREDIBLY soft and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>so I could dye it a bright blue.</li>
            <li>It may be OK for some people but is didn&#x27;t seemed to do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Gave my hair a healthy look, even though it was very damaged because of years of abuse.</li>
            <li>A true find.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>So far it is nice</li>
            <li>By itself it&#x27;s a good shampoo, gets your hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to regular shampoo again, this is the BEST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>One month down, and my hair is still feeling GREAT.</li>
            <li>My hair just feels cleaner when I use One n&#x27; Only and, in turn, I feel better!</li>
            <li>Hair feels, smells and IS more lush!</li>
            <li>I bought this product in hopes that it would make my dry, damaged, color treated hair, more healthy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and someone told me the other day my hair smelled good.  </li>
            <li>I did not think it was possible for a product to have this effect on my hair as it&#x27;s always been a hassle to get it to look nice</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but wow, did my hair keep on smelling.</li>
            <li>My hair is way more shiny and soft after using this ( coming from grocery store shampoos).</li>
            <li>Love it, hair so soft and shiny and</li>
            <li>It contains no sulfur (which is great for African Americans) and it does not strip your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this product was the smell.  </li>
            <li>This line cleanses without stripping, leaves hair smelling delicious and is very economical in price and in how much a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come to realize my friend was right</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner my hair was extremely soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>but after trying this shampoo and conditioner, it brought my healthy hair back!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>When my ears started turning red, I suspected my shampoo and switched to Aubrey products that I like much, much more.</li>
            <li>Love the One N&#x27; Only line.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the shampoo</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks once I realized that it was the shampoo, I used loreal 5 in 1 damage control shampoo and my hair instantly started feeling better.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at Sally Beauty Supply, but found it on here for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li>First time trying this product and seller</li>
            <li>It makes hair nice and soft, especially hair that has been damaged!</li>
            <li>Since switching, not only does my hair feel much softer, it&#x27;s shiny and healthy again.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it worked well to clean my hair and scalp, plus it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to help my color treatment last longer or stay more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo isn&#x27;t quite as strong as the conditioner and the scent will linger the next day.</li>
            <li>I went into Sally&#x27;s and bought the large 33 oz bottle for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier now</li>
            <li>This shampoo has really helped with that.</li>
            <li>So I decided to use Sulfate Free and ONLY argan oil products.</li>
            <li>me try something else that&#x27;s Sulfate Free and has argan oil.&amp;#34; Came across One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil products</li>
            <li>Likewise I do not shampoo very often;</li>
            <li>and my whole head perhaps</li>
            <li>Argan oil is very beneficial in adding moisture to skin an hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Using the purple shampoo alone is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t lather much and my hair felt like straw when I was done washing it.  </li>
            <li>and it was MUCH softer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, and shiny, and got that healthy looking/ feel back again!</li>
            <li>I kind of got thrown off at first because it was a lot heavier than my normal shampoo, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the junk in it that makes ordinary shampoo sudsy.</li>
            <li>moisturizes better than other shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Loreal yellow container super moisturizing conditioner once a week, and my hair feels VERY silky smoooth.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased the One &#x27;n Only Shampoo; appears to be a very good product with no appearance of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>(I will be reviewing them as well), and very pleased with the results, I went back and purchased the shampoo and other items in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so nice to find a shampoo that has such a refreshing smell, I&#x27;m so tired of all the drugstore shampoo scents.</li>
            <li>It did the opposite, after every use, my hair got more and more dry and rough.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and totally frizz free.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my hair has been going through some changes.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, as I like the oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the argan oil leave in treatment.</li>
            <li>so far it is working good, especially using it with the Jamaican black castor oil protein hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>Within three weeks of using this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner and the hair mask, my hair is straight, shiny, ridiculously soft.  </li>
            <li>It felt like concrete</li>
            <li>For women, it might be better, but this product is heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li>In fact, it feels more as though I just conditioned without it being heavy and weighing.</li>
            <li>I follow up with the hydrating hair mask from this line on the days I use a purple shampoo or just the normal conditioner from the line and let it sit for 5 minutes if I just use the normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing shampoo ,thick lather and shiny hair when it is dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spending a chunk of my paycheck on Wen every month for the past couple years because I haven&#x27;t been able to find something in the store that doesn&#x27;t strip my wavy hair and make brittle, frizzy and poofy....until this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and we as consumers only have an association with lather as clean where others say the later helps to move dirt.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the conditioner, not crazy about it, I have dry hair</li>
            <li>I started noticing that my hair seemed to be very oily by the second day.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is extremely sensitive to sulfates.</li>
            <li>have used this shampoo twice so far.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, and I have an extremely sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend to people who already have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp, and this works well.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and try Suave Professional Keratin Infusion.</li>
            <li>I switched to another shampoo to help with this and switched back after a few uses and things seem to be ok.     </li>
            <li>, I almost felt my hair was a little dry the first time I used it, but by the third time I was in love.  </li>
            <li>At first, it did seem to help with my dry hair (along with the conditioner), but I was concerned about my allergies.  </li>
            <li>It definitely leaves the hair hydrated and super soft after use, although when you rinse it your hair feels dry for some reason (which I have gotten before/similar to using protein s &amp; c&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>The only drawback I see is that while sulfphate free, I am not a fan of a lot of the other ingredients in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>No tight scalp, no flakes and no overly oily scalp.   </li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and tend to alternate between dry and wet shampoo... using this once a week in my rotation works for my head!</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m in love with One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner I&#x27;m not completely in love with the Shampoo.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommend all of the One n Only products!</li>
            <li>every winter I have to wear my hair back, because the static is so bad, but when I use this line, I don&#x27;t the static problem</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t so much comment on if it creates frizz or not being that I used it in conjunction with the daily one n only argan conditioner, topped off by leave in oil and a curl control product.</li>
            <li>when i received the item,30% shampoo spill all over the package and whole thing was sticky.i had to wash thoroughly to get rid of shampoo from outside of the bottle.but overall product</li>
            <li>Recently bought Suave Professional Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Also the smell of this stuff is crazy good imho.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell false like so many do.</li>
            <li>Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it.</li>
            <li>--that it was this shampoo breaking my hair, drying it out and making it hard, as there was a significant difference in my hair after one wash with another</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every penny and it last me a long time, a little really does go a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to shave my already short hair style completely off to get my hair back.</li>
            <li>Since I switched from regular drug store hair products to One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil hair products my hair has completely transformed.</li>
            <li>Pretty round curls</li>
            <li>Less frizz and much easier to control.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is way too gentle, it does not clean your hair.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo (and the conditioner) are both great products!  </li>
            <li> I felt compelled to review this product as it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I get the best of both worlds.         </li>
            <li> It no longer looks  washed out and has brilliant shine!!  </li>
            <li> This is awesome</li>
            <li> all of them are excellent products</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> At any rate, this was an excellent cleanser which didn&#x27;t strip and added buckets of softness.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because it has a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the conditioner and oil treatment are awesome as well.</li>
            <li> And again, SMELLS wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff !!!</li>

            <li> My hair has felt softer and had a great shine to it and has even been keeping it&#x27;s style longer.  </li>
            <li> It smells great too.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this shampoo is so soothing, not to mention the great treatment it gives ones hair.  </li>
            <li> It looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Shampoo, Conditioner, mousse and oil and they all work great.</li>
            <li> My hair was great.</li>
            <li> (Also, I follow this up with the Agadir Argon Oil spray, which is also great.)</li>
            <li> #34;chick shampoo&amp;#34; LOL.</li>
            <li> it smells great.</li>

            <li> Im selling the rest of my Wen to my friend LOL</li>
            <li> Product was great.</li>
            <li> Very kind to tinted hair.</li>
            <li> perfect love it wish it had plastic over the bottle entrance otherwise</li>
            <li> , I thought this would be a great product to use since it&#x27;s sulfate-free and also supposedly good for color-treated</li>
            <li> I had a pleasant experience with this shampoo .</li>
            <li> Smells *amazing*, and is a great conditioner if you want &amp;#34;silky-soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> &quot; hair isn&#x27;t good.   </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair smelling good too</li>
            <li> Though SF, it still lathers well, which was surprising.</li>
            <li> the smell is kinda musky in a good way.</li>
            <li> Good for color treated hair</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo on a whim because it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> is good.</li>
            <li> Cashier told me that its a very popular product and is amazing.</li>
            <li> And, best thing is, for a fine quality Shampoo and Conditioner, the price is right too!!!</li>
            <li> Its rare that I recommend or am impressed with a shampoo-</li>
            <li> Its got that great Moroccan oil scent to it which I love, just perfumed a smidgen lighter than the</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is wonderful and lather&#x27;s well as the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate is a great substitute for sulfates and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair&#x27;s natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more for my money!</li>
            <li> But the benefits outweigh that factor; I will continue using it and glad I found it!</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely amazing, smells very exotic.</li>
            <li> Partnered with the conditioner, I love my hair again!</li>
            <li> When applying it, I can already feel it is going to make my hair better, and it does!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is pleasant, and leaves the hair very clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used Agadir products for 2 months straight after my Keratin Treatment, and my hair was the best.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair nice after shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!!</li>
            <li> The treatment spray however is awesome, works great on dry hair and control the frizz.</li>
            <li> As soon as I get more cash, i am going to buy and keep a huge stockpile!!</li>
            <li> This is by far on of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> It felt soft immediately, and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wash with lot&#x27;s of lather and your hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> First of, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I have very light platinum</li>
            <li> I like the nice and strong smell</li>
            <li> Shampoo works like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> Cheaper drug store brands seem better to me than this.  </li>
            <li> also it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo hydrates and it also gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love this repair shampoo</li>
            <li> Maybe I won&#x27;t have to get so many split ends chopped off.</li>
            <li> Love everything I have tried.  </li>
            <li> more $$$ brands.</li>
            <li> LOVE.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner from Ulta and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> And I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Was not too sure about it</li>
            <li> and I am officially in love with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more earthy/sensual.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair felt after just one use.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and smells like a tropical fruit.</li>
            <li> I went to Sally&#x27;s and was eying this product but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li> Go with Argan oil for sure.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is ok.....</li>
            <li> This product has wonderful moisturizing properties and leaves hair clean and silky soft.</li>
            <li> i  think its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome does it&#x27;s job and takes your hair to a whole new level and makes it feel great and fresh and clean</li>
            <li> but when is dry it is perfect!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is excellent for dry hair.</li>
            <li> The best sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; the only one I will ever use!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is sulfate, paraben, and phosphate free.</li>
            <li> But certainly not the best.</li>
            <li> Sent is a bit strong and it takes a bit more than normal for me to get a good lather</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give it a couple more uses before I&#x27;ll know if it as good as the New Zealand product.  </li>
            <li> Found a product while in New Zealand that is made with the argan and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the conditioner and the treatment oil , they work just fine for me .</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite&#x27;s were the oil leave in treatment (LOVE IT!)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of shampoo and conditioner available at the drug store as well as the no shampoo baking soda and vinegar route.  </li>
            <li> but I read that happens when you switch to Sulfate Free products either way</li>
            <li> These products smell amazing too, they have a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li> But I was intrigued by the fact it was an affordable Argan oil cleanser and also sulfate free.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil has been the best find for my hair - really helps condition it without turning it into flat, overconditioned hair</li>
            <li> Once I switched to a sulfate free shampoo the very FIRST shampoo I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased it to help remove a gummy texture from my roots.</li>
            <li> I tried Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo and Conditioner and, although it seemed to be okay at first, my hair stopped liking it.</li>
            <li> Certainly the highest quality and most affordable argan oil line available.</li>
            <li> Hair never feels as clean as it should.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything special</li>
            <li> but once I have the right amount it lathers well!</li>
            <li> I used Wen Hair Care products before this and wen hair care was also very good, but it was just too heavy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair INCREDIBLY soft and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> so I could dye it a bright blue.</li>
            <li> It may be OK for some people but is didn&#x27;t seemed to do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Gave my hair a healthy look, even though it was very damaged because of years of abuse.</li>
            <li> A true find.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> So far it is nice</li>
            <li> By itself it&#x27;s a good shampoo, gets your hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular shampoo again, this is the BEST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> One month down, and my hair is still feeling GREAT.</li>
            <li> My hair just feels cleaner when I use One n&#x27; Only and, in turn, I feel better!</li>
            <li> Hair feels, smells and IS more lush!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would make my dry, damaged, color treated hair, more healthy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and someone told me the other day my hair smelled good.  </li>
            <li> I did not think it was possible for a product to have this effect on my hair as it&#x27;s always been a hassle to get it to look nice</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but wow, did my hair keep on smelling.</li>
            <li> My hair is way more shiny and soft after using this ( coming from grocery store shampoos).</li>
            <li> Love it, hair so soft and shiny and</li>
            <li> It contains no sulfur (which is great for African Americans) and it does not strip your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this product was the smell.  </li>
            <li> This line cleanses without stripping, leaves hair smelling delicious and is very economical in price and in how much a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to realize my friend was right</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner my hair was extremely soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> but after trying this shampoo and conditioner, it brought my healthy hair back!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> When my ears started turning red, I suspected my shampoo and switched to Aubrey products that I like much, much more.</li>
            <li> Love the One N&#x27; Only line.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the shampoo</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks once I realized that it was the shampoo, I used loreal 5 in 1 damage control shampoo and my hair instantly started feeling better.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Sally Beauty Supply, but found it on here for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and seller</li>
            <li> It makes hair nice and soft, especially hair that has been damaged!</li>
            <li> Since switching, not only does my hair feel much softer, it&#x27;s shiny and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it worked well to clean my hair and scalp, plus it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to help my color treatment last longer or stay more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t quite as strong as the conditioner and the scent will linger the next day.</li>
            <li> I went into Sally&#x27;s and bought the large 33 oz bottle for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier now</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really helped with that.</li>
            <li> So I decided to use Sulfate Free and ONLY argan oil products.</li>
            <li> me try something else that&#x27;s Sulfate Free and has argan oil.&amp;#34; Came across One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil products</li>
            <li> Likewise I do not shampoo very often;</li>
            <li> and my whole head perhaps</li>
            <li> Argan oil is very beneficial in adding moisture to skin an hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Using the purple shampoo alone is VERY drying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lather much and my hair felt like straw when I was done washing it.  </li>
            <li> and it was MUCH softer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft, and shiny, and got that healthy looking/ feel back again!</li>
            <li> I kind of got thrown off at first because it was a lot heavier than my normal shampoo, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the junk in it that makes ordinary shampoo sudsy.</li>
            <li> moisturizes better than other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Loreal yellow container super moisturizing conditioner once a week, and my hair feels VERY silky smoooth.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the One &#x27;n Only Shampoo; appears to be a very good product with no appearance of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> (I will be reviewing them as well), and very pleased with the results, I went back and purchased the shampoo and other items in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so nice to find a shampoo that has such a refreshing smell, I&#x27;m so tired of all the drugstore shampoo scents.</li>
            <li> It did the opposite, after every use, my hair got more and more dry and rough.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and totally frizz free.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my hair has been going through some changes.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I like the oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the argan oil leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> so far it is working good, especially using it with the Jamaican black castor oil protein hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Within three weeks of using this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner and the hair mask, my hair is straight, shiny, ridiculously soft.  </li>
            <li> It felt like concrete</li>
            <li> For women, it might be better, but this product is heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> In fact, it feels more as though I just conditioned without it being heavy and weighing.</li>
            <li> I follow up with the hydrating hair mask from this line on the days I use a purple shampoo or just the normal conditioner from the line and let it sit for 5 minutes if I just use the normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing shampoo ,thick lather and shiny hair when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a chunk of my paycheck on Wen every month for the past couple years because I haven&#x27;t been able to find something in the store that doesn&#x27;t strip my wavy hair and make brittle, frizzy and poofy....until this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and we as consumers only have an association with lather as clean where others say the later helps to move dirt.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the conditioner, not crazy about it, I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I started noticing that my hair seemed to be very oily by the second day.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is extremely sensitive to sulfates.</li>
            <li> have used this shampoo twice so far.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and I have an extremely sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to people who already have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp, and this works well.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and try Suave Professional Keratin Infusion.</li>
            <li> I switched to another shampoo to help with this and switched back after a few uses and things seem to be ok.     </li>
            <li> , I almost felt my hair was a little dry the first time I used it, but by the third time I was in love.  </li>
            <li> At first, it did seem to help with my dry hair (along with the conditioner), but I was concerned about my allergies.  </li>
            <li> It definitely leaves the hair hydrated and super soft after use, although when you rinse it your hair feels dry for some reason (which I have gotten before/similar to using protein s &amp; c&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> The only drawback I see is that while sulfphate free, I am not a fan of a lot of the other ingredients in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> No tight scalp, no flakes and no overly oily scalp.   </li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and tend to alternate between dry and wet shampoo... using this once a week in my rotation works for my head!</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m in love with One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner I&#x27;m not completely in love with the Shampoo.   </li>
            <li> Highly recommend all of the One n Only products!</li>
            <li> every winter I have to wear my hair back, because the static is so bad, but when I use this line, I don&#x27;t the static problem</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t so much comment on if it creates frizz or not being that I used it in conjunction with the daily one n only argan conditioner, topped off by leave in oil and a curl control product.</li>
            <li> when i received the item,30% shampoo spill all over the package and whole thing was sticky.i had to wash thoroughly to get rid of shampoo from outside of the bottle.but overall product</li>
            <li> Recently bought Suave Professional Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Also the smell of this stuff is crazy good imho.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell false like so many do.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it.</li>
            <li> --that it was this shampoo breaking my hair, drying it out and making it hard, as there was a significant difference in my hair after one wash with another</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every penny and it last me a long time, a little really does go a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to shave my already short hair style completely off to get my hair back.</li>
            <li> Since I switched from regular drug store hair products to One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil hair products my hair has completely transformed.</li>
            <li> Pretty round curls</li>
            <li> Less frizz and much easier to control.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is way too gentle, it does not clean your hair.</li>
            <li> Recently, it has become dry, coarse, and felt dehydrated.</li>
            <li> The last time I went to the salon, my hair was hard and had so much breakage that I had to get my hair cut short.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 something caucasian guy with dark soft medium curls.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and it tames it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I see a big difference and will never go back to other brands</li>
            <li> beside the mascara is very good, this shampoo is the worst thing i ever tryed...is just bad!i gave for a friend to try, since i was thinkyng</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two months in and as long as my hair stays in this condition, I&#x27;m a life-long user...</li>
            <li> My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is usually semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s made, I will never use another.</li>
            <li> I mean my hair was really fried.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, and this product has turned me off to trying other products from the same line.</li>
            <li> If you have had to deal with damaged, dry and frizzy hair as I have once had to then you&#x27;ll understand why I do this.     </li>
            <li> I have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, puffy hair</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Given that my hair was damaged and already dry and prone to breakage</li>
            <li> Since my hair was already dry, it didn&#x27;t occur to me that it was this shampoo that could be the culprit of a worsening problem.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something to help your dry, damage, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think that such a tiny amount would be enough for my thick, long, multiracial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black and I&#x27;m a Caucasion mix Asian heritage</li>
            <li> after all, shampoos are simply cleansers, so typically the benefits they tote are negated by the fact they are made to take AWAY from hair, NOT at anything to it.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick, mid-back length hair that gets pretty dried out from driving topless.</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to my Nexxus Humectress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: African-American, relaxed, thick and coarse with natural very tight curl pattern.</li>
            <li> My hair has been very dry from medications and this shampoo (and conditioner) was a blessing.  </li>
            <li> The only purpose for sulfates in our shampoos is to allow the shampoo to lather, especially for those who have hard water.  </li>
            <li> The last two times my hair was colored, the wrong developer was used and too much color was stripped.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have with this shampoo is that I have to use a bit to get to my scalp and entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> you need to get use to the feeling that it leaves when your hair is wet</li>
            <li> My husband has thicker hair with a lot of body that he doesn&#x27;t wash everyday, and he especially likes this shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you do too, and you know how your hair feels when it gets wet while you had on hairspray, well that&#x27;s how you will feel when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I did the porosity test (placing strand in water to see if it sinks).</li>
            <li> but it dried her hair out, that her son recently used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say I either loved it or hated it, but I&#x27;m somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> Each cost around $5 at WalMart and my hair felt soft and less frizzy than it usual does.  </li>
            <li> have been coloring my hair for roughly 31 years due to getting greys at 11.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 43 and have hard water, so age and minerals make my hair less than soft) silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Coarse, curly, thick, dry, waist length]</li>
            <li> and  I don’t even have to use other products in my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other chemicals in my hair; shampoo, conditioner and argan oil, and I was out the door.</li>
            <li> Was searching for Argan oil to see if it was any cheaper purchasing online and stumbled upon this company&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I use it about every other time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, within the first two months of use my hair was softer and bouncier after use.  </li>
            <li> my hair felt a little dry</li>
            <li> After I rinsed out the conditioner my hair was easier to comb through and blow dry with little to no shedding or breakage.</li>
            <li> but, alas, every two months I have to go in and have all my new growth whacked off due to split ends.</li>
            <li> Usually I wash my hair every other day but after a few weeks of using the One &#x60;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo</li>
            <li> The last two months my hair stylists said my hair felt hard to them.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> That means that essentials are being washed down the drain IMHO.</li>
            <li> I feel like it took the life out of my hair rather than the other way around!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t improve the health of my hair at all, and may have even damaged it a little due to overdrying.  </li>
            <li> my have is much less frizzy when it dries.</li>
            <li> That started my journey in locating hair care products that would restore my hair to its previous state.</li>
            <li> I also have about 50% less split ends for the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> No itchy, tight scalp.</li>
            <li> and i have a hard time with the ends always being dry and course.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has thick frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> The problem I have is the shampoo can be a bit heavy for my hair and every once in a while I need to switch to another brand to help with this.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, be prepared for a few days of perfumed hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I bought a few from the line, but this review will be for the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it also dried his hair</li>
            <li> and although there still is a little frizz it is cut at least in half.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my long and tired hair</li>
            <li> I should have bought the small one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was my hair hard but it was also difficult to curl with an iron, was hard after blow drying, and was rock-hard after roller setting.  </li>
            <li> I can usually tell when my hair starts to feel oily and dirty with in the second day after I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair lost a lot of curl and was dull and not silky like with the Aubrey products.  </li>
            <li> Desperation forced me to try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the shampoo-my hair is mid-back and rather thick.</li>
            <li> Hey their unfortunately yes i have to give to thumbs down on this product</li>
            <li> well until I decided to order Wen online recently, not a good idea.</li>
            <li> After a bad bleach job my damaged hair went from pretty bouncy curls to loose frizzy waves and at its worst stick strait straw-like hair.</li>
            <li> everytime I showered with this and the conditioner no more!!</li>
            <li> It gets really thick when it&#x27;s cold (or even cooler weather), and it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I did, it just seemed to get worse.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the cleansing shampoos and home remedies, but these thing have only made my hair worse and did not remove the tar/gummy crap in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so close to cutting my hair short, it was that bad!</li>
            <li> For years I had horrible dry and oily dandruff, break outs on my scalp and even bleeding until I found the culprit is the sulfates in our shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I got my hair bleached and my hair was black at the time, and after it got bleached it was awful texture, didn&#x27;t shine, and was frizzy/ puffy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wildly crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> that could be bad just for my hair, but she said she hate it..</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> and I hated that squeak feeling after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> you need to get use to the feeling that it leaves when your hair is wet but when is dry it is perfect! the softest hair you have ever experience. I like the nice and strong smell</li>
            <li> perfect love it wish it had plastic over the bottle entrance otherwise everything else was great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! The best sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; the only one I will ever use! Moisturizes &amp; softens my 4b relaxed hair every time.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the One &#x27;n Only Shampoo; appears to be a very good product with no appearance of harsh chemicals. Fragrance is pleasant, and leaves the hair very clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo (and the conditioner) are both great products!  My hair has felt softer and had a great shine to it and has even been keeping it&#x27;s style longer.  All this after using it for only 2 weeks.  I wasn&#x27;t wildly crazy about the scent but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and someone told me the other day my hair smelled good.  I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works like most shampoos. Haven&#x27;t noticed anything special but I do like it and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I do not care for this.  It may be OK for some people but is didn&#x27;t seemed to do much for my hair.  Cheaper drug store brands seem better to me than this.  I feel like it took the life out of my hair rather than the other way around!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t read or understand all the ingredients.  That aside, I would say that this shampoo works for the entire family and we always keep a bottle in rotation.  My husband has thicker hair with a lot of body that he doesn&#x27;t wash everyday, and he especially likes this shampoo. I have fine straight hair and tend to alternate between dry and wet shampoo... using this once a week in my rotation works for my head!</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to review this product as it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have about 30\\&quot; of wavy frizzy damaged brown hair.  Within three weeks of using this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner and the hair mask, my hair is straight, shiny, ridiculously soft.  It is multi-tonal and I&#x27;d guess 80% of my split ends have reversed.  I did not think it was possible for a product to have this effect on my hair as it&#x27;s always been a hassle to get it to look nice and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of shampoo and conditioner available at the drug store as well as the no shampoo baking soda and vinegar route.  I&#x27;m two months in and as long as my hair stays in this condition, I&#x27;m a life-long user...also it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> i  think its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m in love with One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Conditioner I&#x27;m not completely in love with the Shampoo.   The shampoo is wonderful and lather&#x27;s well as the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate is a great substitute for sulfates and it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair&#x27;s natural oils.  \\&quot;Squeaky clean\\&quot; hair isn&#x27;t good.   The problem I have is the shampoo can be a bit heavy for my hair and every once in a while I need to switch to another brand to help with this.  I can usually tell when my hair starts to feel oily and dirty with in the second day after I washed my hair.  No I do not wash my hair every day and yes I do shower daily.   If you have had to deal with damaged, dry and frizzy hair as I have once had to then you&#x27;ll understand why I do this.     Usually I wash my hair every other day but after a few weeks of using the One &#x60;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo I started noticing that my hair seemed to be very oily by the second day.  I switched to another shampoo to help with this and switched back after a few uses and things seem to be ok.     My scalp is extremely sensitive to sulfates. For years I had horrible dry and oily dandruff, break outs on my scalp and even bleeding until I found the culprit is the sulfates in our shampoos.  Dandruff shampoos were not helping because they all contained sulfates.  Once I switched to a sulfate free shampoo the very FIRST shampoo I noticed a huge difference.  No dandruff.  No tight scalp, no flakes and no overly oily scalp.   The only purpose for sulfates in our shampoos is to allow the shampoo to lather, especially for those who have hard water.  It&#x27;s debatable whether lathering is actually needed in a cleaner. Some people feel it&#x27;s not and we as consumers only have an association with lather as clean where others say the later helps to move dirt.  I&#x27;m with those who feel it&#x27;s not needed but with the Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate in this shampoo I get the best of both worlds.         My hair type in case anyone wants to compare is usually semi coarse , thick, with a natural wave and once prone to frizzing. It&#x27;s black and I&#x27;m a Caucasion mix Asian heritage</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have fine hair. This shampoo hydrates and it also gives my hair more volume. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I found this after I saw my sister using it I&#x27;ve had problems with my hair coming out everytime I showered with this and the conditioner no more!! It leaves the hair smelling good too I see a big difference and will never go back to other brands</li>
            <li> This stuff smells DIVINE! It makes hair nice and soft, especially hair that has been damaged! I kind of got thrown off at first because it was a lot heavier than my normal shampoo, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the junk in it that makes ordinary shampoo sudsy. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I got my hair bleached and my hair was black at the time, and after it got bleached it was awful texture, didn&#x27;t shine, and was frizzy/ puffy. I cried for three days cause I thought I ruined my hair.. but after trying this shampoo and conditioner, it brought my healthy hair back! it&#x27;s soft, and shiny, and got that healthy looking/ feel back again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 something caucasian guy with dark soft medium curls. This is by far on of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever found. It also seems to have relieved some scalp issues as well. Also the smell of this stuff is crazy good imho.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this shampoo is so soothing, not to mention the great treatment it gives ones hair.  Very kind to tinted hair.</li>
            <li> After a color blunder I totally fried my hair trying to fix it. I thought I was going to have to shave my already short hair style completely off to get my hair back. One week with this Shampoo and the One N Only Restorative Masque and my hair is repaired!!! I never thought it could happen. I mean my hair was really fried. My color has improved a lot too. It no longer looks  washed out and has brilliant shine!!  I will use One n Only shampoo and Conditioners for ever! Highly recommend all of the One n Only products! And, best thing is, for a fine quality Shampoo and Conditioner, the price is right too!!!</li>
            <li> Since I switched from regular drug store hair products to One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil hair products my hair has completely transformed. My hair is so much healthier now and I owe it all to these hair products. Every product that I have used from this brand is awesome the shampoo, condition, hair oil, hairspray all of it has been great to my hair. It is definitely worth every penny and it last me a long time, a little really does go a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sent is a bit strong and it takes a bit more than normal for me to get a good lather but once I have the right amount it lathers well! Leaves hair soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde color treated hair. Perhaps this wasn&#x27;t meant for blondes or my hair type?..It did soften my hair, but left it a bit greasy looking. I originally purchased it to help remove a gummy texture from my roots. I have tried all the cleansing shampoos and home remedies, but these thing have only made my hair worse and did not remove the tar/gummy crap in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shampoo twice so far. I&#x27;m iffy about it, but do not totally regret purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves hair soft &amp; shiny.  Gave my hair a healthy look, even though it was very damaged because of years of abuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say I either loved it or hated it, but I&#x27;m somewhere in between. If you read the ingredient list, you&#x27;ll see it has almost no Argan Oil. At first, it did seem to help with my dry hair (along with the conditioner), but I was concerned about my allergies.  I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything.  When my ears started turning red, I suspected my shampoo and switched to Aubrey products that I like much, much more. I did try it again after using Aubrey for a while and I was very disappointed.  My hair lost a lot of curl and was dull and not silky like with the Aubrey products.  I would consider this a drug store quality product.  Not too pricey.  But certainly not the best.</li>
            <li> This is awesome I love this repair shampoo</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and product seems to work every once in a while. I started using this shampoo and conditioner and the Argon oil and  I don’t even have to use other products in my hair. It looks great.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick, mid-back length hair that gets pretty dried out from driving topless. This shampoo is a LIFESAVER. I keep trying to grow my hair out to hip bone length but, alas, every two months I have to go in and have all my new growth whacked off due to split ends. This shampoo has really helped with that. I use it in conjunction with the Loreal yellow container super moisturizing conditioner once a week, and my hair feels VERY silky smoooth. Maybe I won&#x27;t have to get so many split ends chopped off. One month down, and my hair is still feeling GREAT.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, be prepared for a few days of perfumed hair. The product is ok, but wow, did my hair keep on smelling. For women, it might be better, but this product is heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> Love the One N&#x27; Only line. I&#x27;ve used the Shampoo, Conditioner, mousse and oil and they all work great. My hair is way more shiny and soft after using this ( coming from grocery store shampoos). When I first started using the shampoo my hair felt a little dry but I read that happens when you switch to Sulfate Free products either way it&#x27;s gone now, my hair is soft even when it&#x27;s wet and just using the shampoo and conditioner with nothing else my have is much less frizzy when it dries. (Brown mid back Native American hair). These products smell amazing too, they have a very earthy smell. The shampoo isn&#x27;t quite as strong as the conditioner and the scent will linger the next day.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. Never again would I buy it. Made my hair dull and even more dry than what it it. I have frizzy, dry, unmanageable hair. So I ended up doing the Keratin Treatment. My hair was great. So I decided to use Sulfate Free and ONLY argan oil products. I used Agadir products for 2 months straight after my Keratin Treatment, and my hair was the best. I didn&#x27;t use any other chemicals in my hair; shampoo, conditioner and argan oil, and I was out the door. Then I decieded &amp;#34;Let me try something else that&#x27;s Sulfate Free and has argan oil.&amp;#34; Came across One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil products and I decieded to buy the shampoo, conditioner, and the argan oil. WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. I used it 3X and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my shower. Going back to my Agadir products.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil has been the best find for my hair - really helps condition it without turning it into flat, overconditioned hair - I use both the conditioner and shampoo, the serum, and the &amp;#34;One n Only&amp;#34; Argan Oil hair dye - all of them are excellent products and I have every intention of continuing to use them!</li>
            <li> This item I cannot seem to find locally.  Was searching for Argan oil to see if it was any cheaper purchasing online and stumbled upon this company&#x27;s other products.  Love everything I have tried.  Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try this product but it did wonders for my hair and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more for my money!</li>
            <li> Its rare that I recommend or am impressed with a shampoo- after all, shampoos are simply cleansers, so typically the benefits they tote are negated by the fact they are made to take AWAY from hair, NOT at anything to it. Likewise I do not shampoo very often; my roots 1X per week and my whole head perhaps once every 5-8 days, depending. But I was intrigued by the fact it was an affordable Argan oil cleanser and also sulfate free. First of, this stuff works great. Though SF, it still lathers well, which was surprising. Its got that great Moroccan oil scent to it which I love, just perfumed a smidgen lighter than the more $$$ brands. It definitely leaves the hair hydrated and super soft after use, although when you rinse it your hair feels dry for some reason (which I have gotten before/similar to using protein s &amp; c&#x27;s). I can&#x27;t so much comment on if it creates frizz or not being that I used it in conjunction with the daily one n only argan conditioner, topped off by leave in oil and a curl control product. At any rate, this was an excellent cleanser which didn&#x27;t strip and added buckets of softness. The only drawback I see is that while sulfphate free, I am not a fan of a lot of the other ingredients in this shampoo. But the benefits outweigh that factor; I will continue using it and glad I found it! [My hair type: Coarse, curly, thick, dry, waist length]</li>
            <li> I had a pleasant experience with this shampoo . I bought it with the conditioner and the treatment oil , they work just fine for me . They gave my hair the shine I was looking for .</li>
            <li> LOVE.  I bought this and the conditioner from Ulta and LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve been spending a chunk of my paycheck on Wen every month for the past couple years because I haven&#x27;t been able to find something in the store that doesn&#x27;t strip my wavy hair and make brittle, frizzy and poofy....until this stuff.  I was skeptical at first, I almost felt my hair was a little dry the first time I used it, but by the third time I was in love.  My hair is soft, shiny and totally frizz free.  I am officially no longer a Wen girl, my days of $40 cleansers are finally done.  (Also, I follow this up with the Agadir Argon Oil spray, which is also great.)</li>
            <li> I had been using Avalons Biotin shampoo and decided to try this. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable effect from the shampoo and felt it increased by hair falling. I stopped using it after a few weeks but I do still use the conditioner every now and then on the bottom hald of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It leaves my long and tired hair (I&#x27;m 43 and have hard water, so age and minerals make my hair less than soft) silky and shiny.  And I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> Hey their unfortunately yes i have to give to thumbs down on this product it was not what was shown in the picture also came leaking threw the package i do recommend buying this from SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPY where it going to cost 21 plus tax i believe but hopefully the will fix this and update the photo ASAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best regards April.</li>
            <li> I was leaving my bf&#x27;s house when I saw sample sizes of these in laying in his mom&#x27;s variety bowl. She offered them to me but I didn&#x27;t think that such a tiny amount would be enough for my thick, long, multiracial hair. Desperation forced me to try and I have not looked back since. This line cleanses without stripping, leaves hair smelling delicious and is very economical in price and in how much a little goes a long way. As soon as I get more cash, i am going to buy and keep a huge stockpile!! Love love love!! It has replaced Nexxus, Paul Mitchell and Body shop as my fav line. Certainly the highest quality and most affordable argan oil line available.</li>
            <li> I was given this shampoo and matching conditioner as a gift. I used this morning and immediately noticed the difference in my hair. I have a lot of fine often frizzy hair. I have been using Bumble and Bumble shampoo and conditioner prior to today. After using this shampoo and conditioner my hair was extremely soft and easy to style. Living on the East Coast the humidity often rules my hair but today, in June, my hair cooperated and even received several compliments. A true find. Will definately be switching to Argan!</li>
            <li> Smells *amazing*, and is a great conditioner if you want &amp;#34;silky-soft&amp;#34;. Protip: leave a tiny bit of conditioner in your hair when you rinse out.</li>
            <li> Love it, hair so soft and shiny and the smell is kinda musky in a good way. My boyfriend likes it too because it doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;chick shampoo&amp;#34; LOL.</li>
            <li> Made my hair INCREDIBLY soft and smells AMAZING. my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo from Sally&#x27;s based on the recommendation from a sales associate. Was not too sure about it but since it was on sale decided to buy this shampoo and the conditioner together. Used it for the first time this morning and I am officially in love with it. After a bad bleach job my damaged hair went from pretty bouncy curls to loose frizzy waves and at its worst stick strait straw-like hair. One wash and my hair is springy again. Pretty round curls and although there still is a little frizz it is cut at least in half.  Next wash I will try the brands curl cream alongside it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff !!! it smells great. moisturizes better than other shampoo. i could skip conditioner if had to.</li>
            <li> but from Sally&#x27;s. I bought a few from the line, but this review will be for the shampoo. I would like to clarify that this DOES NOT LATHER. For those that don&#x27;t like that, this is not the shampoo for you. That being said, let&#x27;s get started...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been coloring my hair for roughly 31 years due to getting greys at 11. My hair is partly wavy, partly spring curls. and i have a hard time with the ends always being dry and course. The last two times my hair was colored, the wrong developer was used and too much color was stripped. This caused severe dryness and breakage. No matter what I did, it just seemed to get worse. I went to Sally&#x27;s and tried One N&#x27; Only&#x27;s dye and developer (I will be reviewing them as well), and very pleased with the results, I went back and purchased the shampoo and other items in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have with this shampoo is that I have to use a bit to get to my scalp and entire head of hair. It&#x27;s not the shampoo-my hair is mid-back and rather thick. I love the fact that it is sulfate, paraben, and phosphate free. Before now, my hair was constantly blah feeling and I hated that squeak feeling after washing my hair. That means that essentials are being washed down the drain IMHO. Since switching, not only does my hair feel much softer, it&#x27;s shiny and healthy again. I like the scent, and I have an extremely sensitive nose. It doesn&#x27;t smell false like so many do. It&#x27;s more earthy/sensual. When I rinse, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw. In fact, it feels more as though I just conditioned without it being heavy and weighing. No itchy, tight scalp. I am more than pleased with this shampoo. As long as it&#x27;s made, I will never use another.</li>
            <li> This works great. It contains no sulfur (which is great for African Americans) and it does not strip your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> great product, hair feels beautiful</li>
            <li> In March 2011, I went to a salon to have my hair bleached so I could dye it a bright blue. I had never bleached my hair before and was unprepared for the damage it caused. My hair was fried and I would cry in the shower after shampooing it. It felt like concrete and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it. That started my journey in locating hair care products that would restore my hair to its previous state. Before I found this shampoo and conditioner, I got my hair cut very, very short to begin getting rid of the damaged hair. After I found One &#x27;N Only products, I regretted the haircut. It undid all the damage to the hair that was remaining on my head. I&#x27;ve been using these products ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the shampoo and conditioner, I started using their hydrating mask and treatment spray. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. I will always recommend them to people!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is excellent for dry hair. I have dry, puffy hair so both these products do wonders for my hair. The scent is absolutely amazing, smells very exotic. I would not recommend to people who already have naturally oily hair. Great product, its a must buy and its affordable. I used Wen Hair Care products before this and wen hair care was also very good, but it was just too heavy. This is perfect because it has a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awesome does it&#x27;s job and takes your hair to a whole new level and makes it feel great and fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Great price, quality and very convenient.</li>
            <li> Just the smell alone would be enough to make me want to purchase again! I love the way my hair felt after just one use. My hair has been very dry from medications and this shampoo (and conditioner) was a blessing.  I recommend to anyone with dry hair. It was so nice to find a shampoo that has such a refreshing smell, I&#x27;m so tired of all the drugstore shampoo scents.</li>
            <li> This product has wonderful moisturizing properties and leaves hair clean and silky soft. The scent is refreshing and smells like a tropical fruit. Argan oil is very beneficial in adding moisture to skin an hair. For th price this product has great value.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing shampoo ,thick lather and shiny hair when it is dry. I would recommend it to friends. Good for color treated hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would make my dry, damaged, color treated hair, more healthy. It did the opposite, after every use, my hair got more and more dry and rough. After about 3 weeks once I realized that it was the shampoo, I used loreal 5 in 1 damage control shampoo and my hair instantly started feeling better. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the conditioner. Removes the tangles and hydrates.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my hair has been going through some changes. Recently, it has become dry, coarse, and felt dehydrated. I tried Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo and Conditioner and, although it seemed to be okay at first, my hair stopped liking it. Plus, it was starting to cause breakage to my hair. I was so close to cutting my hair short, it was that bad! I went to Sally&#x27;s and was eying this product but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy it. Seemed like it was calling me and saying, \\&quot;Buy me!\\&quot; So, I did, but waited two weeks to try it. As soon as the shampoo made contact, my hair was so thankful! It felt soft immediately, and the smell is great! Partnered with the conditioner, I love my hair again!</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a whole lot. By itself it&#x27;s a good shampoo, gets your hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I have very light platinum almost white blonde hair so I have to use a purple toning shampoo every so often. Using the purple shampoo alone is VERY drying. I mix this with my purple shampoo and leave it in for 5 minutes before rinsing. Mixing in this shampoo keeps the purple shampoo from drying out my hair while still allowing it to do it&#x27;s job! I follow up with the hydrating hair mask from this line on the days I use a purple shampoo or just the normal conditioner from the line and let it sit for 5 minutes if I just use the normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> did not like it at all</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular shampoo again, this is the BEST shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried. Leaves my hair soft and more manageable. Less frizz and much easier to control. I used to buy this at Sally Beauty Supply, but found it on here for MUCH cheaper! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has thick frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and seller and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with both. My hair just feels cleaner when I use One n&#x27; Only and, in turn, I feel better!</li>
            <li> This shampoo will leave your scalp oily. so far it is working good, especially using it with the Jamaican black castor oil protein hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is way too gentle, it does not clean your hair. I use hairspray and it does not remove it. If you do too, and you know how your hair feels when it gets wet while you had on hairspray, well that&#x27;s how you will feel when using this shampoo. I also bought the conditioner, not crazy about it, I have dry hair and I need a deeper moisturizer. The treatment spray however is awesome, works great on dry hair and control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo on a whim because it smelled so good. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked well to clean my hair and scalp, plus it&#x27;s very moisturizing. It feels like a conditioner because it has lots of slip and you can detangle your hair with it. It is the only shampoo that I use now. Oh, and the conditioner and oil treatment are awesome as well.</li>
            <li> Hair feels, smells and IS more lush! When applying it, I can already feel it is going to make my hair better, and it does! And again, SMELLS wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  every winter I have to wear my hair back, because the static is so bad, but when I use this line, I don&#x27;t the static problem (well only if I&#x27;ve worn a knitted cap).  I also have about 50% less split ends for the length of my hair.  Buy this, the conditioner, and the Oil.  I use it about every other time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo.  I have a sensitive scalp, and this works well.  Warning - It gets really thick when it&#x27;s cold (or even cooler weather), and it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle.  I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because I found the same shampoo for about 2$ cheaper at my local Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell or the feel or texture of the shampoo.  Didn&#x27;t lather much and my hair felt like straw when I was done washing it.  Not worth the money.  Recently bought Suave Professional Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner.  Each cost around $5 at WalMart and my hair felt soft and less frizzy than it usual does.  Save your money and try Suave Professional Keratin Infusion.</li>
            <li> beside the mascara is very good, this shampoo is the worst thing i ever tryed...is just bad!i gave for a friend to try, since i was thinkyng that could be bad just for my hair, but she said she hate it..passed for another friend..she says the same thing...dont get this, waist of money and time..</li>
            <li> Found One N Only Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner at Sallys Beauty Supply about a year ago. Cashier told me that its a very popular product and is amazing. Went to grab a bottle and there was only one left lol so I snagged it. It&#x27;s all ive used since that day.. well until I decided to order Wen online recently, not a good idea. It sucked... Do your research and read reviews. Go with Argan oil for sure. Im selling the rest of my Wen to my friend LOL</li>
            <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest shampoo.  Hair never feels as clean as it should.  I only say this because of the price.  Otherwise, worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this product was the smell.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help my color treatment last longer or stay more vibrant.  It didn&#x27;t improve the health of my hair at all, and may have even damaged it a little due to overdrying.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, and this product has turned me off to trying other products from the same line.</li>
            <li> when i received the item,30% shampoo spill all over the package and whole thing was sticky.i had to wash thoroughly to get rid of shampoo from outside of the bottle.but overall product is good.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I like the oil. I went into Sally&#x27;s and bought the large 33 oz bottle for $19.99.  I should have bought the small one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started using this shampoo and conditioner about four months ago (September 2012).  Given that my hair was damaged and already dry and prone to breakage, I thought this would be a great product to use since it&#x27;s sulfate-free and also supposedly good for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, within the first two months of use my hair was softer and bouncier after use.  The last two months my hair stylists said my hair felt hard to them.  My hair started breaking a lot whenever I combed it. The last time I went to the salon, my hair was hard and had so much breakage that I had to get my hair cut short.  Since my hair was already dry, it didn&#x27;t occur to me that it was this shampoo that could be the culprit of a worsening problem. One of my stylists said that my hair felt like it could be porous.  I did the porosity test (placing strand in water to see if it sinks). My hair didn&#x27;t sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had asked a friend of mine had she tried this shampoo.  She said she did but it dried her hair out, that her son recently used it and it also dried his hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was my hair hard but it was also difficult to curl with an iron, was hard after blow drying, and was rock-hard after roller setting.  I colored and washed my hair on 1/5/13. Keeping my friend in mind, instead of using the One n&#x27; Only shampoo, I used my Hair One cleansing conditioner, along with Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair.  After I rinsed out the conditioner my hair was easier to comb through and blow dry with little to no shedding or breakage. I curled it with an iron and it was MUCH softer&lt;br /&gt;and curled with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to realize my friend was right--that it was this shampoo breaking my hair, drying it out and making it hard, as there was a significant difference in my hair after one wash with another shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however like the conditioner, but I probably will never buy it again after it&#x27;s all gone. I will probably go back to my Nexxus Humectress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: African-American, relaxed, thick and coarse with natural very tight curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now and I love it! I have natural curly hair and it tames it without weighing it down. My hair looks and feels healthier and I plan on continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair nice after shampoo.  I like when you comb there&#x27;s no hair in comb. It&#x27;s a good wash with lot&#x27;s of lather and your hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> I dislike the way my hair feel after the using this shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo is ok..... I thought i&#x27;d give it a try.. I bought the shampoo, conditioner, hydrating mask and the argan oil leave in treatment... By far my favorite&#x27;s were the oil leave in treatment (LOVE IT!) and the hydrating mask. If your looking for something to help your dry, damage, frizzy hair. I highly recommend the argan oil leave in treatment. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> Found a product while in New Zealand that is made with the argan and absolutely loved it.  But since it is not sold in the states thought I&#x27;d try this product.  So far it is nice, I&#x27;ll give it a couple more uses before I&#x27;ll know if it as good as the New Zealand product.  So far, so good.  My hair feels fab-u-lous</li>
