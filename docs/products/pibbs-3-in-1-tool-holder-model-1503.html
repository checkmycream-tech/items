            <li>This is a great hair appliance holder I purchased on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It has not budged an inch, and has remained nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am super happy I decided to go with this and permanently drill into my vanity.  </li>
            <li>My Wife loves it, and it was very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you install using mollies and within a stud or its sure to pull out of the wall or cabinet!</li>
            <li>My hairdryer fits perfectly in the slot and the other two spaces seem great for my curling irons.  </li>
            <li>My tools fit nicely in the tubes and it keeps them handy but out of the way.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very secure.</li>
            <li>I love love love this item.</li>
            <li>Neat place to hold my most used tools, blow dryer, straightner, curling wand.  </li>
            <li>(they are not \\&quot;rolled\\&quot; like the top).    </li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great purchase for someone who wants a minimul space-disrupting organizer.</li>
            <li>I love it, did not give it 5 stars because mine did not come with mounting screws.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s MUCH better than having all my hair appliances sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li>It is screwed into the side of my bathroom sink and it has been the best way to keep the hairdryer and other tools organized and off the counter.</li>
            <li>A SUPER choice!</li>
            <li>They work well, and free up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li>It holds two curling irons and my blow dryer securely.</li>
            <li>I have a small bath and this is the perfect utility holder for hair dryer and curling irons.</li>
            <li>Been looking for something to help clean the clutter around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I love my tool holder but it was much heavier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I imagine it will still be in great shape after I&#x27;m dead on gone.  </li>
            <li>Although beautiful, I hardly notice it&#x27;s there-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, but my husband securely attached it to the wall in a small area that was available and it&#x27;s been durable and just perfect.</li>
            <li>but then I found this and certainly this holder will not go any where!</li>
            <li>I also want to commend the seller for providing extremely quick and reasonably priced shipping.]</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, so</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had was somewhere for the cords to go &amp; be more hidden/out of the way.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what the doctor ordered and matches the polished look in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the hair dryer section because I have a really large hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This hanging salon organizer accommodates  a dryer, curling iron and flat iron for easy access while doing your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have one in a 3/4\\&quot; and one 1.5\\&quot; iron that have plastic \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; on them and both fit in the respective spots.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider my grooming tools modern art.    </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t mind at all</li>
            <li>It is quite heavy however, so make sure you install it onto the studs or use wall anchors.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that the picture does not show the bottom and all the tubes are open on the end.</li>
            <li>Once your done with your roller / curling iron stick it into one of the holes hot or not and it will protect against falling onto the carpet after you leave and possibly starting a fire.</li>
            <li>Aside from a little surface rust after several months of humid conditions we love this product.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.  </li>
            <li>Love this product enough that I bought a second one for the other bathroom in our house.</li>
            <li>This is my second attempt buying a product that could hold my dryer and flat ironing, the first one broke within 6 mo</li>
            <li>This is super heavy duty, is not a work of art since the weld marks are visible</li>
            <li>I have now had the Pibbs 3-in-1 tool holder on the same spot on our bathroom wall for three years, and have used it nearly every day in that time.</li>
            <li>We have a pocket door behind the wall on which this was mounted so we used anchors to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>The heat setting dial is a little thicker than the handle and keeps the irons right where they should be.</li>
            <li>, the wall will go down first before this thing breaks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love love love this item. It&#x27;s nice and sturdy. It can stand heat and being banged by irons and curlers. It&#x27;s great when organizing a bathroom with minimal/no cabinet space.</li>
            <li> Love this product enough that I bought a second one for the other bathroom in our house. A friend saw it and ordered one too, best advertising is word of mouth!</li>
            <li> My Wife loves it, and it was very easy to install. We actually installed two of these; one beside the sink and one on the wall. They work well, and free up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> Solid!  Great addition to the bathroom.  It is screwed into the side of my bathroom sink and it has been the best way to keep the hairdryer and other tools organized and off the counter. It didn&#x27;t require any counter sinks for support and maybe some people complained about the saudering points but frankly this is one seriously solid heavy piece of metal, of course you are going to see those!  This thing is going to last for decades.</li>
            <li> My husband does as well.  Neat place to hold my most used tools, blow dryer, straightner, curling wand.  Mounts quicky and is sturdy!</li>
            <li> This makes fixing hair so convenient.  I am super happy I decided to go with this and permanently drill into my vanity.  I was hesitant, but could not live without this now.</li>
            <li> great quality, built well, and I imagine it will still be in great shape after I&#x27;m dead on gone.  love that it organizes all my hair crap--I no longer have to dig my irons out of a drawer or basket.  I also purchased a wire basket I mounted on the wall for my hair gels, sprays, etc.  My bathroom looks great!!</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, so it&#x27;s perfect for me. My tools fit nicely in the tubes and it keeps them handy but out of the way.</li>
            <li> The Pibbs 3-in-1 tool holder is really heavy duty. We have a pocket door behind the wall on which this was mounted so we used anchors to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t fall off. It&#x27;s been holding perfectly even though I sometimes rush and slam my hairdryer into it on the way out the door.    I was also worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold my two con-air curling brushes because they lack the handle that seemingly keeps the irons from sliding through. Not the case! The heat setting dial is a little thicker than the handle and keeps the irons right where they should be. I have one in a 3/4\\&quot; and one 1.5\\&quot; iron that have plastic \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; on them and both fit in the respective spots. The blow dryer also sits perfectly.    Be aware that the picture does not show the bottom and all the tubes are open on the end. Also be aware that this is very heavy metal and the bottoms of the tubes are a little sharp (they are not \\&quot;rolled\\&quot; like the top).    All in all, this is a great purchase for someone who wants a minimul space-disrupting organizer. Although beautiful, I hardly notice it&#x27;s there- unlike those gigantic wooden wall pieces. I don&#x27;t consider my grooming tools modern art.    UPDATE:    I have now had the Pibbs 3-in-1 tool holder on the same spot on our bathroom wall for three years, and have used it nearly every day in that time. It has not budged an inch, and has remained nice and shiny. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my tool holder but it was much heavier than I anticipated. Make sure that you install using mollies and within a stud or its sure to pull out of the wall or cabinet!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair appliance holder I purchased on Amazon.  It is heavy duty enough to hold up to daily use.  I really like the size of the hair dryer section because I have a really large hair dryer.  I am looking forward to using it for years![[ASIN:B002IADO4Y PIBBS 3 in 1 Tool Holder (Model: 1503)  I also want to commend the seller for providing extremely quick and reasonably priced shipping.]</li>
            <li> Professional quality.  Heavy duty salon quality, weighs a couple pounds.  I love it, did not give it 5 stars because mine did not come with mounting screws.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, sturdy. Very heavy weight. Only issue is that it does not come with hardware to hang it up.</li>
            <li> This is great for my hair-dryer, straightener, and curling iron.  The only thing I wish it had was somewhere for the cords to go &amp; be more hidden/out of the way.  But, it&#x27;s MUCH better than having all my hair appliances sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of winding the cords up on my dryer and irons after every use. I mounted it on a slanted wall (because that&#x27;s what I have) and it&#x27;s very secure. It holds two curling irons and my blow dryer securely. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to perfectly.</li>
            <li> Been looking for something to help clean the clutter around the bathroom sink. This is exactly what the doctor ordered and matches the polished look in the bathroom. It does look a little \\&quot;hand crafted\\&quot; in terms of metal and the welds but it does the job and takes up little space on the side of the counter.</li>

This is super heavy duty, is not a work of art since the weld marks are visible but I really don&#x27;t mind at all, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I love it, no more mess</li>
            <li> This hanging salon organizer accommodates  a dryer, curling iron and flat iron for easy access while doing your hair.  Aside from a little surface rust after several months of humid conditions we love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the PIBBS 3 in 1 Tool Holder as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves it, and says a lot of her friends have asked where she got it. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping all her hair appliances off her bathroom counter. Very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> These work awesome and so I bought two. Once your done with your roller / curling iron stick it into one of the holes hot or not and it will protect against falling onto the carpet after you leave and possibly starting a fire.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago and it took my husband a while to put it up.  I think it is well made and compact enough to work in small bathrooms.  My hairdryer fits perfectly in the slot and the other two spaces seem great for my curling irons.  It is quite heavy however, so make sure you install it onto the studs or use wall anchors.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and not many places to pick and choose where to put it, and it&#x27;s so heavy that I have to be very careful where I place it. Seller wouldn&#x27;t take it back. Also, it has visible solder marks in the metal, if that matters to you. Going to look for a lighter holster.</li>
            <li> I have a small bath and this is the perfect utility holder for hair dryer and curling irons. It&#x27;s heavy, but my husband securely attached it to the wall in a small area that was available and it&#x27;s been durable and just perfect. A great find because of it&#x27;s skinny size. You&#x27;ll love it. In the smaller curling iron cavity, I stick my headbands I use in the shower and to wash my face! A SUPER choice!</li>
