    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good eye cream that doesn&#x27;t sting and this is it!!</li>
            <li>amazon price was the best!</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried it is the best one for the value.</li>
            <li>but it seems really good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Its great to use with make-up</li>
            <li>Looks great under makeup.</li>
            <li>love it , best eyecream on the market</li>
            <li>This eye cream does a good job with moisturizing, but also has also visibly reduced the puffiness under my eyes, which I was not expecting.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this eye cream and was impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>Wish I found this product many years ago!</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>This product really works!!!!!</li>
            <li>this cream feels and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and is not greasy, all the while providing the moisture I need.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly oily cream which is fine for me at night.  </li>
            <li>While it feels nice going on and not greasy...there is nothing more to it.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best one yet!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Haushka products off and on for years now and they are high quality and very good.</li>
            <li>Great Product - Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>very smooth and non greasy....</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>It brightens under eye area when I haven&#x27;t slept well and gives a more refreshed look.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any changes after 30 days and had so hoped for more.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what my wife says:  I have used so many undereye creams</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have a jar that you dip a finger into to apply the cream.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, but I like Biodroga eye care much better, so I will stick to that.</li>
            <li>It makes skin smooth, not greasy at all and nice smell.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about this product and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am on day 3 now and am 98% better.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Unlike most eye creams this one does not run into you&#x27;re eyes and burn.</li>
            <li>and it gives the eyes a glossy greasy look that makes eye bags more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love ALL the Hauschka products.</li>
            <li>Most eye creams make my eyelids swell, but this did not.  </li>
            <li>Love using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>This product is pretty good</li>
            <li>Like every other product from Dr. Hauschka - it is great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, light weight, goes on well under make-up and makes me look refreshed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and keeps a 65 year old bright eyed--probably would work for someone younger too.</li>
            <li>If I skip applying it for 2 or 3 days, my eye smile creases are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>so you can keep it germ free and sanitary.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, rich cream, but it soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>It will not completely remove fine lines, but it will make your skin look great.</li>
            <li>Specially this is considered a chemical free treatment for your eyes, so I&#x27;m going to repurchase this again and again.</li>
            <li>but for combination to oily skin for eye cream, I feel the Biodroga Anti-Age Firming Eye Care is much more effective than Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Daily Eye Care.</li>
            <li>This a smooth eye cream, not oily and quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that it is natural, semi-affordable, soaks right in, and with diligence it does brighten up the eyes and smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li>The texture is pretty light and it does not feel particularity nutritive.</li>
            <li>After having an allergic reaction to some perfumed products my eyes have become extremely sensitive to many ingredients.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes is sensitive and most of the eye creams with \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients like retinol cause an allerigic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Also really economical cause</li>
            <li>Is very gentle around the eyes and keeps skin hydrated for up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>5 stars as I saw results immediately after the first use</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny, from N.V. Perricone to Garnier</li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka clarifying day oil, however, I do like better than the Biodroga Anti-Age Cell Formula (their daily care for combination to oily skin)</li>
            <li>After the first application I got immediate results.  </li>
            <li>If I know I&#x27;m heading to the gym or its a hot day, I&#x27;m more likely to use this.</li>
            <li>I have not been as consistent as I should be using this since I have gotten it</li>
            <li>This is great and the tube seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Decades ago, I used Dr. Hauschka \\&quot;Eye Contour Day Balm\\&quot;, which is also a very good product, and I recently came back to it, but I think I&#x27;m going to stick with just the \\&quot;Daily Revitalizing Eye</li>
            <li>i like the pure ingredients and the philosophy of their skin care line.  </li>
            <li>Additional promotion verbiage is minimal, if any, unlike the overblown promises made to promote most products of this type.  </li>
            <li>, it absorbed well and made my lines soft around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really think it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need it too much.</li>
            <li>But even though you don&#x27;t need to use much, it is still a bit pricey for me.</li>
            <li>My eyes have improved so much.</li>
            <li>I also used too much and it broke out my skin.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a plumping property to help reduce appearance of lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li>It has made me try many other Dr. Hauschka products.  </li>
            <li>I used this product before the bed and let me tell, you&#x27;ll feel the lift action of your eyes from the first use.</li>
            <li>I am older and do not have lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m only 19, I noticed a lot of aging around my eyes due to the fact that I never found an eye cream I liked and gave up...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few better ones but the price tags were over $100.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream so far that actually seems to make my eyes look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I started using a new cream shadow</li>
            <li>wanted the stuff I&#x27;m used to, not something new and improved.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new ones too.</li>
            <li>, just let it soak in for about ten minutes first.</li>
            <li>just so I can hear them say wow</li>
            <li>Really opens your eyes and holds back the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It gives a refreshed look and I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>My eye lids became VERY itchy and red.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d get the same result with some almond oil at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old.  </li>
            <li>It is a tad more expensive than some treatments, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to believe this product is going to make a difference -- partly because the claims the manufacturer makes are all in the product name, i.e., if you use it daily, Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s eye cream actually does revitalize skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Due to the price I will use it all, but will sadly not reorder.</li>
            <li>i have not  aged at all!  </li>
            <li>I have found that just after 2 weeks of use, my undereye circles are not as dark and lines are less prominent.  </li>
            <li>This was listed as the Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream when I bought it, but I got the new daily hydrating eye</li>
            <li>The other creams I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t cause a reaction don&#x27;t really seem to do anything at all.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning the next day, there was no dark circles and my eyes looked plumped.</li>

            <li> I had minor eczema on the upper eye lid..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect much from eye creams, but at least this is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> Tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other thing that makes it hard to believe in this product at first is its lightness: it would seem to lack the viscosity necessary to get this hard job done.  </li>
            <li> My wife suffers from rosasea and this cream has really noticeably improved her skin, especially during dry winter days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I followed some other reviewers instructions with patting it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Immediate brightness of dark under eye area.</li>
            <li> Then this itchiness after few days, turned into rough peeling eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Makes my eyes appear less &amp;#34;tired looking&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It ticked me off a little bit to tell you the truth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see an improvement in the morning after using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I can see the difference everyday when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and the Revitalizing Eye Cream</li>
            <li> This product works well by nourishing the under eye delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eye cream junkie using it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> protects my skin from winter damage without being heavy or irritating.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I came down with an awful allergic reaction to something.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate at this point.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> After having an allergic reaction to some perfumed products my eyes have become extremely sensitive to many ingredients. I have been using this eye cream for 2 years and love it. It absorbs nicely and is not greasy, all the while providing the moisture I need. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product before the bed and let me tell, you&#x27;ll feel the lift action of your eyes from the first use. When I woke up in the morning the next day, there was no dark circles and my eyes looked plumped. Specially this is considered a chemical free treatment for your eyes, so I&#x27;m going to repurchase this again and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to believe this product is going to make a difference -- partly because the claims the manufacturer makes are all in the product name, i.e., if you use it daily, Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s eye cream actually does revitalize skin around the eyes. Additional promotion verbiage is minimal, if any, unlike the overblown promises made to promote most products of this type.  The other thing that makes it hard to believe in this product at first is its lightness: it would seem to lack the viscosity necessary to get this hard job done.  Instead, it keeps the skin around my eyes moist without looking as if I&#x27;ve medicated it!  Decades ago, I used Dr. Hauschka \\&quot;Eye Contour Day Balm\\&quot;, which is also a very good product, and I recently came back to it, but I think I&#x27;m going to stick with just the \\&quot;Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream\\&quot; from now on.  I&#x27;m 68, and this product makes a noticeable difference in my appearance and my comfort.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> 5 stars as I saw results immediately after the first use, it absorbed well and made my lines soft around my eyes. I followed some other reviewers instructions with patting it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a miracle....very smooth and non greasy....it helps me with my allergies around my eyes and diminishes my eye puffiness...</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. It brightens under eye area when I haven&#x27;t slept well and gives a more refreshed look. I like this product because it does actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I&#x27;ve often let my friends use this just so I can hear them say wow once it soaks it. Its great to use with make-up, just let it soak in for about ten minutes first. It will not completely remove fine lines, but it will make your skin look great.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is sensitive and most of the eye creams with \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients like retinol cause an allerigic reaction.  The other creams I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t cause a reaction don&#x27;t really seem to do anything at all.  This eye cream does a good job with moisturizing, but also has also visibly reduced the puffiness under my eyes, which I was not expecting.  I have had no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now.  Really think it makes a difference.  Makes my eyes appear less &amp;#34;tired looking&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for years and will never stop. Really opens your eyes and holds back the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I so wanted this product to work. While it feels nice going on and not greasy...there is nothing more to it. I have not noticed any changes after 30 days and had so hoped for more. Due to the price I will use it all, but will sadly not reorder.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what my wife says:  I have used so many undereye creams it&#x27;s not even funny, from N.V. Perricone to Garnier and this is by far the best one yet!  It is smooth, light weight, goes on well under make-up and makes me look refreshed in the morning.  I have found that just after 2 weeks of use, my undereye circles are not as dark and lines are less prominent.  I love that you don&#x27;t have a jar that you dip a finger into to apply the cream.  It has made me try many other Dr. Hauschka products.  It is a tad more expensive than some treatments, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter in law last year, she requested it again, and loves it.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I like Biodroga eye care much better, so I will stick to that. Dr. Hauschka clarifying day oil, however, I do like better than the Biodroga Anti-Age Cell Formula (their daily care for combination to oily skin) but for combination to oily skin for eye cream, I feel the Biodroga Anti-Age Firming Eye Care is much more effective than Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Daily Eye Care.</li>
            <li> Immediate brightness of dark under eye area.</li>
            <li> Like every other product from Dr. Hauschka - it is great! It makes skin smooth, not greasy at all and nice smell. Also really economical cause you don&#x27;t need it too much.</li>
            <li> love it , best eyecream on the market</li>
            <li> Is very gentle around the eyes and keeps skin hydrated for up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This product works well by nourishing the under eye delicate skin. It gives a refreshed look and I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li> I came down with an awful allergic reaction to something.  I started using a new cream shadow and I think it had something in it that created this irritation.  My eye lids became VERY itchy and red.  Then this itchiness after few days, turned into rough peeling eyelids.  They felt like sand paper and were sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I read many reviews about this product and thought I would give it a try. I was desperate at this point.  I was so nervous because my daily cleanser would sting my eyelids when I was washing my face.  I looked on line but I  needed the eye cream asap.  Just so happens my husband was in Germany and was coming back the next day.  I had him pick me up a jar.  After the first application I got immediate results.  I am on day 3 now and am 98% better.  I LOVE this product.  This product really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> This a smooth eye cream, not oily and quickly absorbed.  But even though you don&#x27;t need to use much, it is still a bit pricey for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes have improved so much. Love this product</li>
            <li> Great Product - Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Unlike most eye creams this one does not run into you&#x27;re eyes and burn. If I know I&#x27;m heading to the gym or its a hot day, I&#x27;m more likely to use this. Definitely see results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and keeps a 65 year old bright eyed--probably would work for someone younger too. You use just a tiny bit so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This does not work!! Save your $40.  I noticed no difference at all and it gives the eyes a glossy greasy look that makes eye bags more noticeable. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> This was listed as the Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream when I bought it, but I got the new daily hydrating eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted the stuff I&#x27;m used to, not something new and improved.  It ticked me off a little bit to tell you the truth.  I have not tried the product yet.  Thinking about sending it back.</li>
            <li> So stinging or burning and the eye area stays hydrated. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good eye cream that doesn&#x27;t sting and this is it!!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is Not greasy.  A little goes a long way.  You can see the results in short amount of time.  I love ALL the Hauschka products.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly oily cream which is fine for me at night.  I don&#x27;t see an improvement in the morning after using this for a few weeks.  I don&#x27;t expect much from eye creams, but at least this is non-irritating.  My suspicion is this is basically oils and I&#x27;d get the same result with some almond oil at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Wish I found this product many years ago! Even though I&#x27;m only 19, I noticed a lot of aging around my eyes due to the fact that I never found an eye cream I liked and gave up... Until this product!! LOVE that it is natural, semi-affordable, soaks right in, and with diligence it does brighten up the eyes and smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li> I had alot of allergies to this which caused sneezing all the time. I also used too much and it broke out my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is pretty light and it does not feel particularity nutritive. No visible results. Would not buy again--CeraVe</li>
            <li> I have not been as consistent as I should be using this since I have gotten it but it seems really good! A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this cream feels and smells amazing. However, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a plumping property to help reduce appearance of lines under the eyes. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Daily Revitalizing Eye Cream for several years, and I&#x27;m 59 now.  After initially using it for about two weeks, I noticed a difference in the smoothness around my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t appear oily or shiny.  Looks great under makeup. If I skip applying it for 2 or 3 days, my eye smile creases are more noticeable. Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricy, I&#x27;ll continue to use this eye cream.  It even works on those pesky lines around my lips!  Smooths them out!</li>
            <li> i have been using Dr. Haushka daily revitalizing eye cream for years,  people tell my i have not  aged at all!  i like the pure ingredients and the philosophy of their skin care line.  amazon price was the best!</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried it is the best one for the value. It does the trick. I&#x27;ve used a few better ones but the price tags were over $100. This is great and the tube seems to last a long time. I&#x27;m an eye cream junkie using it at least twice a day. I&#x27;m always trying new ones too. I need something affordable and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I had minor eczema on the upper eye lid..regular use of the cream did help me immensly.</li>
            <li> I always like Dr Hauschka products.  I live in a cold climate and the Revitalizing Eye Cream protects my skin from winter damage without being heavy or irritating.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this eye cream and was impressed with it.  Most eye creams make my eyelids swell, but this did not.  This is the only eye cream so far that actually seems to make my eyes look more youthful.  I am 66 years old.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference everyday when I use it.  Fines lines and puffiness do dissipate.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good and I like the fact that it comes in a tube so you can keep it germ free and sanitary. It does minimize lines and keeps moisturizing all day.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products! This eye cream is no exception. It is a nice, rich cream, but it soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> Love using Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products.  I am older and do not have lines around my eyes. Absorbs well. Tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from rosasea and this cream has really noticeably improved her skin, especially during dry winter days. She alternates with another cream at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Haushka products off and on for years now and they are high quality and very good.</li>
