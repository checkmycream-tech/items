            <li>Rich, clean, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but just right with the Youth Dew Scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these powders, thinking that being Estee Lauder, the smell would be nice, on the contrary, its odor is similar to talc</li>
            <li>this is my favorite bath powder by far...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was really for me at the time, although it&#x27;s a classic scent and certainly lovely.</li>
            <li>It is so convenient to have it arrive right at my door instead of having to stand at a counter at a department store.  </li>

            <li>Love the powder, wish  estee Lauder would bring back all the flavores</li>
            <li>I work outdoors in the hot summer greeting people.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great to use after a shower, especially during hot weather, because it works well instead of using a tacky deodorant to keep dry and smelling</li>
            <li>I associated it with something an older person would wear.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend it.  </li>

            <li> A gift for my mom.  She uses it daily and has for years.  Just loves it.  Does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, as expected!  I mix two powders, this one &amp; Shalimar.  Perfection!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> This dusting powder is great!  It&#x27;s not too strong, but just right with the Youth Dew Scent.  I have used this powder for years and I bought this one for my Mother.  She too has used this powder for many years!  Highly Recommend it.  I give it a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> This was bought for me as a gift when I was 18.  Even though it is called &amp;#34;Youth Dew,&amp;#34; at that time I remember it smelling very mature, yet feminine.  I associated it with something an older person would wear.  I don&#x27;t think it was really for me at the time, although it&#x27;s a classic scent and certainly lovely.</li>
            <li> I love Estes Lauder it last for a long time</li>
            <li> Bought this in the past and just love the dewy scent. I have always used Estee Lauder perfumes and talcs&lt;br /&gt;but this is my favorite bath powder by far...</li>

It took me all of 5 minutes to order it from them online. It takes 5-7 business days to get to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For purchases made for Estee products, I recommend skipping Amazon and going straight to Estee; you won&#x27;t be disappointed! (This info just saved you about $15!)</li>

            <li> I work outdoors in the hot summer greeting people.  Even after a 10 hour day in the heat people still ask what I am wearing.  I use the Youth Dew bath oil and the powder.  The bath oil worn as a perfume smells better and better as the heat of the day gets warmer and warmer.  All day people tell me how good I smell, and I love that!</li>
            <li> Youth Dew dusting powder is as good as ever.  I&#x27;ve loved it for over 40 years.  It&#x27;s very woodsie and floral and soft.  I always get compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just what my mother wanted</li>
            <li> This powder feels wonderful on my chaffed taint....and the smell ain&#x27;t bad either.</li>
