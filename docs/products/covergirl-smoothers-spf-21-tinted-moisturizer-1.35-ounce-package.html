            <li>Perfect for the summer!</li>
            <li>but I use it a couple of times a week when I want to look my best.  </li>
            <li>All in all just a really great product!</li>
            <li>but for the $7 it is the best deal around.</li>
            <li>and it is the best alternative for foundation</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>Oh and perfect shade for my skin too!!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel awesome, and it just gives it an evened out finish.  </li>

            <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Its the best of the &amp;#34;tinted moisturizers&amp;#34;, I think.</li>
            <li>Now for the best part, it also makes my skin tone look uniform which is an added plus</li>
            <li>The moisturize in this product is very good for the face.</li>
            <li>THE IDEAL</li>
            <li>Now I just use this tinted moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>so stuff like this is great for me.</li>
            <li>This was on a great sale</li>
            <li>But I am happy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li>The price is great also.</li>
            <li>Great coverage without being pastie in appearance.</li>
            <li>Very effective, great compact size and great price.</li>
            <li>The color was perfect and It was so easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I will wear this sometimes when I know I will be under bright lights when singing at church.  </li>
            <li>she loved it.</li>
            <li>and she loved the added sunblock protection</li>
            <li>CoverGirl is a good brand of beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>On a good day though, I feel good wearing it by itself.</li>
            <li>Plus UV protection is always good.</li>
            <li>I think this might be a good moisturizer and not a  BB crean.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as good as I expect it too be</li>
            <li>This works good not one for wearing foundation</li>
            <li>so that is good.</li>
            <li>Then I heard that this stuff isn&#x27;t a good product anyways...</li>
            <li>Have ordered more than once - sign of a good product and happy customer.</li>
            <li>A medium light would be ideal.</li>
            <li>So happy this is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This item was perfect, my fiance has been looking for exactly this product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Really amazing product.</li>
            <li>I think it will be liked.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; and it blended so nicely with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky with makeup products and do not like to spend money on things, but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking it would be nice to have in my drawer.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it on Amazon for a good price, so</li>
            <li>Great under cover for nighttime makeup or alone for quick daytime errands.</li>
            <li>It applies to the skin very easy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to squeeze as well.</li>
            <li>My skin has &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; under tones and the light to medium was a good match.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is a nice feature, but most products have that these days.  </li>
            <li>, I find that when I wear this over Neutrogena Healthy Defense Moisturizer, I get even better results and both are cheap!!</li>
            <li>Knowing that I&#x27;d be returning to my full makeup bag at home, I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying duplicates of things I already owned and figured that perhaps I would even find an inexpensive solution to my beloved [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Feels very light weight on the face.</li>
            <li>The coverage is very light, so I do have to wear foundation over it because of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer not only worked but blended perfectly with her skin tone</li>
            <li>The CoverGirl Smoohters SPF 15 gives me a lovely glow and evens my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Its an okay bb cream</li>
            <li>I love the stuff</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but am impressed.  </li>
            <li>I wear this in lieu of foundation most days</li>
            <li>I can leave my house feeling confident that my skin is taken care of with this product.</li>
            <li>and to top it off.......GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>But it blended perfectly with my skin, made it feel soft, and it was so light that it didn&#x27;t feel like I had anything on my face.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like liquid make-up.  </li>
            <li>and I love mascara now, so</li>
            <li>, that is okay.</li>
            <li>I found exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good though.</li>
            <li>Pretty good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, male or female,  CoverGirl Smoothers is one of the best ways to quickly and conveniently put your best face  forward.</li>
            <li>I am going to be able to use this even in summer as this includes sunscreen as well which is a huge relief as I don&#x27;t have to buy another cream for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Cosmetic brands please make shades for us light to medium latinas (for those of us that are more beige than tan).</li>
            <li>I like how it feels light and is easy to apply, but with there were more color choices.</li>
            <li>I have used different products before and this one is not as good as for example Loreal!</li>
            <li>Covergirl has a true winner here!  </li>
            <li>As any other Cover Girl product, awesome!</li>
            <li>This tinted moisturizer has been a delightful find even for those of us with a few more crinkles than we want to share.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it clogs my pores at all, and it easily blends into my skin so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve caked the stuff on.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, but it works good enough for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one positive thing I will say is that the SPF 21 was effective and did work well as a sunscreen, even though I was out and about in the sun on 80 degree</li>
            <li>, it is light, easy to apply, smooth on skin and does not leave patches.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon, since it&#x27;s hit or miss in most of the stores near me.</li>
            <li>Light, smooth, non-greasy, SPF included, extremely light coverage, never oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have anything on your face.  </li>
            <li>Cost-efficient, portable, and keeps your face-oil free.</li>
            <li>This gives a  smooth satin feel on the face.</li>
            <li>I like the light to medium tent.  </li>
            <li>This cannot be used in place of make-up of course (even though I don&#x27;t wear it), but is really great at evening out skin-tone and fixing some red areas which are caused by the acne medications I use.</li>
            <li>Really fabulous stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed names a couple times since I started buying it, but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
            <li>Light coverage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it over and over again, And the SPF is a great added bonus to my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the sun when I go outside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s s light formula, so if you&#x27;re looking for thicker coverage, this isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li>I use both the light to medium and the darker shade in combination.  </li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer - Oil Free Nude]]</li>
            <li>and it felt light when applied.  </li>
            <li>Because of its light weight compact design, I carry it in my bag everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed you don&#x27;t have to be real exact with the color</li>
            <li>And you have that added convenience of a moisturizer with an SPF that makes you feel that more much protected when in the sun.</li>
            <li>good for sun screen, but not big sunshine.</li>
            <li>but it is also just great for days when you don&#x27;t really want to wear makeup but want a little something on your face to even things out :-)</li>
            <li>It seems pretty light still.  </li>
            <li>All this while making my face look non-greasy which is very thrilling to me as my skin gets oily otherwise.</li>
            <li>I normally use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in Sand and thought the light to medium in CoverGirl would be fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try the light because it more white.</li>
            <li>Also use it as sunscreen for pool time fun or gardening.</li>
            <li>I never was big on any kind of foundation type product.  </li>
            <li>I like it even though it is not fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right in &amp; does not leave a shine.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t gather in tiny lines, takes a light powder well, blends easily, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>The price was good, but the product is not a true tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like the look very much</li>
            <li>The color spreads out evenly and last for many hours.</li>
            <li>This product is so affordable and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Not only is it super affordable, but it goes on light, evens my skin tone, and protects from the sun, all in one.</li>
            <li>Obviously like any foundation, it might not be a good match for everyone, but I&#x27;m not real good at picking foundations that work for me, so something more forgiving is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This goes on so smoothly and gives a little glow, covers imperfections and is a 3in1, moisturizer, sunscreen, light foundation!  </li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I use, so I really don&#x27;t have a lot to compare.</li>
            <li>Feels fine (not too heavy) and blends in easily</li>
            <li>At age 50 plus, I don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>You really have to know the color to choose in this product.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin very greasy and provided zero coverage</li>
            <li>And it tints just a tad but doesn&#x27;t cover to much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it is really just tinted.moisturizer</li>
            <li>However the coverage is light for at home or perhaps grocery shopping, too sheer for work or outings..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much color to it.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to buy it online.  </li>
            <li>Light but enough coverage to even out blotchy skin.</li>
            <li>This Cg product is much thicker and does not spread and blend in very well.  </li>
            <li>very watery, doesnt cover anything.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t find it very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>it feels very greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really into mascara at that point</li>
            <li>the coverage is light, but it does even out my skin a bit, while providing me with a physical sunscreen (I can&#x27;t do chemical sunscreens).  </li>
            <li>All of this at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It can get a touch greasy in really hot weather, but compared to standard sunscreen, it&#x27;s actually less tacky/oily and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This product was outstandingly smooth, and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel suffocated like many other moisturizers and products I have used, especially the tinted kinds.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin smooth and feeling moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>You gets a pretty good amount of coverage with only a small (dime sized) dollop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not heavy like foundation and it conceals exactly what I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife loved how her skin felt after only a few days using it</li>
            <li>My only problem perhaps is that the covergirl medium shade is more of a tan especially the compact powder for shine control.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the texture is decent, and does the job.</li>
            <li>It provides s sheer coverage that I can put on quickly.</li>
            <li>I could see this being okay for someone who already has amazing skin and wants only a faint hint of color, but having some skin imperfections and issues with redness, this didn&#x27;t seem to help as much as the Laura Mercier does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me, even at the very affordable price point, because it seems to do next to nothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend CoverGirl Smoothers SPF 21 Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Is a little more matte like than the discontinued Neutrogena that I am replacing and not quite as moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The color is sheer and light, which is fine, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>, I get the wrong color or it looks too pasty on my face, this stuff is great</li>
            <li>I need more products like these for my everyday beauty routine.</li>
            <li>This is a portable, easy to use, and affordable solution for anybody who wears minimal make-up but still likes a nice even color with a little bit of daily sun protection.</li>
            <li>an easy way to get sheer coverage, even out your skin, and get some Sun Protection at the same time!</li>
            <li>Only a few times a week though but in love with it!</li>
            <li>My new fave foundation.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It gives just enough coverage to smooth things out, but I still need to spot-conceal any especially angry-looking blemishes.  </li>
            <li>it is very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, sheer yet subtle and smooths fine lines a bit.  </li>
            <li>But I do get pretty greasy within a few hours of using it, and I don&#x27;t think the coverage is worth buying this again.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and it leaves my face soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural on mature skin.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very smooth, not too thick and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>To begin this product goes on smooth with little to no greasiness.</li>
            <li>Some are so lightly tinted, you almost feel you need to reapply it while others are a little gooey or</li>
            <li>is my daily wear &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;; for work, I do layer BareMinerals Mineral Veil over it, just for a little more of a finished look</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it is so hard for me to find anymore.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a regular foundation; it&#x27;s not nearly as heavy nor does it provide as much coverage.  </li>
            <li>the color just doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin soft without making me breakout.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and have had no issues using this product.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s definitely NOT like the tinted moisturizer I used to get from Olay - a real shame</li>
            <li>skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel nearly as hydrating on my skin as the Laura Mercier does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also am very prone to broken out skin, and this did not make my skin more oily, nor did it make it break out after about a week of use, which is plenty of time for me to have noticed if it caused this issue.</li>
            <li>It was very, very sheer, so much so that it provided barely any coverage and made no noticeable improvements to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pricier brands but this wins hands down.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and the fact that it now says &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed the formulation from the old days when it was simply called a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And I do use an undereye concealer with it most days as well, but that might just be one of those things where I&#x27;m my own worst critic.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and she loved the added sunblock protection</li>
            <li> CoverGirl is a good brand of beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> On a good day though, I feel good wearing it by itself.</li>
            <li> Plus UV protection is always good.</li>
            <li> I think this might be a good moisturizer and not a  BB crean.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as good as I expect it too be</li>
            <li> This works good not one for wearing foundation</li>
            <li> so that is good.</li>
            <li> Then I heard that this stuff isn&#x27;t a good product anyways...</li>
            <li> Have ordered more than once - sign of a good product and happy customer.</li>
            <li> A medium light would be ideal.</li>
            <li> So happy this is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This item was perfect, my fiance has been looking for exactly this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Really amazing product.</li>
            <li> I think it will be liked.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; and it blended so nicely with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky with makeup products and do not like to spend money on things, but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be nice to have in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find it on Amazon for a good price, so</li>
            <li> Great under cover for nighttime makeup or alone for quick daytime errands.</li>
            <li> It applies to the skin very easy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to squeeze as well.</li>
            <li> My skin has &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; under tones and the light to medium was a good match.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is a nice feature, but most products have that these days.  </li>
            <li> , I find that when I wear this over Neutrogena Healthy Defense Moisturizer, I get even better results and both are cheap!!</li>
            <li> Knowing that I&#x27;d be returning to my full makeup bag at home, I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying duplicates of things I already owned and figured that perhaps I would even find an inexpensive solution to my beloved [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Feels very light weight on the face.</li>
            <li> The coverage is very light, so I do have to wear foundation over it because of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer not only worked but blended perfectly with her skin tone</li>
            <li> The CoverGirl Smoohters SPF 15 gives me a lovely glow and evens my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Its an okay bb cream</li>
            <li> I love the stuff</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but am impressed.  </li>
            <li> I wear this in lieu of foundation most days</li>
            <li> I can leave my house feeling confident that my skin is taken care of with this product.</li>
            <li> and to top it off.......GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.</li>
            <li> But it blended perfectly with my skin, made it feel soft, and it was so light that it didn&#x27;t feel like I had anything on my face.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like liquid make-up.  </li>
            <li> and I love mascara now, so</li>
            <li> , that is okay.</li>
            <li> I found exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, male or female,  CoverGirl Smoothers is one of the best ways to quickly and conveniently put your best face  forward.</li>
            <li> I am going to be able to use this even in summer as this includes sunscreen as well which is a huge relief as I don&#x27;t have to buy another cream for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic brands please make shades for us light to medium latinas (for those of us that are more beige than tan).</li>
            <li> I like how it feels light and is easy to apply, but with there were more color choices.</li>
            <li> I have used different products before and this one is not as good as for example Loreal!</li>
            <li> Covergirl has a true winner here!  </li>
            <li> As any other Cover Girl product, awesome!</li>
            <li> This tinted moisturizer has been a delightful find even for those of us with a few more crinkles than we want to share.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it clogs my pores at all, and it easily blends into my skin so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve caked the stuff on.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular, but it works good enough for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one positive thing I will say is that the SPF 21 was effective and did work well as a sunscreen, even though I was out and about in the sun on 80 degree</li>
            <li> , it is light, easy to apply, smooth on skin and does not leave patches.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon, since it&#x27;s hit or miss in most of the stores near me.</li>
            <li> Light, smooth, non-greasy, SPF included, extremely light coverage, never oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have anything on your face.  </li>
            <li> Cost-efficient, portable, and keeps your face-oil free.</li>
            <li> This gives a  smooth satin feel on the face.</li>
            <li> I like the light to medium tent.  </li>
            <li> This cannot be used in place of make-up of course (even though I don&#x27;t wear it), but is really great at evening out skin-tone and fixing some red areas which are caused by the acne medications I use.</li>
            <li> Really fabulous stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed names a couple times since I started buying it, but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
            <li> Light coverage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it over and over again, And the SPF is a great added bonus to my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the sun when I go outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s s light formula, so if you&#x27;re looking for thicker coverage, this isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li> I use both the light to medium and the darker shade in combination.  </li>
            <li> Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer - Oil Free Nude]]</li>
            <li> and it felt light when applied.  </li>
            <li> Because of its light weight compact design, I carry it in my bag everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed you don&#x27;t have to be real exact with the color</li>
            <li> And you have that added convenience of a moisturizer with an SPF that makes you feel that more much protected when in the sun.</li>
            <li> good for sun screen, but not big sunshine.</li>
            <li> but it is also just great for days when you don&#x27;t really want to wear makeup but want a little something on your face to even things out :-)</li>
            <li> It seems pretty light still.  </li>
            <li> All this while making my face look non-greasy which is very thrilling to me as my skin gets oily otherwise.</li>
            <li> I normally use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in Sand and thought the light to medium in CoverGirl would be fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t try the light because it more white.</li>
            <li> Also use it as sunscreen for pool time fun or gardening.</li>
            <li> I never was big on any kind of foundation type product.  </li>
            <li> I like it even though it is not fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right in &amp; does not leave a shine.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t gather in tiny lines, takes a light powder well, blends easily, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but the product is not a true tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like the look very much</li>
            <li> The color spreads out evenly and last for many hours.</li>
            <li> This product is so affordable and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Not only is it super affordable, but it goes on light, evens my skin tone, and protects from the sun, all in one.</li>
            <li> Obviously like any foundation, it might not be a good match for everyone, but I&#x27;m not real good at picking foundations that work for me, so something more forgiving is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This goes on so smoothly and gives a little glow, covers imperfections and is a 3in1, moisturizer, sunscreen, light foundation!  </li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I use, so I really don&#x27;t have a lot to compare.</li>
            <li> Feels fine (not too heavy) and blends in easily</li>
            <li> At age 50 plus, I don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> You really have to know the color to choose in this product.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin very greasy and provided zero coverage</li>
            <li> And it tints just a tad but doesn&#x27;t cover to much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it is really just tinted.moisturizer</li>
            <li> However the coverage is light for at home or perhaps grocery shopping, too sheer for work or outings..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much color to it.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> Light but enough coverage to even out blotchy skin.</li>
            <li> This Cg product is much thicker and does not spread and blend in very well.  </li>
            <li> very watery, doesnt cover anything.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t find it very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> it feels very greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really into mascara at that point</li>
            <li> the coverage is light, but it does even out my skin a bit, while providing me with a physical sunscreen (I can&#x27;t do chemical sunscreens).  </li>
            <li> All of this at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It can get a touch greasy in really hot weather, but compared to standard sunscreen, it&#x27;s actually less tacky/oily and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product was outstandingly smooth, and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel suffocated like many other moisturizers and products I have used, especially the tinted kinds.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin smooth and feeling moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> You gets a pretty good amount of coverage with only a small (dime sized) dollop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not heavy like foundation and it conceals exactly what I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife loved how her skin felt after only a few days using it</li>
            <li> My only problem perhaps is that the covergirl medium shade is more of a tan especially the compact powder for shine control.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the texture is decent, and does the job.</li>
            <li> It provides s sheer coverage that I can put on quickly.</li>
            <li> I could see this being okay for someone who already has amazing skin and wants only a faint hint of color, but having some skin imperfections and issues with redness, this didn&#x27;t seem to help as much as the Laura Mercier does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me, even at the very affordable price point, because it seems to do next to nothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend CoverGirl Smoothers SPF 21 Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Is a little more matte like than the discontinued Neutrogena that I am replacing and not quite as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The color is sheer and light, which is fine, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> , I get the wrong color or it looks too pasty on my face, this stuff is great</li>
            <li> I need more products like these for my everyday beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is a portable, easy to use, and affordable solution for anybody who wears minimal make-up but still likes a nice even color with a little bit of daily sun protection.</li>
            <li> an easy way to get sheer coverage, even out your skin, and get some Sun Protection at the same time!</li>
            <li> Only a few times a week though but in love with it!</li>
            <li> My new fave foundation.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It gives just enough coverage to smooth things out, but I still need to spot-conceal any especially angry-looking blemishes.  </li>
            <li> it is very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, sheer yet subtle and smooths fine lines a bit.  </li>
            <li> But I do get pretty greasy within a few hours of using it, and I don&#x27;t think the coverage is worth buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and it leaves my face soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural on mature skin.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very smooth, not too thick and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> To begin this product goes on smooth with little to no greasiness.</li>
            <li> Some are so lightly tinted, you almost feel you need to reapply it while others are a little gooey or</li>
            <li> is my daily wear &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;; for work, I do layer BareMinerals Mineral Veil over it, just for a little more of a finished look</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it is so hard for me to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a regular foundation; it&#x27;s not nearly as heavy nor does it provide as much coverage.  </li>
            <li> the color just doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin soft without making me breakout.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and have had no issues using this product.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s definitely NOT like the tinted moisturizer I used to get from Olay - a real shame</li>
            <li> skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel nearly as hydrating on my skin as the Laura Mercier does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also am very prone to broken out skin, and this did not make my skin more oily, nor did it make it break out after about a week of use, which is plenty of time for me to have noticed if it caused this issue.</li>
            <li> It was very, very sheer, so much so that it provided barely any coverage and made no noticeable improvements to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried pricier brands but this wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and the fact that it now says &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed the formulation from the old days when it was simply called a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And I do use an undereye concealer with it most days as well, but that might just be one of those things where I&#x27;m my own worst critic.  </li>
            <li> This one makes my face look much greasier than it is, not exactly sure why that happens, but I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many and they are often greasy or too dark, or too sheer, or the wrong color...</li>
            <li> At first I thought the bottle a little small but for the money you actually get quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers nicely, not too much so it doesn&#x27;t have a make up look to it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel natural and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> It does seem to have some smoothing effect with the look of my skin, and I haven&#x27;t broken out any more than usual with this.</li>
            <li> It is a good sunscreen and makeup base.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance is extremely mild and feels classy, which I have seen only in very expensive products.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it daily because it will give me a rash due to my chemical sensitivity,  </li>
            <li> It feels just like lotion but not greasy once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this is not too oily nor too dry.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> so it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> and so all my other makeup stays put all day, but on weekends or days I don&#x27;t feel like doing a lot of makeup</li>
            <li> and I experience absolutely no more discomfort while stretching my face especially.</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive and unable to wear sunscreen on my face because it causes various degrees of hives, itching, swelling as soon as I am in the sun!  </li>
            <li> Just enough tint to make the face look like a very small amount of make-up has been applied.</li>
            <li> This is not a full coverage product.  </li>
            <li> You get a lot of product for the money; a tube with daily use usually lasts me at least a couple months.  </li>
            <li> I find that dabbing a little grapeseed oil on my face before applying it helps to keep me from developing redness.</li>
            <li> I hate makeup, but need something to smooth my complexion...yet is has to require little effort, little time and little skill....</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> ; the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; works for me year round, even after vacations when I&#x27;m in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and even have an Amazon subscription to it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now, but cannot always find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday and have even recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I brought it from the drug store a few months ago.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical, because I have a very hard skin tone to match.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything bad, it just doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I do not wear make up usually at all.  </li>
            <li> In the past I used it  under foundation, but now (age 60+) I use it alone and like the results.</li>
            <li> Foundation make-up just feels too heavy!  </li>
            <li> Its hardly a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is one of my least favorites.</li>
            <li> The product does not claim to be non-comedogenic (does not cause acne) and that is a negative, because after using it twice, at age 62</li>
            <li> My primary use for this is as a moisturizer for the cruel winter weather.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for somebody who has a very uneven complexion, as it does not provide coverage.  </li>
            <li> I had never used a tinted moisturizer before, and was a little nervous is would make my skin tone look weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it frankly did very little for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This one blends into my skin without being visible, just faintly smoothing out my skin tone without looking or feeling like liquid cover makeup.</li>
            <li> If you hate to have heavy foundation on your face, but you need coverage to balance out your skin tone, I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> It is a weird orangey tint and too shiny to be on</li>
            <li> So, unfortunately I cannot continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> and since she is so pale the sunblock helps her from getting some nasty sun burns.</li>
            <li> it J&#x27;s mot bad at all thought I used it as a primer for my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> this was very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> To begin this product goes on smooth with little to no greasiness. You gets a pretty good amount of coverage with only a small (dime sized) dollop. The color spreads out evenly and last for many hours. I&#x27;d have to say this is a must have product for anyone who needs to do some touch up on the go or for the days when you are in a hurry. My wife loved how her skin felt after only a few days using it and since she is so pale the sunblock helps her from getting some nasty sun burns. At first I thought the bottle a little small but for the money you actually get quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: This is a portable, easy to use, and affordable solution for anybody who wears minimal make-up but still likes a nice even color with a little bit of daily sun protection. I&#x27;d say, male or female,  CoverGirl Smoothers is one of the best ways to quickly and conveniently put your best face  forward.</li>
            <li> By this time, we all have tried different tinted moisturizers. Some are so lightly tinted, you almost feel you need to reapply it while others are a little gooey or the color just doesn&#x27;t look natural.  This tinted moisturizer has been a delightful find even for those of us with a few more crinkles than we want to share.  I especially like to wear this product in the warmer weather.  It&#x27;s so light, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you have anything on your face.  And you have that added convenience of a moisturizer with an SPF that makes you feel that more much protected when in the sun.</li>
            <li> My new fave foundation.  At age 50 plus, I don&#x27;t need much.  This is perfect weight, color, and has benefits for my skin as well.  Doesn&#x27;t gather in tiny lines, takes a light powder well, blends easily, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> This is a tinted SPF moisturizer that I can like. I&#x27;ve tried so many and they are often greasy or too dark, or too sheer, or the wrong color...This one blends into my skin without being visible, just faintly smoothing out my skin tone without looking or feeling like liquid cover makeup. It can get a touch greasy in really hot weather, but compared to standard sunscreen, it&#x27;s actually less tacky/oily and more comfortable. I will be repurchasing this one.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very smooth, not too thick and not too greasy. Feels very light weight on the face. Cost-efficient, portable, and keeps your face-oil free. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. In fact, its one of only 2 beauty products I use daily. Can&#x27;t live without it. It covers nicely, not too much so it doesn&#x27;t have a make up look to it.</li>
            <li> been using this for years! hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> You really have to know the color to choose in this product.  I normally use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer in Sand and thought the light to medium in CoverGirl would be fine.  It is not even close.  My husband said I looked like a ghost and it was chalky.  I am going back to Laura Mercier.  The price was good, but the product is not a true tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the summer! Evens out skin tone while moisturizing and gives you spf protection with out using greasy sunblock.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon, since it&#x27;s hit or miss in most of the stores near me. I believe this basically used to be their &amp;#34;tinted moisturizer&amp;#34; before it became BB cream, but it feels like basically the same thing.  This isn&#x27;t a regular foundation; it&#x27;s not nearly as heavy nor does it provide as much coverage.  I&#x27;ve noticed you don&#x27;t have to be real exact with the color; the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; works for me year round, even after vacations when I&#x27;m in the sun a lot.  Obviously like any foundation, it might not be a good match for everyone, but I&#x27;m not real good at picking foundations that work for me, so something more forgiving is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily wear &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;; for work, I do layer BareMinerals Mineral Veil over it, just for a little more of a finished look and so all my other makeup stays put all day, but on weekends or days I don&#x27;t feel like doing a lot of makeup, I can wear this by itself without a problem.  It gives just enough coverage to smooth things out, but I still need to spot-conceal any especially angry-looking blemishes.  And I do use an undereye concealer with it most days as well, but that might just be one of those things where I&#x27;m my own worst critic.  You get a lot of product for the money; a tube with daily use usually lasts me at least a couple months.  Overall, I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years. It is a good sunscreen and makeup base. It is not meant to be a stand alone concealer. I have very sensitive skin and it leaves my face soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t get the hype it deserves! This goes on so smoothly and gives a little glow, covers imperfections and is a 3in1, moisturizer, sunscreen, light foundation!  I use this in place of foundation, I never like the way foundation looks on me, I get the wrong color or it looks too pasty on my face, this stuff is great and I get compliments all the time, I find that when I wear this over Neutrogena Healthy Defense Moisturizer, I get even better results and both are cheap!! Both are my go to!</li>
            <li> It does seem to have some smoothing effect with the look of my skin, and I haven&#x27;t broken out any more than usual with this. But I do get pretty greasy within a few hours of using it, and I don&#x27;t think the coverage is worth buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to my expectations.  It made my skin very greasy and provided zero coverage what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> This item was perfect, my fiance has been looking for exactly this product. As soon as I bought it for her and she put it on she loved it. The moisturizer not only worked but blended perfectly with her skin tone and she loved the added sunblock protection, I highly recommend CoverGirl Smoothers SPF 21 Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It feels just like lotion but not greasy once it&#x27;s dry. And it tints just a tad but doesn&#x27;t cover to much so I still put powder in. Pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Its hardly a tinted moisturizer. It has no effect on my skin apart from making it oily. It feels like I have rubbed oil on my face!</li>
            <li> CoverGirl is a good brand of beauty supplies. This gives a  smooth satin feel on the face. It applies to the skin very easy. Just enough tint to make the face look like a very small amount of make-up has been applied. The moisturize in this product is very good for the face. I like this tinted moisturizer. It is 2 products in one squeeze container. I like the light to medium tent.  Takes the guess work out of what color of make-up to get. Ladies try it I think it will be liked.</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive and unable to wear sunscreen on my face because it causes various degrees of hives, itching, swelling as soon as I am in the sun!  The CoverGirl Smoohters SPF 15 gives me a lovely glow and evens my skin tone. It is the only makeup product I can use on my face.  People say to me that I look &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; when I wear it.  I cannot use it daily because it will give me a rash due to my chemical sensitivity,  but I use it a couple of times a week when I want to look my best.  I find that dabbing a little grapeseed oil on my face before applying it helps to keep me from developing redness. I like that it has a low SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, CoverGirl!</li>
            <li> For this price, give it a shot. The coverage is very light, so I do have to wear foundation over it because of my skin. On a good day though, I feel good wearing it by itself. I haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in outbreaks. Nothing spectacular, but it works good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Not only is it super affordable, but it goes on light, evens my skin tone, and protects from the sun, all in one. Sometimes I&#x27;ll pair it with some powder but it is also just great for days when you don&#x27;t really want to wear makeup but want a little something on your face to even things out :-) I don&#x27;t feel like it clogs my pores at all, and it easily blends into my skin so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve caked the stuff on. All in all just a really great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Its an okay bb cream it is really just tinted.moisturizer but for the $7 it is the best deal around. I had no problems with it and it was quite affordable for being covergirl brand. However the coverage is light for at home or perhaps grocery shopping, too sheer for work or outings.. it J&#x27;s mot bad at all thought I used it as a primer for my powder foundation. Cosmetic brands please make shades for us light to medium latinas (for those of us that are more beige than tan). My only problem perhaps is that the covergirl medium shade is more of a tan especially the compact powder for shine control. I don&#x27;t try the light because it more white. A medium light would be ideal.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical, because I have a very hard skin tone to match. I ended up ordering the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; and it blended so nicely with my skin tone. This product was outstandingly smooth, and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel suffocated like many other moisturizers and products I have used, especially the tinted kinds. I also am very prone to broken out skin, and this did not make my skin more oily, nor did it make it break out after about a week of use, which is plenty of time for me to have noticed if it caused this issue. This cannot be used in place of make-up of course (even though I don&#x27;t wear it), but is really great at evening out skin-tone and fixing some red areas which are caused by the acne medications I use.</li>
            <li> The color is sheer and light, which is fine, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;ll try a CC next time.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff and I recommend it to everyone. an easy way to get sheer coverage, even out your skin, and get some Sun Protection at the same time! Really fabulous stuff</li>
            <li> Got what was advertised. I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of foundation so stuff like this is great for me. It&#x27;s fairly sheer but has enough of a tint to even me out if I feel like I need it. Plus UV protection is always good.</li>
            <li> Have ordered more than once - sign of a good product and happy customer.</li>
            <li> I use BB creams often, different brands.. This is one of my least favorites. Doesn&#x27;t do anything bad, it just doesn&#x27;t do much. This was on a great sale so I tried it. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I think this might be a good moisturizer and not a  BB crean. I have used different products before and this one is not as good as for example Loreal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tinted moisturizer for over 15 years now. It&#x27;s changed names a couple times since I started buying it, but it&#x27;s still the same great product. If you hate to have heavy foundation on your face, but you need coverage to balance out your skin tone, I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> Is a little more matte like than the discontinued Neutrogena that I am replacing and not quite as moisturizing. But I am happy. And it is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as good as I expect it too be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky with makeup products and do not like to spend money on things, but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I hate makeup, but need something to smooth my complexion...yet is has to require little effort, little time and little skill....this is it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great under cover for nighttime makeup or alone for quick daytime errands. Also use it as sunscreen for pool time fun or gardening.</li>
            <li> This works good not one for wearing foundation but this works just as well!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT. AND WILL KEEP USING IT.I LIKE THE IDEAL THAT YOU CAN BUY IT IN STORES OR ON LINE.</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturiser but I use foundation over too. It is a weird orangey tint and too shiny to be on it&#x27;s own. Hydrates well .</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it is so hard for me to find anymore.  I was very excited to find it on Amazon for a good price, so now I don&#x27;t have to worry about searching for it in stores once I run out.</li>
            <li> I do not wear make up usually at all.  I will wear this sometimes when I know I will be under bright lights when singing at church.  Seems to help with evening everything out.  Feels fine (not too heavy) and blends in easily so that is good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much color to it. It does make my skin soft without making me breakout.</li>
            <li> I never was big on any kind of foundation type product.  But figured a tinted moisturizer helps when you are in your 40&#x27;s.  Covergirl has a true winner here!  I have tried pricier brands but this wins hands down.  It&#x27;s light, sheer yet subtle and smooths fine lines a bit.  I wear it everyday and even have an Amazon subscription to it.  Don&#x27;t wast $ on department store brands like I did.  Try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for one day, but am impressed.  It absorbs right in &amp; does not leave a shine.  The coverage is very sheer, which is what I wanted under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product fro years and it is the best alternative for foundation, it is light, easy to apply, smooth on skin and does not leave patches.</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisturizer.  Light coverage. My skin has &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; under tones and the light to medium was a good match.  This is not a full coverage product.  I have sensitive combination skin and have had no issues using this product.</li>
            <li> This one makes my face look much greasier than it is, not exactly sure why that happens, but I will not be ordering this again. Otherwise the texture is decent, and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I like the way it applies and looks on my face it is very natural.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now, but cannot always find it in the stores.  It is so much easier to buy it online.  I don&#x27;t like regular makeup foundations.</li>
            <li> I only reapply if I&#x27;m using it as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wear this in lieu of foundation most days and it&#x27;s great. Light but enough coverage to even out blotchy skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great! it leaves my skin smooth and feeling moisturized all day long. I don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it over and over again, And the SPF is a great added bonus to my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the sun when I go outside. I can leave my house feeling confident that my skin is taken care of with this product. Very effective, great compact size and great price. I need more products like these for my everyday beauty routine. Oh and perfect shade for my skin too!!!! and to top it off.......GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> This product is so affordable and it is exactly what I wanted.  Keep in mind that this does not provide a ton of coverage... that is not the point of a tinted moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel awesome, and it just gives it an evened out finish.  This is not a good product for somebody who has a very uneven complexion, as it does not provide coverage.  It is perfect for me, though!</li>
            <li> This is a product that I&#x27;ve used for almost two years. It provides s sheer coverage that I can put on quickly. It&#x27;s s light formula, so if you&#x27;re looking for thicker coverage, this isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li> Um........I never got my package.......this was very disappointing. I want my money back!!!!! Is this like a scam or something????</li>
            <li> Nice and light. Keeps face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I had never used a tinted moisturizer before, and was a little nervous is would make my skin tone look weird. But it blended perfectly with my skin, made it feel soft, and it was so light that it didn&#x27;t feel like I had anything on my face. My co-workers even told me I was glowing! Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy like foundation and it conceals exactly what I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and have even recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definetely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years!  In the past I used it  under foundation, but now (age 60+) I use it alone and like the results. Foundation make-up just feels too heavy!  I use both the light to medium and the darker shade in combination.  A bit of powder lessens any shine.  The sunscreen is a nice feature, but most products have that these days.  So happy this is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s definitely NOT like the tinted moisturizer I used to get from Olay - a real shame they stopped selling it in the states.  This Cg product is much thicker and does not spread and blend in very well.  It&#x27;s more like liquid make-up.  I gave it two stars  - for color only.</li>
            <li> very watery, doesnt cover anything. Also is greasy, makes my face look a lot greasier even with powder. Only plus is the spf in it!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I use, so I really don&#x27;t have a lot to compare. I like it even though it is not fully absorbed. You can always touch your face and know it is there.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is really sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this! I used to put on moisturizer then foundation or powder.  Now I just use this tinted moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I accidentally forgot my makeup when leaving for a trip so I bought this because I needed an inexpensive replacement.  Knowing that I&#x27;d be returning to my full makeup bag at home, I didn&#x27;t want to commit to buying duplicates of things I already owned and figured that perhaps I would even find an inexpensive solution to my beloved [[ASIN:B00D58JIJI Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer - Oil Free Nude]] So I tried this product.  Unfortunately it frankly did very little for my skin.  It was very, very sheer, so much so that it provided barely any coverage and made no noticeable improvements to my skin.  I could see this being okay for someone who already has amazing skin and wants only a faint hint of color, but having some skin imperfections and issues with redness, this didn&#x27;t seem to help as much as the Laura Mercier does.  I also didn&#x27;t find it very moisturizing.  I still had to apply lotion underneath and it didn&#x27;t feel nearly as hydrating on my skin as the Laura Mercier does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive thing I will say is that the SPF 21 was effective and did work well as a sunscreen, even though I was out and about in the sun on 80 degree days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this just isn&#x27;t worth it to me, even at the very affordable price point, because it seems to do next to nothing.</li>
            <li> it feels very greasy on the skin. would not recommend it to any one with oil skin</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be nice to have in my drawer. But what showed up? Mascara. I wasn&#x27;t really into mascara at that point so it was a huge disappointment. Then I heard that this stuff isn&#x27;t a good product anyways... and I love mascara now, so I guess that&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I brought it from the drug store a few months ago. Only a few times a week though but in love with it! I have combination skin and this is not too oily nor too dry. I definitely will get another one when finished.</li>
            <li> As any other Cover Girl product, awesome! The color was perfect and It was so easy to blend. Makes my skin feel natural and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. The price is great also. I have used the same Cover Girl mascara for 10 years and I think I just found another one of their products I&#x27;m sticking with!!!</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s plus was that it combines facial moisturizer with a tinted cream.  I like the look very much and it felt light when applied.  The product does not claim to be non-comedogenic (does not cause acne) and that is a negative, because after using it twice, at age 62 my face  broke out.  So, unfortunately I cannot continue to use this product.  Don&#x27;t know what your experience will be.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Beware:  the coverage is light, but it does even out my skin a bit, while providing me with a physical sunscreen (I can&#x27;t do chemical sunscreens).  I have used this product for years, and the fact that it now says &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed the formulation from the old days when it was simply called a tinted moisturizer.  Looks very natural on mature skin.  Will continue to buy.  I do wish that they would stop testing on animals.</li>
            <li> Great coverage without being pastie in appearance.</li>
            <li> Never use foundation anymore. Buy NOTHING but this. Light, smooth, non-greasy, SPF included, extremely light coverage, never oily. Its the best of the &amp;#34;tinted moisturizers&amp;#34;, I think.</li>
            <li> I have it 3 stars because the tint doesn&#x27;t match at all.  I got medium.  It seems pretty light still.  I like how it feels light and is easy to apply, but with there were more color choices.</li>
            <li> I found exactly what I was looking for!!! My primary use for this is as a moisturizer for the cruel winter weather. I apply it every day before leaving for work and that&#x27;s it. It makes my skin feel so hydrated allllll day without wearing out and I experience absolutely no more discomfort while stretching my face especially. All this while making my face look non-greasy which is very thrilling to me as my skin gets oily otherwise. Now for the best part, it also makes my skin tone look uniform which is an added plus as I do not have time for additional foundation material. Also, the fragrance is extremely mild and feels classy, which I have seen only in very expensive products. I am going to be able to use this even in summer as this includes sunscreen as well which is a huge relief as I don&#x27;t have to buy another cream for that purpose. Because of its light weight compact design, I carry it in my bag everywhere ever I go. It is very easy to squeeze as well. All of this at an extremely reasonable price. Really amazing product. I will recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> good for sun screen, but not big sunshine. only got spf 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hardly cover your things on face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you just want to tint your face, that is okay.</li>
    </ol>
