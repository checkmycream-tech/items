            <li>Velvety smooth.</li>

            <li>No odor and easy to apply makeup right over.  </li>
            <li>Blends right in!</li>
            <li>The product that I got from my dermatologist is a very good heavy duty makup in the sun.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, but this particular sunscreen product is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>I love this all natural sunblock.  </li>
            <li>best facial sunscreen for active people.</li>
            <li>No other words, I just love it.</li>
            <li>I saw this one for fair skinned and ssumed it was still tinted, just not as dark.</li>
            <li>I tried a few samples of this last summer and was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, light, comfortable and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product, hope they can sale it in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>I would have given this a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t prefer the tinted one.</li>
            <li>This product is so sheer, it&#x27;s better than using nothing.</li>
            <li>It is very oil free, and I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>and I have combination skin- more on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This mineral cream really makes my makeup stay on all day and all night.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen does protect well, however it has a very matte finish</li>
            <li>The reviewer above is right!</li>
            <li>This product may be okay for someone who has dark skin but for me, I prefer the tinted one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has a high SPF, and I can wear it when I go to the beach or play in water park.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I like this product in general, however I usually buy the tinted kind.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The tinted formula is too dark for my light completion, so I prefer this one which has no tint.  </li>
            <li>Suppose I order the Tizo2 for light skin, but the company sent me for the dark skin one without any receipt or any papers for return .</li>
            <li>Thought it would be skintoned, but it is just clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on nearly invisible.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, which is completely under control - but sunscreens can give me whiteheads, blackheads, etc...</li>
            <li>I tend to react by eye tearing ( not the product&#x27;s fault), just sensitive to something in it.</li>
            <li>This is the only reason a rated it lowered since I don&#x27;t want to have paler skin than my normal skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love that this is not greasy or irritating for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This eliminates the soft white look this sunscreen can give your skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the darkness of the other one since it&#x27;s sheer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has given me more peace of mind, easy to put on, worth the money.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen since I have roscea. The reviewer above is right! This sunscreen does not cause eye make-up to run causing dark Raccoon eyes. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause that. Additionally, this one does not look shiny or greasy. It feels light and breathable. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it is both a sunscreen and a primer. However: because of the silicon-ey consistency, it&#x27;s tempting to just use a pea size amount, which is definitely not enough if you&#x27;re looking for solar protection. It is a fabulous primer -- I just add more sunscreen (Biore Sarasara or Skinceuticals Physical Fusion) to keep that horrible melasma at bay.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  It works well as a primer for make-up or wearing alone is nice as it evens your color.  It also has a nice consistency, not greasy and no fragrance which is perfect.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock for very sensitive skin- I really like it as a base, I mix it with my daytime moisturizer and I get great coverage and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! She spends a lot for her facial care and I totally understand. This product helps her keep looking beautiful. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be skintoned, but it is just clear. The product that I got from my dermatologist is a very good heavy duty makup in the sun.</li>
            <li> This mineral cream really makes my makeup stay on all day and all night.  I have a really bad problem with my eye makeup running.  When I put this on underneath, it&#x27;s like my makeup has been fused in place and doesn&#x27;t move til I take it off.  I tried a few samples of this last summer and was very impressed.  Buying it from this company worked well.  I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product, hope they can sale it in a bigger bottle, I take care of my skin, use it every single day&lt;br /&gt;no to many people put in in neck and chest, this one doesn&#x27;t feel oily, so you can put it</li>
            <li> This product may be okay for someone who has dark skin but for me, I prefer the tinted one.  The Tizo cream goes on very easy and is non-greasy. I would have given this a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t prefer the tinted one.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this for my daughter and it was the only sun protection that didn&#x27;t break her out.  She also did not burn with this sun screen.</li>
            <li> I like this product and would recommend. On my second tube. Have been using for 2 years. Goes on smooth.  No sunscreen odor.</li>
            <li> Packaging seems to have changed recently. Great sunscreen, gives skin a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my foundation if I am going to wear makeup. This eliminates the soft white look this sunscreen can give your skin. It does not sting or burn. I use both TiZO2 and TiZ03 depending on what I am doing. No makeup, I use TiZO3 mixed with my moisturizer. My dermatologist recommended the TiZO line to me.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product. 1. It is a physical blocker. 2. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. 3. It doesn&#x27;t have a tint. 4. It is very oil free, and I have sensitive combination skin. 5. It has a high SPF, and I can wear it when I go to the beach or play in water park. I will definitely buy this product again! Great product for this price!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Goes on like a primer under my foundation. I wear it every day rain or shine. It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, this is a gentle, greaseless and effective sunscreen; I&#x27;ve found nothing else quite like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on silky smooth and not greasy at all.  I live in Florida and I was happy to find something non greasy and light enough to put under my make up.  It goes on nearly invisible.  I am very please with this product.  I will it buy again.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely and my make up goes on top of it smoothly.  I have been using this product for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this particular sunscreen product is not my cup of tea. The sunscreen does protect well, however it has a very matte finish and I have combination skin- more on the dry side. It looks too white and doesn&#x27;t blend well with my make-up. It looks chalky.</li>
            <li> I love that this is not greasy or irritating for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for sensitive skin.  Blends right in!</li>
            <li> I received what I ordered but really prefer the tinted formula that was not available. Not sure why but I could not find it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, but before buying it on-line I purchased it from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  The price on-line with shipping was comparable to the price paid at the doctor&#x27;s office, but was much more convenient to purchase it on-line.</li>
            <li> Great texture. Velvety smooth. Absorbs well but does leave a little bit of white residue. Just throw a little bronzing powder on top and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I&#x27;ve been using Tizo 2 (purple package) overseas for 4 years now that I&#x27;m back in the states I searched but the dermatologist around here only carry the Tizo 2 Tinted Formula so I went ahead and bought from Amazon but when received it I was skeptic it if was authentic and when I started using it I didn&#x27;t like it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE TIZO 2 (Purple Package)</li>
            <li> Blocks out the sun wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my facialist.  It goes on matte, not shiny.  No odor and easy to apply makeup right over.  The tinted formula is too dark for my light completion, so I prefer this one which has no tint.  I have never gotten a sunburn on my face while using it.</li>
            <li> This product is so sheer, it&#x27;s better than using nothing. It&#x27;s smooth, light, comfortable and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. You would forget that you have it on, except that it feels so good.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, which is completely under control - but sunscreens can give me whiteheads, blackheads, etc... This product does not. It also gives a beautiful matte finish to the skin and I do not wear makeup when I am wearing this. By far the best looking sunscreen I have ever used and by far the nicest to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product in general, however I usually buy the tinted kind. I saw this one for fair skinned and ssumed it was still tinted, just not as dark. I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the darkness of the other one since it&#x27;s sheer. However, this one is not tinted at all, it&#x27;s white. The white actually leaves a white residue on my skin like zinc. This is the only reason a rated it lowered since I don&#x27;t want to have paler skin than my normal skin tone.</li>
            <li> No other words, I just love it.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered Tizo3  not 2  I wanted the tinted formula.  very disappointed.  Not at all what I wanted</li>
            <li> 1.  Its heavier than another product I use, BUT IS a good product-&lt;br /&gt;2. I tend to react by eye tearing ( not the product&#x27;s fault), just sensitive to something in it.</li>
            <li> The product was very good, this is my third one already. But I don&#x27;t like the company sent me the wrong item to me at this time . Suppose I order the Tizo2 for light skin, but the company sent me for the dark skin one without any receipt or any papers for return . That is the only thing I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Found it to be very effective and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural sunblock.  I have very sensitive skin and I apply this under my makeup and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was the tinted solar protection formula from Tizo. It is NOT. I wanted the Tizo3 not Tizo2 formula. Will not purchase again. ONLY the Tizo3.</li>
            <li> stays on all day even if it gets damp. best facial sunscreen for active people.</li>
            <li> Tizo was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  This stuff is fantastic.  My dermatologist says that chemical sunscreens convert UV rays to heat, which also has an aging affect.  Mineral based sunscreens just sit on the skin and reflect UV rays - and mineral-based also blocks ALL UV rays, not just a section of the spectrum of A or B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is micronized, so it goes on matte and actually smoothes my skin out.  It makes makeup easier to apply.  My dermatologist even wears it at night because it keeps moisture on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the best mineral-based sunscreen I have ever found!</li>
