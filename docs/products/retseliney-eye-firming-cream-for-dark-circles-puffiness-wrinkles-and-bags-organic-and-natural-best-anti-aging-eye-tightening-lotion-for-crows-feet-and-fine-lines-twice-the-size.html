    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very creamy and smoothing eye cream. It has a very silky feeling upon application and absorbs well into my skin. I like that it has a pump for just the right amount to be dispensed based on your needs. I have been using this for a few weeks and have been using it at night as well as in the morning under my makeup. It does not interfere with my makeup application which I like. There are some eye creams that cause creasing of my makeup and this does not do that. There is no scent which is great and does not irritate my eyes.  I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts, opinions or experience.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff it&#x27;s very easy to use. I have very dark circles under my eyes and nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before has worked. Well this has and I don&#x27;t even use it every day. I use it about 4-5 times a week and the circles under my eyes are getting lighter and lighter. I would use it every day but I forget to pack it sometimes when I go to work. I&#x27;m amazed at how much I love this product and it only takes a small amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get the seller contact option but I do not see it on my order. This also irritates the skin around my eyes. I have never had any skill n allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and, unfortunately I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too soon....</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my face feel like silk ! I will keep using it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.. I&#x27;ve used it a for three days now. Morning and night. Don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; yet a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing in three weeks the lines and bags under my eyes were gone. It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t do much for my dark,but I will continue buying this product and trying new one from this company.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in the area around the eye.</li>
            <li> I started using this product recently and have not noticed it help my face. I am not satisfied and will have to purchase a different cream.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I am really, really happy with this Eye Cream.  I have autoimmune problems and many food sensitivities.  Over the years,  the swelling and inflammation caused by that has made my skin loose , dry and with dark circles.  Most eye creams will have some results on my skin,  but a lot of that is just because the skin is dry and the moisture helps that.  Of course,  some are better than others and some absorb differently...or not at all.

That makes it great for using before makeup.  When it moisturizes and tightens the skin,  the slightly dark shadow around them is virtually gone.

That is very important for me to be a customer.  The cream is full of numerous known beneficial oils and vitamins ,  along with other advanced formulas that feed and nourish that sensitive skin area.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this eye cream,  it&#x27;s my new favorite thing.  I am really loving the products that this company puts out .&lt;br /&gt;I received this eye cream free for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are 100% my own and I highly recommend it.</li>

It absorbs right into your skin and leaves it moisturized, not greasy.  Firms and tightens my fine lines.  I love that the ingredients are natural and organic.  Amazing company with great products.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> RETSELINEY believes in nature and nature&#x27;s way of caring for us. Their products are 100% natural and organic with absolutely no non-organic additives. Are they stable without the usual stabilizing elements (parabens, phtalates, sulfates, etc)? Absolutely. One look at the packaging and the product and the fresh scent of each and you know you are in safe hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETSELINEY makes a fine assortment of products of skin care so you can find the one that suits you best. I have tried five products they were gracious enough to sent me for an unbiased review and I have found all five equally excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is an eye firming cream - something to use as age and lack of proper sleep or even staring into a computer screen all day creates those bags or dark circles under the eyes. This product is made of Matryxil 3000, MSM, Vitamins C,E and B5, Rosehip Oil, CoQ10, Blueberry Extract, Cocoa Butter, Avocado Oil, Calendula, Lavender, Flaxseed Oil and more but does not contain artificial dyes, parabens, phthalates, fragrances or sulfates: pure and organic. Applying this cream is a small amount with the tip of the finger in a circular massaging motion immediately feels refreshing. The results/changes take a couple of weeks or so before the effect promised happens - but then the feeling of looking into a mirror and being free of the bags you&#x27;ve been carrying around is a very satisfying and healthy feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another excellent product from RETSELINEY  you can depend on to deliver what it promises. Grady Harp, April 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me gratis for an unbiased review</li>
            <li> It smelled good,light weight and definitely diminished the fine lines. It partially help with the puffiness. I&#x27;m having a hard time dispensing the product, so I just open the pump. Otherwise, this would have been a 5star product.</li>
            <li> This cream is very penetrating but did little for those morning puffy eyes, or dark circles.  I think for the younger group 20+ it would be better,&lt;br /&gt;but for aged , mature skin 50+ it just isnt enough.  But I do like this company. They contact you through email after purchase and invite feedback, which is above average.  I would suggest a heavier penetrating hydration eye cream for a more mature 50+ skin, or for those even younger&lt;br /&gt;who have been heavy sunbathers this one will not deliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and am noticing firmness, less puffiness. Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
            <li> Have only been using this eye cream for a few days and I am loving it so far.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this Firming Eye Cream mainly on my eye area. If I have excess, I use it on the deep lines around my mouth. It may also be used on the neck or any part of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a light, pleasant scent. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. I use it in combination with some of Retseliney’s other products at night. After cleansing my skin, I use their Retinol Serum, then the Retinol Moisturizer and end with this Firming Eye Cream. This combination has made my skin feel soft and smooth. It has evened up my skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;These products all work together so I can’t say that there’s only one of their products that has firmed up my skin, reduced the fine lines around my eyes and softened the laugh lines around my mouth. I recommend using several of their products in combination.</li>
