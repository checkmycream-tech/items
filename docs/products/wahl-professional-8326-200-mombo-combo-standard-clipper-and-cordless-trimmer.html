    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>As a stylist for almost 10 years now, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Come with perfect guards that tell the length it will cut.</li>
            <li>you think in one this is the best choice</li>
            <li>I purchased this wahl combo and it was very good in manufacturing also the trimmer was excellent</li>
            <li>This is a real nice set.</li>
            <li>The clipper is still great.  </li>
            <li>and they still work great.</li>
            <li>It has worked great</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a great set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>and I both have done a fair share of hair</li>
            <li>but I felt it would be good to have some anyhow, just in case.</li>
            <li>These clippers do a great job and the included trimmer gets the fine</li>
            <li>When one gets adept at using these clippers, it can save some trips to the barber shop.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t know what or how to order this kind of product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a kind that a &#x27;&#x27;barber&#x27;&#x27; would use . .</li>
            <li>The guides make it very easy to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Top quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks I love them great seller</li>
            <li>Maybe even better.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a hair stylist and this is her favorite set of clippers and trimmers.  </li>
            <li>They are lightyears better than these and are used by barbers a lot more often than Wahl is (I&#x27;m sure there is a reason for that.)</li>
            <li>When those died, I knew I had to go to something better.</li>
            <li>If I measure the noise level when the clipper is able to cut, it will be almost 100decibel.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use the clipper since I bought it as I don&#x27;t want to damage my ear drums.</li>
            <li>Love the cordless edgers.</li>
            <li>Very nice set, has a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, and cuts very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>its a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering it again very soon.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on schedule and was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would say anyone could buzz cut a head of hair easily from bald to an inch.</li>
            <li>This item is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The cordless fine trimmer works well for sideburns, etc</li>
            <li>but I was very pleased when they arrived looking and feeling just like the classic pair I&#x27;ve been using at home for my beard and body hair (t.m.i.?)</li>
            <li>You have to follow the instruction and adjust to remove the clattering sound.</li>
            <li>My youngest son was so impressed with this set he took the time to call me up after the first time he borrowed them to comment on how much better they work than anything we had owned previously.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s pretty easy to do that smoothly.  </li>
            <li>But she still does a good job by pulling it away from my head, and it cuts well enough</li>
            <li>It cuts so well and so quickly because of the quality of the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>I also needed a nice rechargeable trimmer which I use daily.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pleased with it in every way so far.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap set for many years, and finally bought this one.  </li>
            <li>The little rechargeable trimmer is fine too, and handy.</li>
            <li>I would very much appreciate your input.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never used clippers at the salon because it&#x27;s higher end</li>
            <li>These are thee exact quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you are willing to try to cut hair, you can do a great job with this - everyone in our family gets haircuts from these clippers, so they do save a lot of money in the long run.</li>
            <li>When I finally got the voltage converter I tested the clipper, made the adjustment according to manufacturer&#x27;s description to be able to control the noise level but to no avail.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; in the item title made me think I was getting a better set of clippers than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying every 5 years or so at Walmart, but when they arrived, they are pretty much the same as the Walmart versions with an included cordless</li>
            <li>but it is the quality of the cut that really impresses me.</li>
            <li>These clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li>I immediately returned them and went with the Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are more expensive clippers on Amazon, but I can&#x27;t imagine that they do the job better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and these clippers are much more heavy duty than others I have used.  </li>
            <li>In fact I should have given it one star but because the shaver that came with it is functioning effeciently that&#x27;s why I have to live it on two star.</li>
            <li>I got a different kid of Whals in my first kit from the school.</li>
            <li>Wow, it makes all the difference!  </li>
            <li>When I unscrewed the adjustment to obtain a certain high noise and then screwed back to reduce the noise, the noise could not be reduced.</li>
            <li>I spent the last two years using cheap department store clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this set so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut.  </li>
            <li>a hair clipper that can skin the hair completely off the head.  </li>
            <li>Even if his hair gets too long they still cut very well.</li>
            <li>I discovered that the clipper cuts effectively at high noise levels than when the noise is as low as being silent.</li>
            <li>One more thing, the clipper attachment&#x27;s plastic is not as sturdy or thick of plastic as some of other ones I had</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have owned several sets of store quality clippers over the years. My son&#x27;s and I both have done a fair share of hair cuts over the years. My youngest son was so impressed with this set he took the time to call me up after the first time he borrowed them to comment on how much better they work than anything we had owned previously.</li>
            <li> Top quality. Cuts well. Little bit bulky, heavier than others but it is the quality of the cut that really impresses me. Note that it is the trimmer that is cordless, NOT the clipper. The minor downside is that it doesn&#x27;t include a case. When you turn it on initially, it has a beginning clattering noise which is gone after one second. You have to follow the instruction and adjust to remove the clattering sound. So don&#x27;t be alarm by the clatter which sounds like a piece of plastic just shattered. One more thing, the clipper attachment&#x27;s plastic is not as sturdy or thick of plastic as some of other ones I had but it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny I paid for it.  In less than one year it paid for itself.  I use it to cut my husbands hair every 4 - 6 weeks and the trimmer holds a charge for a long time.  It cuts so well and so quickly because of the quality of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I world never go back to a consumer level product again after having this \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; product.  Only draw back from the consumer version is you don&#x27;t get a video tape and a case to hold all the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/19/2012.  This item is still going strong.  The clipper is still great.  The only problem now is the trimmer which has a nicad battery which only lasts 3-5 years.  It is not holding a charge like it used to.  I would never get a trimmer again that is not electric.  Rather than pay for a battery and shipping I will try and track down the same type of trimmer in an electric one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used this for a few years, and I just want to say that it is a high quality item, made in the USA.  The little rechargeable trimmer is fine too, and handy.</li>

            <li> Thanks I love them great seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pair of Wahl clippers, that I still use at home, and have for about 17 years. I thought they died the other day but I oiled them and had to shimmy the blades a bit and they still work great. I am a hairdresser and I&#x27;ve never used clippers at the salon because it&#x27;s higher end so I use scissors and comb but I felt it would be good to have some anyhow, just in case. I also needed a nice rechargeable trimmer which I use daily. It has worked great, I&#x27;m pleased with it in every way so far. The clippers have not been used and I cannot say when they will but I was very pleased when they arrived looking and feeling just like the classic pair I&#x27;ve been using at home for my beard and body hair (t.m.i.?) For years. I&#x27;d recommend this set so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased in 2011. I have not seen a barber since. It has paid for itself several times over. It you buzz your hair and have a partner to touch up the back for you... I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> These clippers work very well.  I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and these clippers are much more heavy duty than others I have used.  Even if his hair gets too long they still cut very well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut.  Product arrived on schedule and was easy to use.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a stylist for almost 10 years now, these are perfect. I got a different kid of Whals in my first kit from the school. These are thee exact quality. Maybe even better. Come with perfect guards that tell the length it will cut. And cleaning brush with oil. I would say anyone could buzz cut a head of hair easily from bald to an inch. A tad longer if the handle on the side is raised. Happy with my purchase. Way less expensive then buying at a store, beauty supply or individually.</li>
            <li> When one gets adept at using these clippers, it can save some trips to the barber shop. Someone with children could save some money.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. She&#x27;s a hair stylist and this is her favorite set of clippers and trimmers.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of clippers.  I had a cheap set for many years, and finally bought this one.  Wow, it makes all the difference!  It&#x27;s so easy to use, and cuts very cleanly.  The guides make it very easy to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  I have saved hundreds of dollars by cutting his hair at home over the years.  I do wish it came with a few longer guides (the longest is 1 inch) because now my daughter is cutting my hair with the clippers, and while I have short hair, it&#x27;s not quite that short!  But she still does a good job by pulling it away from my head, and it cuts well enough that it&#x27;s pretty easy to do that smoothly.  Overall, if you are willing to try to cut hair, you can do a great job with this - everyone in our family gets haircuts from these clippers, so they do save a lot of money in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is a real nice set. I purchased this for my daughter and her family. She absolutelly loves it. I could not have picked out a nicer set for the money!</li>
            <li> Totally NOT this company&#x27;s problem.  I just didn&#x27;t know what or how to order this kind of product.  The beard trimmer is great.  It&#x27;s just that I had expected the hair clipper to have the same cutting abilities but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m looking for a kind that a &#x27;&#x27;barber&#x27;&#x27; would use . . a hair clipper that can skin the hair completely off the head.  Maybe you could suggest something else in the Wahl line or perhaps another brand altogether.  I would very much appreciate your input.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; in the item title made me think I was getting a better set of clippers than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying every 5 years or so at Walmart, but when they arrived, they are pretty much the same as the Walmart versions with an included cordless trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;One of the guards for the full size clippers was missing upon arrival from Amazon, and one of the edge teeth for the trimmer guard was broken off as well. I immediately returned them and went with the Oster Fast Feed clippers. They are lightyears better than these and are used by barbers a lot more often than Wahl is (I&#x27;m sure there is a reason for that.)</li>
            <li> i like it because a friend introduced it to me recently saying its a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering it again very soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wahl combo and it was very good in manufacturing also the trimmer was excellent I suggest that it you think in one this is the best choice</li>
            <li> I spent the last two years using cheap department store clippers. When those died, I knew I had to go to something better. These clippers do a great job and the included trimmer gets the fine points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more expensive clippers on Amazon, but I can&#x27;t imagine that they do the job better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper without checking for the voltage specifications. It is rated 110V. In my country we have a voltage range of 220V/240V. Then I had to order a voltage converter (VCT VTM-150UK-Deluxe 220V/240V Step Down Travel Voltage Converter) that will step down our 220/240V to 110V which the clipper can operate with. It took me another shipment to put the clipper to use. When I finally got the voltage converter I tested the clipper, made the adjustment according to manufacturer&#x27;s description to be able to control the noise level but to no avail. When I unscrewed the adjustment to obtain a certain high noise and then screwed back to reduce the noise, the noise could not be reduced. I discovered that the clipper cuts effectively at high noise levels than when the noise is as low as being silent. If I measure the noise level when the clipper is able to cut, it will be almost 100decibel. This could damage the eardrum over prolonged usage. I adjusted severally but couldn&#x27;t get the noise reduced. I haven&#x27;t been able to use the clipper since I bought it as I don&#x27;t want to damage my ear drums. In fact I should have given it one star but because the shaver that came with it is functioning effeciently that&#x27;s why I have to live it on two star.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, has a very close shave. Love the cordless edgers. Doesnt come with a case suggest you have one before you buy.</li>
