            <li>My family are faithful users since Summer 2012.&lt;br /&gt;**VALUE: I believe the $20ish bucks is a great value for the amount of &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; in the 32oz bottle.</li>

            <li>AMAZING ORGANIC Shampoo!  </li>
            <li>We have not had an issue with lice since we started using Fairly Tales Shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We just switched the kids shampoo with this, it&#x27;s got a good smell, cleans and lathers well, lasts over 6 months of showers/baths 4-6 times a week.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Really, REALLY good product.</li>
            <li>tried the conditioner too and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>good product/ serves its purpose</li>
            <li>I am now using it too because my hair feels so good after.  </li>
            <li>Needed a good conditioning shampoo for my kids</li>
            <li>and I do head checks weekly with licefreee - with the combo they have been good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moral of the story: vigilance is good, paranoia is not.</li>
            <li>The bottle and lid are of good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy, thanks!</li>
            <li>We continue to be head lice free at this time!!</li>
            <li>Also love the pump!</li>
            <li>who could ask for more!</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it!</li>
            <li>Update (May 2015): LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Very important to have a good lice comb though.</li>
            <li>It smells great and my kids enjoy washing their hair with it...</li>
            <li>You can also make your own prevention spray by adding tea tree oil (5 drops to 1 ounce) to your kids shampoo, conditioner, detangler and hairspray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pesticide-based products (like Rid &amp; Nix) are no longer effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pesticide-based products (like Rid &amp; Nix) are no longer effective.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and keeps the chemicals out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>Nice to have something not loaded with garbage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot say enough how great and happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells more like rosemary than citronella, which is good).</li>
            <li>I will continue using fairy tales for my own peace of mind.</li>
            <li>best place to do do a head-check is outside in bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>best place to do do a head-check is outside in bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>We used no heavy chemicals and the hair is shiny and the smell in great and the kids are happy.</li>
            <li>There is an herbal scent, but I find it light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully and leaves hair clean, soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>When you buy the 32 oz, it also comes with a pump so it is very easy to pump the shampoo out to your palm.  </li>
            <li>love it, and I will continue to use it until I find something better!</li>
            <li>It is very important to learn how to use the lice comb correctly so it is effective at removing all the nits and lice.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved the fragrance of this shampoo and felt her hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>Since using fairy tales, my hair has NEVER been more amazing.</li>
            <li>However once you rinse and it dries the scent isn&#x27;t too strong at all!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li>Smells natural, does a GREAT job of getting in her hair, makes it feel good</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling nice and clean!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>You will spend more on getting rid of lice than you will buying this shampoo/conditioner to prevent them.</li>
            <li>This of course isn&#x27;t a fix all cure for lice, however it&#x27;s better knowing there is a chance your kids won&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>I use this for my daughter’s curly hair, and it works so much better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li>I would love to say this product works, but it does not.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
            <li>Even when our lice issue goes away, I will definitely be buying again, both for preventative purposes and for the fact that it makes my hair feel and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>know many people don&#x27;t like the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this shampoo and am STOKED to have found this &amp;#34;unlikely&amp;#34; product for my hair :)))</li>
            <li>We love this shampoo for the kids.</li>
            <li>have already recommended this product to my friends :)</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>It took many weeks to get rid of the lice</li>
            <li>(many hours of checking their hair, washing and drying bed sheets and stuffed animals)</li>
            <li>Smells refreshing</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m confident it works.</li>
            <li>we stayed lice free!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the rosemary smell of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>We bought this as more of a prevention than a remedy since one of my kids classmate had a &amp;#34;a bug in the hair.&amp;#34;  I would buy again even just for the thought of comfort and my daughter likes how it smells.</li>
            <li>Once this bottle is gone, we won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>And I love that it works, both in terms of cleaning and in keeping lice at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I know there are many factors involved with head lice</li>
            <li>Smells great, my girls and I like to use it, and it lathers up quite nicely for a natural shampoo with no SLS.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I have my kids use this twice a week just to keep the bugs away :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product...</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Many students in the class had re-occurring infestations throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I send my kids to school now in peace :-)</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your kid rinses his/her hair after washing/conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold for sure.</li>
            <li>My girls actually love the smell, which I was worried about them not liking it.</li>
            <li>Shampoo has a lovely fragrance that isn&#x27;t over-powering.</li>
            <li>The most notable fragrances are lavender and rosemary.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So it needs an effective shampoo and conditioner that will rinse out cleanly.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, but leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair with a white residue like the cheap hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING and well worth</li>
            <li>There are others available, but it is the top rated nit and lice comb out</li>
            <li>I love this product, leaves my granddaughter&#x27;s hair smooth, shinny and silky.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working great to repel the lice from the outbreak they are having at her school.</li>
            <li>(combing is the most important part of getting rid of and keeping lice away) and using fairy tales shampoo ever since.</li>
            <li>Two elementary school kids in the house, many more in the neighborhood; one of all these kids always has lice year in year out and thus, ping-pong effect on my two kids.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you smell the shampoo out of the bottle it is strong....</li>
            <li>I noticed some of the reviews said that the smell was terribly strong, but I disagree.</li>
            <li>But this is a good natural product and we love it.</li>
            <li>All seemed fine for almost two months, but my child still ended up with head lice.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely fine and this shampoo works well for her.</li>
            <li>shampoo has a natural smell which is really pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean, smells very nice, and so far seems to be tear-free.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle and came with a pump to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughters hair was extremely smooth after using the product and her hair had a light after scent.</li>
            <li>professionals use and recommend the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb (Available on Amazon).</li>
            <li>your child has just been treated for lice, it is extremely important to:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>That said, it is still important to know how to do thorough head-checks.</li>
            <li>That said, it is still important to know how to do thorough head-checks.</li>
            <li>It is very herby and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Works great on my kids&#x27; hair and no lice even though several classmates do have continuing head lice.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works well as just a regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I feel comfortable having my children use this product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love the scent and it leaves their hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>We stayed lice free when there was an epidemic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more herbal than I like, but again, well worth using.  </li>
            <li>, we are still lice free.</li>
            <li>I have been lice free for 3 weeks now, still combing my hair once a week</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait until the kids get lice to try it, it is an excellent everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Additionally outside of the lice prevention - the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>This bottle lasted us an ENTIRE school year for all three of my kids, and when lice was going around their classrooms, I&#x27;m happy to say that none of them got it.</li>
            <li>Since school has been out, lice free.    </li>
            <li>We use this as part of a weekly routine of keeping the kids in the house lice free.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more while my kids are still in elementary school.</li>
            <li>Bought this primarily on the &amp;#34;help</li>
            <li>This is my children&#x27;s primary shampoo.</li>
            <li>We had a light case of lice</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>If you buy this shampoo do it because it smells good, is all natural, made in America and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product and I do recommend it to anyone, HOWEVER when the package arrived the lid was completely off of the bottle</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the scent, but if it protects my girls from lice, then great!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old is able to wash and rinse her own hair now and never complains about the soap stinging her eyes</li>
            <li>Thanks Fairy Tales!!!</li>
            <li>people have found treatments with coconut or olive oil mixed with tea tree oil to be very effective at killing the lice (not the nits).</li>
            <li>people have found treatments with coconut or olive oil mixed with tea tree oil to be very effective at killing the lice (not the nits).</li>
            <li>and we are free and clear of any love in the house!</li>
            <li>I originally started using it when they had a lice scare at preschool.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re kid is in a lice infected elementary school, buy this now and use it today!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and since it&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school.</li>
            <li>I can also say that I like the smell and that it makes all of our hair feel clean and look shiny.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your hair CLEAN.</li>
            <li>and I literally could not believe how incredibly soft, healthy, and shiny my hair was!</li>
            <li>and I did NOT want it coming home with us (who does, right?)!  </li>
            <li>I use this all the time love it will buy this again when I use up what I have thanks</li>
            <li>and that is good enough but seeing as how I paid for a full bottle I should have received a full unopened bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle is big too, good value.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves his hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair clean, healthy and completely lice free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure no bug would want to live in hair that smells like this!</li>
            <li>I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products .  </li>
            <li>has very fine, soft baby hair</li>
            <li>In fact, lice actually prefer clean hair because they can move around more freely.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember about effective combing is to divide the hair into small sections and comb each section from all directions.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember about effective combing is to divide the hair into small sections and comb each section from all directions.</li>
            <li>and I use this stuff religiously just to be safe!</li>
            <li>Lice do not care about what kind of house we live in, our economic status, our level of cleanliness etc...  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!t&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school.</li>
            <li>Its very calming and doesn&#x27;t smell too girly (an important thing when you have 2 boys)</li>
            <li>This method involves saturating your child&#x27;s hair with the mixture, working it through the hair, covering it with a plastic cap and sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;The most important part of treating lice (regardless of your initial treatment method) is to learn to use your lice comb correctly and comb every day for two to three weeks.</li>

            <li>Elementary schools always seem to have a lice problem until summer.</li>
            <li>The most important point so far, we have been lice and/or bug free so far.</li>
            <li>Does not actually repel but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>Worth each penny.  </li>
            <li>I worked at an elementary school where kids would have lice some weeks.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but daily use gave my daughter dandruff.</li>
            <li>Head lice has been running rampant in my kids&#x27; elementary school for two years now.  </li>
            <li>Love this product because it&#x27;s natural and will hopefully do the job of repelling lice.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I was officially informed that in my daughter&#x27;s class lice are running wild, but she was lice free, yeah!</li>
            <li>and I should have read the full ingredient list; looking this up on EWG first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look for something that is more natural.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and adds extra confidence about avoiding lice from school/daycare.</li>
            <li>but it seems worth it to prevent it if I can.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to order this shampoo because of the price, but it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the &amp;#34;peace of mind&amp;#34; for prevention when lice is going around the kids school.</li>
            <li>the mill kids shampoo isn&#x27;t worth it to us.</li>
            <li>Yes, I tend to react strongly to creepy-crawlies.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few friends suggested Fairy Tales and though it seemed too good to be true, I grabbed the large size bottle of shampoo after I resolved the immediate problem.  </li>
            <li>I was too quick to buy this when I heard that lice was &#x27;going around&#x27; and didn&#x27;t do my research first.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels very clean and soft when done and rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of the lice prevention selling point, it smells lovely and works great as a general shampoo for the kids, year round.</li>
            <li>Very well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Regardless If You See Lice or Nits.&lt;br /&gt;According to lice professionals, this is the most important prevention technique we can ever do because it is extremely easy to miss lice and nits, especially if an outbreak is in the early stages.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right after kids return to school from any break (summer, Christmas, spring etc</li>
            <li>: Again, I want to make the point that it is important to know how to do a thorough head check, but current thinking is that combing with a lice comb is far more important than just checking.</li>

            <li>It smells fresh and vibrant and clean- healthy….and</li>
            <li>Its not a guarantee lice-free protection, but it certainly helps!  </li>
            <li>Squeaky clean, smells great, and there&#x27;s no ice cold feeling by leaving it in a bit longer for use as bug repellant (works for most buzzing type bugs) and for repelling head lice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, shampoo itself is decent and gets hair clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>and I did not want to expose my daughter again to Rid or any other chemical shampoo, so I searched and gave this shampoo a try and we, the kids and I, are so happy with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and its gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>but it makes me feel better psychologically.</li>
            <li>Make sure the tips of the comb stays on the scalp across the entire section before you pull the hair through the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>

            <li>It made my hair feel soft and light -</li>
            <li>Used the chemical stuff at first, but didn&#x27;t want to continue to use.  </li>
            <li>I now buy it in bulk for my whole house!</li>
            <li>husband has male pattern baldness and it works on his remaining hair too :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo especially during the school year and for daycare kids.</li>
            <li>I also hope that it will really repel the lice (which we have not yet had in the house!).</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The seller provided exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>My younger son ALWAYS sleeps better when we use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love these products we started with the smaller sizes but after my daughters class had two lice incidents my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice, i will contain to buy and brag!!</li>
            <li>Did it 2 days later again, found one more nymph, and after that every creature was gone.  </li>
            <li>My kids LOVE the smell (it&#x27;s definitely got an herbal smell to it -- but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>this is the first incident we have had.</li>
            <li>When the first outbreak hit, I loaded up on this stuff, the spray, and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Both girls have gone through preschool, and the oldest is going into first grade this fall--not one hint of lice, despite outbreaks in the schools each spring and fall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that hairspray and the use of additional styling products (i.e., hair \\&quot;coatings\\&quot;) help to repel lice, and I do apply styling products to their hair, but not on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it comes in such a large size (with pump).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been using a natural remedy of apple cider vinegar (ACV) to leave my scalp and hair squeaky clean WITHOUT drying it out.</li>
            <li>It makes their hair feel really clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li>It really is soft on the hair and feels clean.</li>
            <li>Unless a child has an advanced case of lice, the chances of actually seeing lice or nits in a 30-second head check is rare.</li>

            <li>We love the smell, it&#x27;s gentle enough for the baby, everyone loves it, and it doesn&#x27;t have any junk in it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, even for thick hair, and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li>At first the rosemary and other scents seemed strong - but as we&#x27;ve used it - both boys like it and it smells clean.  </li>
            <li>So my daughters about ready to start preschool (after being watched by her nana the first 3years of her life)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m petrified to say the least to think about my daughter catching lice!</li>
            <li>And i have long curly hair that lice tend to love.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend every parent use it all year long as it conditions the hair too.</li>
            <li>smells good but not sure it really repels, my daughter still winded up getting lice even after use.</li>
            <li>is the kind of hair spray that leaves the hair super hard that my daughter complains.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one happy momma to say the least!</li>
            <li>My son has short, fine hair</li>
            <li>My son has short, fine hair</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to several other moms who successfully maintain lice-free households.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh and we don&#x27;t have to use a lot -- it seems like it is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>As I was leaving the center I made sure to purchase a large bottle of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So far so good but does  make the hair a little greasy looking</li>
            <li>The professionals now use enzyme based products for their initial treatment (available with all the product lines I mentioned</li>
            <li>The professionals now use enzyme based products for their initial treatment (available with all the product lines I mentioned</li>
            <li>Although, I can&#x27;t really say weather or not it keeps lice away because we have not been traumatized by those yet</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Tried so many products and spent lot of money but no use.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hair and eyes, doesn&#x27;t aggravate their eczema and it leaves no residue in their hair.</li>
            <li>I have found that I can skip the whole flea treatment craziness if I use this on my dog.  </li>
            <li>I had avoided getting it my whole childhood</li>
            <li>While results may be anecdotal, I really do believe this is helping keep lice away.</li>
            <li>While results may be anecdotal, I really do believe this is helping keep lice away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Smells like rosemary like real rosemary.</li>
            <li>I learned so much about lice in a 24 hour period and one thing that came up over and over</li>
            <li>It keeps the lice from multiplying too fast.</li>
            <li>so I would say it is gentle.</li>
            <li>While we can&#x27;t prevent being exposed to lice, there are some simple and effective steps we can take to prevent constant outbreaks and recurrences in our families and classrooms.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am taking pre-cautuionary steps, I am satisfied with this product because I do feel less often itchiness when the day is hot</li>
            <li>love the other products but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You still need to be vigilant and talk to your kids about sharing brushes, hats and touching heads with other children.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and is way above average.</li>
            <li>Parents should try this stuff and a nit comb for first line of action on the nits.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you are not diligent with combing, you will most likely have constant recurrences .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are not diligent with combing, you will most likely have constant recurrences .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kids love the shampoo, so do I, and thus, I am ordering now the big bottle to use as regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>but i still highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Since lice like clean and long hair</li>
            <li>Use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales daily conditioning spray and you get at least a BIT of peace of mind that you&#x27;re able to help fight off critters that can infest very quickly at school.</li>
            <li>The treatment center was amazing, they combed out every single lice,louse, and egg in my head and they did 2 special treatments to keep the lice from coming back.</li>
            <li>This means you comb it from the top down, from the bottom up, from right to left and left to right.</li>
            <li>This means you comb it from the top down, from the bottom up, from right to left and left to right.</li>
            <li>Although the thought of lice don&#x27;t completely freak me out, I really don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of it.</li>
            <li>but so far we&#x27;ve not had any cases of lice in our family, and I really do think this line of products helps.</li>
            <li>They use it daily year round, smells great &amp; would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels clean and is manageable to brush after being toweled dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well it prevents lice, but it smells nice and is all natural</li>
            <li>Found a few more lice in daughter&#x27;s hair just before Spring Break.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase again as the premium paid for this vs our normal run of</li>

            <li>when I purchased so there was no surprises but it could be misleading to new customers.</li>

            <li>and she was never reecposed, i took a star off because the smell is so strong in the shower it can be overwhelming and if it gets in your eyes it burns worse than regular shampoo</li>
            <li>my daughters remain lice free, and since I started volunteering in the health clinic at my oldest daughter&#x27;s (public) school last fall, I have started using this product as well.</li>

            <li>I ordered twice so far!</li>
            <li>In first time use only it removed 95% lice and eggs.</li>
            <li>My kids (8 &amp; 5) got their first case of lice, my husband and I went to war and sanitized, cleaned, vacuumed, treated, pulled nits one by one (did all this multiple times a day)  and got rid of it in two weeks.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I even use it myself!</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer this shampoo and conditioner over any of the higher end ones.</li>
            <li>It is for the first time in almost a year that I finally get a break.  </li>
            <li>our soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to mistake sand, dirt, dry skin or other things caught in the hair for nits.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to mistake sand, dirt, dry skin or other things caught in the hair for nits.</li>
            <li>and I was SHOCKED at how good and squeaky clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells strongly of rosemary essential oil, which makes for a potent and not very pleasant aroma to be clinging to a kiddo&#x27;s hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for young children since it is completely natural and organic</li>
            <li>we still brush our little girl regularly but we make sure we use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>: It could be a combination of things such as being aware of high risk activities that cause lice and psychological peace-of-mind...</li>
            <li>To be clear, nowhere on the bottle does it say that the product is organic</li>
            <li>Get a Professional Steel Lice &amp; Nit Comb </li>
            <li>your child has been around someone with lice or there is a known outbreak at school, bump up your combings to two or three times a week to catch early infestations</li>
            <li>Also try the natural stuff made for that if you need it, Amazon sells it too.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 5-year old daughter after picking up lice at school.</li>
            <li>I have 8-year old twin girls.</li>
            <li>shampoo was bought for my 4.5 year old stepson, but I used it once about 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li>After head bath, i towel dried har hair and combed with &#x27;nit free lice comb&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Now she is completely got rid off lice and eggs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, two years in, no lice, and my kids hair smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this at any store anymore, so I am very thankful Amazon has it, and in larger sizes!</li>
            <li>I feel this is something we really need to protect against since a lice infestation would be a big pain for us.</li>
            <li>So far after 2 out breaks in 2 years my granddaughters have not gotten the head lice.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and manageable even without using a conditioner, which is something I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 years old and caught lice from teaching.</li>
            <li>I had it as an adult.  </li>
            <li>, i used it on her every day until mine were completely gone</li>
            <li>This shampoo is an all natural way to PREVENT it from ever infecting your kids&#x27; heads.</li>
            <li>And our hair (both adults and young girls)</li>
            <li>so it is a clear natural color.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old son likes it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I learned that there was a local lice \\&quot;clinic\\&quot; around where I live that I realized there was hope!</li>
            <li>Decent smell, and it seems to do the trick with a big lice problem in my kids&#x27; school.</li>
            <li>However half the class wasn&#x27;t as lucky.  </li>
            <li>so the cost is worth it because it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Spray your kids hair right before school or any event where they will be around other children. </li>
            <li>Also, if you have missed any nits, you will have a new case of lice all over again and daily combing catches things early.</li>
            <li>I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed to it since we started using it (at least not that I know of), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>It has a very natural and refreshing smell and not a strong chemical smell as other products have that are supposed to repel.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m an adult female in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago, one of my daughters complained of itchy head and sure enough I found some nymphs.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s preventing lice but smells clean.</li>
            <li>I was SHOCKED when she mentioned how great this shampoo was.  </li>
            <li>When a child is sent home with lice, many parents will say that they just did a lice check and are shocked to learn the lice are in full party mode on their child&#x27;s hear.</li>

            <li>This stuff must work if out of 30 kids in one class only 3 kids came out of the nurse&#x27;s office clear of bugs.</li>
            <li>The truth is, they probably missed the early signs several days before.  </li>
            <li>The truth is, they probably missed the early signs several days before.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I use on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>finally decide to try this all natural product after being concerned on the chemical exposure to her and her hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>One of the reasons for this is lice leave behind a “sent” that attracts more lice.</li>
            <li>I use it on my own hair sometimes, and I have very thick hair, but a dry scalp.</li>

            <li>The second time around I learned a new tactic that prevented a recurrence (daily combing with a lice comb for three weeks).  </li>
            <li>I live in Kauai, Hawaii where the weather is very humid year round (80-98% humidity) and my scalp tends to get itchy and sort of moldy or the like from this humidity.</li>
            <li>So far, we&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and both of my sons have had multiple lice outbreaks at their respective schools.</li>
            <li>so glad I use this product, or else my little girl’s hair would be a mess!</li>
            <li>the price (which honestly isn&#x27;t high compared to other products).  </li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil and solved the dry hair</li>
            <li>Both boys have super thick hair and the idea of shaving heads</li>

            <li> tried the conditioner too and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> good product/ serves its purpose</li>
            <li> I am now using it too because my hair feels so good after.  </li>
            <li> Needed a good conditioning shampoo for my kids</li>
            <li> and I do head checks weekly with licefreee - with the combo they have been good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral of the story: vigilance is good, paranoia is not.</li>
            <li> The bottle and lid are of good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy, thanks!</li>
            <li> We continue to be head lice free at this time!!</li>
            <li> Also love the pump!</li>
            <li> who could ask for more!</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it!</li>
            <li> Update (May 2015): LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very important to have a good lice comb though.</li>
            <li> It smells great and my kids enjoy washing their hair with it...</li>
            <li> You can also make your own prevention spray by adding tea tree oil (5 drops to 1 ounce) to your kids shampoo, conditioner, detangler and hairspray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pesticide-based products (like Rid &amp; Nix) are no longer effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pesticide-based products (like Rid &amp; Nix) are no longer effective.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and keeps the chemicals out.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> Nice to have something not loaded with garbage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cannot say enough how great and happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells more like rosemary than citronella, which is good).</li>
            <li> I will continue using fairy tales for my own peace of mind.</li>
            <li> best place to do do a head-check is outside in bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> best place to do do a head-check is outside in bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> We used no heavy chemicals and the hair is shiny and the smell in great and the kids are happy.</li>
            <li> There is an herbal scent, but I find it light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully and leaves hair clean, soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> When you buy the 32 oz, it also comes with a pump so it is very easy to pump the shampoo out to your palm.  </li>
            <li> love it, and I will continue to use it until I find something better!</li>
            <li> It is very important to learn how to use the lice comb correctly so it is effective at removing all the nits and lice.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the fragrance of this shampoo and felt her hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> Since using fairy tales, my hair has NEVER been more amazing.</li>
            <li> However once you rinse and it dries the scent isn&#x27;t too strong at all!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> Smells natural, does a GREAT job of getting in her hair, makes it feel good</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling nice and clean!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> You will spend more on getting rid of lice than you will buying this shampoo/conditioner to prevent them.</li>
            <li> This of course isn&#x27;t a fix all cure for lice, however it&#x27;s better knowing there is a chance your kids won&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter’s curly hair, and it works so much better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> I would love to say this product works, but it does not.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Even when our lice issue goes away, I will definitely be buying again, both for preventative purposes and for the fact that it makes my hair feel and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> know many people don&#x27;t like the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this shampoo and am STOKED to have found this &amp;#34;unlikely&amp;#34; product for my hair :)))</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo for the kids.</li>
            <li> have already recommended this product to my friends :)</li>
            <li> :):)</li>
            <li> It took many weeks to get rid of the lice</li>
            <li> (many hours of checking their hair, washing and drying bed sheets and stuffed animals)</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m confident it works.</li>
            <li> we stayed lice free!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the rosemary smell of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> We bought this as more of a prevention than a remedy since one of my kids classmate had a &amp;#34;a bug in the hair.&amp;#34;  I would buy again even just for the thought of comfort and my daughter likes how it smells.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle is gone, we won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> And I love that it works, both in terms of cleaning and in keeping lice at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I know there are many factors involved with head lice</li>
            <li> Smells great, my girls and I like to use it, and it lathers up quite nicely for a natural shampoo with no SLS.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have my kids use this twice a week just to keep the bugs away :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product...</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Many students in the class had re-occurring infestations throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> I send my kids to school now in peace :-)</li>
            <li> Also, make sure your kid rinses his/her hair after washing/conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold for sure.</li>
            <li> My girls actually love the smell, which I was worried about them not liking it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a lovely fragrance that isn&#x27;t over-powering.</li>
            <li> The most notable fragrances are lavender and rosemary.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So it needs an effective shampoo and conditioner that will rinse out cleanly.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, but leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair with a white residue like the cheap hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING and well worth</li>
            <li> There are others available, but it is the top rated nit and lice comb out</li>
            <li> I love this product, leaves my granddaughter&#x27;s hair smooth, shinny and silky.  </li>
            <li> So far it is working great to repel the lice from the outbreak they are having at her school.</li>
            <li> (combing is the most important part of getting rid of and keeping lice away) and using fairy tales shampoo ever since.</li>
            <li> Two elementary school kids in the house, many more in the neighborhood; one of all these kids always has lice year in year out and thus, ping-pong effect on my two kids.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you smell the shampoo out of the bottle it is strong....</li>
            <li> I noticed some of the reviews said that the smell was terribly strong, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> But this is a good natural product and we love it.</li>
            <li> All seemed fine for almost two months, but my child still ended up with head lice.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely fine and this shampoo works well for her.</li>
            <li> shampoo has a natural smell which is really pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It rinses out clean, smells very nice, and so far seems to be tear-free.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and came with a pump to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughters hair was extremely smooth after using the product and her hair had a light after scent.</li>
            <li> professionals use and recommend the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb (Available on Amazon).</li>
            <li> your child has just been treated for lice, it is extremely important to:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> That said, it is still important to know how to do thorough head-checks.</li>
            <li> That said, it is still important to know how to do thorough head-checks.</li>
            <li> It is very herby and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Works great on my kids&#x27; hair and no lice even though several classmates do have continuing head lice.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works well as just a regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I feel comfortable having my children use this product.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love the scent and it leaves their hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> We stayed lice free when there was an epidemic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more herbal than I like, but again, well worth using.  </li>
            <li> , we are still lice free.</li>
            <li> I have been lice free for 3 weeks now, still combing my hair once a week</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait until the kids get lice to try it, it is an excellent everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Additionally outside of the lice prevention - the smell is great.  </li>
            <li> This bottle lasted us an ENTIRE school year for all three of my kids, and when lice was going around their classrooms, I&#x27;m happy to say that none of them got it.</li>
            <li> Since school has been out, lice free.    </li>
            <li> We use this as part of a weekly routine of keeping the kids in the house lice free.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more while my kids are still in elementary school.</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily on the &amp;#34;help</li>
            <li> This is my children&#x27;s primary shampoo.</li>
            <li> We had a light case of lice</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> If you buy this shampoo do it because it smells good, is all natural, made in America and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and I do recommend it to anyone, HOWEVER when the package arrived the lid was completely off of the bottle</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the scent, but if it protects my girls from lice, then great!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old is able to wash and rinse her own hair now and never complains about the soap stinging her eyes</li>
            <li> Thanks Fairy Tales!!!</li>
            <li> people have found treatments with coconut or olive oil mixed with tea tree oil to be very effective at killing the lice (not the nits).</li>
            <li> people have found treatments with coconut or olive oil mixed with tea tree oil to be very effective at killing the lice (not the nits).</li>
            <li> and we are free and clear of any love in the house!</li>
            <li> I originally started using it when they had a lice scare at preschool.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re kid is in a lice infected elementary school, buy this now and use it today!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and since it&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school.</li>
            <li> I can also say that I like the smell and that it makes all of our hair feel clean and look shiny.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair CLEAN.</li>
            <li> and I literally could not believe how incredibly soft, healthy, and shiny my hair was!</li>
            <li> and I did NOT want it coming home with us (who does, right?)!  </li>
            <li> I use this all the time love it will buy this again when I use up what I have thanks</li>
            <li> and that is good enough but seeing as how I paid for a full bottle I should have received a full unopened bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is big too, good value.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves his hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair clean, healthy and completely lice free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure no bug would want to live in hair that smells like this!</li>
            <li> I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products .  </li>
            <li> has very fine, soft baby hair</li>
            <li> In fact, lice actually prefer clean hair because they can move around more freely.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember about effective combing is to divide the hair into small sections and comb each section from all directions.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember about effective combing is to divide the hair into small sections and comb each section from all directions.</li>
            <li> and I use this stuff religiously just to be safe!</li>
            <li> Lice do not care about what kind of house we live in, our economic status, our level of cleanliness etc...  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!t&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school.</li>
            <li> Its very calming and doesn&#x27;t smell too girly (an important thing when you have 2 boys)</li>
            <li> This method involves saturating your child&#x27;s hair with the mixture, working it through the hair, covering it with a plastic cap and sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;The most important part of treating lice (regardless of your initial treatment method) is to learn to use your lice comb correctly and comb every day for two to three weeks.</li>

            <li> Elementary schools always seem to have a lice problem until summer.</li>
            <li> The most important point so far, we have been lice and/or bug free so far.</li>
            <li> Does not actually repel but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> Worth each penny.  </li>
            <li> I worked at an elementary school where kids would have lice some weeks.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but daily use gave my daughter dandruff.</li>
            <li> Head lice has been running rampant in my kids&#x27; elementary school for two years now.  </li>
            <li> Love this product because it&#x27;s natural and will hopefully do the job of repelling lice.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I was officially informed that in my daughter&#x27;s class lice are running wild, but she was lice free, yeah!</li>
            <li> and I should have read the full ingredient list; looking this up on EWG first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look for something that is more natural.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and adds extra confidence about avoiding lice from school/daycare.</li>
            <li> but it seems worth it to prevent it if I can.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order this shampoo because of the price, but it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the &amp;#34;peace of mind&amp;#34; for prevention when lice is going around the kids school.</li>
            <li> the mill kids shampoo isn&#x27;t worth it to us.</li>
            <li> Yes, I tend to react strongly to creepy-crawlies.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few friends suggested Fairy Tales and though it seemed too good to be true, I grabbed the large size bottle of shampoo after I resolved the immediate problem.  </li>
            <li> I was too quick to buy this when I heard that lice was &#x27;going around&#x27; and didn&#x27;t do my research first.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels very clean and soft when done and rinsed.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of the lice prevention selling point, it smells lovely and works great as a general shampoo for the kids, year round.</li>
            <li> Very well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Regardless If You See Lice or Nits.&lt;br /&gt;According to lice professionals, this is the most important prevention technique we can ever do because it is extremely easy to miss lice and nits, especially if an outbreak is in the early stages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right after kids return to school from any break (summer, Christmas, spring etc</li>
            <li> : Again, I want to make the point that it is important to know how to do a thorough head check, but current thinking is that combing with a lice comb is far more important than just checking.</li>
            <li> : Again, I want to make the point that it is important to know how to do a thorough head check, but current thinking is that combing with a lice comb is far more important than just checking.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and vibrant and clean- healthy….and</li>
            <li> Its not a guarantee lice-free protection, but it certainly helps!  </li>
            <li> Squeaky clean, smells great, and there&#x27;s no ice cold feeling by leaving it in a bit longer for use as bug repellant (works for most buzzing type bugs) and for repelling head lice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, shampoo itself is decent and gets hair clean.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> and I did not want to expose my daughter again to Rid or any other chemical shampoo, so I searched and gave this shampoo a try and we, the kids and I, are so happy with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and its gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> but it makes me feel better psychologically.</li>
            <li> Make sure the tips of the comb stays on the scalp across the entire section before you pull the hair through the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li> Make sure the tips of the comb stays on the scalp across the entire section before you pull the hair through the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Head</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and light -</li>
            <li> Used the chemical stuff at first, but didn&#x27;t want to continue to use.  </li>
            <li> I now buy it in bulk for my whole house!</li>
            <li> husband has male pattern baldness and it works on his remaining hair too :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo especially during the school year and for daycare kids.</li>
            <li> I also hope that it will really repel the lice (which we have not yet had in the house!).</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The seller provided exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My younger son ALWAYS sleeps better when we use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love these products we started with the smaller sizes but after my daughters class had two lice incidents my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice, i will contain to buy and brag!!</li>
            <li> Did it 2 days later again, found one more nymph, and after that every creature was gone.  </li>
            <li> My kids LOVE the smell (it&#x27;s definitely got an herbal smell to it -- but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> this is the first incident we have had.</li>
            <li> When the first outbreak hit, I loaded up on this stuff, the spray, and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Both girls have gone through preschool, and the oldest is going into first grade this fall--not one hint of lice, despite outbreaks in the schools each spring and fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that hairspray and the use of additional styling products (i.e., hair \\&quot;coatings\\&quot;) help to repel lice, and I do apply styling products to their hair, but not on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it comes in such a large size (with pump).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using a natural remedy of apple cider vinegar (ACV) to leave my scalp and hair squeaky clean WITHOUT drying it out.</li>
            <li> It makes their hair feel really clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li> It really is soft on the hair and feels clean.</li>
            <li> Unless a child has an advanced case of lice, the chances of actually seeing lice or nits in a 30-second head check is rare.</li>
            <li> Unless a child has an advanced case of lice, the chances of actually seeing lice or nits in a 30-second head check is rare.</li>
            <li> We love the smell, it&#x27;s gentle enough for the baby, everyone loves it, and it doesn&#x27;t have any junk in it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, even for thick hair, and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li> At first the rosemary and other scents seemed strong - but as we&#x27;ve used it - both boys like it and it smells clean.  </li>
            <li> So my daughters about ready to start preschool (after being watched by her nana the first 3years of her life)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m petrified to say the least to think about my daughter catching lice!</li>
            <li> And i have long curly hair that lice tend to love.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend every parent use it all year long as it conditions the hair too.</li>
            <li> smells good but not sure it really repels, my daughter still winded up getting lice even after use.</li>
            <li> is the kind of hair spray that leaves the hair super hard that my daughter complains.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one happy momma to say the least!</li>
            <li> My son has short, fine hair</li>
            <li> My son has short, fine hair</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to several other moms who successfully maintain lice-free households.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and we don&#x27;t have to use a lot -- it seems like it is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> As I was leaving the center I made sure to purchase a large bottle of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So far so good but does  make the hair a little greasy looking</li>
            <li> The professionals now use enzyme based products for their initial treatment (available with all the product lines I mentioned</li>
            <li> The professionals now use enzyme based products for their initial treatment (available with all the product lines I mentioned</li>
            <li> Although, I can&#x27;t really say weather or not it keeps lice away because we have not been traumatized by those yet</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Tried so many products and spent lot of money but no use.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and eyes, doesn&#x27;t aggravate their eczema and it leaves no residue in their hair.</li>
            <li> I have found that I can skip the whole flea treatment craziness if I use this on my dog.  </li>
            <li> I had avoided getting it my whole childhood</li>
            <li> While results may be anecdotal, I really do believe this is helping keep lice away.</li>
            <li> While results may be anecdotal, I really do believe this is helping keep lice away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells like rosemary like real rosemary.</li>
            <li> I learned so much about lice in a 24 hour period and one thing that came up over and over</li>
            <li> It keeps the lice from multiplying too fast.</li>
            <li> so I would say it is gentle.</li>
            <li> While we can&#x27;t prevent being exposed to lice, there are some simple and effective steps we can take to prevent constant outbreaks and recurrences in our families and classrooms.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am taking pre-cautuionary steps, I am satisfied with this product because I do feel less often itchiness when the day is hot</li>
            <li> love the other products but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You still need to be vigilant and talk to your kids about sharing brushes, hats and touching heads with other children.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and is way above average.</li>
            <li> Parents should try this stuff and a nit comb for first line of action on the nits.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you are not diligent with combing, you will most likely have constant recurrences .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are not diligent with combing, you will most likely have constant recurrences .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kids love the shampoo, so do I, and thus, I am ordering now the big bottle to use as regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> but i still highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Since lice like clean and long hair</li>
            <li> Use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales daily conditioning spray and you get at least a BIT of peace of mind that you&#x27;re able to help fight off critters that can infest very quickly at school.</li>
            <li> The treatment center was amazing, they combed out every single lice,louse, and egg in my head and they did 2 special treatments to keep the lice from coming back.</li>
            <li> This means you comb it from the top down, from the bottom up, from right to left and left to right.</li>
            <li> This means you comb it from the top down, from the bottom up, from right to left and left to right.</li>
            <li> Although the thought of lice don&#x27;t completely freak me out, I really don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of it.</li>
            <li> but so far we&#x27;ve not had any cases of lice in our family, and I really do think this line of products helps.</li>
            <li> They use it daily year round, smells great &amp; would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels clean and is manageable to brush after being toweled dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it prevents lice, but it smells nice and is all natural</li>
            <li> Found a few more lice in daughter&#x27;s hair just before Spring Break.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again as the premium paid for this vs our normal run of</li>

            <li> when I purchased so there was no surprises but it could be misleading to new customers.</li>

            <li> and she was never reecposed, i took a star off because the smell is so strong in the shower it can be overwhelming and if it gets in your eyes it burns worse than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> my daughters remain lice free, and since I started volunteering in the health clinic at my oldest daughter&#x27;s (public) school last fall, I have started using this product as well.</li>
            <li> Thankfully we caught it very early on.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair very soft and bouncy afterward-</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and leaves hair very soft and clean-smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I ordered twice so far!</li>
            <li> In first time use only it removed 95% lice and eggs.</li>
            <li> My kids (8 &amp; 5) got their first case of lice, my husband and I went to war and sanitized, cleaned, vacuumed, treated, pulled nits one by one (did all this multiple times a day)  and got rid of it in two weeks.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I even use it myself!</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer this shampoo and conditioner over any of the higher end ones.</li>
            <li> It is for the first time in almost a year that I finally get a break.  </li>
            <li> our soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to mistake sand, dirt, dry skin or other things caught in the hair for nits.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to mistake sand, dirt, dry skin or other things caught in the hair for nits.</li>
            <li> and I was SHOCKED at how good and squeaky clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells strongly of rosemary essential oil, which makes for a potent and not very pleasant aroma to be clinging to a kiddo&#x27;s hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for young children since it is completely natural and organic</li>
            <li> we still brush our little girl regularly but we make sure we use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> : It could be a combination of things such as being aware of high risk activities that cause lice and psychological peace-of-mind...</li>
            <li> To be clear, nowhere on the bottle does it say that the product is organic</li>
            <li> Get a Professional Steel Lice &amp; Nit Comb </li>
            <li> your child has been around someone with lice or there is a known outbreak at school, bump up your combings to two or three times a week to catch early infestations</li>
            <li> Also try the natural stuff made for that if you need it, Amazon sells it too.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 5-year old daughter after picking up lice at school.</li>
            <li> I have 8-year old twin girls.</li>
            <li> shampoo was bought for my 4.5 year old stepson, but I used it once about 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> After head bath, i towel dried har hair and combed with &#x27;nit free lice comb&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Now she is completely got rid off lice and eggs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, two years in, no lice, and my kids hair smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this at any store anymore, so I am very thankful Amazon has it, and in larger sizes!</li>
            <li> I feel this is something we really need to protect against since a lice infestation would be a big pain for us.</li>
            <li> So far after 2 out breaks in 2 years my granddaughters have not gotten the head lice.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and manageable even without using a conditioner, which is something I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and caught lice from teaching.</li>
            <li> I had it as an adult.  </li>
            <li> , i used it on her every day until mine were completely gone</li>
            <li> This shampoo is an all natural way to PREVENT it from ever infecting your kids&#x27; heads.</li>
            <li> And our hair (both adults and young girls)</li>
            <li> so it is a clear natural color.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son likes it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I learned that there was a local lice \\&quot;clinic\\&quot; around where I live that I realized there was hope!</li>
            <li> Decent smell, and it seems to do the trick with a big lice problem in my kids&#x27; school.</li>
            <li> However half the class wasn&#x27;t as lucky.  </li>
            <li> so the cost is worth it because it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Spray your kids hair right before school or any event where they will be around other children. </li>
            <li> Also, if you have missed any nits, you will have a new case of lice all over again and daily combing catches things early.</li>
            <li> I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed to it since we started using it (at least not that I know of), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> It has a very natural and refreshing smell and not a strong chemical smell as other products have that are supposed to repel.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m an adult female in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago, one of my daughters complained of itchy head and sure enough I found some nymphs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s preventing lice but smells clean.</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED when she mentioned how great this shampoo was.  </li>
            <li> When a child is sent home with lice, many parents will say that they just did a lice check and are shocked to learn the lice are in full party mode on their child&#x27;s hear.</li>

            <li> This stuff must work if out of 30 kids in one class only 3 kids came out of the nurse&#x27;s office clear of bugs.</li>
            <li> The truth is, they probably missed the early signs several days before.  </li>
            <li> The truth is, they probably missed the early signs several days before.  </li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> finally decide to try this all natural product after being concerned on the chemical exposure to her and her hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> One of the reasons for this is lice leave behind a “sent” that attracts more lice.</li>
            <li> I use it on my own hair sometimes, and I have very thick hair, but a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I use it on my own hair sometimes, and I have very thick hair, but a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The second time around I learned a new tactic that prevented a recurrence (daily combing with a lice comb for three weeks).  </li>
            <li> I live in Kauai, Hawaii where the weather is very humid year round (80-98% humidity) and my scalp tends to get itchy and sort of moldy or the like from this humidity.</li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and both of my sons have had multiple lice outbreaks at their respective schools.</li>
            <li> so glad I use this product, or else my little girl’s hair would be a mess!</li>
            <li> the price (which honestly isn&#x27;t high compared to other products).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil and solved the dry hair</li>
            <li> Both boys have super thick hair and the idea of shaving heads</li>
            <li> - are attached to one side of a single piece of hair near the scalp.</li>
            <li> - are attached to one side of a single piece of hair near the scalp.</li>
            <li> Remember that nits are always &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to a single piece of hair, therefore will not easily move.&lt;br /&gt;Lice – are about the size of a sesame seed but can vary in color and be various shades (light or dark) tan, yellow, brown or reddish.</li>

            <li> My daughter made it all the way through first grade at a school with numerous, and I mean NUMEROUS lice outbreaks - without a problem.  </li>
            <li> dtr hair is fine thin silky and became really dry in Texas dry weather..</li>
            <li> I asked what kind of shampoo they were using and they told me it was called fairy tales rosemary shampoo and conditioner (since lice hate the scent of rosemary) and it was meant to help with the prevention of lice and was completely natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Several others in school have had lice (some who I know my kids are close to -- either classmates or friends), but we&#x27;ve not seen a single nit/bug/whatever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for any family with little ones at home!</li>
            <li> They brought the giant, red birthday hat around and placed it on 2 other birthday kids before they came to our table and plopped the thing on my daughters&#x27; heads.</li>
            <li> They range in color from white (already hatched) to yellow, tan, brown or dark brown.</li>
            <li> They range in color from white (already hatched) to yellow, tan, brown or dark brown.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for any school aged children.</li>
            <li> an adult, living in a heavily wooded area</li>
            <li> I spent hours combing and picking, and several hundred dollars on combs, treatments, etc.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it ever since and so far have made it through quite a few Parent Alerts from school without re-infestation</li>
            <li> I have two girls, school age with long hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knock on wood, we&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioning spray for a long time now, and no lice.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After using a lice shampoo and combing our hair daily with a nit comb i started using this (1 week out from initial treatment) it definitley stunned/slowed down the stragling lice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wish lice upon anyone and if your child is exposed (and EVERY child will be exposed due to laziness of parents NOT treating their infected child properly</li>
            <li> only to find about a thousand little white bits stuck to her bangs.</li>
            <li> I have a oily scalp and dry ends</li>
            <li> I noticed the girls&#x27; hair 2-3 weeks after-wards was dry with lots of flyaways which they had never had before.  </li>
            <li> Typically teachers will do checks if there is a known outbreak in the classroom, but parents need to be the ones taking prevention seriously as there is only so much a school can</li>

            <li> Usually if its anywhere near us, we get it.  </li>
            <li> This 32 once bottle last a long time, and a little will go a long way!</li>
            <li> wish they would have checked the cap as it was loose</li>
            <li> and I had to squeeze over half of the shampoo back into the bottle from the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> When I received it the cap wasn&#x27;t tight and part of the fluid was all over bottle and plastic it was shipped in and on inside of box.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better to both clean your child&#x27;s hair and keep those nasty little critters away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise to add a little tea tree oil to a different shampoo if you want lice protection...</li>
            <li> - Do daily combings for at least two weeks following treatment.</li>
            <li> Re-infestation is extremely common for several weeks after an initial treatment is done. </li>
            <li> After reading online that 34% of school aged kids have lice at any given time during the school year, I decided it was time to take preventative measures.  </li>
            <li> But then my hair smells like the vinegar, which is a drag after a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was harder for me to kick the lice than in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> No lice since using it for the last few years.</li>
            <li> We used to use California Baby (we still use their Sensitive Skin liquid soap, but not as a shampoo -- it doesn&#x27;t work well for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so much better than any other lice shampoo or rinse we&#x27;ve tried and, when used consistently, seems to actively repel those nasty critters.</li>
            <li> Paraben and sulfate-free&amp;#34; -I took it to mean that it was a &#x27;natural product&#x27;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I read all other reviews and realized that I need to use shampoo with conditioner.</li>
            <li> We have only dealt with lice once in the past 2 years since we&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> We were re-exposed, 6 months later, by the same relatives who gave it to us before, and with our preventative care, shampooing and conditioning (at least once a week) and spraying their hair with Fairy Tales a few times a week</li>
            <li> and my daughter never got lice from the other kids in her class who did have it.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I ran out to get nix and other lice killing shampoos in the hopes i could get rid of the lice.</li>
            <li> My little girl&#x27;s class had head lice 4 times this year and sadly only my little one and 2 others never got them.</li>
            <li> We will be re-ordering when we get low, and the school has past the name around to the other parents to try.</li>
            <li> I usually have my daughter put her head down on a table, part her hair down the middle and divide it into sections.</li>

            <li> We wash hair on average of 3 times a week and the bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> have coarse thick wavy curly hair and it works well on my hair too...</li>
            <li> girls wear their hair up in a bun or in a tight braid during a known outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Speak to your kids about the importance of not sharing brushes, hats or other hair accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Increase your prevention tactics (combing, treatment shampoo, spray etc...)</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair down toe her butt</li>
            <li> When I break that down in cost compared to what it costs in $$ and anguish when lice comes home...</li>
            <li> something I&#x27;m not used to finding with any other product!</li>
            <li> I was horrified when my kids came home with lice a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> My kids never got lice, which is now resistant to the typical treatments....</li>
            <li> All the moms at our school now use it because there was a lice outbreak previously at our school.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve already gored half the neighborhood.</li>
            <li> As soon as we got home, everyone was in the bath with about a half cup of this shampoo applied to her head.</li>
            <li> Half the bottle was spilled out when I received it.</li>
            <li> This will take me 5 to 10 minutes, but she has long, thick hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter has about three feet of long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have veryyyy thick, course, long hair, and I have literally tried every shampoo and conditioner out there, but after using fairy tales i was blown away!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair (her choice), and it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is nothing is going to keep those little buggers from trying to infest.</li>
            <li> By the time this shampoo arrived we had already applied petroleum jelly to all our heads, which killed nits and</li>
            <li> My child and I both use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> My wife formulated cosmetics for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I got this for my kids and use it as their everyday shampoo and after 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I blew dried and straightened my hair</li>
            <li> We started using this a few months ago when we had a lice scare.  </li>
            <li> My sons both use this shampoo and we&#x27;ve avoided lice a few times when there were cases.  </li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo for peace of mind when a few of my students had to deal with lice.</li>
            <li> and I dried her hair...</li>
            <li> After about an hour of this treatment, my daughter (now screaming and crying) yelled, \\&quot;Mommy, mommy, I didn&#x27;t rinse my hair!\\</li>
            <li> We stock up on this year round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> two weeks, if nits and/or lice are not found during combings for at least two consecutive days, you can go down to two or three times a week and then once a week for maintenance if no re-infestations occur within the month. </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve struggled with lice in the past.  </li>
            <li> The kids usually use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used a small dab ongrandchild&#x27;s hair, washed and rinsed well.</li>
            <li> Having a girl with hair the same color as the lice makes it difficult to spot them without the comb of shame.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will order it online again though.</li>
            <li> Usually when I get organic hair products, there is no perfume and hardly any lather when you shampoo with it.  </li>
            <li> , lice can be stopped, it just takes lots of hard work)</li>
            <li> May be organic, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not toxic.  </li>
            <li> Over the last year, we used Rid and other very expensive medical shampoo prescribed by the pediatrician, combed meticulously for hours, washed everything, vacuumed like crazy, checked hair every week, put lice repellent on the hair but the creepies kept coming back.  </li>
            <li> Shaving my son&#x27;s hair and doing daily checks has been the only remedy to keeping these disgusting pests away.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was a mess.</li>
            <li> Know I can&#x27;t return item because it is open, but sick over spending $19.89.</li>
            <li> I had heard of Fairytales from other parents and was desperate to find something that would keep the lice OFF my kids.  </li>
            <li> At the very least?</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> was not happy with that.</li>
            <li> I was devastated because I am so tired of going through the procedure</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive Aveda shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; reviews, but had nothing to lose anyway.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it till it&#x27;s gone because it was so expensive</li>
            <li> and I hate to see that money go to waste, but</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had lice despite others around us dealing with it, so I&#x27;m guessing this works at repelling the little buggers, but the smell of the shampoo (and conditioner) is just awful.</li>
            <li> I am the mother of 3 boys who went through a horrible lice infestation a couple ago--it got to the point I just wanted to just sell my house in case the little boogers were still hanging around.</li>
            <li> Every school year the kids bring home those nasty little creatures.</li>
            <li> Sorry, got cut off!</li>
            <li> After dealing with the horrible, expensive, and exhausting process of ridding my 2 kiddos of lice TWICE in 3 months, I started looking for a long-term solution.  </li>
            <li> It leaked so bad that even the box was soaked.</li>
            <li> My kids got a bad case of lice.</li>
            <li> her school had it bad.  </li>
            <li> All was well, not as bad of an outbreak as the Fall of 2014.   </li>
            <li> Disappointed that it has &amp;#34;cocamidopropyl betaine&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li> and I certainly don&#x27;t hate it, just not something I would choose for myself.  </li>
            <li> Both my kids are sick of the smell of tea tree oil!   </li>
            <li> Even if you shampoo with another shampoo afterwards it leaves your hair smelling AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> However, as soon as I opened bottle, the aroma was horrible.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had lice in your home, you know it&#x27;s dreadful...</li>
            <li> and I believe it kept those nasty critters away!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Looks like working great for my girls</li>
            <li> This worked great for us! My daughter came home from school with lice. Using this shampoo, getting all the nits out with a nit comb, and washing everything repeatedly no one else in the house got lice and we are free and clear of any love in the house!</li>
            <li> if he has been around head lice but since we started using it he has not gotten any. I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for any school aged children. You will spend more on getting rid of lice than you will buying this shampoo/conditioner to prevent them. Well worth the money and its gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> I used hair conditioner spray only before buying this product. And to avoid getting any lice, I use the spray on my daughter&#x27;s hair almost every day. But still, one day, I see nits on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I read all other reviews and realized that I need to use shampoo with conditioner. So, I bought this product. So far so good. All nits are gone and hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> So my daughters about ready to start preschool (after being watched by her nana the first 3years of her life) I&#x27;m petrified to say the least to think about my daughter catching lice! So I purchased this shampoo to help repel. I don&#x27;t know if if actually works but it makes me feel better psychologically. My daughters hair was extremely smooth after using the product and her hair had a light after scent. If you smell the shampoo out of the bottle it is strong.... However once you rinse and it dries the scent isn&#x27;t too strong at all! I&#x27;m one happy momma to say the least! Here&#x27;s to hoping we make it through preschool without bugs!</li>
            <li> My step daughter returned home from dad&#x27;s house with lice.  By the time this shampoo arrived we had already applied petroleum jelly to all our heads, which killed nits and adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a natural smell which is really pleasant.  We all used it daily for abut one week, just in case.  No sign of any survivors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on keeping this shampoo for any possible future recurrences, as the petroleum jelly was stuck in our hair for several days, and in my wife&#x27;s hair for over a week.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time love it will buy this again when I use up what I have thanks</li>
            <li> Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have not had an issue with lice since we started using Fairly Tales Shampoo. After multiple outbreaks in my kids school,  I did a ton of research on dealing with lice and lice prevention.  If you are at your wits end and are about the line your family up and shear them like a heard of sheep, read on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I have found to work for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Experience - My kids are now 8 &amp; 10.   I have dealt with lice twice – once when my daughter was 5 (with one recurrence two weeks later) and once when she was 7. The second time around I learned a new tactic that prevented a recurrence (daily combing with a lice comb for three weeks).  Last school year I added daily doses of prevention spray  to the mix.  I also added tea tree oil to everything! Both my kids are sick of the smell of tea tree oil!   Lice do not care about what kind of house we live in, our economic status, our level of cleanliness etc...  In fact, lice actually prefer clean hair because they can move around more freely.  While we can&#x27;t prevent being exposed to lice, there are some simple and effective steps we can take to prevent constant outbreaks and recurrences in our families and classrooms.  &lt;br /&gt;1. Get a Professional Steel Lice &amp; Nit Comb &lt;br /&gt;Most professionals use and recommend the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb (Available on Amazon). There are others available, but it is the top rated nit and lice comb out there.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use Your Lice Comb Weekly &amp; All-Year Regardless If You See Lice or Nits.&lt;br /&gt;According to lice professionals, this is the most important prevention technique we can ever do because it is extremely easy to miss lice and nits, especially if an outbreak is in the early stages.&lt;br /&gt;If your child has been around someone with lice or there is a known outbreak at school, bump up your combings to two or three times a week to catch early infestations (Note: when I say combings, I am always referring to using a steel nit &amp; lice comb).&lt;br /&gt;If your child is prone to getting lice and there are known outbreaks, bump up the combings to daily until the outbreaks have totally cleared.&lt;br /&gt;If your child has just been treated for lice, it is extremely important to:&lt;br /&gt;  - Do daily combings for at least two weeks following treatment. One of the reasons for this is lice leave behind a “sent” that attracts more lice. Also, if you have missed any nits, you will have a new case of lice all over again and daily combing catches things early. Re-infestation is extremely common for several weeks after an initial treatment is done. &lt;br /&gt;-After two weeks, if nits and/or lice are not found during combings for at least two consecutive days, you can go down to two or three times a week and then once a week for maintenance if no re-infestations occur within the month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use prevention products such as the Fairy Tales Line, Licelogic ( both on Amazon) You can also make your own prevention spray by adding tea tree oil (5 drops to 1 ounce) to your kids shampoo, conditioner, detangler and hairspray. Spray your kids hair right before school or any event where they will be around other children. &lt;br /&gt;Have girls wear their hair up in a bun or in a tight braid during a known outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Speak to your kids about the importance of not sharing brushes, hats or other hair accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Increase your prevention tactics (combing, treatment shampoo, spray etc...) right after kids return to school from any break (summer, Christmas, spring etc..)&lt;br /&gt;Ramp up your prevention efforts after travel, vacation, sleepovers, camps, visits from cousins or any new group your kids are exposed to.&lt;br /&gt;More Information On Combing&lt;br /&gt;Spending ones time and energy actually doing a careful and thorough combing is a far better method than doing weekly head-checks alone. It is very important to learn how to use the lice comb correctly so it is effective at removing all the nits and lice. A short video that I found helpfulis by a company called Lice Control. The most important thing to remember about effective combing is to divide the hair into small sections and comb each section from all directions. This means you comb it from the top down, from the bottom up, from right to left and left to right. Make sure the tips of the comb stays on the scalp across the entire section before you pull the hair through the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Head Checks&lt;br /&gt;Note: Again, I want to make the point that it is important to know how to do a thorough head check, but current thinking is that combing with a lice comb is far more important than just checking. That said, it is still important to know how to do thorough head-checks. When a child is sent home with lice, many parents will say that they just did a lice check and are shocked to learn the lice are in full party mode on their child&#x27;s hear. The truth is, they probably missed the early signs several days before.  Unless a child has an advanced case of lice, the chances of actually seeing lice or nits in a 30-second head check is rare. A careful lice-check takes several minutes or more depending on the length and thickness of the hair. Because of this, it is not feasible for teachers to take time out the the school schedule to do thorough lice checks. Typically teachers will do checks if there is a known outbreak in the classroom, but parents need to be the ones taking prevention seriously as there is only so much a school can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best place to do do a head-check is outside in bright sunlight. If that is not possible, use a spotlight. I usually have my daughter put her head down on a table, part her hair down the middle and divide it into sections. Then, using a rat-tail comb I go through each section, examining one paper-thin row at at time. This will take me 5 to 10 minutes, but she has long, thick hair. My son has short, fine hair so it takes me just a couple minutes to go through his hair. On average, a careful lice-check can be done in just a few minutes if you know what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nits - are attached to one side of a single piece of hair near the scalp. They are about the size of a poppy seed (or smaller) and are oval in shape. They range in color from white (already hatched) to yellow, tan, brown or dark brown. It is very easy to mistake sand, dirt, dry skin or other things caught in the hair for nits. Remember that nits are always &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to a single piece of hair, therefore will not easily move.&lt;br /&gt;Lice – are about the size of a sesame seed but can vary in color and be various shades (light or dark) tan, yellow, brown or reddish. They also vary in size depending where there are in their life-cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pesticide-based products (like Rid &amp; Nix) are no longer effective. The professionals now use enzyme based products for their initial treatment (available with all the product lines I mentioned above).&lt;br /&gt;Some people have found treatments with coconut or olive oil mixed with tea tree oil to be very effective at killing the lice (not the nits). This method involves saturating your child&#x27;s hair with the mixture, working it through the hair, covering it with a plastic cap and sleeping in it.&lt;br /&gt;The most important part of treating lice (regardless of your initial treatment method) is to learn to use your lice comb correctly and comb every day for two to three weeks. If you are not diligent with combing, you will most likely have constant recurrences .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an area where five minutes of prevention every day can save hours of dealing with an infestation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- ontrol.

            <li> Huge bottle and came with a pump to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She had gotten lice and we treated it with Fairy Tails Mousse - hopefully this will prevent her from getting lice again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and keeps the chemicals out.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and does not burn or ice-out your scalp.  My child and I both use this everyday.  Squeaky clean, smells great, and there&#x27;s no ice cold feeling by leaving it in a bit longer for use as bug repellant (works for most buzzing type bugs) and for repelling head lice.  Daughter gets some nits but, always get them under control and out before head infestation. Elementary schools always seem to have a lice problem until summer. Parents should try this stuff and a nit comb for first line of action on the nits.  NEVER USE THE BUG CHEMICALS. Also try the natural stuff made for that if you need it, Amazon sells it too.</li>
            <li> my girl came home with lice. after brushing for several hrs, we started using this product after reading the reviews. now, its been a week and havnt seen lice since then. we still brush our little girl regularly but we make sure we use this shampoo. we are planning to use it regularly until we use it all.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use on my 4 year old. Although, I can&#x27;t really say weather or not it keeps lice away because we have not been traumatized by those yet.... It smells like it would. It is very herby and smells nice. My husband also uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> The most important point so far, we have been lice and/or bug free so far. This of course isn&#x27;t a fix all cure for lice, however it&#x27;s better knowing there is a chance your kids won&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just switched the kids shampoo with this, it&#x27;s got a good smell, cleans and lathers well, lasts over 6 months of showers/baths 4-6 times a week.</li>
            <li> When I received it the cap wasn&#x27;t tight and part of the fluid was all over bottle and plastic it was shipped in and on inside of box. was not happy with that. I Hope it works Like it says it does.</li>
            <li> There is a student in my daughters class that constantly has head lice... My daughter has hair down toe her butt and I use this stuff religiously just to be safe!</li>
            <li> A must have for children. My daughter got lice from school so I started using this daily as a preventative. It smells great &amp; she has not had lice since. I also use the leave-in spray on her.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter’s curly hair, and it works so much better than anything else I have used. I’m so glad I use this product, or else my little girl’s hair would be a mess!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Very happy, thanks!</li>
            <li> As soon as we heard a child at our son&#x27;s daycare had head lice, we purchased this shampoo, conditioner and daily spray and used it faithfully. All seemed fine for almost two months, but my child still ended up with head lice. Thankfully we caught it very early on. I would love to say this product works, but it does not. Shaving my son&#x27;s hair and doing daily checks has been the only remedy to keeping these disgusting pests away.</li>
            <li> Good price!!!!! Great product!!! I ordered twice so far!</li>
            <li> I love this product, leaves my granddaughter&#x27;s hair smooth, shinny and silky.  The kids like it to and their hair combs through easier.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and a tingly sensation. It seems like a good value for the money. They claim lice don&#x27;t like the smell. We use this shampoo a lot and I am convinced it does not deter lice at all. If you buy this shampoo do it because it smells good, is all natural, made in America and has not been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> My wife formulated cosmetics for a few years.  I was SHOCKED when she mentioned how great this shampoo was.  Plus it kills lice as designed.  Really, REALLY good product.</li>
            <li> Does not actually repel but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> After reading online that 34% of school aged kids have lice at any given time during the school year, I decided it was time to take preventative measures.  I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products .  I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed to it since we started using it (at least not that I know of), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural and organic.  I can also say that I like the smell and that it makes all of our hair feel clean and look shiny.  Even IF it doesn’t actually work to prevent lice, I’d buy it again for those reasons alone.  I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Decent smell, and it seems to do the trick with a big lice problem in my kids&#x27; school.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, but leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair with a white residue like the cheap hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;Plus is the kind of hair spray that leaves the hair super hard that my daughter complains.&lt;br /&gt;She has very fine, soft baby hair and she is 5.&lt;br /&gt;I love the other products but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to have the extra protection but instead went to Target and bought the conditioning spray, works better.&lt;br /&gt;Beware You can&#x27;t return this product! Mine is sitting over the counter ;(&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 5-year old daughter after picking up lice at school. Before we had this shampoo we had to keep retreating her (three times!). We started using this after the third time and she has not been found with lice since! I noticed some of the reviews said that the smell was terribly strong, but I disagree. There is an herbal scent, but I find it light and pleasant. I used it for a while myself.</li>
            <li> Works great on my kids&#x27; hair and no lice even though several classmates do have continuing head lice. Lasts about two months with daily showers.</li>
            <li> Sorry, got cut off! It made my hair feel soft and light - something I&#x27;m not used to finding with any other product! Even when our lice issue goes away, I will definitely be buying again, both for preventative purposes and for the fact that it makes my hair feel and smell wonderful. Thanks Fairy Tales!!!</li>
            <li> my kids like the smell. but we have had reaccuring lice. they come back!! not a 100% preventative. am disapointed.</li>
            <li> Very well worth the money! Have 7 children and they use it daily! Leaves hair smelling nice and clean! We highly recommend this product! Also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I have 8-year old twin girls. They had an outbreak at school this last year. This shampoo smells so much better than any other lice shampoo or rinse we&#x27;ve tried and, when used consistently, seems to actively repel those nasty critters.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully and leaves hair clean, soft and smelling great.  It has a very natural and refreshing smell and not a strong chemical smell as other products have that are supposed to repel.  So far it is working great to repel the lice from the outbreak they are having at her school.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm and smells good....not a chemical smell.  Would definitely buy it again.  Shampoo and conditioner are both great!</li>
            <li> This is awesome Shampoo.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 2 years now.  We&#x27;ve struggled with lice in the past.  Usually if its anywhere near us, we get it.  We had lice between our 3 girls 4 times, prior to finding this shampoo.  We have only dealt with lice once in the past 2 years since we&#x27;ve started using it.  Its not a guarantee lice-free protection, but it certainly helps!  It smells great and works well as just a regular shampoo.  Our girls also like the conditioning spray too.</li>
            <li> After a lice outbreak in the school, we have used the Fairy Tale products. This seems to be working. Keeps the hair clean, healthy and completely lice free. Also use the rosemary repel conditioner. I have not see the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; anywhere on the product. But this is a good natural product and we love it.</li>
            <li> I know this is marketed for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, living in a heavily wooded area, I&#x27;ve been using it for ~5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe it is keeping the critters out of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many people don&#x27;t like the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I will continue to use it until I find something better!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and I do recommend it to anyone, HOWEVER when the package arrived the lid was completely off of the bottle and I had to squeeze over half of the shampoo back into the bottle from the plastic packaging. It leaked so bad that even the box was soaked. I only have about 3/4 of a bottle left and that is good enough but seeing as how I paid for a full bottle I should have received a full unopened bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased because all 3 kids had head lice.  Used the chemical stuff at first, but didn&#x27;t want to continue to use.  I feel comfortable having my children use this product.  We continue to be head lice free at this time!!</li>
            <li> I use This shampoo it&#x27;s make the hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s make the hair dray</li>
            <li> I live in Kauai, Hawaii where the weather is very humid year round (80-98% humidity) and my scalp tends to get itchy and sort of moldy or the like from this humidity. Regular shampoo does not do the job on my scalp- so I&#x27;ve been using a natural remedy of apple cider vinegar (ACV) to leave my scalp and hair squeaky clean WITHOUT drying it out. But then my hair smells like the vinegar, which is a drag after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I do NOT have lice in my head, I&#x27;m an adult female in my early 30s. I used to use expensive Aveda shampoo and conditioner. They do NOT COMPARE OR COME CLOSE IN QUALITY TO THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo was bought for my 4.5 year old stepson, but I used it once about 2 weeks ago and I was SHOCKED at how good and squeaky clean my scalp and hair felt afterward- and NO funky odor either like the ACV. It smells fresh and vibrant and clean- healthy….and leaves my hair very soft and bouncy afterward- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this shampoo and am STOKED to have found this &amp;#34;unlikely&amp;#34; product for my hair :)))</li>
            <li> I was horrified when my kids came home with lice a year and a half ago.  Both boys have super thick hair and the idea of shaving heads didn&#x27;t appeal to any of us. I spent hours combing and picking, and several hundred dollars on combs, treatments, etc.  Yes, I tend to react strongly to creepy-crawlies.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few friends suggested Fairy Tales and though it seemed too good to be true, I grabbed the large size bottle of shampoo after I resolved the immediate problem.  We&#x27;ve been using it ever since and so far have made it through quite a few Parent Alerts from school without re-infestation (I cringe every time I see one of those in my inbox).  Bonus - I love, love, love the scent and it leaves their hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my son and didn&#x27;t realize it was for lice. It was so awesome I now buy it in bulk for my whole house! We love the smell, it&#x27;s gentle enough for the baby, everyone loves it, and it doesn&#x27;t have any junk in it. Also love the pump!</li>
            <li> My daughter suffering from lice since 2 years. Tried so many products and spent lot of money but no use. By reading all reviews i wanted to try this so i bought it. My daughter loved the fragrance of this shampoo and felt her hair so smooth. In first time use only it removed 95% lice and eggs. After head bath, i towel dried har hair and combed with &#x27;nit free lice comb&#x27;. Now she is completely got rid off lice and eggs. Definitely worth buying and it is a very big bottle. Worth each penny.  Don&#x27;t forget to use conditioner after using it.</li>
            <li> Guess it works kids haven&#x27;t gottwn lice from school yet.  Smell takes awhile to get used to.  I&#x27;m sure no bug would want to live in hair that smells like this!</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo for the kids. I originally started using it when they had a lice scare at preschool. &amp;#60;shivers&amp;#62; We never got any lice and have been using it ever since. My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely fine and this shampoo works well for her. And it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> I gave 5 star coz this shampoo is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;We have 3 hair types in my family.&lt;br /&gt;My dtr hair is fine thin silky and became really dry in Texas dry weather.. I oiled her hair but it didn&#x27;t help a lot..that&#x27;s when I went looking for a organic shampoo on amazon and found this. And it did the trick... This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil and solved the dry hair problem!&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse thick wavy curly hair and it works well on my hair too... It does build up coz I have a oily scalp and dry ends I use a clarifying shampoo whenever needed!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has male pattern baldness and it works on his remaining hair too :) even he is glad,&lt;br /&gt;We tried the conditioner too and it&#x27;s good I&#x27;m the only one who conditions!&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this product to my friends :):):)</li>
            <li> We used another product, ran out, and used regular shampoo. My kids got a bad case of lice. It took many weeks to get rid of the lice (many hours of checking their hair, washing and drying bed sheets and stuffed animals) even using the commercial lice shampoo, and then finally talking to the pediatrician. After we got rid of the lice, we used this shampoo and conditioner. The kids usually use this shampoo and conditioner. We haven&#x27;t had lice since then and the school has sent notices periodically, but we are lice-free. This is after a year.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Smells refreshing</li>
            <li> I worked at an elementary school where kids would have lice some weeks. Used this when those weeks would happen, basically I never got lice. And i have long curly hair that lice tend to love.</li>
            <li> Must have for all girls!</li>
            <li> Since our daughter&#x27;s kindergarten had a lice outbreak, we use this on her hair for every shampooing.  Smells natural, does a GREAT job of getting in her hair, makes it feel good, she likes the way it feels.  Her hair feels very clean and soft when done and rinsed.  Nice to have something not loaded with garbage.  Use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales daily conditioning spray and you get at least a BIT of peace of mind that you&#x27;re able to help fight off critters that can infest very quickly at school.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo period.</li>
            <li> I send my kids to a hippy school where people refuse vaccines and don&#x27;t wash themselves so I wanted to have some proactive measures in place to prevent lice.&lt;br /&gt;So far, two years in, no lice, and my kids hair smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Take that you hippies!</li>
            <li> Humungous bottle. Forgot what size it was sold at. Regardless of the lice prevention selling point, it smells lovely and works great as a general shampoo for the kids, year round.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s preventing lice but smells clean.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing! Gentle on hair and eyes, doesn&#x27;t aggravate their eczema and it leaves no residue in their hair. Survived a daycare lice outbreak without bringing them home,  so I&#x27;m confident it works.</li>
            <li> We stayed lice free when there was an epidemic</li>
            <li> My kids (8 &amp; 5) got their first case of lice, my husband and I went to war and sanitized, cleaned, vacuumed, treated, pulled nits one by one (did all this multiple times a day)  and got rid of it in two weeks. We were re-exposed, 6 months later, by the same relatives who gave it to us before, and with our preventative care, shampooing and conditioning (at least once a week) and spraying their hair with Fairy Tales a few times a week we stayed lice free! I can&#x27;t find this at any store anymore, so I am very thankful Amazon has it, and in larger sizes! We will continue to do a weekly shampooing with Fairy Tales and using hair spray and conditioner, just to prevent. I don&#x27;t wish lice upon anyone and if your child is exposed (and EVERY child will be exposed due to laziness of parents NOT treating their infected child properly, lice can be stopped, it just takes lots of hard work) can prevent an outbreak on them with this. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very good!</li>
            <li> good product/ serves its purpose</li>
            <li> I have two girls, school age with long hair and we have used this for years and we haven&#x27;t yet had any lice.  Since lice like clean and long hair I feel this is something we really need to protect against since a lice infestation would be a big pain for us.</li>
            <li> My daughter lice kept coming back after three treatments. She has mixed ethnicities and her hair is very thick, curly, and long. Using the tiny comb was not happening.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decide to try this all natural product after being concerned on the chemical exposure to her and her hair.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff did the trick. We haven&#x27;t had one breakout since using the shampoo and conditioner after the last treatment. No itchy head, not nits, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;We also employed Zippity Doos lice prevention hair gel which is perfect for her hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot say enough how great and happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but daily use gave my daughter dandruff. I use it before sleepovers to help protect her head, just in case</li>
            <li> Head lice has been running rampant in my kids&#x27; elementary school for two years now.  After dealing with the horrible, expensive, and exhausting process of ridding my 2 kiddos of lice TWICE in 3 months, I started looking for a long-term solution.  I had heard of Fairytales from other parents and was desperate to find something that would keep the lice OFF my kids.  We have been using just the shampoo 2-3 times a week for well over a year now, and although the lice problem still persists in our school, my kids have not had one bug, not one nit, the entire time.  This stuff is AMAZING and well worth the price (which honestly isn&#x27;t high compared to other products).  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but my daughter loves it and I certainly don&#x27;t hate it, just not something I would choose for myself.  It&#x27;s more herbal than I like, but again, well worth using.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> After we treated my daughter for lice she has not gotten it again.... her school had it bad.  Its great stuff. It was wrapped in plastic when shipped and did leak inside the plastic. wish they would have checked the cap as it was loose so I didnt lose some in shipping. Otherwise I recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re kid is in a lice infected elementary school, buy this now and use it today!  My kids never got lice, which is now resistant to the typical treatments....</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for head lice.  My Granddaughter&#x27;s school had an out break of head lice.  So my daughter uses the shampoo to wash their hair and then sprays the leave on hair spray.  It has rosemary in it and the lice hates it.  So far after 2 out breaks in 2 years my granddaughters have not gotten the head lice.  However half the class wasn&#x27;t as lucky.  Get this product .  We use it every day to prevent head lice.  It is very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo like shampoo. nothing else</li>
            <li> This shampoo is GROSS.  Even if you shampoo with another shampoo afterwards it leaves your hair smelling AWFUL.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great detangling spray and it keeps the bugs away.....who could ask for more!</li>
            <li> Awesome preventative!</li>
            <li> Love this product because it&#x27;s natural and will hopefully do the job of repelling lice. I use this along with tea tree oil in their hair to help with my children not getting lice while at preschool. Smells great as well!</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo as a preventative shampoo.  There is a rampant lice problem at my son&#x27;s school and I was paranoid about him getting it.  Therefore, I got this for my kids and use it as their everyday shampoo and after 6 weeks, we are still lice free.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo especially during the school year and for daycare kids. As an adult, I even use it myself! It leaves your hair soft and manageable even without using a conditioner, which is something I need. It&#x27;s lightweight leaving no residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING ORGANIC Shampoo!  It says Lice preventative and my daughter never got lice from the other kids in her class who did have it.</li>
            <li> My kids use this everyday it really works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the rosemary smell of this shampoo.  I have found that I can skip the whole flea treatment craziness if I use this on my dog.  I despise chemicals so this product is the go to for me!</li>
            <li> Usually when I get organic hair products, there is no perfume and hardly any lather when you shampoo with it.  This shampoo smells so naturally good with tea tree oil, rosemary and citronella that my daughter loves it!  I am now using it too because my hair feels so good after.  When you buy the 32 oz, it also comes with a pump so it is very easy to pump the shampoo out to your palm.  Great product!  I also hope that it will really repel the lice (which we have not yet had in the house!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and caught lice from teaching. I had avoided getting it my whole childhood so I was obviously mortified when I found out I had it as an adult.  Immediately, I ran out to get nix and other lice killing shampoos in the hopes i could get rid of the lice. Unfortanetly, all it did was kill the female lice but still left the louse and nits along with totally frying my hair. Needless to say, I was a mess. I thought I would be stuck with lice forever! It wasn&#x27;t until I learned that there was a local lice \\&quot;clinic\\&quot; around where I live that I realized there was hope! The treatment center was amazing, they combed out every single lice,louse, and egg in my head and they did 2 special treatments to keep the lice from coming back. As they washed my hair I smelled a very pleasant scent. I asked what kind of shampoo they were using and they told me it was called fairy tales rosemary shampoo and conditioner (since lice hate the scent of rosemary) and it was meant to help with the prevention of lice and was completely natural and organic. As I was leaving the center I made sure to purchase a large bottle of the shampoo and conditioner. I went home that night and used it. Now I have veryyyy thick, course, long hair, and I have literally tried every shampoo and conditioner out there, but after using fairy tales i was blown away! I blew dried and straightened my hair and I literally could not believe how incredibly soft, healthy, and shiny my hair was! I have been lice free for 3 weeks now, still combing my hair once a week (combing is the most important part of getting rid of and keeping lice away) and using fairy tales shampoo ever since. Since using fairy tales, my hair has NEVER been more amazing. I definitely prefer this shampoo and conditioner over any of the higher end ones. It has truly worked the best for my hair and trust me I have tried them ALL. I highly recommend this for young children since it is completely natural and organic and I even recommend it for anyone of all ages, even if you have never had lice before.  Fairy tales is awesome whether you have had lice or not !! Love it :)</li>
            <li> I think this is quality shampoo, so I use it too, along with my kids.  It smells good, and is way above average.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better to both clean your child&#x27;s hair and keep those nasty little critters away! Smells fantastic and leaves hair shiny and soft. The seller provided exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Although the thought of lice don&#x27;t completely freak me out, I really don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of it. So far, we&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and both of my sons have had multiple lice outbreaks at their respective schools. Neither of my boys have gotten them! I&#x27;ve also recommended this to several of my friends and their kids have avoided lice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part about this shampoo? It smells wonderfully. Its very calming and doesn&#x27;t smell too girly (an important thing when you have 2 boys) yet is very pleasant. My younger son ALWAYS sleeps better when we use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> We bought this as more of a prevention than a remedy since one of my kids classmate had a &amp;#34;a bug in the hair.&amp;#34;  I would buy again even just for the thought of comfort and my daughter likes how it smells.</li>
            <li> Love these products we started with the smaller sizes but after my daughters class had two lice incidents my daughter didn&#x27;t get lice, i will contain to buy and brag!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; reviews, but had nothing to lose anyway.  Two elementary school kids in the house, many more in the neighborhood; one of all these kids always has lice year in year out and thus, ping-pong effect on my two kids. Over the last year, we used Rid and other very expensive medical shampoo prescribed by the pediatrician, combed meticulously for hours, washed everything, vacuumed like crazy, checked hair every week, put lice repellent on the hair but the creepies kept coming back.  Two weeks ago, one of my daughters complained of itchy head and sure enough I found some nymphs. I was devastated because I am so tired of going through the procedure and I did not want to expose my daughter again to Rid or any other chemical shampoo, so I searched and gave this shampoo a try and we, the kids and I, are so happy with this product so far.  I lathered my kid&#x27;s head with the shampoo, let it stay on for 15 minutes, rinsed it out and combed all the nymphs out.  Did it 2 days later again, found one more nymph, and after that every creature was gone.  Did it again a week after, nothing anymore on the head. We used no heavy chemicals and the hair is shiny and the smell in great and the kids are happy. Very important to have a good lice comb though. Yesterday, I was officially informed that in my daughter&#x27;s class lice are running wild, but she was lice free, yeah! The kids love the shampoo, so do I, and thus, I am ordering now the big bottle to use as regular shampoo. It is for the first time in almost a year that I finally get a break.  If you are in doubt, buy the smaller shampoo 16oz and test it.</li>
            <li> smells good but not sure it really repels, my daughter still winded up getting lice even after use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it has &amp;#34;cocamidopropyl betaine&amp;#34; in it. I fell for the &amp;#34;no pesticides, chemicals or toxins. Paraben and sulfate-free&amp;#34; -I took it to mean that it was a &#x27;natural product&#x27; and I should have read the full ingredient list; looking this up on EWG first. Live and learn. It&#x27;s really my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look on the ewg skin deep website, and you will see that cocamidopropyl betaine is listed as a level 4 out of 10 on the &#x27;toxins&#x27; list. The Fairy Tale products are around a level 5 out of 10 overall. I was too quick to buy this when I heard that lice was &#x27;going around&#x27; and didn&#x27;t do my research first. Once this bottle is gone, we won&#x27;t be purchasing more. I&#x27;ll look for something that is more natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Needed a good conditioning shampoo for my kids&lt;br /&gt;2. Anti-Lice? Seriously? There is such a thing? SIGN ME UP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s class had notes sent home because one of the kids had lice. Oh dear. Yes, I know, it can happen to anyone. No, I&#x27;m not judging. However, the last thing I want to deal with is head lice. Ugh. My daughter has very long hair (her choice), and it&#x27;s thick. So it needs an effective shampoo and conditioner that will rinse out cleanly. We used to use California Baby (we still use their Sensitive Skin liquid soap, but not as a shampoo -- it doesn&#x27;t work well for thick hair. We used to use their conditioning spray but my kids didn&#x27;t like the scent), then I found the Fairy Tales line of hair products, touted to be &amp;#34;anti-lice&amp;#34; -- and thought, why not? So I ordered the shampoo and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! I&#x27;m so glad it comes in such a large size (with pump). It doesn&#x27;t take much, even for thick hair, and it works GREAT. It rinses out clean, smells very nice, and so far seems to be tear-free. And it lasts ages! So don&#x27;t be put off by the price. You will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock on wood, we&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioning spray for a long time now, and no lice. Several others in school have had lice (some who I know my kids are close to -- either classmates or friends), but we&#x27;ve not seen a single nit/bug/whatever. The bonus? My kids LOVE the smell (it&#x27;s definitely got an herbal smell to it -- but not overpowering. Smells more like rosemary than citronella, which is good). And I love that it works, both in terms of cleaning and in keeping lice at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I know there are many factors involved with head lice (luck being a big one), but so far we&#x27;ve not had any cases of lice in our family, and I really do think this line of products helps. At the very least? It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and since it&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school. I use it on my own hair sometimes, and I have very thick hair, but a dry scalp. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and leaves hair very soft and clean-smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this! Especially if you have kids. While results may be anecdotal, I really do believe this is helping keep lice away. Highly recommend!t&#x27;s also a great shampoo, we will continue using it as long as they&#x27;re in school.

            <li> So far so good but does  make the hair a little greasy looking so we alternate.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it prevents lice, but it smells nice and is all natural so it couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had lice despite others around us dealing with it, so I&#x27;m guessing this works at repelling the little buggers, but the smell of the shampoo (and conditioner) is just awful. It&#x27;s smells strongly of rosemary essential oil, which makes for a potent and not very pleasant aroma to be clinging to a kiddo&#x27;s hair all day long. I will keep using it till it&#x27;s gone because it was so expensive and I hate to see that money go to waste, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it ever again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, my girls and I like to use it, and it lathers up quite nicely for a natural shampoo with no SLS.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be great for my grandchild. However, as soon as I opened bottle, the aroma was horrible. I used a small dab ongrandchild&#x27;s hair, washed and rinsed well. Odor still there. She later told me she did not want to use it again because of the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;. Know I can&#x27;t return item because it is open, but sick over spending $19.89.</li>
            <li> Has worked for our family yet can be drying so weekly conditioning is a must</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and use it every day. Don&#x27;t wait until the kids get lice to try it, it is an excellent everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> I noticed the girls&#x27; hair 2-3 weeks after-wards was dry with lots of flyaways which they had never had before.  We&#x27;re still working on moisturizing there hair after the episode.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very effective. Easy to use. Lasts a long time. Smells like rosemary like real rosemary. Would recommend for all ages</li>
            <li> May be organic, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not toxic.  Fragrance, benzyl alcohol, etc.  I&#x27;d advise to add a little tea tree oil to a different shampoo if you want lice protection...</li>
            <li> Have been using this set for months and my daughter just came home with lice. I will probably continue using this product but I don&#x27;t think that it repels...obviously.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have my kids use this twice a week just to keep the bugs away :) no lice since we&#x27;ve been using, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It smells nice and adds extra confidence about avoiding lice from school/daycare. The bottle is big too, good value.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this shampoo.  We started using this a few months ago when we had a lice scare.  I learned so much about lice in a 24 hour period and one thing that came up over and over was prevention...don&#x27;t even interest those lice creatures with your head at all.  My sons both use this shampoo and we&#x27;ve avoided lice a few times when there were cases.  Maybe they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it anyone - I don&#x27;t know....but it seems worth it to prevent it if I can.  Additionally outside of the lice prevention - the smell is great.  At first the rosemary and other scents seemed strong - but as we&#x27;ve used it - both boys like it and it smells clean.  Oh and we don&#x27;t have to use a lot -- it seems like it is very high quality.  Thanks for this great product...what a great company.</li>
            <li> I only use Fairy Tales on my girls. Just yesterday my oldest daughter was digging at her head. I checked her head over and found that her head was infested with lice.  My youngest daughter however doesn&#x27;t have any lice. I have been using fairy tales for years now and this is the first incident we have had. I will continue using fairy tales for my own peace of mind. Just know this is not a miracle cure for keeping lice away. You still need to be vigilant and talk to your kids about sharing brushes, hats and touching heads with other children.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a lice issue in my in home day care, i wanted to keep my daughter and I protected from future incidents. After using a lice shampoo and combing our hair daily with a nit comb i started using this (1 week out from initial treatment) it definitley stunned/slowed down the stragling lice. I pulled 3 out of my hair and they were moving atsnail speed. I have very thick hair so it was harder for me to kick the lice than in my daughters hair, i used it on her every day until mine were completely gone and she was never reecposed, i took a star off because the smell is so strong in the shower it can be overwhelming and if it gets in your eyes it burns worse than regular shampoo but i still highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Do not care for this product. It didn&#x27;t work like it said it would.</li>
            <li> Hallelujah!  My daughter made it all the way through first grade at a school with numerous, and I mean NUMEROUS lice outbreaks - without a problem.  Thank you, Fairly Tales!  When the first outbreak hit, I loaded up on this stuff, the spray, and the conditioner.  I used them religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think 2/3 of the girls in class had lice this year.  Thankfully, my kid wasn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have 4 boys ranging from 8-14 &amp; have been using Fairy Tales since the oldest started kindergarten....never have any of them got lice even though they may have been exposed at school. They use it daily year round, smells great &amp; would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes my daughters&#x27; heads itch... We have to stop using it...</li>
            <li> I am the mother of 3 boys who went through a horrible lice infestation a couple ago--it got to the point I just wanted to just sell my house in case the little boogers were still hanging around. I was reluctant to order this shampoo because of the price, but it has been worth every penny. This bottle lasted us an ENTIRE school year for all three of my kids, and when lice was going around their classrooms, I&#x27;m happy to say that none of them got it. Was it just because of the shampoo? Can&#x27;t say for sure, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it! It is also just a great shampoo over all. Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Discovered lice in my daughter&#x27;s hair Labor Day. Treated her hair diligently for 2 weeks. Used this shampoo to support. Found lice in her hair today.  Lice did not officially leave my house until November 2014.  Update (March 2015) Ran out of the shampoo for about a week. Found a few more lice in daughter&#x27;s hair just before Spring Break. Cetaphil Treatment. All was well, not as bad of an outbreak as the Fall of 2014.   Update (May 2015): LOVE this stuff! It keeps the lice from multiplying too fast. They literally FALL out of her hair now.  What I didn&#x27;t know was there was an infestation in her 5th grade classroom the entire year.  Many students in the class had re-occurring infestations throughout the year.  When I found them two days before Memorial Weekend, I found 3 bugs. That&#x27;s it. Treated with Cetaphil cleanser (google it- it works!).  Since school has been out, lice free.    Bottom line is nothing is going to keep those little buggers from trying to infest. This product definitely slows the process of infestation.  Having a girl with hair the same color as the lice makes it difficult to spot them without the comb of shame. I will keep purchasing this product until we are done with this stage of life.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair CLEAN. It has the essential oil smell, but it&#x27;s not too overbearing. Worth it for the &amp;#34;peace of mind&amp;#34; for prevention when lice is going around the kids school.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Every school year the kids bring home those nasty little creatures. I&#x27;ve learned to buy this at back to school time to avoid the problem! It really works!</li>
            <li> Works great for the kids.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo for peace of mind when a few of my students had to deal with lice. It leaves my hair soft and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. All the moms at our school now use it because there was a lice outbreak previously at our school. My daughter has about three feet of long, thick hair. She uses this shampoo and the conditioner as well. We also use tea tree essential oil in a spray bottle after drying and styling her hair. No lice! Yay! (Keep in mind, this product PREVENTS lice. It does not remove them if you already have them. For lice treatment, you need something completely different.)</li>
            <li> This is great, but it turned my boys into unicorns. They&#x27;ve already gored half the neighborhood.</li>
            <li> We use this as part of a weekly routine of keeping the kids in the house lice free.  We also have the fairy tales spray and I do head checks weekly with licefreee - with the combo they have been good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had lice in your home, you know it&#x27;s dreadful...and can be expensive to get rid of, not to mention highly chemical! This shampoo is an all natural way to PREVENT it from ever infecting your kids&#x27; heads. I send my kids to school now in peace :-) It smells great and my kids enjoy washing their hair with it...probably because of it&#x27;s name. I highly recommend this product for any family with little ones at home!</li>
            <li> My daughters have been using this shampoo and conditioner for two years. Both girls have gone through preschool, and the oldest is going into first grade this fall--not one hint of lice, despite outbreaks in the schools each spring and fall. I&#x27;ve heard that hairspray and the use of additional styling products (i.e., hair \\&quot;coatings\\&quot;) help to repel lice, and I do apply styling products to their hair, but not on a consistent basis. I will continue to use this product and I have recommended it to several other moms who successfully maintain lice-free households.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****3 year update****&lt;br /&gt;So my daughters remain lice free, and since I started volunteering in the health clinic at my oldest daughter&#x27;s (public) school last fall, I have started using this product as well. No trace of lice, although I did have a scare after our recent birthday extravaganza at Wasabi Japanese Steakhouse. They brought the giant, red birthday hat around and placed it on 2 other birthday kids before they came to our table and plopped the thing on my daughters&#x27; heads. As soon as we got home, everyone was in the bath with about a half cup of this shampoo applied to her head. Rinsing not allowed for 20 minutes. My youngest daughter hopped out of the tub and I dried her hair... only to find about a thousand little white bits stuck to her bangs. I freaked and started in with the lice comb and vowed never to go to Wasabi for our birthdays. After about an hour of this treatment, my daughter (now screaming and crying) yelled, \\&quot;Mommy, mommy, I didn&#x27;t rinse my hair!\\&quot; We rinsed it in the sink, and--voila!--no white bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: vigilance is good, paranoia is not. Also, make sure your kid rinses his/her hair after washing/conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold for sure. My little girl&#x27;s class had head lice 4 times this year and sadly only my little one and 2 others never got them. This stuff must work if out of 30 kids in one class only 3 kids came out of the nurse&#x27;s office clear of bugs. This 32 once bottle last a long time, and a little will go a long way! We will be re-ordering when we get low, and the school has past the name around to the other parents to try. The Rosemary is not so over powering like rosemary can be. I also use this with the leave in conditioner by Fairy Tales!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the scent, but if it protects my girls from lice, then great! It makes their hair feel really clean and soft as well.</li>
            <li> No lice infection in our house!  And our hair (both adults and young girls) our soft and shiny!  We stock up on this year round.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and even with a pump for the bottle. My girls actually love the smell, which I was worried about them not liking it. I will be buying more while my kids are still in elementary school. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily on the &amp;#34;help keep lice away&amp;#34; theory.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work in that respect.  Used this exclusively on our kids for several weeks then had a re-infestation of lice anyway.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, shampoo itself is decent and gets hair clean.  I would not purchase again as the premium paid for this vs our normal run of the mill kids shampoo isn&#x27;t worth it to us.</li>
            <li> Half the bottle was spilled out when I received it. Other than that, I love this stuff. I have used it for my daughter for awhile now. Not sure if I will order it online again though.</li>
            <li> Use this as the normal shampoo for my son in order to prevent lice. No lice since using it for the last few years. Smells nice and leaves his hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is my children&#x27;s primary shampoo. We have used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;**PACKAGING: It comes sealed so there is never leakage issues. The bottle and lid are of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;**SHAMPOO: Shampoo has a lovely fragrance that isn&#x27;t over-powering. There are no dyes so it is a clear natural color. The most notable fragrances are lavender and rosemary. My 7 year old is able to wash and rinse her own hair now and never complains about the soap stinging her eyes so I would say it is gentle. Her hair feels clean and is manageable to brush after being toweled dry. My daughter loves the shampoo. My 11 year old son likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;**USEFULNESS: It could be a combination of things such as being aware of high risk activities that cause lice and psychological peace-of-mind...but when we use this shampoo, we don&#x27;t have lice in this house. I went a couple of months without this shampoo for the kids, replacing it with a lavender shampoo and my daughter ended up with lice. Obviously that was traumatic enough for the family. As a part of our eradication procedure we purchased the 32oz bottle of Fairy Tales again. We have not been without it since. My family are faithful users since Summer 2012.&lt;br /&gt;**VALUE: I believe the $20ish bucks is a great value for the amount of &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; in the 32oz bottle. We wash hair on average of 3 times a week and the bottle lasts for months. When I break that down in cost compared to what it costs in $$ and anguish when lice comes home...always having this in the house is no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that although the title of product says &amp;#34;Organic Hair Care&amp;#34; it is not. I knew this when I purchased so there was no surprises but it could be misleading to new customers. To be clear, nowhere on the bottle does it say that the product is organic so I believe this is a seller discrepancy (or whoever listed this product), not a manufacturer/product discrepancy.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is keeping the lice away. Need I say more!??! A little goes a long way so the cost is worth it because it will last a long time. We had a light case of lice and I never want my kids to bring it home again so we will happily be buying this for years to come!</li>
            <li> Use this with our children everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Helps prevent the spread of lice in school.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say it works great</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love! A must have for every parent with school age children. Lice at school is an annual event. With this shampoo a parent does not have to worry about your child getting lice. I love this product and recommend every parent use it all year long as it conditions the hair too.</li>
            <li> We bought this because lice was going around my daughter&#x27;s school and I did NOT want it coming home with us (who does, right?)!  I washed my kids hair with this twice a week and used the spray in conditioner every morning and I believe it kept those nasty critters away!</li>
            <li> It really is soft on the hair and feels clean. I do not have lice in my hair just yet. I bought this product in precaution because my niece, whom I babysit all the time, has lice problems. Now that I am taking pre-cautuionary steps, I am satisfied with this product because I do feel less often itchiness when the day is hot and I sweat.</li>
