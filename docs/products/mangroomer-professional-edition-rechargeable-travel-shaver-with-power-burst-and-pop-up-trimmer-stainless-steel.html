    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>A shaver that won&#x27;t give you the greatest shave, holds its charge, and is portable.</li>
            <li>works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shopped around for awhile for a rechargeable shaver, this was the best review and price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>quality shaver and great price</li>
            <li>It is great for travel.</li>
            <li>This works great for trimming and shaving.</li>
            <li>one charge lasted me for about a month or so, the battery is great.</li>
            <li>And the price is great.</li>
            <li>Not as great as my Braun,</li>
            <li>It will give you a superior close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and perfectly fit my need</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver but the recharger leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good; battery life between charges is very good.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is amazing though.</li>
            <li>My package did not include a cover nor any kind of travel case.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it had a pop up trimmer as well as a shaving function, and that it could be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>However, the shaver is not as effective as the Eltron #el-3040 Compact Travel Shaver.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s handy on trips.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, gives a great shave and feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li>Its very smooth.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how the back shaver did what it had to do and was even using the coil shaver on it on my neck at times, but knew i needed something  more manageable to do the job.</li>
            <li>The next couple of uses were great!</li>
            <li>and it was ok for trimming.</li>
            <li>but it is one more thing that needs to be packed for any extended travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that I need to hold the shaver with my finger on top of the trimmer to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When they had a sale with 15% off we bought a couple more.</li>
            <li>Then I figured maybe the battery needs to die first to get a good charge, so I let it charge for 2 days (mostly because i forgot it was charging).</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good machine.</li>
            <li>A pretty good product.</li>
            <li>very nice groomer, i use for my mustache and it cuts all the hair deeply while making the skin smooth, there is a side cutter as well which works good as well.</li>
            <li>Could be more powerful, but works fine</li>
            <li>it is light weight and quality feel with the steel body.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this light weight shaver for the closeness and ease of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I liked the design and operation of this razor and really looked forward to using it.</li>
            <li>The charger is light weight</li>
            <li>This shaver and a free nose, ear, etc.</li>
            <li>Cheap as chips</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 16 year old son who needed a good shaver.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon did credit me for the original order sent out a ups pick up slip prepaid.</li>
            <li>I went to clean it</li>
            <li>Because of the charger/battery issue I am reluctant to clean it with water or use it that way regardless of the design of the shaver to the contrary.</li>
            <li>I do not blame Amazon tho they should get the shipping time more accurate and they should have inspected the 2nd shaver sent out to make sure that it did have the protective endcap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: For the current price ($17), and what it&#x27;s supposed to do, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Overall a good groomer</li>
            <li>Does good enough for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>would buy this again( and will for my other sons) for the great value and it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave: It&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for 1-pass shaving experience, be realistic: you&#x27;ll probably need to spend more than $25.</li>
            <li>Honestly I bought this only cause of the cool name, but was expecting</li>
            <li>Even then, don&#x27;t expect to give you the closest or most complete shave of your life.</li>
            <li>He had another one of a different kind</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shaver is a good value due to</li>
            <li>I prefer the straight blades on the trimmers in order to clean up my line up.</li>
            <li>As the package has a viewable clear front this would have been easy to do so when they were boxing it up for shipment.</li>
            <li>We charged it when it first arrived</li>
            <li>One of the items purchased broke after first use.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what piece it was exactly, but I can not reconnect the blades and pretty much ended up with junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>coincidentally, I got it when I had a fair amount of face hair &amp; to my dismay (after charging it till the charging light switched from red to green)</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works well but is positioned such that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally slide it up to the engaged position while trying to shave.  </li>
            <li>He has tried many expensive shavers, and other Mangroomer versions, but this is the best one, plus it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I recommend you save your money and buy the  Braun Smart Control 190s-1.</li>
            <li>Well fortunately for me someone bought it from my wishlist as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>So one star is too much.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>A button does not work, but also with the body out of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>also really like the trimmer on the back to touch up my sideburns/neck and just rinse under the sink to clean off.  </li>
            <li>I found the product worked great, just as I had anticipate, only found that I had to maneuver it in several different angles to get certain hairs, and pull my skin in some areas to get hairs that just weren&#x27;t getting cut, not figuring it was a big deal since I rarely use electric razors -</li>
            <li>I did not have to send the original unit back.</li>
            <li>I only shave once or twice a week, but that also means the charge doesn&#x27;t quickly trickle away like many other electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally found my one true electric razor.</li>
            <li>It took several hours of charging before the shaver could operate at full power.  </li>
            <li>Have only owned it for about 1 month and don&#x27;t use it daily, but my overall assessment is this product is just average at best.  </li>
            <li>The Eltron is cheaper, not rechargeable and less powerful--but, it will give you a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Being I expected it to work fine</li>
            <li>However a little better shaving performance and some responsiveness from the company would be required before I could give it a 5 or even a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>While it shaves OK, it feels a little underpowered in normal mode.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is reasonably close but not as close as my Panasonic home shaver or the old Braun.  </li>
            <li>not reliable or powerful enough...</li>
            <li>Recharging after one or two shaves is much quicker and full charge is indicated by a light that switches from red to green.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Mangroomer about the problem and they instructed me to wait for a new shaver to be sent.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t shave my facial negro hair very well at all!</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver at another site (for a slightly higher price) for my husband as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard, so when it did not work for me, I kind of thought it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Even now, after many months, I can expect the shaver to hold its charge for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>There are times when I&#x27;ll need 3-4 passes before an area is completely shaved/</li>
            <li>This is more for someone who has a moderate amount of facial hair, or doesn&#x27;t let their facial hair grow out too long.</li>
            <li>Now normally I have a beard and would just shave my neck without issue, so since I was doing my entire face except a goatee</li>
            <li>Ours has stayed red with no green showing.</li>
            <li>By reading &amp;#34;gadget buyer&#x27;s&amp;#34; review, I found out that this thing takes a long time to charge and that the light is supposed to turn from red to green.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, and looks sharp; but, for its primary purpose (close shave), it&#x27;s only average.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it misses quite a few hairs on the first pass.</li>
            <li>so if they come off just toss them because the whole razor is covered in a mat black rubber feel coating and works well in the shower.</li>

            <li> so if they come off just toss them because the whole razor is covered in a mat black rubber feel coating and works well in the shower.</li>
            <li> The foil cutter does an unremarkable job of providing a really close shave, and the beard trimmer pop-up perpetually slides down unless one holds it up with pressure.  </li>
            <li> Well my &amp;#34;Happily Ever After&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t last long since after maybe my 10th use</li>
            <li> I figured that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> It does have a \\&quot;Power Burst\\&quot; mode supposedly for heavy stubble, but I find that Power Burst brings it up to the power level that I would expect from a normal shaver.  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t use it daily, just every other day and not for a long period of time either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or if the shaver really isn&#x27;t shaving clean, but I have been gravely disappointed with the way this Mangroomer Shaver has worked since I got it.</li>
            <li> This little thing works a charm I have it in the car to use as back up when I forget to shave.</li>
            <li> When I initially opened the package i immediately noticed the that shiny metal casing wasn&#x27;t glued on all the way and that the extendable trimmer was missing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Operating instructions are minimal.  </li>
            <li> Although the packaging says \\&quot;Wet/Dry\\&quot;, indicating that the shaver can be used in a shower and rinsed under running water, there is nothing in the instructions about using the shaver in wet conditions.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet tried it for wet shaving for fear of damaging it.  </li>
            <li> The mangroomer should last a few years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how long this shaver will hold a charge as I haven&#x27;t used it enough to require a recharge, but at least it came with a charger.  </li>
            <li> It does work but not as well as some other razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp as the Eltron.</li>
            <li> The other has had no issues.</li>

            <li> it is light weight and quality feel with the steel body.  also really like the trimmer on the back to touch up my sideburns/neck and just rinse under the sink to clean off.  quality shaver and great price</li>
            <li> not reliable or powerful enough...</li>
            <li> I had this item in my wishlist after getting the man groomer back shaver. I was really impressed with how the back shaver did what it had to do and was even using the coil shaver on it on my neck at times, but knew i needed something  more manageable to do the job. Well fortunately for me someone bought it from my wishlist as a Christmas present. When I initially opened the package i immediately noticed the that shiny metal casing wasn&#x27;t glued on all the way and that the extendable trimmer was missing. I ended up finding the trimmer piece almost halfway across the room (no idea how that happened) and just glued the casing back on. I figured I had to charge it before use so I let it sit and charge overnight for maybe 8 hours. I went to use it and it almost died almost instantly - and I had to use a Mach to finish the job. Then I figured maybe the battery needs to die first to get a good charge, so I let it charge for 2 days (mostly because i forgot it was charging). When I went to use it I found the product worked great, just as I had anticipate, only found that I had to maneuver it in several different angles to get certain hairs, and pull my skin in some areas to get hairs that just weren&#x27;t getting cut, not figuring it was a big deal since I rarely use electric razors - since any of the circular systems end up usually biting me. The next couple of uses were great! Had to charge it after every 3rd time. No razor burn. No ingrown hairs. I finally found my one true electric razor. Well my &amp;#34;Happily Ever After&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t last long since after maybe my 10th use I went to clean it and as I took of the coil guard the blades came off the mount and some roundish piece went down my sink drain. I have no idea what piece it was exactly, but I can not reconnect the blades and pretty much ended up with junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After toying around with the idea I decided to buy another one since it worked well on/with my skin. Everything was attached. I started charged it at noon when I received it and went to use it the next day and of course what happened? it held no charge. So I let it charge again for the next use. Well it died on me again alway through! Now normally I have a beard and would just shave my neck without issue, so since I was doing my entire face except a goatee I figured that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t last as long. If after attempt #3 I&#x27;m considering calling the company to see I can reimbursed for one, if not both of them. Being I expected it to work fine I threw out the packaging, so hopefully they&#x27;ll let it slide.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this light weight shaver for the closeness and ease of the trimmer. It is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this item after having owned it for a little under a year now. I originally purchased it for $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: The travel shaver holds its charge well. Even now, after many months, I can expect the shaver to hold its charge for at least 3 weeks. Keep in mind I only shave once or twice a week, but that also means the charge doesn&#x27;t quickly trickle away like many other electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave: It&#x27;s adequate. If you have thick hair, this isn&#x27;t for you. This is more for someone who has a moderate amount of facial hair, or doesn&#x27;t let their facial hair grow out too long. Even then, don&#x27;t expect to give you the closest or most complete shave of your life. In fact, it misses quite a few hairs on the first pass. There are times when I&#x27;ll need 3-4 passes before an area is completely shaved/trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: For the current price ($17), and what it&#x27;s supposed to do, this is a good deal. A shaver that won&#x27;t give you the greatest shave, holds its charge, and is portable. If you&#x27;re looking for 1-pass shaving experience, be realistic: you&#x27;ll probably need to spend more than $25.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 16 year old son who needed a good shaver. He had another one of a different kind and it was ok for trimming. This works great for trimming and shaving. Holds a charge for........? We charged it when it first arrived and it is still going. He doesn&#x27;t use it daily, just every other day and not for a long period of time either.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again( and will for my other sons) for the great value and it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shopped around for awhile for a rechargeable shaver, this was the best review and price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have only owned it for about 1 month and don&#x27;t use it daily, but my overall assessment is this product is just average at best.  The foil cutter does an unremarkable job of providing a really close shave, and the beard trimmer pop-up perpetually slides down unless one holds it up with pressure.  The one I ordered stated it came with a foil head cover, but none was to be found in the product case; I emailed the manufacturer, but never received a response--lousy customer service!  Can&#x27;t say how long this shaver will hold a charge as I haven&#x27;t used it enough to require a recharge, but at least it came with a charger.  It is lightweight, and looks sharp; but, for its primary purpose (close shave), it&#x27;s only average.  Then again, what could one expect for an electric shaver @ less than $20.00?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work... Returning.... Put a double a battery inside and it just didn&#x27;t function at all. I would recommend you don&#x27;t order this I&#x27;m not sure how the other mangroomer products are</li>
            <li> I liked the design and operation of this razor and really looked forward to using it. Unfortunately after 3 weeks of very limited use the battery failed. It will not hold a charge. I&#x27;d like to return it and maybe? try another one. However, for anyone considering buying this razor......beware.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> It does work but not as well as some other razors. Battery life is amazing though. In all the desgin is a lot bigger than it seems. The metal plates are only held on by some glue so if they come off just toss them because the whole razor is covered in a mat black rubber feel coating and works well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Could be more powerful, but works fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair type or if the shaver really isn&#x27;t shaving clean, but I have been gravely disappointed with the way this Mangroomer Shaver has worked since I got it. coincidentally, I got it when I had a fair amount of face hair &amp; to my dismay (after charging it till the charging light switched from red to green) it didn&#x27;t shave my facial negro hair very well at all! the push-up shave blade is as dull as a butter knife and practically useless. The close shaver has to be pressed so hard against my face to get it to work a little and its actually missing spots.</li>
            <li> MANGROOMER ! Honestly I bought this only cause of the cool name, but was expecting a half decent product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get a thick beard and this shaver couldn&#x27;t even shave that.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it the very next day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item with a 2 day shipping agreement as i am a Amazon Prime member. Received it in 3 days and with the protective endcap that covers the foil end missing (package had not been opened so was missing from the factory). Notified Amazon and they said offered to send it out next day shipping, Received an emali later saying it would be 2 day shipping. Item arrived in 3 days and yes again the protective end cap was missing also (package was not opened so again it came that way to them from the factory). I do not blame Amazon tho they should get the shipping time more accurate and they should have inspected the 2nd shaver sent out to make sure that it did have the protective endcap. As the package has a viewable clear front this would have been easy to do so when they were boxing it up for shipment. Amazon did credit me for the original order sent out a ups pick up slip prepaid. Still what a hassle</li>
            <li> very nice groomer, i use for my mustache and it cuts all the hair deeply while making the skin smooth, there is a side cutter as well which works good as well. one charge lasted me for about a month or so, the battery is great. Overall a good groomer</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mangroomer as a replacement for my 20 year old Braun 150 that finally failed.  The Mangroomer is similar in size and weight to the Braun, but comes with a wall-wart charger, while the Braun had the charger built-in and only required a power cable.  The charger is light weight but it is one more thing that needs to be packed for any extended travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operating instructions are minimal.  Although the packaging says \\&quot;Wet/Dry\\&quot;, indicating that the shaver can be used in a shower and rinsed under running water, there is nothing in the instructions about using the shaver in wet conditions.  I have not yet tried it for wet shaving for fear of damaging it.  Also, the instructions say to attach the protective cover when the shaver is not in use.  My package did not include a cover nor any kind of travel case.  I tried to contact Mangroomer using their website but have received no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial charging on the Mangroomer is slow.  It took several hours of charging before the shaver could operate at full power.  Recharging after one or two shaves is much quicker and full charge is indicated by a light that switches from red to green.  While it shaves OK, it feels a little underpowered in normal mode.  It does have a \\&quot;Power Burst\\&quot; mode supposedly for heavy stubble, but I find that Power Burst brings it up to the power level that I would expect from a normal shaver.  Shaving is reasonably close but not as close as my Panasonic home shaver or the old Braun.  The pop-up trimmer works well but is positioned such that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally slide it up to the engaged position while trying to shave.  I find that I need to hold the shaver with my finger on top of the trimmer to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shaver is a good value due to it&#x27;s low price.  However a little better shaving performance and some responsiveness from the company would be required before I could give it a 5 or even a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> After a 24 hour charge if will last about a week before the next 24 hour charge. If you use it every daym This is a pretty good machine. It will give you a superior close shave.And the price is great.</li>
            <li> Shaver did not give a close shave</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, so when it did not work for me, I kind of thought it wouldn&#x27;t. Then I gave it to my wife, and it did not work for her. So one star is too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and perfectly fit my need</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this Mangroomer. When they had a sale with 15% off we bought a couple more. He has tried many expensive shavers, and other Mangroomer versions, but this is the best one, plus it is reasonably priced. Don&#x27;t tell anyone but I use it too! Its very smooth.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt of my shaver I plugged in the charger and 24 hours later I tried to use it and it would not operate. I contacted Mangroomer about the problem and they instructed me to wait for a new shaver to be sent. This shaver and a free nose, ear, etc. trimmer was sent to me. I did not have to send the original unit back. This shaver charged. The shaver is like a regular electric shaver. Powerful, gives a great shave and feels like a quality product. It usually shaves for 2 to 2 1/2 shaves and needs to be recharged. It&#x27;s a good shaver but the recharger leaves a bit to be desired. Maybe it&#x27;s the ni-cad batteries. There is something that needs to be improved on that end. Because of the charger/battery issue I am reluctant to clean it with water or use it that way regardless of the design of the shaver to the contrary.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver at another site (for a slightly higher price) for my husband as a Christmas present. I liked the fact that it had a pop up trimmer as well as a shaving function, and that it could be used in the shower. My husband plugged the thing in Christmas day and by night it still didn&#x27;t work. The package and instructions were destroyed and taken out with the Christmas trash, so I can&#x27;t even send it back. By reading &amp;#34;gadget buyer&#x27;s&amp;#34; review, I found out that this thing takes a long time to charge and that the light is supposed to turn from red to green. Ours has stayed red with no green showing. It has now been plugged in for close to 48 hours, and when you push the buttons, there is no power at all. Does anyone know if there a trick I am missing, or is the company just sending out duds?</li>
            <li> A button does not work, but also with the body out of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This shaver has got a lot of power and it&#x27;s rechargeable. The charge will last for days. However, the shaver is not as effective as the Eltron #el-3040 Compact Travel Shaver. The Eltron is cheaper, not rechargeable and less powerful--but, it will give you a better shave.  The pop-up trimmer on the mangroomer is horrible. It&#x27;s not as sharp as the Eltron. It is also one of those 90 degree &#x27;claw like&#x27; blade trimmers. This makes it nearly impossible to see the sideburns as you&#x27;re cutting. It limits your view. I don&#x27;t know why some people would prefer these pop-up trimmers instead. I cut my own hair. I prefer the straight blades on the trimmers in order to clean up my line up. The Eltron has got it. However, the eltron will stop working after a few months. The mangroomer should last a few years. I recommend you save your money and buy the  Braun Smart Control 190s-1. It shaves well. It&#x27;s rechargeable. You can shave with it while it&#x27;s charging and plugged into the outlet or cordless.</li>
            <li> This little thing works a charm I have it in the car to use as back up when I forget to shave. Cheap as chips</li>
            <li> One of the items purchased broke after first use. Contacted seller they replaced it no questions asked. The other has had no issues. A pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good; battery life between charges is very good.  Not as great as my Braun, but it&#x27;s handy on trips.  Does good enough for a quick shave.</li>
