            <li>so far seems to be working okay</li>

            <li>I have used many higher end skin care items before and these have far exceeded at a lower price.</li>

            <li>Ingredients are higher quality and natural and the products work well together,</li>
            <li>Thank you AMAZON for the opportunity to try new things!</li>
            <li>and if I see a difference, I will write a new review then.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like this because it makes your eyes sting and turn red!</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a clear container</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>but I have had problems with allergies to all of them so far.</li>

            <li> Unless it is only for dark circle, it did not do it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a month, it seems to clam down my puffiness (not totally diminish).  </li>
            <li> Also, after a few days my eyes started to get red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I used all of it hoping I will see a difference and absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> Does not firm under-eye bags, it only makes them appear worse as it puffs up area to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> She has worked and has since worked with me to find the problem and other options on products that will work for</li>
            <li> What it does do is burn slightly which is mentioned in directions.</li>
            <li> all&lt;br /&gt;the black lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products and they&#x27;re usually too greasy or thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li> This firming get helps a little</li>
            <li> I think it helps a little.  </li>
            <li> That is until a friend gave me this product as a gift a few weeks</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t just firm my under eye bags, it reduced lines</li>
            <li> I was very upset and left a horrible review.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 2 months</li>
            <li> and I could see a difference within a few minutes !!</li>
            <li> After that the entire area was dry and hardened and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> I purchased all 4 products in this line and after using this and my acne medication I had a horrible reaction on my face.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product.  Definite reduction in the appearance of wrinkes.  Wish it came in a clear container so I knew when I was running low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I decided to give New Resilient Beauty &amp;#34;Uplifting Eye Treatment&amp;#34; a try. Like a lot of women, I&#x27;ve always had a problem with bags under my eyes no matter how much I slept. That is until a friend gave me this product as a gift a few weeks a go. My under eye bags started to reduce almost immediately. It didn&#x27;t just firm my under eye bags, it reduced lines I didn&#x27;t even realize I had!&lt;br /&gt;This really is a must have product for anybody that has issues with under eye bags, circles, or lines/wrinkles. Just a dab or two a day and all those things will be vastly improved leaving your eyes looking so much younger! I plan on buying more when mine runs out and gifting to several girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Have use for a couple of months with no noticeable result.</li>
            <li> This product caused the entire area under my eyes to burn, swell and inflamed. It took more than a week for my face to heal. After that the entire area was dry and hardened and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I bought it, I can feel my eye lids tighten. I&amp;#34; have tried may products, this is the only one that works</li>
            <li> This is the first eye product that I&#x27;ve used that actually really works.  I highly recommend it!!!  I have had bags under my eyes for years and have tried pretty much everything out there from Lancome, Clinique and many others and this is the first product that actually made my bags go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased far more expensive eye creams that have provided fewer results.  This product may be one of the most effective I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s performance exceeds those recommended by my dermatologist.  A real winner.</li>
            <li> I find this gel works well in lessening the puffiness around my eyes even when I eat salty food.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this because it makes your eyes sting and turn red! But after a week of using that went away, and my lines around my eyes disappeared, so I think it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> We are undecided if this works or not. What it does do is burn slightly which is mentioned in directions.</li>
            <li> This firming get helps a little but it is not a miracle.  I wanted it for the puffiness of my upper eye lid.  I think it helps a little.  I have been using it for at least 2 months, That&#x27;s about all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased all 4 products in this line and after using this and my acne medication I had a horrible reaction on my face.  I then received a phone call from the company trying to persuade me to leave positive reviews even after I explained my reaction.  I was very upset and left a horrible review. I then received a call from the owner of the company and she was very upset about my experience. She has worked and has since worked with me to find the problem and other options on products that will work for me.&lt;br /&gt; I have found out that my reaction was to a formulation change in my acne medication.  I am so impressed that there is company that cares so much about customers and is willing to go above and beyond what they have to. I have been using the product now for 2 weeks and have started to see results.  Ingredients are higher quality and natural and the products work well together, great skin care line and I am impressed. I have used many higher end skin care items before and these have far exceeded at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Really a magic!!  My wrinkles have disappeared and I got rid off all&lt;br /&gt;the black lines. This uplifting eye gel is superior than any other eye&lt;br /&gt;gel. I used this eye cream  three times in a day and  no doubt its&lt;br /&gt;giving me excellent results. I am 100% satisfied with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this Firming Gel to Renew Fresh, Youthful Eyes, Uplifting Eye Treatment works like it says it will, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my under eye lines yet.  It is light, not heavy, and feels nice going on and my makeup goes on top of it easily.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone and if I see a difference, I will write a new review then.</li>
            <li> Does not firm under-eye bags, it only makes them appear worse as it puffs up area to reduce wrinkles. Also, after a few days my eyes started to get red and irritated. I do not recommend this for people with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for around my eyes but I have had problems with allergies to all of them so far. This is the first product that I can use around my eyes that I don&#x27;t have any problems with and it seems to be working good.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  I love it so far.  Have only used it for a couple of weeks now but plan on buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing ! And works great !  Love this product, and love the price as well.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products and they&#x27;re usually too greasy or thick for my liking.  This is not like that at all.  And doesn&#x27;t feel chunky under my make up. I will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> This is an eye gel which takes care of all eye problems. I have tried many products but this  is the best I have tried. I saw results the first day.  It is economical and a product that really works and i like it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this eye cream I put it on one eye only, to compare and I could see a difference within a few minutes !! Its like a dream which came true. This gel has given me 100% results and almost all the members of my family are using this product. No one has any complaints about this eye gel .Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and did not notice any reduction in my baggy eyes.  Unless it is only for dark circle, it did not do it for me. I will continue to use it to finish the jar and hope for miracle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Have not seen a change since using this product. I used all of it hoping I will see a difference and absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> so far seems to be working okay---not gonna say its the best eye gel i have ever used---- THAT REMAINS to be SEEN.  Thank you AMAZON for the opportunity to try new things!</li>
            <li> Great product, great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a month, it seems to clam down my puffiness (not totally diminish).  It has a nice smell, isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
