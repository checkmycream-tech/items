            <li>I loved Truth or Dare</li>
            <li>Very nice if you love vanilla.  </li>
            <li>We both agree that it smells much better on her!  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Many complements!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the risk!</li>
            <li>so when I run out I will purchase more through this seller!</li>
            <li>and it is complemented with the amazing longevity of the scent.</li>
            <li>me, this smells a lot like cream soda and root beer, with a warm, spicy tone.  </li>
            <li>(today was warm) and see if it suits me better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume is so sensual, it is a nice blend of sandalwood, benzoin</li>
            <li>smells nice for the winter&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>okay when I catch it in the air around me, but when I smell my wrist, it&#x27;s very strong like fizzy soda.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone that loves this scent is lucky to get the good notes out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I get so many complements when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>but then when I pass someone they say &amp;#34;I love what you are wearing&amp;#34; and this is at the end of the work day.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and I love Madonna.</li>
            <li>and I love this one too.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent &amp; lasts long !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually glad that Madonna is not as popular as she once was so that a million young girls aren&#x27;t wearing this.</li>
            <li>so I was stoked to find it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a great scent also that last all day.</li>
            <li>Perfume as promised and in time for an important event .</li>
            <li>Fantastic smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the original Truth or Dare.  </li>
            <li>Her first truth or dare has more uniqueness and seems to have been copied, Estee Lauder muse chic.</li>
            <li>I put this on and when I walked past my husband he immediately attacked me telling me how wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li>This perfume came in pristine condition as advertised and its the real perfume , thank you so much , keep up the good work</li>
            <li>Got here super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I keep hoping to smell the sweet vanilla and chocolate scent others noticed, but I can&#x27;t detect it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool</li>
            <li>Sweet vanilla woody fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying this, because I like the first Truth or Dare, and this one gets much better reviews than the first tends to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That one smells like florals, then dries down to a warm vanilla that I love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sophisticated without any old lady qualities.  </li>
            <li>This is a rich, woodsy scent that I love enough to put in a travel atomizer.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my signature scent for winter!</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really smell it on me</li>
            <li>What your left with is sweet creamy vanilla</li>
            <li>I expected the fragrance to last being that it has warm under tones, disappears after 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, dark,and cocky, yet sweet and simple.</li>
            <li>I need a new bottle already</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but not enjoyable, either.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly masculine, like cologne or after-shave, with a bit of a minty note.  </li>
            <li>me, this is a miss so far.  </li>
            <li>(If you don&#x27;t like vanilla scents, stay far, far away.)</li>
            <li>I want to keep it a secret, but I&#x27;m feeling nice today.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more serious with almost a warming sense.  </li>
            <li>I usually go for sweet smelling scents such as caramel/vanilla perfume.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to wash it off a few times, because it was quite strong, and though it didn&#x27;t give me a headache, it did make me feel a little woozy at times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to describe, there&#x27;s actually one note that smells like childrens play doh, but it only comes out in the initial spray and fades away quickly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was looking forward to trying this, because I like the first Truth or Dare, and this one gets much better reviews than the first tends to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, this smells a lot like cream soda and root beer, with a warm, spicy tone.  It is slightly masculine, like cologne or after-shave, with a bit of a minty note.  The mint went away, but the soda scent is still there.  It smells okay when I catch it in the air around me, but when I smell my wrist, it&#x27;s very strong like fizzy soda.  I keep hoping to smell the sweet vanilla and chocolate scent others noticed, but I can&#x27;t detect it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my mother to try it, since perfume is different on everyone.  She was reluctant, because she could smell it as I walked by and she didn&#x27;t care for it.  On her, there was the soda smell, but also a little floral and fruity scents, too.  We both agree that it smells much better on her!  She actually is starting to like it now.  I&#x27;d like it, too, if I got the fruity/floral scent on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a miss so far.  Not horrible, but not enjoyable, either.  I was tempted to wash it off a few times, because it was quite strong, and though it didn&#x27;t give me a headache, it did make me feel a little woozy at times.  I&#x27;m going to try it on a cold day (today was warm) and see if it suits me better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone that loves this scent is lucky to get the good notes out of it.  I&#x27;ll stick to the original Truth or Dare.  That one smells like florals, then dries down to a warm vanilla that I love.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not able to wear spicy scents.</li>
            <li> A long-lasting but not overpowering cozy scent.  Very nice if you love vanilla.  (If you don&#x27;t like vanilla scents, stay far, far away.)</li>
            <li> amazing!!! great service!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells like Glade&#x27;s cashmere woods candle. Her first truth or dare has more uniqueness and seems to have been copied, Estee Lauder muse chic.</li>
            <li> 5 stars is NOT enough!!! I put this on and when I walked past my husband he immediately attacked me telling me how wonderful I smell. I have tested him out and worn other ones then I will just put this on and he notices immediately! He can&#x27;t leave me alone when I wear this. I need a new bottle already</li>
            <li> I have heard this perfume is hard to find so I was stoked to find it at such a great price. It is perfect for the winter weather. This is absolutely my signature scent for winter! I&#x27;m actually glad that Madonna is not as popular as she once was so that a million young girls aren&#x27;t wearing this. It&#x27;s really hard to describe, there&#x27;s actually one note that smells like childrens play doh, but it only comes out in the initial spray and fades away quickly. What your left with is sweet creamy vanilla that&#x27;s quite long lasting, but not overbearing. I wear it to bed sometimes and can smell it on my nightie days later. It&#x27;s very feminine. I almost didn&#x27;t write this review cos I want to keep it a secret, but I&#x27;m feeling nice today. haha! Try it! Definitely a winter scent though, can&#x27;t imagine wearing this in spring or summer.&lt;br /&gt;This seller was great, btw. Got here super fast!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Perfer it over the 1st fragrance. Many complements! Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a rich, woodsy scent that I love enough to put in a travel atomizer. It only lasts a couple of hours on the skin though. Longer if I spray it onto my hair or clothing.</li>
            <li> This perfume came in pristine condition as advertised and its the real perfume , thank you so much , keep up the good work and when im done with the perfume  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome Perfume. Smells so feminine!!! Probably going to buy this forever</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I get so many complements when I wear it.  I can&#x27;t really smell it on me but then when I pass someone they say &amp;#34;I love what you are wearing&amp;#34; and this is at the end of the work day. The lotion has a great scent also that last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I love Madonna. This perfume somehow gives me a feeling of confidence whenever I wear it on. It&#x27;s sexy, dark,and cocky, yet sweet and simple. There&#x27;s this dualism that goes on and it is complemented with the amazing longevity of the scent.</li>
            <li> I got my fav. Perfume as promised and in time for an important event . This is actually my second purchase with them.</li>
            <li> I despite celebrity perfume so I went against the grain when I ordered this perfume by Madonna. I&#x27;m glad I took the risk! I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist. I usually go for sweet smelling scents such as caramel/vanilla perfume. This perfume is so sensual, it is a nice blend of sandalwood, benzoin and I think I smell a little bit of a vanilla note. The bottle is really cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this last week, received it yesterday and there is still 8 days left before the estimated arrival date so when I run out I will purchase more through this seller!</li>
            <li> smells nice for the winter&lt;br /&gt;I would compare it to chanel&#x27;s allure</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell.  It&#x27;s a bit more serious with almost a warming sense.  It&#x27;s sophisticated without any old lady qualities.  Great for nighttime.</li>
            <li> I loved Truth or Dare and I love this one too. (Although, they are nothing alike, at all). I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments on this perfume, since I stated wearing it. Will definitely be buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent &amp; lasts long !</li>
            <li> Smells great and a perfect gift for any Madonna enthusiast in your life. Sweet vanilla woody fragrance.</li>
            <li> I expected the fragrance to last being that it has warm under tones, disappears after 2 hours. I gave it a 3 star for the smell. Will not order again</li>
            <li> Thank you again for this perfume! my therapist will love it!!</li>
