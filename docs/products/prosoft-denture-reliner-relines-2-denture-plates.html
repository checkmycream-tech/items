            <li>Good idea but do not work well on partials and</li>

            <li>it was easy to use and works great ...</li>
            <li>I thought it was easy and great</li>
            <li>It is great, but I wish it would fit snugger on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I put the lowers in this am, they fit great.  </li>
            <li>; this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>bought for friend she liked it</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find some one that still supplies this product.</li>
            <li>which is nice....</li>
            <li>The dentist didn&#x27;t put a liner in, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>Not as good as some I have used, but it is okay for  temporary liner.</li>
            <li>Always fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li>The cushion feel is nice</li>
            <li>I bought it for my father and he liked it.</li>
            <li>It takes a good minute or more for it to thicken to the consistency of honey.</li>
            <li>The good news is it&#x27;s a much better reline than what I got from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I now have good suction on the top denture.</li>
            <li>So that stir stick also was handy for scooping and smearing.</li>
            <li>Worked really great, and her dentures fit better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and result was good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>Product was very easy to use and worked as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Soft is a real good</li>
            <li>This is by far the best reliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Fit good, however after 1st meal, out they came...</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product to make comfortably soft relines for dentures.</li>
            <li>I love that I can reapply whenever I need to and adjust it at my own whim.</li>
            <li>So far, the best of the liquid reliners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions like they said and Pro Soft worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I relined mine with Pro Soft and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The seller was great , and the product came on time, it mixed nicely , and has done a great job</li>
            <li>Was easy to use and it Works!</li>
            <li>When they first go in they feel great but</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how this has made my dentures fit and feel.</li>
            <li>the softness is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Instructions are very good had no problems so far.</li>
            <li>looks ok ,haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li>I should of use both for just the top plate</li>
            <li>loveit love it love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more try and if anything changes I&#x27;ll write a follow-up review.</li>
            <li>the product worked very well and was happy with it</li>
            <li>Prosoft was much better for me.</li>
            <li>My dentures are better now than ever before.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine that anything else could work better.</li>
            <li>I understand it has to be replaced more often</li>
            <li>I just wish they both worked better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad my choice was ProSoft.</li>
            <li>if  you purchase more</li>
            <li>It has been about a week now and looks like I&#x27;ll have a add a b&#x27;it more to both which would incline me to subtract a star.</li>
            <li>it was okay not what I thought was going to be</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well and the after taste remains even now after most has been removed.\&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure you do the procedure on a washable surface-</li>
            <li>Be sure to do one plate at a time.  </li>
            <li>If your denture used to rock in your mouth, be sure to tip the denture a bit towards the side that needs to be thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to time those three minutes exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, be sure to time exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to time those three minutes exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, be sure to time exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both are sometimes challenging to remove, I heat up water for a couple of minutes in the microwave...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>i glad i found it.</li>
            <li>Works better than what the dentist has done for him.</li>
            <li>I have had so many problems with the liner that my dentist used</li>
            <li>and I truly love this.</li>
            <li>I tried some different ones, but ProSoft is the best yet.</li>
            <li>yes it did so much better</li>
            <li>I have used most of these products, and this product is above wonderful.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try, despite the many, many reviews stating that the chemical taste is....</li>
            <li>used to be better.</li>
            <li>Upper came out as advertised, Excellent.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Its certainly better and cheaper than the dentist.</li>
            <li>As a retired dental lab tech, it is better and easier to use than any denture line I ave ever worked with.  </li>
            <li>My dentures are so comfortable now and no need for adhesives!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I had used Acryline, but this is much better.  </li>
            <li>I do intend to purchase some more in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Once I got over my fear of trying this (being a former &#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27; fan), it was great!!</li>
            <li>and I will say that Perma Labs as got another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Wish they made it with a better taste  .</li>
            <li>worked ok until we seen the dentist</li>
            <li>It was ok in the beginning</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>Works great and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I still use a powder on top to assist in holding the plate in place.</li>
            <li>Overall experience is awesome.</li>
            <li>It has made my life much better.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more of this when needed.</li>
            <li>ProSoft is softer and more flexible, but lasts around 6 months to a year instead of up to 2 years like Perma Soft\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and I will be able to get 4 uses out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, I have also used Cushion Grip and this product is much better.</li>
            <li>So I will be ordering more again soon.</li>
            <li>I have&#x27;nt found anything else that works better.</li>
            <li>So much better now.</li>
            <li>I still use the powder to be sure they stay in, but so much better than before.</li>
            <li>Its OK for a one day use</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>10 more words required.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buy more, just to have it on hand.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>they are a million times more</li>
            <li>This is the second time we have purchased this product and it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Way better then paying the money for a re-liner at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Do you have another product that works better?</li>
            <li>the directions and you will be satisfied with the results</li>
            <li>save me some more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is better than the D.O.C Reline</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I thought about paying $100.00 more dollars to have my plate lined again and having to go without my denture.</li>
            <li>that is, like I said, until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>I was beyond satisfied with the customer service that I received.&lt;br /&gt;Now - the product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>However overall I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>however they advertise 2 relines and it took both containers to just do the top denture.</li>
            <li>After the setting time, most of the excess material was removed with just my finger</li>
            <li>After struggling with them for over 6 months and stil not being able to bite into a sandwich because the bite was so &#x27;off&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was having pain, I ended up leaving with my mouth hurting more than before I went to correct the problem.</li>
            <li>so it has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>worked great--they fit a lot better now--was very easy to use</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t quite get a good result on your first try, don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>Does not taste good the first day</li>
            <li>After trying this product I am impressed as to how soft and comfortable my dentures know fit and feel.</li>
            <li>Made my dentures fit better and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t pleasant at first, but can easily be remedied.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this particular product and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Worked pretty good and am sure when I use it again it will go more smoothly, now that I know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I have worn the denture with the new lining for a couple of days and it works great.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how I managed to get a great fit with ProSoft, and some helpful hints: ProSoft really does edge out the competition.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it, it seemed to be the next best option from what is available.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be fine</li>
            <li>It works fine until I can get to the denturist for a more permanent reline.</li>
            <li>It is great, easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li>The liner stays pliable/soft, making my dentures much more comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>So being able to help myself is important and now my lower plate does not rub or hurt me.</li>
            <li>When you go out to dinner you want to be able to enjoy the food you buy.  </li>
            <li>most comfortable things either.</li>
            <li>By doing that you will not be doing any gum wiggling and the fit will be even better.</li>
            <li>Dentures never felt or fit better.</li>
            <li>I needed a reline because my lowers were &amp;#34;Immediates,&amp;#34; the kind that are put in right after an extraction.  </li>
            <li>I got to do my reline, and I can not say enough good things about this kit!</li>
            <li>gel like easy on the gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s very mild compared with the burning from the doc recline kit.</li>
            <li>This was an easy fix for awhile,easy  to do.</li>
            <li>EASY TO APPLY.</li>

            <li>Easy to apply</li>

            <li>easy to remove once it started separating on its own just pull and pry out use hot water in between prying and pulling.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I did use my fixedent powder as I do love a full hold in case</li>
            <li>So, I tried my own reline for the first time and want to share my experience.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve managed to be successful and not waste any product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy, cheap and quick...definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I found this product to work just fine.</li>
            <li>I will have to fine a dentist to do  a reline.</li>
            <li>but if you do what they suggest it works out fine.  </li>
            <li>The denture reline kit was worth the money, easy to use and no nasty after taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ProSoft did exactly what it said and it was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy directions, easy to use, no bad aftertaste or smell.</li>

            <li>it cushioned my dentures they fit and stayed without any adhesive or sea bond.</li>
            <li>I just relined my upper denture and it feel absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Comfort is important to me.</li>
            <li>Have not tested them yet, but they feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Have an extra pack on hand so you can see how great it can be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product makes a custom fit for you.</li>
            <li>tHIS IS WHERE YOU GET YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li>tHIS IS WHERE YOU GET YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li>YOU NEED THEM TO HUG YOUR GUMS PRECISELY.</li>
            <li>When you have trimmed your denture, pop it in for fit-</li>
            <li>When you have trimmed your denture, pop it in for fit-</li>
            <li>SECURE CARE adhesive however is a rip off.</li>
            <li>The dentist can&#x27;t seem to get his dentures to fit his mouth</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to say that I have tried D.O.C. Reline-It, Advanced Denture Reliner</li>
            <li>and it works fantastic, and was the cheapest one I could find.</li>
            <li>I, for one, will deal with the taste to have the hold and fit</li>
            <li>I have dentures and others in my family, I do the relining for them also and this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>And it takes me awhile before I can get them to a point that is comfortable for me to even eat with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gave me the fit of a profession reline.</li>
            <li>I have had an occasional need to use this reliner for temporarty solutions and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I cannot have the denture fit too snugly as I have to have room for the Poligrip to make a surface of adherence.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit from the beginning</li>
            <li>My soft reline is still good after 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Works Great better than expected just mix and pour</li>
            <li>Was very easy to use,and made my dentures fit prefectly!!!Thanks SO much</li>
            <li>My friend says her dentures are more stable and more comfortable than when the were new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better, but even as a first-time user the product was not hard to work with, as I feared it might be.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that this is the best</li>
            <li>It is, however, my first time ordering it through Amazon, which I will continue to do as the price is better and it arrived faster.</li>
            <li>Due to dislike of&lt;br /&gt;Going to dentist I am a DIY person , this product is great, easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I should have stayed the course, because clean up was a cinch.</li>
            <li>I am bummed out and trying to clean this out</li>
            <li>I try to catch it when they&#x27;ve got special deals going on...</li>
            <li>Everything is included in this package, instructions, and most importantly correct measures to mix, for a durable comfortable soft reline.</li>
            <li>Good thing this stuff is only temporary......</li>
            <li>I wanted my dentures super clean.</li>
            <li>So if I had given this 4 1/2 stars, I would now upgrade my rating today to a full 5.</li>
            <li>(although the directions were quite good and specific).  </li>
            <li>I liked how soft it was</li>
            <li>Great results, Better and much easier to use than I had expected</li>
            <li>I bought this ProSoft reliner kit for my full lower denture.</li>
            <li>It is important to time everything just right as per the directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is easy to use, watch a helpful video on utube before trying first time it will help you out.</li>
            <li>Product works if you will follow the directions and don&#x27;t bite to strong at first try.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different liners and by far the best,easiest to use,last the longest and does the best job of all of them is the pro soft denture liner.</li>
            <li>Provides a fit as good or better than most professional relines I have had at a cost hundreds of dollars less.</li>
            <li>Instead I came straight home and hit Amazon and found this little box of wonderful.</li>
            <li>Dentures now fit very snugly and comfortable for about a week now.</li>
            <li>There is not a lot of maintenance to it and you can quickly get on with your life .  </li>
            <li>This product makes them fit much better while you are waiting for your gums to heal completely</li>
            <li>While boxes and contents looked almost identical, the ProSoft did not harden as quickly.</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm for me allowing me to gradually eat more and more solid foods.</li>
            <li>lucky to get two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Super quick shippers.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, but is rather tricky to apply, being very, very gooey!  </li>
            <li>After using 2 other brands this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>but I was overall very pleased</li>
            <li>nice soft liner, longer lasting than comfort grip and so much more comfortable than re- line it</li>
            <li>One more thought: try to figure out a way to get new dentures.</li>
            <li>One more thought: try to figure out a way to get new dentures.</li>
            <li>I still use a it of adhesive to secure each denture as I like to be sure of no slipping.</li>
            <li>Now they fit great and no more pressure points.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Be sure you have a clock and a good, small paring knife.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions and works very well.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars is because it does taste &#x27;funky&#x27; for awhile, but that&#x27;s a small price to to pay for the good comfort and fit!</li>
            <li>Its easy and fast to do for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use and worked very well on the uppers.</li>
            <li>easy to use sticks to plate very well</li>
            <li>works very well and easy to use</li>
            <li>think you should put out a better product and help these old people!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Had no problem mixing and applying the pro soft and it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use and makes my partial plate feel and fit better.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using Pro Soft to help my new dentures fit better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had occasion to use this product yet, but after looking it over, I&#x27;m fairly certain that it will work as well as the Coe-Soft (which is no longer available) did.  </li>
            <li>My denture is tight and I have a good fit</li>
            <li>Mixed fine, poured ok, shaped, trimmed.  </li>
            <li>, my teeth didn&#x27;t fit very well even when band</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has only been 4-5 days since I did this, but I must say the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>I will be keeping an extra kit handy just in case of damage.</li>
            <li>or If I liked it well enough to use it again (it is temporary).</li>
            <li>(guessing again), I have a feeling they wanted to make a product for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Selling to dentists, they could charge much more money.&lt;br /&gt;Making</li>
            <li>Maybe its just in my case,but for people who have recently had oral surgery and are doing their own relines using these products,you will not get the two years out of it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if you soak it in baking soda and water mixture like they say, that would be fixed.</li>
            <li>I find it adheres better, it stays soft, and doesn&#x27;t continually slip.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the way my lowers turned out I was more patient with the uppers and let the goo get good and thick before pouring it into the teeth and putting it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>So, I rarely noticed it and of course, after a while there is no chemical taste.</li>
            <li>I was in too much of a hurry causing the mixture to set up later than was optimum.</li>
            <li>and I feel I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This kit is well worth the price just for the comfort alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not be able to even get through a snack or meal or a 4 hour shift at work without it becoming loose and having to reapply an adhesive.</li>
            <li>Since I had waited for the mixture to cure a bit longer before putting in my mouth, I was able to do any clean up prior to this step.</li>
            <li>I am looking into other products that state are good for two years or longer.</li>
            <li>he used it and said it did not set up right on the lowers</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:cbb30e4e39748038a754cfdc1afaf51a]]I posted the video as a picture of my teeth right after installing the PROSOFT.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Prosoft, I found out yesterday, doesn&#x27;t bother me, even right after putting it</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll notice right away, there is no break-in period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no problems getting the mixture to the right consistancy.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>this stuff will save your life if you cant get to the dentist right away.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li>so I have to watch closely to get the product the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply - came out as professionally as it would at the dentist!</li>
            <li>It seems I&#x27;ll be fine until I can get new ones.</li>
            <li>Now you need to know my upper teeth fit great before using this, no shifting no pinching or slipping.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands and ProSoft works the best so far.</li>
            <li>It has been very temporary for me as it is wearing away quickly with brushing and soaking.</li>
            <li>Just as easy to use as they claim and a lot cheaper than having professional relining done.&lt;br /&gt;O</li>
            <li>The liner is soft as described, it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>A dentist wants $250 or more to reline my lower teeth, and that is for a soft reline.</li>
            <li>The directions were very easy to follow but there is not enough product to cover my entire top plate.</li>
            <li>Although I am just in my first few hours with this product I am quite pleased, it is exceeding my expectations, in fact I love pecans and cashews and haven&#x27;t eaten either for about 2 years</li>
            <li>soft, makes it so comfortable right away.</li>
            <li>A huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;Being soft, you&#x27;ll notice right away, there is no break-in period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The solution set up smoothly, and actually a little more quickly than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>very very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable I will be buying this again in the future way better than 60 for the dentist/</li>
            <li>After I put it in my mouth for the impression, I followed the advice of others and soaked it in a little bowl of water with a good bit of baking soda for about 30 mins to help counteract any chemical taste.</li>
            <li>Once I split it and mixed it up, the process was relatively quick and easy.</li>
            <li>once i finished, it set good, it is  areally comphy fit, still comphyey  other hardened got irritations but simply used fine emery board to smooth it,  this last purchase is still soft can comfortable.</li>
            <li>this product feels like it is burning the gums for a day or two after first applying,  </li>
            <li>I left mine in the sulution for about 45 minute and the taste was much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to get a similar product at a chain store but they no longer carry the product.</li>
            <li>It lasted 4 months the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>ProSoft is my first denture reliner kit that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>YOU FIRST PUT THE DENTURE IN YOUR MOUTH WITH THE UNCURED PROSOFT POURED IN, USE YOUR FINGERS AND HOLD IT IN PLACE.</li>
            <li>YOU FIRST PUT THE DENTURE IN YOUR MOUTH WITH THE UNCURED PROSOFT POURED IN, USE YOUR FINGERS AND HOLD IT IN PLACE.</li>
            <li>it did not last more than one day it did not hold</li>
            <li>wish they would put it back on the market as most elderly people in this town have always depended upon this</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, it is definitely \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; as the product documentation states.</li>
            <li>Running it under hot water....</li>
            <li>,I will plan a day to reline it a week or so away,and drink hot drinks up to then to soften it a bit.</li>
            <li>For my first try, I did pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its like a soft rubber and so - so - so comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But my dentures fit snug and are cushion soft against my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still on the first application on my lower plate and it has been 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I got them, my gums don&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>This is my first try with ProSoft</li>
            <li>First batch just oozed out of plate.</li>
            <li>More after 2nd attempt</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product ....</li>
            <li>cause I messed up the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>First tried PermaSoft, then this.</li>
            <li>I like it to some extent, because it&#x27;s soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am guessing that is why there are so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like what my dentist used.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Once I received it I read the instructions and did exactly as it said.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not my first time using this re-liner.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>The taste is nothing, so don&#x27;t worry about what it says about taste (I was concerned at first).</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I would be able to wear my dentures without being in pain the entire time</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re back to having snug fitting dentures.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d better remove the old and add a new application.</li>
            <li>I came home, ordered prosoft and am now able to eat with a snugger fit and less pain.</li>
            <li>I was upset about this - as I really needed to use the product right away, but knew that I needed directions, and was weary of the packaging.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t last forever but a good amount of time before you have to remove the old and put in some new.</li>
            <li>though I did both at the same time, against the advice of the product directions, I had enough material to do both at once with ample squeeze out and good coverage of both dentures.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly after my order, and if you follow the instructions exactly, it works as well as the professional reline.</li>
            <li>I read all the POSITIVE reviews before buying.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely a game changer when it comes to getting your dentures to fit more comfortably.</li>
            <li>Not quite as soft as a reline I had done at the dentist once, but not bad either.</li>
            <li>This product gets the job done and it&#x27;s super quick and simple to use .  </li>
            <li>To maximize the benefit of this great product when the instructions tell you to bite down and hold it for 3 minutes, I know of no one who can hold their mouth still for three minutes, and just the slight movement will create gaps and pockets which deter from the fit.</li>
            <li>Works much better and has much better taste and smell compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li>The paper used isn&#x27;t even the right stock used in normal packages.</li>
            <li>I got a soft liner from my dentist that helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Set up time is not as short as some, making it easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Wish they made an instant facelift this easy and no pain.</li>
            <li>First, the fit didn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li>I have had to reline my dentures more than once, because I simply do not have the money to buy new dentures- who does these days?</li>
            <li>Applicatiin was easy and the directions clear and concise.</li>
            <li>I have had my new, very costly dentures for not even a year, I have had so many problems, especially with the lower plate.</li>
            <li>mixed &amp; applied fine,</li>
            <li>Left a taste for a couple of days then fine.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, and to prove it I&#x27;ve just ordered another box, as I am quite sure my gums will keep right on shrinking over the next 4 or five months, as that is how long my dentist wants to wait before applying a permanent hard acrylic liner.</li>
            <li>They are a little financially strapped at the moment, and this looked like a great temporary solution for their loosened dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As to the re-liner kits, this company discovered the perfect balance between soft and comfortable yet hard enough to last.</li>
            <li>Still much cheaper than paying a lab.</li>
            <li>definitely a big improvement in fit...</li>
            <li>but I tell that it is going to be very temporary</li>
            <li>ProSoft Denture Reliner-Relines 2 Denture Plates worked really well.</li>
            <li>Time for recline took me about an hour, much of that was waiting for curing and cleaning the dentures.</li>
            <li>Comfortable when finished but lasted only 4 -5 days before needing replacement.</li>
            <li>it really works well..</li>
            <li>it really hurt my bite</li>
            <li>So, knowing this, be prepared to stir extremely carefully all the time you are mixing, especially at first.</li>
            <li>If you move too fast, you will have a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will prevent you from pulling off too much reliner and ruining your work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can really wreck your gums and underlying bone if you put it off</li>
            <li>This will prevent you from pulling off too much reliner and ruining your work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This ProSoft is really a blessing for those who have pain with their dentures.</li>
            <li>I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The process of getting here was absolutely nightmarish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>soon as I ate something, it turned to much in my mouth and dentures slipped</li>
            <li>Better product than I even expected.</li>
            <li>My upper plate hasn&#x27;t fit like this for years</li>
            <li>and it did not help much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Does not adhere to adhesives very well.</li>
            <li>but doesnt seem to adhere very well.</li>
            <li>but it is very close.  </li>
            <li>But the product seems to be very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>can say much on how longer the liner lasts yet</li>
            <li>The better you put it in, the harder it is to get it out.</li>
            <li>But it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work,  nothing else much to say except to do the required words</li>
            <li>So much for customer service.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>,it is comfortabl andnever gets really</li>
            <li>Really works well as intended.</li>
            <li>I thought what the heck, I do not have that much to lose</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there because the color blends with the denture.  </li>
            <li>This got rid of a whole lot of that.</li>
            <li>Since I all ready knew about Prosoft</li>
            <li>sometimes the chemical is much too strong for too long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li>Pro soft lifts right out of my plastic temporary plates even after roughing them up with sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mix the stuff for too long, it needs to be like runny honey in order to spread out on the denture easily.</li>
            <li>I found other items that worked better.</li>
            <li>Once it was in place the only time I ever noticed a bit of chemical taste was momentarily when I took it out to clean it.</li>
            <li>The Walgreen brand denture reliner kit for $5.59 is just as good (if not better) than pro soft.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased thus far even though I don,t think this reline will last too long.  </li>
            <li>hot but NOT anywhere near boiling..</li>
            <li>The taste lasted for over TWO FULL WEEKS in my upper and lower.  </li>
            <li>I thought if I could just find a product that would make my lower dentures comfortable, then I could be saving my money for new dentures that would be made right, well this product did it for me, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth for a while, but this will finally go away, because of this product I am able to wait to have to spend another huge amount of money right away!</li>
            <li>This item, as are many, is subject to be discontinued at any minute.</li>
            <li>and it took a much better impression - and less oozing out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;both may require more then one application if the back of your denture has a big gap from your gums shrinking.</li>
            <li>If you have dentures and need a quick fix for short term use this is the go to product for me.</li>
            <li>A little messy but did a fine job once you got the right amount in the plate and held about as many days as it advertised.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ProSoft and will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>This can be highly discouraging when it comes time to reline again</li>
            <li>I am 84 and can&#x27;t get my teeth fixed any more due to cost and surgery involved.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve yet to find any other product that comes close, it&#x27;s simple and effective.</li>
            <li>and I will never use any other liner again,they are the only liner to use believe me,very easy to prepare and mix and use and last a very long time and feels good in your mouth,no after taste at all like a lot of them.my choice is prosoft.  </li>
            <li>had I not wasted so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Pro Soft.</li>
            <li>Pro soft denture recliner works very well.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t believe it would stay soft once applied to the dentures.</li>
            <li>I was really torn about whether to purchase ProSoft, Perma Soft or Acryline II.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for something soft for someone who has tender guns and mouth, this is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hardens like cement after it&#x27;s been in there awhile, unlike Perma Soft which peels off when you&#x27;re ready to reline.</li>
            <li>It took me 15 years to find this one (I wasted a LOT of $ and time), so I have made sure I have a WORKING product--</li>
            <li>, Prosoft is their second try at making a useful product..</li>
            <li>It now feels pretty much the same as the stuff the dentist uses.</li>
            <li>Now for as long this will last before having to buy more ProSoft we will see.</li>
            <li>My &#x27;trial&#x27; with dentures has been a long drawn out process lasting more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>This service is included in the original cost of the denture, but I feel my welcome there is beginning to wear a little thin.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and last several months.  </li>
            <li>It may take you 2 or 3 times to finally &#x27;learn&#x27; how to do it right.</li>
            <li>If you were a former Cushion Grip user, you will know when it is right.</li>
            <li>want to loose the fluid to a tissue better in the powder or the bottle</li>
            <li>First, the packaging was very generic, which is okay but made me a little nervous that maybe it was manufactured and boxed in a home somewhere.</li>
            <li>This was a new product for me.</li>
            <li>brand new</li>
            <li>But remember: you should be thinking about new dentures.</li>
            <li>The liner is still like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this until I get my new dentures.</li>
            <li>I am a new denture wearer.</li>
            <li>New haven&#x27;t had to use it as of yet.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, easy to use, very minimal in terms of chemical odor, taste, irritation and it stays soft enough to be gentle.</li>
            <li>this available to the public was, I think, a last resort, after they realized dentists don&#x27;t want to save people money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be more careful next time.  </li>
            <li>Several times I got the Pro Soft out, and then decided didn&#x27;t need it right then.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>MY RED FLAGS at first glance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bar code printed on the packaging, but the bar code association has no records of this product or the bar code number used on the box.</li>
            <li>However, it has lived up to it&#x27;s claim...so far!</li>
            <li>Stay soft and works well!</li>
            <li>I first did my upper denture.  </li>
            <li>I first received my order for one kit, I realized that instead of an instruction sheet, there was just a blank sheet of paper folded up in the box.</li>
            <li>It remains somewhat soft, until you need a new one.</li>
            <li>, it costs less, and the fit is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was easy to use but was a little too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest taping down a piece of wax paper over your work surface, as you will most likely spill some.</li>
            <li>The only thing that was nice was is was really soft just cant get past everything tasting like spary paint</li>
            <li>Filled the denture to fit properly,,, The taste for the first day or so was annoying - but its fine  now ,,,&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have said, thick honey and it changes quickly from that consistency to being too thick to get a good impression</li>
            <li>I was given new ones at no cost, however that led to my lower dentures not fitting since they were molded to fit the first upper plates.</li>
            <li>It is also important to me there is little or no after taste.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the ProSft is a good tight fit without the Fix- powder.</li>
            <li>My immediates were so loose that they just fell right out without using Seabond wafers and</li>
            <li>I do find that I&#x27;m having to do it more often (monthly) as it either becomes too hard or it becomes discolored</li>
            <li>ProSoft  is easy to use and last longer than other products.</li>
            <li>Altho it actually does remain very cushiony soft, it \\&quot;sets up\\&quot; and does not continue to overflow the denture when biting or chewing pressure</li>
            <li>I went to my dentist 3 times in a month for soft lining and</li>
            <li>I used pro soft and it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>and so far my gums have not gotten sore at all.</li>
            <li>It gives you a soft reline in the convience of your home, to do whenever it needs it.</li>
            <li>PRECISELY.plus!&lt;br /&gt;Being soft</li>
            <li>and you cant remove the old liner that no longer fits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both ProSoft and PermaSoft and prefer the softer ProSoft for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS-Perma Soft People: Don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
            <li>It is definitely soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS HELD UP ABOUT 3 MONTHS,SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t set up fast enough.</li>
            <li>soaking helps and so does breath mints, washing mouth with old sewer water and brushing teeth with draino would help too.</li>
            <li>Also, I emailed Permalabs and asked them the difference between ProSoft and Perma Soft.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t even go so far as to call it a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after it has completely set it is rubbery and flexible.</li>
            <li>so I can eat what I want over Christmas without worrying about getting grit stuck in the soft lining material of my dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had my dentures for nearly 4 years now.</li>
            <li>Even though my husband had no trouble putting the liner in, and no complaints on taste, It did not help, but gummed up.</li>
            <li>I will stick with Perma Soft....</li>
            <li>-It, because it keeps soft.</li>
            <li>...the chemical taste which persists and my rookie mistakes the system works well so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered ProSoft to try because I need a soft liner for comfort.  </li>
            <li>i dont like the Perma Soft becaus</li>
            <li>but i hope you continue to carry the pro soft</li>
            <li>but so far I have no  problems with the product</li>
            <li>This is soft-</li>
            <li>I was really surprised</li>
            <li>To me, it looked like there was way TOO MUCH liquid, so I panicked and scooped some back out!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that works like your old Cushion Grip..</li>
            <li>I was grateful when I received the Pro Soft.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has a soft feel and have had no problem with it not adhering to my denture</li>
            <li>You will still have to have a professional reline done, but works well for a temporary reline.</li>
            <li>My partial had become very loose and was requiring me to use the adhesive 4 or more times a day.</li>
            <li>Rating is because it&#x27;s at least as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but too expensive.  </li>
            <li>So contacted another dentist, and he saw the problems I was having right away, however I have already spent almost $1000 on the set I have now, and the procedure that he wants to do sounds like just what I need, but costly, and I want to do this in the future.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this for my husband and he likes it better than any other similar product he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>Carefully followed the instructions but found my dentures to be ill-fitting and the liner pulled right out within hours.</li>
            <li>At first, watch for lumps of dry powder in the mixture.</li>
            <li>Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP.</li>
            <li>Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP.</li>
            <li>Had upper dentures and near full mouth partial completed Feb 2013.  </li>
            <li>Of course the Drug Store prices will vary but I believe this may be about twice the price of other OTC brands but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li>My gums have shrunk and shifted, leaving my first set extremely loose.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, at first the taste is terrible.  </li>
            <li>They look the same, the instructions are different and I&#x27;m sure the chemical ingredients are similar but not the same, or not in the same ratios.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that there could have been a little bit more material giving in order to completely fill the upper plate.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d removed all of the old material but the new batch did not cover places that showed up a different color after I applied it.</li>
            <li>It was better than my last professional hard reline.</li>
            <li>This product works great, but it does leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth which can be removed after soaking in baking soda water.</li>
            <li>They can really wreck your gums and underlying bone if you put it off too long.</li>
            <li>If I should really not continue to use this but should have a dental lab do them why buy this in the first place?</li>
            <li>I definitely would suggest it to any new denture wearer as their gums and bones change.</li>
            <li>In my case,with no hot drinks the liner is very very much attached.</li>
            <li>I am just now feeling a bit of a need to maybe remove this liner and put a new one in because my gums have shrunk a bit more and it just this week has gotten a tad loose when I bit into something hard.</li>
            <li>separates from denture even after following exact instructions and the taste never lasted this long before.</li>
            <li>All in all this product is well worth the money seeing how it costs less than $20</li>
            <li>Tried it today and the mixture never did set it is sticky and dentures can&#x27;t be used as food would just stick to the denture causing major discomfort.</li>
            <li>I popped those baby&#x27;s back in and WOW!</li>
            <li>After the last cure time, I put in my mouth and IT WAS MY OLD CUSHION GRIP all over again!</li>
            <li>and I didnt like that as it was hard and wore off quickly!</li>
            <li>Follow the directions to the letter, and don&#x27;t bite down too soon or too fast, just slow pressure until you achieve a full on bite, then hold it firm and do not let up until the proper time has passed; otherwise your dentures will be extremely comfortable but won&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li>I could not use the fixedent powder before I added the ProSoft as my teeth where to loose for it to really work.</li>
            <li>You can get 2 full relines or 4 relines on just an upper or just a lower if you split the material in half before mixing.</li>
            <li>i really like the pro soft, it iavery comfortable and last a long time and ir never gets hard.</li>
            <li>While the liner quality itself is good (it stays soft, it&#x27;s easy to apply and trim, etc.), the chemical aftertaste is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  </li>
            <li>it gets really hard and if you try to smooth it</li>
            <li>I only needed to reline  lower denture and found that one bottle was way to much for the lower denture and therefore wasted a large amount of the product.  </li>
            <li>Dentures, well if you have them and they don&#x27;t fit well, as in my case, one little sore spot can curtail chewing, so if you have ill fitting dentures this works.</li>
            <li>Read the directions and you&#x27;ll feel better soon, It might take you a while to figure out just how much to use of each ingrediant but its not much (as they say less is more) a little powder and a little fluid (the hardner) goes a long way and get a tiny eye droper</li>
            <li>so there are now two happy women with dentures that stay in place and aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement in the fit and actually feel like the denture is in worse shape after a month.</li>
            <li>As far as the taste goes, it was not at all noticeable the second day after soaking my dentures overnight in effervescent denture cleanser from CVS.</li>
            <li>Had to soak them several times because of the fact that they stay soft, they also hold the chemical smell and taste longer</li>
            <li>When he went back the dentist put in a soft liner.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t really careful the knife will take off too much and lift the liner from the denture.  </li>
            <li>so what do I do to totally remove the old</li>
            <li>As far as any smell or after taste I noticed a very slight chemical taste the first day.</li>
            <li>I wasted a lot of money on reline kits, trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>That made fitting sloppy with a poorer result.</li>
            <li>Since I received enough to do both a full top and bottom plate and only needed enough to do one small partial, I actually split one vial of the liquid and one container of the powder in two, which will give me enough to re-line them 4 times (although I hope to have my permanent partial at the beginning of the year).</li>
            <li>It works great, chill it in the fridge for a few hours to slow down the working time.</li>
            <li>I use a rubber glove to hold the denture to remove the old liner as it can get pretty warm to the touch with a bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reline at night and after soaking in cold water, as instructed, I soak the dentures overnight in water with a little baking soda.</li>
            <li>the fit was good, but the taste was TERRIBLE, and lasted for weeks even after using baking soda.</li>
            <li>These reliner kits are great compared to other liners that usually get rock hard after they set up on the dentures.</li>
            <li>I also felt like the box looked a little funny.</li>
            <li>I just put them in cold water at night and the next morning the adhesive easily wipes right off.</li>
            <li>teeth never fit right, so I went to a local dentist asking for a reline.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>this product did live up to all the reviews I read while it does help, it neither soft or very long lasting, in the long run it&#x27;s cheaper to get</li>
            <li>It held for quite a while, one treatment was empty so used the other because she needed it right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full upper and partial lower (molars, both sides) for a little under a year, I had my first hard reline about 3 months ago after having had a couple of soft relines as my gums healed in the office.</li>
            <li>So just a heads up to others who have had surgery in the last few years,and don&#x27;t drink hot beverages</li>
            <li>The only thing I recommend is when you mix the compound let get a little thicker than honey then pour it in and don&#x27;t put to much pressure just normal pressure from your mouth closed and teeth together.  </li>
            <li>My gums are still shrinking pretty fast, and I know my dentist is getting tired of having to reline my upper over and over again.</li>
            <li>far it has set up and adhered to the denture and shows no sign of ever coming loose , TY ProSoft</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the dentist, you should be ready to spend 5,000 to $7,000 every time your gums shrink a little more.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>, it had not set, I put them in cold water immediately after, ( with other past liners, it set faster), best time to apply is at night before you go to bed , so they can harden by morning.</li>
            <li>I do like this liner a little spendy but you don&#x27;t need much and it does work.</li>
            <li>It takes less than 15 minutes with little clean up.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and ordered it thinking if it worked great if it failed at least I&#x27;d only be out $20 bucks.</li>

            <li> Good idea but do not work well on partials and</li>
            <li> May be good for some, but for the application that it was used for..</li>

            <li> and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> My kit came with a the right amount of liquid in one, and I added it to the powder as directed - that liner came out perfectly.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll love this stuff!</li>

            <li> I will be purchasing some more as needed!</li>
            <li> I love this product; it&#x27;s saved me a bundle!</li>
            <li> perfect the first time.)</li>
            <li> Excellent product worked exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> Very good product and quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to follow and the result was great.</li>
            <li> it was easy to use and works great ...</li>
            <li> I thought it was easy and great</li>
            <li> It is great, but I wish it would fit snugger on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I put the lowers in this am, they fit great.  </li>
            <li> ; this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> bought for friend she liked it</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find some one that still supplies this product.</li>
            <li> which is nice....</li>
            <li> The dentist didn&#x27;t put a liner in, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some I have used, but it is okay for  temporary liner.</li>
            <li> Always fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> The cushion feel is nice</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and he liked it.</li>
            <li> It takes a good minute or more for it to thicken to the consistency of honey.</li>
            <li> The good news is it&#x27;s a much better reline than what I got from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I now have good suction on the top denture.</li>
            <li> So that stir stick also was handy for scooping and smearing.</li>
            <li> Worked really great, and her dentures fit better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and result was good.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>

            <li> Product was very easy to use and worked as instructed.  </li>
            <li> Soft is a real good</li>
            <li> This is by far the best reliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Fit good, however after 1st meal, out they came...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to make comfortably soft relines for dentures.</li>
            <li> I love that I can reapply whenever I need to and adjust it at my own whim.</li>
            <li> So far, the best of the liquid reliners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions like they said and Pro Soft worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I relined mine with Pro Soft and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The seller was great , and the product came on time, it mixed nicely , and has done a great job</li>
            <li> Was easy to use and it Works!</li>
            <li> When they first go in they feel great but</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how this has made my dentures fit and feel.</li>
            <li> the softness is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Instructions are very good had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> looks ok ,haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> I should of use both for just the top plate</li>
            <li> loveit love it love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one more try and if anything changes I&#x27;ll write a follow-up review.</li>
            <li> the product worked very well and was happy with it</li>
            <li> Prosoft was much better for me.</li>
            <li> My dentures are better now than ever before.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine that anything else could work better.</li>
            <li> I understand it has to be replaced more often</li>
            <li> I just wish they both worked better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad my choice was ProSoft.</li>
            <li> if  you purchase more</li>
            <li> It has been about a week now and looks like I&#x27;ll have a add a b&#x27;it more to both which would incline me to subtract a star.</li>
            <li> it was okay not what I thought was going to be</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well and the after taste remains even now after most has been removed.\&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure you do the procedure on a washable surface-</li>
            <li> Be sure to do one plate at a time.  </li>
            <li> If your denture used to rock in your mouth, be sure to tip the denture a bit towards the side that needs to be thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to time those three minutes exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, be sure to time exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to time those three minutes exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, be sure to time exactly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are sometimes challenging to remove, I heat up water for a couple of minutes in the microwave...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> i glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Works better than what the dentist has done for him.</li>
            <li> I have had so many problems with the liner that my dentist used</li>
            <li> and I truly love this.</li>
            <li> I tried some different ones, but ProSoft is the best yet.</li>
            <li> yes it did so much better</li>
            <li> I have used most of these products, and this product is above wonderful.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try, despite the many, many reviews stating that the chemical taste is....</li>
            <li> used to be better.</li>
            <li> Upper came out as advertised, Excellent.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Its certainly better and cheaper than the dentist.</li>
            <li> As a retired dental lab tech, it is better and easier to use than any denture line I ave ever worked with.  </li>
            <li> My dentures are so comfortable now and no need for adhesives!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I had used Acryline, but this is much better.  </li>
            <li> I do intend to purchase some more in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> I need to order more.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Once I got over my fear of trying this (being a former &#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27; fan), it was great!!</li>
            <li> and I will say that Perma Labs as got another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Wish they made it with a better taste  .</li>
            <li> worked ok until we seen the dentist</li>
            <li> It was ok in the beginning</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I still use a powder on top to assist in holding the plate in place.</li>
            <li> Overall experience is awesome.</li>
            <li> It has made my life much better.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more of this when needed.</li>
            <li> ProSoft is softer and more flexible, but lasts around 6 months to a year instead of up to 2 years like Perma Soft\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and I will be able to get 4 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, I have also used Cushion Grip and this product is much better.</li>
            <li> So I will be ordering more again soon.</li>
            <li> I have&#x27;nt found anything else that works better.</li>
            <li> So much better now.</li>
            <li> I still use the powder to be sure they stay in, but so much better than before.</li>
            <li> Its OK for a one day use</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> 10 more words required.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buy more, just to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> they are a million times more</li>
            <li> This is the second time we have purchased this product and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Way better then paying the money for a re-liner at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Do you have another product that works better?</li>
            <li> the directions and you will be satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> save me some more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is better than the D.O.C Reline</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I thought about paying $100.00 more dollars to have my plate lined again and having to go without my denture.</li>
            <li> that is, like I said, until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I like this much better.</li>
            <li> I was beyond satisfied with the customer service that I received.&lt;br /&gt;Now - the product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> However overall I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> however they advertise 2 relines and it took both containers to just do the top denture.</li>
            <li> After the setting time, most of the excess material was removed with just my finger</li>
            <li> After struggling with them for over 6 months and stil not being able to bite into a sandwich because the bite was so &#x27;off&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was having pain, I ended up leaving with my mouth hurting more than before I went to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> so it has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> worked great--they fit a lot better now--was very easy to use</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t quite get a good result on your first try, don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> Does not taste good the first day</li>
            <li> After trying this product I am impressed as to how soft and comfortable my dentures know fit and feel.</li>
            <li> Made my dentures fit better and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t pleasant at first, but can easily be remedied.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this particular product and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Worked pretty good and am sure when I use it again it will go more smoothly, now that I know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I have worn the denture with the new lining for a couple of days and it works great.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how I managed to get a great fit with ProSoft, and some helpful hints: ProSoft really does edge out the competition.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, it seemed to be the next best option from what is available.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will be fine</li>
            <li> It works fine until I can get to the denturist for a more permanent reline.</li>
            <li> It is great, easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li> The liner stays pliable/soft, making my dentures much more comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> So being able to help myself is important and now my lower plate does not rub or hurt me.</li>
            <li> When you go out to dinner you want to be able to enjoy the food you buy.  </li>
            <li> most comfortable things either.</li>
            <li> By doing that you will not be doing any gum wiggling and the fit will be even better.</li>
            <li> Dentures never felt or fit better.</li>
            <li> I needed a reline because my lowers were &amp;#34;Immediates,&amp;#34; the kind that are put in right after an extraction.  </li>
            <li> I got to do my reline, and I can not say enough good things about this kit!</li>
            <li> gel like easy on the gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s very mild compared with the burning from the doc recline kit.</li>

            <li> So, I tried my own reline for the first time and want to share my experience.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s super easy, cheap and quick...definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I found this product to work just fine.</li>
            <li> I will have to fine a dentist to do  a reline.</li>
            <li> but if you do what they suggest it works out fine.  </li>
            <li> The denture reline kit was worth the money, easy to use and no nasty after taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> product makes a custom fit for you.</li>
            <li> tHIS IS WHERE YOU GET YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li> tHIS IS WHERE YOU GET YOUR FIT.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED THEM TO HUG YOUR GUMS PRECISELY.</li>
            <li> When you have trimmed your denture, pop it in for fit-</li>
            <li> When you have trimmed your denture, pop it in for fit-</li>
            <li> SECURE CARE adhesive however is a rip off.</li>
            <li> The dentist can&#x27;t seem to get his dentures to fit his mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to say that I have tried D.O.C. Reline-It, Advanced Denture Reliner</li>
            <li> and it works fantastic, and was the cheapest one I could find.</li>
            <li> I, for one, will deal with the taste to have the hold and fit</li>
            <li> I have dentures and others in my family, I do the relining for them also and this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> And it takes me awhile before I can get them to a point that is comfortable for me to even eat with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gave me the fit of a profession reline.</li>
            <li> I have had an occasional need to use this reliner for temporarty solutions and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I cannot have the denture fit too snugly as I have to have room for the Poligrip to make a surface of adherence.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit from the beginning</li>
            <li> My soft reline is still good after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Works Great better than expected just mix and pour</li>
            <li> Was very easy to use,and made my dentures fit prefectly!!!Thanks SO much</li>
            <li> My friend says her dentures are more stable and more comfortable than when the were new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better, but even as a first-time user the product was not hard to work with, as I feared it might be.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this is the best</li>
            <li> It is, however, my first time ordering it through Amazon, which I will continue to do as the price is better and it arrived faster.</li>
            <li> Due to dislike of&lt;br /&gt;Going to dentist I am a DIY person , this product is great, easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I should have stayed the course, because clean up was a cinch.</li>
            <li> I am bummed out and trying to clean this out</li>
            <li> I try to catch it when they&#x27;ve got special deals going on...</li>
            <li> Everything is included in this package, instructions, and most importantly correct measures to mix, for a durable comfortable soft reline.</li>
            <li> Good thing this stuff is only temporary......</li>
            <li> I wanted my dentures super clean.</li>
            <li> So if I had given this 4 1/2 stars, I would now upgrade my rating today to a full 5.</li>
            <li> (although the directions were quite good and specific).  </li>
            <li> I liked how soft it was</li>
            <li> Great results, Better and much easier to use than I had expected</li>
            <li> I bought this ProSoft reliner kit for my full lower denture.</li>
            <li> It is important to time everything just right as per the directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is easy to use, watch a helpful video on utube before trying first time it will help you out.</li>
            <li> Product works if you will follow the directions and don&#x27;t bite to strong at first try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different liners and by far the best,easiest to use,last the longest and does the best job of all of them is the pro soft denture liner.</li>
            <li> Provides a fit as good or better than most professional relines I have had at a cost hundreds of dollars less.</li>
            <li> Instead I came straight home and hit Amazon and found this little box of wonderful.</li>
            <li> Dentures now fit very snugly and comfortable for about a week now.</li>
            <li> There is not a lot of maintenance to it and you can quickly get on with your life .  </li>
            <li> This product makes them fit much better while you are waiting for your gums to heal completely</li>
            <li> While boxes and contents looked almost identical, the ProSoft did not harden as quickly.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm for me allowing me to gradually eat more and more solid foods.</li>
            <li> lucky to get two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Super quick shippers.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but is rather tricky to apply, being very, very gooey!  </li>
            <li> After using 2 other brands this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> but I was overall very pleased</li>
            <li> nice soft liner, longer lasting than comfort grip and so much more comfortable than re- line it</li>
            <li> One more thought: try to figure out a way to get new dentures.</li>
            <li> One more thought: try to figure out a way to get new dentures.</li>
            <li> I still use a it of adhesive to secure each denture as I like to be sure of no slipping.</li>
            <li> Now they fit great and no more pressure points.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Be sure you have a clock and a good, small paring knife.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions and works very well.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars is because it does taste &#x27;funky&#x27; for awhile, but that&#x27;s a small price to to pay for the good comfort and fit!</li>
            <li> Its easy and fast to do for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use and worked very well on the uppers.</li>
            <li> easy to use sticks to plate very well</li>
            <li> works very well and easy to use</li>
            <li> think you should put out a better product and help these old people!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Had no problem mixing and applying the pro soft and it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use and makes my partial plate feel and fit better.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Pro Soft to help my new dentures fit better.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had occasion to use this product yet, but after looking it over, I&#x27;m fairly certain that it will work as well as the Coe-Soft (which is no longer available) did.  </li>
            <li> My denture is tight and I have a good fit</li>
            <li> Mixed fine, poured ok, shaped, trimmed.  </li>
            <li> , my teeth didn&#x27;t fit very well even when band</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has only been 4-5 days since I did this, but I must say the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I will be keeping an extra kit handy just in case of damage.</li>
            <li> or If I liked it well enough to use it again (it is temporary).</li>
            <li> (guessing again), I have a feeling they wanted to make a product for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Selling to dentists, they could charge much more money.&lt;br /&gt;Making</li>
            <li> Maybe its just in my case,but for people who have recently had oral surgery and are doing their own relines using these products,you will not get the two years out of it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure if you soak it in baking soda and water mixture like they say, that would be fixed.</li>
            <li> I find it adheres better, it stays soft, and doesn&#x27;t continually slip.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the way my lowers turned out I was more patient with the uppers and let the goo get good and thick before pouring it into the teeth and putting it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> So, I rarely noticed it and of course, after a while there is no chemical taste.</li>
            <li> I was in too much of a hurry causing the mixture to set up later than was optimum.</li>
            <li> and I feel I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This kit is well worth the price just for the comfort alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not be able to even get through a snack or meal or a 4 hour shift at work without it becoming loose and having to reapply an adhesive.</li>
            <li> Since I had waited for the mixture to cure a bit longer before putting in my mouth, I was able to do any clean up prior to this step.</li>
            <li> I am looking into other products that state are good for two years or longer.</li>
            <li> he used it and said it did not set up right on the lowers</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cbb30e4e39748038a754cfdc1afaf51a]]I posted the video as a picture of my teeth right after installing the PROSOFT.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Prosoft, I found out yesterday, doesn&#x27;t bother me, even right after putting it</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll notice right away, there is no break-in period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no problems getting the mixture to the right consistancy.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> this stuff will save your life if you cant get to the dentist right away.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li> so I have to watch closely to get the product the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply - came out as professionally as it would at the dentist!</li>
            <li> It seems I&#x27;ll be fine until I can get new ones.</li>
            <li> Now you need to know my upper teeth fit great before using this, no shifting no pinching or slipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and ProSoft works the best so far.</li>
            <li> It has been very temporary for me as it is wearing away quickly with brushing and soaking.</li>
            <li> Just as easy to use as they claim and a lot cheaper than having professional relining done.&lt;br /&gt;O</li>
            <li> The liner is soft as described, it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> A dentist wants $250 or more to reline my lower teeth, and that is for a soft reline.</li>
            <li> The directions were very easy to follow but there is not enough product to cover my entire top plate.</li>
            <li> Although I am just in my first few hours with this product I am quite pleased, it is exceeding my expectations, in fact I love pecans and cashews and haven&#x27;t eaten either for about 2 years</li>
            <li> soft, makes it so comfortable right away.</li>
            <li> A huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;Being soft, you&#x27;ll notice right away, there is no break-in period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The solution set up smoothly, and actually a little more quickly than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> very very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable I will be buying this again in the future way better than 60 for the dentist/</li>
            <li> After I put it in my mouth for the impression, I followed the advice of others and soaked it in a little bowl of water with a good bit of baking soda for about 30 mins to help counteract any chemical taste.</li>
            <li> Once I split it and mixed it up, the process was relatively quick and easy.</li>
            <li> once i finished, it set good, it is  areally comphy fit, still comphyey  other hardened got irritations but simply used fine emery board to smooth it,  this last purchase is still soft can comfortable.</li>
            <li> this product feels like it is burning the gums for a day or two after first applying,  </li>
            <li> I left mine in the sulution for about 45 minute and the taste was much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to get a similar product at a chain store but they no longer carry the product.</li>
            <li> It lasted 4 months the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> ProSoft is my first denture reliner kit that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> YOU FIRST PUT THE DENTURE IN YOUR MOUTH WITH THE UNCURED PROSOFT POURED IN, USE YOUR FINGERS AND HOLD IT IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> YOU FIRST PUT THE DENTURE IN YOUR MOUTH WITH THE UNCURED PROSOFT POURED IN, USE YOUR FINGERS AND HOLD IT IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> it did not last more than one day it did not hold</li>
            <li> wish they would put it back on the market as most elderly people in this town have always depended upon this</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, it is definitely \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; as the product documentation states.</li>
            <li> Running it under hot water....</li>
            <li> ,I will plan a day to reline it a week or so away,and drink hot drinks up to then to soften it a bit.</li>
            <li> For my first try, I did pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its like a soft rubber and so - so - so comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But my dentures fit snug and are cushion soft against my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still on the first application on my lower plate and it has been 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I got them, my gums don&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> This is my first try with ProSoft</li>
            <li> First batch just oozed out of plate.</li>
            <li> More after 2nd attempt</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product ....</li>
            <li> cause I messed up the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> First tried PermaSoft, then this.</li>
            <li> I like it to some extent, because it&#x27;s soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am guessing that is why there are so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like what my dentist used.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Once I received it I read the instructions and did exactly as it said.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not my first time using this re-liner.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> The taste is nothing, so don&#x27;t worry about what it says about taste (I was concerned at first).</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I would be able to wear my dentures without being in pain the entire time</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re back to having snug fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d better remove the old and add a new application.</li>
            <li> I came home, ordered prosoft and am now able to eat with a snugger fit and less pain.</li>
            <li> I was upset about this - as I really needed to use the product right away, but knew that I needed directions, and was weary of the packaging.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t last forever but a good amount of time before you have to remove the old and put in some new.</li>
            <li> though I did both at the same time, against the advice of the product directions, I had enough material to do both at once with ample squeeze out and good coverage of both dentures.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly after my order, and if you follow the instructions exactly, it works as well as the professional reline.</li>
            <li> I read all the POSITIVE reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a game changer when it comes to getting your dentures to fit more comfortably.</li>
            <li> Not quite as soft as a reline I had done at the dentist once, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> This product gets the job done and it&#x27;s super quick and simple to use .  </li>
            <li> To maximize the benefit of this great product when the instructions tell you to bite down and hold it for 3 minutes, I know of no one who can hold their mouth still for three minutes, and just the slight movement will create gaps and pockets which deter from the fit.</li>
            <li> Works much better and has much better taste and smell compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> The paper used isn&#x27;t even the right stock used in normal packages.</li>
            <li> I got a soft liner from my dentist that helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Set up time is not as short as some, making it easy to spread.</li>
            <li> Wish they made an instant facelift this easy and no pain.</li>
            <li> First, the fit didn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li> I have had to reline my dentures more than once, because I simply do not have the money to buy new dentures- who does these days?</li>
            <li> Applicatiin was easy and the directions clear and concise.</li>
            <li> I have had my new, very costly dentures for not even a year, I have had so many problems, especially with the lower plate.</li>
            <li> mixed &amp; applied fine,</li>
            <li> Left a taste for a couple of days then fine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, and to prove it I&#x27;ve just ordered another box, as I am quite sure my gums will keep right on shrinking over the next 4 or five months, as that is how long my dentist wants to wait before applying a permanent hard acrylic liner.</li>
            <li> They are a little financially strapped at the moment, and this looked like a great temporary solution for their loosened dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As to the re-liner kits, this company discovered the perfect balance between soft and comfortable yet hard enough to last.</li>
            <li> Still much cheaper than paying a lab.</li>
            <li> definitely a big improvement in fit...</li>
            <li> but I tell that it is going to be very temporary</li>
            <li> ProSoft Denture Reliner-Relines 2 Denture Plates worked really well.</li>
            <li> Time for recline took me about an hour, much of that was waiting for curing and cleaning the dentures.</li>
            <li> Comfortable when finished but lasted only 4 -5 days before needing replacement.</li>
            <li> it really works well..</li>
            <li> it really hurt my bite</li>
            <li> So, knowing this, be prepared to stir extremely carefully all the time you are mixing, especially at first.</li>
            <li> If you move too fast, you will have a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will prevent you from pulling off too much reliner and ruining your work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can really wreck your gums and underlying bone if you put it off</li>
            <li> This will prevent you from pulling off too much reliner and ruining your work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This ProSoft is really a blessing for those who have pain with their dentures.</li>
            <li> I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The process of getting here was absolutely nightmarish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> soon as I ate something, it turned to much in my mouth and dentures slipped</li>
            <li> Better product than I even expected.</li>
            <li> My upper plate hasn&#x27;t fit like this for years</li>
            <li> and it did not help much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Does not adhere to adhesives very well.</li>
            <li> but doesnt seem to adhere very well.</li>
            <li> but it is very close.  </li>
            <li> But the product seems to be very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> can say much on how longer the liner lasts yet</li>
            <li> The better you put it in, the harder it is to get it out.</li>
            <li> But it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work,  nothing else much to say except to do the required words</li>
            <li> So much for customer service.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> ,it is comfortabl andnever gets really</li>
            <li> Really works well as intended.</li>
            <li> I thought what the heck, I do not have that much to lose</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there because the color blends with the denture.  </li>
            <li> This got rid of a whole lot of that.</li>
            <li> Since I all ready knew about Prosoft</li>
            <li> sometimes the chemical is much too strong for too long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> Pro soft lifts right out of my plastic temporary plates even after roughing them up with sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mix the stuff for too long, it needs to be like runny honey in order to spread out on the denture easily.</li>
            <li> I found other items that worked better.</li>
            <li> Once it was in place the only time I ever noticed a bit of chemical taste was momentarily when I took it out to clean it.</li>
            <li> The Walgreen brand denture reliner kit for $5.59 is just as good (if not better) than pro soft.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased thus far even though I don,t think this reline will last too long.  </li>
            <li> hot but NOT anywhere near boiling..</li>
            <li> The taste lasted for over TWO FULL WEEKS in my upper and lower.  </li>
            <li> I thought if I could just find a product that would make my lower dentures comfortable, then I could be saving my money for new dentures that would be made right, well this product did it for me, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth for a while, but this will finally go away, because of this product I am able to wait to have to spend another huge amount of money right away!</li>
            <li> This item, as are many, is subject to be discontinued at any minute.</li>
            <li> and it took a much better impression - and less oozing out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;both may require more then one application if the back of your denture has a big gap from your gums shrinking.</li>
            <li> If you have dentures and need a quick fix for short term use this is the go to product for me.</li>
            <li> A little messy but did a fine job once you got the right amount in the plate and held about as many days as it advertised.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ProSoft and will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> This can be highly discouraging when it comes time to reline again</li>
            <li> I am 84 and can&#x27;t get my teeth fixed any more due to cost and surgery involved.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve yet to find any other product that comes close, it&#x27;s simple and effective.</li>
            <li> and I will never use any other liner again,they are the only liner to use believe me,very easy to prepare and mix and use and last a very long time and feels good in your mouth,no after taste at all like a lot of them.my choice is prosoft.  </li>
            <li> had I not wasted so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Pro Soft.</li>
            <li> Pro soft denture recliner works very well.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t believe it would stay soft once applied to the dentures.</li>
            <li> I was really torn about whether to purchase ProSoft, Perma Soft or Acryline II.</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for something soft for someone who has tender guns and mouth, this is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hardens like cement after it&#x27;s been in there awhile, unlike Perma Soft which peels off when you&#x27;re ready to reline.</li>
            <li> It took me 15 years to find this one (I wasted a LOT of $ and time), so I have made sure I have a WORKING product--</li>
            <li> , Prosoft is their second try at making a useful product..</li>
            <li> It now feels pretty much the same as the stuff the dentist uses.</li>
            <li> Now for as long this will last before having to buy more ProSoft we will see.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;trial&#x27; with dentures has been a long drawn out process lasting more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> This service is included in the original cost of the denture, but I feel my welcome there is beginning to wear a little thin.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and last several months.  </li>
            <li> It may take you 2 or 3 times to finally &#x27;learn&#x27; how to do it right.</li>
            <li> If you were a former Cushion Grip user, you will know when it is right.</li>
            <li> want to loose the fluid to a tissue better in the powder or the bottle</li>
            <li> First, the packaging was very generic, which is okay but made me a little nervous that maybe it was manufactured and boxed in a home somewhere.</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.</li>
            <li> brand new</li>
            <li> But remember: you should be thinking about new dentures.</li>
            <li> The liner is still like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this until I get my new dentures.</li>
            <li> I am a new denture wearer.</li>
            <li> New haven&#x27;t had to use it as of yet.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle, easy to use, very minimal in terms of chemical odor, taste, irritation and it stays soft enough to be gentle.</li>
            <li> this available to the public was, I think, a last resort, after they realized dentists don&#x27;t want to save people money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be more careful next time.  </li>
            <li> Several times I got the Pro Soft out, and then decided didn&#x27;t need it right then.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> MY RED FLAGS at first glance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bar code printed on the packaging, but the bar code association has no records of this product or the bar code number used on the box.</li>
            <li> However, it has lived up to it&#x27;s claim...so far!</li>
            <li> Stay soft and works well!</li>
            <li> I first did my upper denture.  </li>
            <li> I first received my order for one kit, I realized that instead of an instruction sheet, there was just a blank sheet of paper folded up in the box.</li>
            <li> It remains somewhat soft, until you need a new one.</li>
            <li> , it costs less, and the fit is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use but was a little too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest taping down a piece of wax paper over your work surface, as you will most likely spill some.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was nice was is was really soft just cant get past everything tasting like spary paint</li>
            <li> Filled the denture to fit properly,,, The taste for the first day or so was annoying - but its fine  now ,,,&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have said, thick honey and it changes quickly from that consistency to being too thick to get a good impression</li>
            <li> I was given new ones at no cost, however that led to my lower dentures not fitting since they were molded to fit the first upper plates.</li>
            <li> It is also important to me there is little or no after taste.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the ProSft is a good tight fit without the Fix- powder.</li>
            <li> My immediates were so loose that they just fell right out without using Seabond wafers and</li>
            <li> I do find that I&#x27;m having to do it more often (monthly) as it either becomes too hard or it becomes discolored</li>
            <li> ProSoft  is easy to use and last longer than other products.</li>
            <li> Altho it actually does remain very cushiony soft, it \\&quot;sets up\\&quot; and does not continue to overflow the denture when biting or chewing pressure</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist 3 times in a month for soft lining and</li>
            <li> I used pro soft and it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> and so far my gums have not gotten sore at all.</li>
            <li> It gives you a soft reline in the convience of your home, to do whenever it needs it.</li>
            <li> PRECISELY.plus!&lt;br /&gt;Being soft</li>
            <li> and you cant remove the old liner that no longer fits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both ProSoft and PermaSoft and prefer the softer ProSoft for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS-Perma Soft People: Don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
            <li> It is definitely soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS HELD UP ABOUT 3 MONTHS,SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t set up fast enough.</li>
            <li> soaking helps and so does breath mints, washing mouth with old sewer water and brushing teeth with draino would help too.</li>
            <li> Also, I emailed Permalabs and asked them the difference between ProSoft and Perma Soft.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t even go so far as to call it a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after it has completely set it is rubbery and flexible.</li>
            <li> so I can eat what I want over Christmas without worrying about getting grit stuck in the soft lining material of my dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had my dentures for nearly 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Even though my husband had no trouble putting the liner in, and no complaints on taste, It did not help, but gummed up.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Perma Soft....</li>
            <li> -It, because it keeps soft.</li>
            <li> ...the chemical taste which persists and my rookie mistakes the system works well so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered ProSoft to try because I need a soft liner for comfort.  </li>
            <li> i dont like the Perma Soft becaus</li>
            <li> but i hope you continue to carry the pro soft</li>
            <li> but so far I have no  problems with the product</li>
            <li> This is soft-</li>
            <li> I was really surprised</li>
            <li> To me, it looked like there was way TOO MUCH liquid, so I panicked and scooped some back out!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that works like your old Cushion Grip..</li>
            <li> I was grateful when I received the Pro Soft.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a soft feel and have had no problem with it not adhering to my denture</li>
            <li> You will still have to have a professional reline done, but works well for a temporary reline.</li>
            <li> My partial had become very loose and was requiring me to use the adhesive 4 or more times a day.</li>
            <li> Rating is because it&#x27;s at least as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but too expensive.  </li>
            <li> So contacted another dentist, and he saw the problems I was having right away, however I have already spent almost $1000 on the set I have now, and the procedure that he wants to do sounds like just what I need, but costly, and I want to do this in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this for my husband and he likes it better than any other similar product he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Carefully followed the instructions but found my dentures to be ill-fitting and the liner pulled right out within hours.</li>
            <li> At first, watch for lumps of dry powder in the mixture.</li>
            <li> Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP.</li>
            <li> Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP.</li>
            <li> Had upper dentures and near full mouth partial completed Feb 2013.  </li>
            <li> Of course the Drug Store prices will vary but I believe this may be about twice the price of other OTC brands but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My gums have shrunk and shifted, leaving my first set extremely loose.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, at first the taste is terrible.  </li>
            <li> They look the same, the instructions are different and I&#x27;m sure the chemical ingredients are similar but not the same, or not in the same ratios.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that there could have been a little bit more material giving in order to completely fill the upper plate.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d removed all of the old material but the new batch did not cover places that showed up a different color after I applied it.</li>
            <li> It was better than my last professional hard reline.</li>
            <li> This product works great, but it does leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth which can be removed after soaking in baking soda water.</li>
            <li> They can really wreck your gums and underlying bone if you put it off too long.</li>
            <li> If I should really not continue to use this but should have a dental lab do them why buy this in the first place?</li>
            <li> I definitely would suggest it to any new denture wearer as their gums and bones change.</li>
            <li> In my case,with no hot drinks the liner is very very much attached.</li>
            <li> I am just now feeling a bit of a need to maybe remove this liner and put a new one in because my gums have shrunk a bit more and it just this week has gotten a tad loose when I bit into something hard.</li>
            <li> separates from denture even after following exact instructions and the taste never lasted this long before.</li>
            <li> All in all this product is well worth the money seeing how it costs less than $20</li>
            <li> Tried it today and the mixture never did set it is sticky and dentures can&#x27;t be used as food would just stick to the denture causing major discomfort.</li>
            <li> I popped those baby&#x27;s back in and WOW!</li>
            <li> After the last cure time, I put in my mouth and IT WAS MY OLD CUSHION GRIP all over again!</li>
            <li> and I didnt like that as it was hard and wore off quickly!</li>
            <li> Follow the directions to the letter, and don&#x27;t bite down too soon or too fast, just slow pressure until you achieve a full on bite, then hold it firm and do not let up until the proper time has passed; otherwise your dentures will be extremely comfortable but won&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li> I could not use the fixedent powder before I added the ProSoft as my teeth where to loose for it to really work.</li>
            <li> You can get 2 full relines or 4 relines on just an upper or just a lower if you split the material in half before mixing.</li>
            <li> i really like the pro soft, it iavery comfortable and last a long time and ir never gets hard.</li>
            <li> While the liner quality itself is good (it stays soft, it&#x27;s easy to apply and trim, etc.), the chemical aftertaste is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> it gets really hard and if you try to smooth it</li>
            <li> I only needed to reline  lower denture and found that one bottle was way to much for the lower denture and therefore wasted a large amount of the product.  </li>
            <li> Dentures, well if you have them and they don&#x27;t fit well, as in my case, one little sore spot can curtail chewing, so if you have ill fitting dentures this works.</li>
            <li> Read the directions and you&#x27;ll feel better soon, It might take you a while to figure out just how much to use of each ingrediant but its not much (as they say less is more) a little powder and a little fluid (the hardner) goes a long way and get a tiny eye droper</li>
            <li> so there are now two happy women with dentures that stay in place and aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement in the fit and actually feel like the denture is in worse shape after a month.</li>
            <li> As far as the taste goes, it was not at all noticeable the second day after soaking my dentures overnight in effervescent denture cleanser from CVS.</li>
            <li> Had to soak them several times because of the fact that they stay soft, they also hold the chemical smell and taste longer</li>
            <li> When he went back the dentist put in a soft liner.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t really careful the knife will take off too much and lift the liner from the denture.  </li>
            <li> so what do I do to totally remove the old</li>
            <li> As far as any smell or after taste I noticed a very slight chemical taste the first day.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on reline kits, trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li> That made fitting sloppy with a poorer result.</li>
            <li> Since I received enough to do both a full top and bottom plate and only needed enough to do one small partial, I actually split one vial of the liquid and one container of the powder in two, which will give me enough to re-line them 4 times (although I hope to have my permanent partial at the beginning of the year).</li>
            <li> It works great, chill it in the fridge for a few hours to slow down the working time.</li>
            <li> I use a rubber glove to hold the denture to remove the old liner as it can get pretty warm to the touch with a bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reline at night and after soaking in cold water, as instructed, I soak the dentures overnight in water with a little baking soda.</li>
            <li> the fit was good, but the taste was TERRIBLE, and lasted for weeks even after using baking soda.</li>
            <li> These reliner kits are great compared to other liners that usually get rock hard after they set up on the dentures.</li>
            <li> I also felt like the box looked a little funny.</li>
            <li> I just put them in cold water at night and the next morning the adhesive easily wipes right off.</li>
            <li> teeth never fit right, so I went to a local dentist asking for a reline.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> this product did live up to all the reviews I read while it does help, it neither soft or very long lasting, in the long run it&#x27;s cheaper to get</li>
            <li> It held for quite a while, one treatment was empty so used the other because she needed it right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full upper and partial lower (molars, both sides) for a little under a year, I had my first hard reline about 3 months ago after having had a couple of soft relines as my gums healed in the office.</li>
            <li> So just a heads up to others who have had surgery in the last few years,and don&#x27;t drink hot beverages</li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend is when you mix the compound let get a little thicker than honey then pour it in and don&#x27;t put to much pressure just normal pressure from your mouth closed and teeth together.  </li>
            <li> My gums are still shrinking pretty fast, and I know my dentist is getting tired of having to reline my upper over and over again.</li>
            <li> far it has set up and adhered to the denture and shows no sign of ever coming loose , TY ProSoft</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the dentist, you should be ready to spend 5,000 to $7,000 every time your gums shrink a little more.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> , it had not set, I put them in cold water immediately after, ( with other past liners, it set faster), best time to apply is at night before you go to bed , so they can harden by morning.</li>
            <li> I do like this liner a little spendy but you don&#x27;t need much and it does work.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 15 minutes with little clean up.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and ordered it thinking if it worked great if it failed at least I&#x27;d only be out $20 bucks.</li>
            <li> That number is for the person who&#x27;s gums have settled years ago,and drink very few hot drinks.</li>
            <li> In reading the information on the product I got the impressiin that this would not require any further action other than to reline them again when time and wear dictated.</li>
            <li> I used to use the other soft liner that was taken off the market.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy several now because they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> We will see how long they last though, but I will purchase this product again if I have to realign my dentures again in the future.</li>
            <li> I found the cup supplied was rather small and the mixing paddle supplied a bit too large causing me to spill a bit over the sides.</li>
            <li> I did however frequently have tender spots on my gums from the constant pressure of hard plastic against soft tissue.</li>
            <li> I will monitor ProSoft to see how long the reliner last.</li>
            <li> Of course, though, I cannot say how long it will last.</li>
            <li> product is acceptable except it does not last as long as advertised</li>
            <li> I think next time its starting to come loose</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but then decided to try this particular product.</li>
            <li> When I put it in my mouth and bit down nearly all the liner goo squeezed out.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an improvement over other products!</li>
            <li> Even though adjustments always need to be made with new dentures to prevent sore places the dentist seemed impatient with me when I would tell him I needed him to do so.</li>
            <li> My dentures fit so bad and this product really helped a  lot.</li>
            <li> The liner itself worked great, but it smelled and tasted was so bad I had to remove it after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> The permasoft was painful and left sores and blisters but this stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> Less than 3 weeks ago I paid $60.00 to have the dentist do a soft reline for me.  </li>
            <li> It is not even close to being soft &amp; you can buy it in the store&#x27;s for half the price</li>
            <li> and then my upper denture was to loose and giving me sore spots.</li>
            <li> The material shrank and left my bottom denture loose once again.</li>
            <li> It made me loose my appetite and left me feeling nausea.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that I would be stuck with a goopy mess that I&#x27;d never be able to fix!</li>
            <li> /&gt;8.Be sure your water is cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;8.Be sure your water is cold.</li>
            <li> These react just like your gums-continued use causes some minor shrinkage.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, I got dentures.  </li>
            <li> Definately not for any sort of long term use at all.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see how long it will last.would like to know if  it is cheaper</li>
            <li> I used my paring knife carefully, and only trimmed a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I used my paring knife carefully, and only trimmed a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I even soaked them in baking soda and water for over 6 hours (the instructions in the box recommend only like 30 minutes to resolve the taste), and it made absolutely no impact</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time to get rid of the taste and it burns while it is curing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reline done and knew nothing of soft liners until a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this stuff long ago.</li>
            <li> I say this as the stuff is so soft, it can make you think you&#x27;re biting all of it out when your bite is firm.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Cushion Grip user and when they quite making it, I was lost.</li>
            <li> can reline denture doesn&#x27;t stay on long and flakes in mouth.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, its the easiest to use, non-clumping, longest lasting commercial liner on the planet.</li>
            <li> that I needed an extra half of the formula to totally seal.</li>
            <li> There indeed is a slight after taste for a few days but no worse then the paste I have used to hold denture in.</li>
            <li> I expect I will be using this product for as long as I have dentures!</li>
            <li> I have a problem mouth due to maxillo facial surgeries that did not turn out as they should have.  </li>
            <li> It helped, and what little taste was left went away the following day.</li>
            <li> This should be done as needed, sometimes every few months, as the gums tend to retract, and/or change shape, in time.&lt;br /&gt;It takes less than 10 minutes, from beginning to end, very convenient, and will save you a lot of money, spent for the dentist.</li>
            <li> I mean the stuff really grips on there if its not ready to come off.</li>
            <li> I left the remnants sitting in the mixing cup overnight to see how hard it would actually get if left to dry and set without being used.</li>
            <li> Since I only needed to reline my lower plates I only use half the kit but the moment I use the other vial</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews but since the reviews on this product is why I purchased, I wanted to give my opinion.</li>
            <li> applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very quickly, direct from the manufacturer, in a padded envelope with all the things I needed in a small box.</li>
            <li> Maybe the dentures were too loose to begin with.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product when my dentures feel loose.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone having issues with loose or rocking dentures.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight chemical taste/smell briefly (much less than when my dentist did a soft line for me).</li>
            <li> Now when I bite down, the liners actually feel that they are massaging my gums.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Perma Soft is a longer-lasting reliner and gets very firm.  </li>
            <li> I have half a one left</li>
            <li> The taste is awful, first application did not go as well, When I took out my top dentures, part of the liner</li>
            <li> If that gap in the front is bothersome, I will use the second half of the kit to redo.</li>
            <li> When you bite down, don&#x27;t chomp hard, but bite slowly until it feels comfortable and then after three or four seconds, relax your jaw.</li>
            <li> : It seems ProSoft takes a little extra time to cure.</li>
            <li> Since using ProSoft, I still have to use a little adhesive initially, but after that it lasts all day, through meals, talking on the phone at work, etc.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last a little longer than it did</li>
            <li> Because I have been using Perma Soft and it always kept my gums sore because it was too hard, so I tried ProSoft</li>
            <li> my only complaint is they don&#x27;t give you enough liquid, I always run out of liquid when I have powder left.&lt;br /&gt;Gladys</li>
            <li> If it does not last at least till the beginning of the year, I will update this review, but it is supposed to last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only advice to the ProSoft folks would be to get the product shipped quicker, seemed like a long time to get a small pkg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> It took longer to set up, than I expected.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I read PermaSoft last longer than ProSoft, but is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Baking soda and water does not take away the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few months</li>
            <li> You can use your thumb to press down the edges at the back of the denture, being careful not to mess up the impression.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use your thumb to press down the edges at the back of the denture, being careful not to mess up the impression.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to missing work and inconvenience of going at all, I searched to find a product similar to what they had used.</li>
            <li> My husband got dentures and about a month later they were loose and not fitting well.</li>
            <li> did my lower first as it is the worst fit.</li>
            <li> I had to take it out and reline with my normal product after several days of being unable to taste anything but the mix.  </li>
            <li> but I am guessing it will last at least as long as the reline that was done by the dentist</li>
            <li> When it was done and cured in cold water I put my upper denture back in my mouth and then mixed the second vial and did my lowers.  </li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to other.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews for ProSoft and other reliner kits, and decided to go with ProSoft.</li>
            <li> I have tried other competing products, but the reviews convinced me to try ProSoft.</li>
            <li> By the way, the other products turn brown at the edges over time.</li>
            <li> When it comes time to insert the denture to get an impression, you will need the other plate in your mouth to have something to bite against.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> In the end, due to the reviews, I decided on ProSoft.</li>
            <li> The perforated folding lines were all wrong, and the ink lines are really messed up, too!</li>
            <li> This is the same product that one would pay a small fortune for at the dentists office.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting the horrid taste that I got from the other products, but there wasn&#x27;t any.</li>
            <li> My mouth was extremely sore.</li>
            <li> Taste isnt offensive and it lasts longer than the other brands.</li>
            <li> The envelope it was shipped in was sealed tight but the factory box was opened and the product was loose in the envelope.</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t that bad, but I still opted to soak the relined partial in the baking soda/water mix and it worked out fine and has not bothered me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I insisted n new lowers because I felt they would still impede my ability to eat &#x27;real&#x27; food without cutting it up into small pieces.</li>
            <li> Despite everything I have read in the reviews I got a little impatient and did not let it thicken enough before placing it in my lower denture.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the swelling in the gums goes down, and they become loose.  </li>
            <li> was soft and sticky hard to handle compared to past purchases.</li>
            <li> My denture don&#x27;t fit badly</li>
            <li> but I am anxious to see just how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Did have a small amount of taste for a few days but not enough to be a bother.  </li>
            <li> Coffee would slowly soften the liner until it simply peeled away.</li>
            <li> but it is rough and it lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> I find that this breaks down the reline.</li>
            <li> perhaps chow down ..</li>
            <li> and it does run down the side of the bottle.(Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Stir, pour, bite down, trim.</li>
            <li> It does stress me since I have to turn the denture upside down to get it in my mouth</li>
            <li> it tastes pretty bad, didnt line dentures well and lasted only a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other brands</li>
            <li> No more loose denture, I would recommend this to anyone who has had their denture over a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, but better than putting up with bad dentures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, but better than putting up with bad dentures.</li>
            <li> Holds up for a really long time and isn&#x27;t&#x27; hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It also eroded after a brief period of time leaving a very thin lining for the last week  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a small, bottom partial \\&quot;flipper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> you mess up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a little odd and stings a bit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a little odd and stings a bit.</li>
            <li> The directions are a hand typed black and white carbon copied generic instruction sheet that is folded very sloppy with an 800 number and a P.O. Box address.</li>
            <li> After taste lingers a little bit longer than I like</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it came with packaging if plastic bag with no original box.</li>
            <li> I did soak them in baking soda water, it helps a little.</li>
            <li> takes a little practice but works well.</li>
            <li> but I pushed the liner back down onto the denture and put it back in the cold water to finish curing.  </li>
            <li> I have denture&#x27;s that do not fit tight on my gums, trying this ProSoft Denture Reliner-Relines 2 Denture Plates helps my denture&#x27;s to say in place.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly recommend this product for anyone with loose dentures or dentures that are painful.</li>
            <li> I can bite down with no discomfort!</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of the Perma Soft being too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I trimmed off too much of the excess after the cold water soak.</li>
            <li> Lower dentures typically do not fit as well as the uppers</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t string or objectionable and it disappered within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble !</li>
            <li> I had to redo the bottoms in a few weeks</li>
            <li> If this was not available</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s in my near future. :(</li>
            <li> a lot of trouble for very little.</li>
            <li> tasted really bad and it came off as fast as it went on save your money  !</li>
            <li> She apologized over and over about the missing instructions, and then priority shipped me two boxes for my trouble!</li>
            <li> The splitting of the product equally was a little difficult, but doable.</li>
            <li> A quick to use product, and although not quite as nasty tasting as another I have used, it still retains the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; a long time despite soaking in baking soda and water as instructed.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that to get it thick enough to where it protects the underlying bone and gum from the denture, it keeps squirting out and around the denture every time you apply pressure by biting or chewing.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use it.</li>
            <li> no more .</li>
            <li> Has the most horrible taste.  </li>
            <li> I washed each denture in turn with my usual paste and hand sanitizer before I started.</li>
            <li> The cups are too small.</li>
            <li> my dentures have never fit this well!  </li>
            <li> ist time it did not last one week ill have to try it again</li>
            <li> ) Waste not want not!  </li>
            <li> She explained that Perma Labs is a small family owned company which processes and packages all of their product themselves.</li>
            <li> Third, it was extremely difficult to remove the material from the denture.</li>
            <li> a few easy steps and no more nasty adhesives.</li>
            <li> Very messy to apply.</li>
            <li> They worked very well, but left a nasty after-taste in my mouth, which eventually subsided.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that Sea-Bond wafers are very difficult to get off of the denture at the end of the day without scraping off the ProSoft reliner material.</li>
            <li> I hate it very much.</li>
            <li> Also trying to mix the mixture in those small cups was a pain because it was hard to tell when the material be came the consistency of honey.</li>
            <li> Comes with 2 applications, which could actually be broken down into four.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply but even after a week the chemical taste was terrible.</li>
            <li> pros: lasted about a year because it is hard set.</li>
            <li> I kept some hard candy around to offset the flavor.</li>
            <li> I can hardly stand it, like Permasoft did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The soreness and pain in my mouth was hard to bear.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Was hard to work together.</li>
            <li> so you can get a hard reline at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I tried the cheaper reliner from the drug store but it was too hard.</li>
            <li> I paid to have mine hard lined</li>
            <li> Does not taste near as bad as some folks say.</li>
            <li> It stays fairly soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums, although it does have a bad taste, it goes away after a couple days.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 because there is still the after taste, although, not as bad as Perma Soft.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for the icky taste-</li>
            <li> Be prepared for the icky taste-</li>
            <li> The ProSoft reliner material did the trick -- at least for the time being.</li>
            <li> but I expect after a night in a cold water bath should dissipate this, just as it did with the office soft relines, which I might add were both worse tasting and burned while they cured in my mouth</li>
            <li> Like I said, I haven&#x27;t eaten nuts, or anything else crunchy for that matter, in at least 2 years</li>
            <li> I was afraid to go out to eat in public with my friends.</li>
            <li> For all I know, both Perma Soft and ProSoft may be the same product, but both of them work well as a denture reliner, but the solvent used tastes really awful, and lingers for days.  </li>
            <li> I mixed per directions, waited until it was thick (thicker than the honey called for in the directions) spread in my denture, leveled with the stir stick provided, ran under cold water for about 2 minutes, then popped in my mouth for the 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> To thick wont use it again</li>
            <li> The product does get thickly gooey and may drip onto the surface you are working on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like someone threw some stuff in a small box!</li>
            <li> hate having to get new dentures</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply... even closely following instructions and extremely difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I even bought a more expensive one and was VERY disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved over to EZO cushions, which are much less expensive, and have no taste at all.  </li>
            <li> taste was so bad ,even after several attttemps to get rid of i had to throw the unused portion away and remove the applicatin freon the dentores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good to keep relining.</li>
            <li> I will get one that will not set up right and has a awful taste that just will not go away for months!  </li>
            <li> After receiving this, I have decided to just help my family member and pay the $$$ for their realignment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone spending their hard earned money on this, or putting unidentifiable contents in your mouth!</li>
            <li> me say, the other reviewers aren&#x27;t wrong or exaggerating!  </li>
            <li> They all taste nasty at first, so I&#x27;m used to that.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, pretty nasty taste but the baking soda and water soak seems to have taken care of that.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> No better than Fixodent!!</li>
            <li> Bottom needs to be done over, but, no more product!!  </li>
            <li> it is to hard and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Some of them became hard as a rock within a few days, others had caustic chemicals that burned my gums badly.</li>
            <li> I used it ti reline my wife&#x27;s lower denture, and she said the taste was worse than acryline 2.</li>
            <li> it just was too thin it peeled off etc.</li>
            <li> but since I am still in my immediates and poor... I like to have this on stock...</li>
            <li> I reline approximately every 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> DID NOT STICK CAME OFF AND PEELED CRACKED NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> did not work, made dentures worse.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely false.  </li>
            <li> The taste and odor were no where as bad as I&#x27;d expected from reading some other reviews, their is some bad aftertaste</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading the negative reviews...because one negative review said it tasted bad and that baking soda didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PUSH REAL HARD.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PUSH REAL HARD.</li>
            <li> Taste bad for a few days</li>
            <li> taste was really bad for a few days, even after doing baking soda soak.  </li>
            <li> I like the mixture to be truly as thick as cold honey.</li>
            <li> One week later still getting real unpleasant aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> It was a very weak repair and did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I will say I was a little doubtful about this product but</li>
            <li> cons: nasty taste on initial setting.</li>
            <li> There is a weird taste from the liner that lingers fir a day or so.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I did not realize that until after the fact.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because it tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> and it made mealtime extremely difficult</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try again, to see if I did anything wrong.</li>
            <li> awful didn&#x60;t last a week</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong but just off.</li>
            <li> The taste is absolutey horrible and no matter how long you soak them in baking soda water.</li>
            <li> every single night, overnight, for 7 nights in a row, and this had no effect on the terrible taste, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, due to the extremely terrible chemical taste that lingers for two weeks, I will never order this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other products that were horrible.</li>
            <li> Have tried soaking in baking soda like it said for over half an hour and still is horrible.</li>
            <li> If you are a denture wearer, then you know how little it takes to create a nasty irritation on the gums.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, and it tastes awful</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shape once you set it up in the cold water.</li>
            <li> Took out and continued to cure in the cup of cold water for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> There is an unpleasant taste for a couple of days</li>
            <li> The Reliners from the store seem to harden, and end up being very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> i found it impossible to use</li>
            <li> Has a bad taste even after months of use</li>
            <li> also had a bad taste no matter what I dd.</li>
            <li> The icecream-cup wood spoon is a bad choice as a mixer.</li>
            <li> DO taste it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste so bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the taste as bad as some made out.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> It had a bad taste.  </li>
            <li> I had to remove it after a couple of days because it made all food taste bad.</li>
            <li> now the bad part.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> the bad taste and odor goes away in a day.  </li>
            <li> The taste is unforgivably bad.</li>
            <li> Yes, it tastes bad.  </li>
            <li> The solution did leave a bad taste</li>
            <li> i am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate when I do that.</li>
            <li> We still need something which contains a thermoplastic base.</li>
            <li> the taste is very unpleasant even after a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Permasoft tastes sooooo bad!</li>
            <li> is very bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed!  </li>
            <li> but the taste is HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> BUT the horrible taste is still there.</li>
            <li> would I buy it again yes ,because it works &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty taste in your mouth like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> there is one drawback : it taste awful !!!!!  </li>
            <li> I hate this format!  </li>
            <li> Never the awful experience this has been.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It DOES have a horrible, chemical taste in the beginning</li>
            <li> This product tastes terrible; doesn&#x27;t do as advertised though</li>

            <li> looks ok ,haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> Got this for hubby&#x27;s dentures... he used it and said it did not set up right on the lowers and we had to find another product to fix them.. He did say it was great on the uppers..  So guess it is all how it is mixed..</li>
            <li> Good product.  This the third order for the item.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different liners and by far the best,easiest to use,last the longest and does the best job of all of them is the pro soft denture liner.I have used them 2 times now and I will never use any other liner again,they are the only liner to use believe me,very easy to prepare and mix and use and last a very long time and feels good in your mouth,no after taste at all like a lot of them.my choice is prosoft.  Jerry Delpaz  Georgia</li>
            <li> was not enough to fill both dentures . I have holes and gaps cause I should of use both for just the top plate</li>
            <li> Ever needed a denture &#x27;relined&#x27; but had neither the money nor the time to have it done. DO IT YOURSELF. I have done it since &#x27;90. This is the best product that I have found in today&#x27;s market. It remains somewhat soft, until you need a new one. I replace mine every 6 months, as the continued use of this product is not recommended. These react just like your gums-continued use causes some minor shrinkage. If you continue to use it, after any shrinkage, you can cause permanent damage to your gums, therefore, the reason I change each 6 months. It may take you 2 or 3 times to finally &#x27;learn&#x27; how to do it right. Still much cheaper than paying a lab. Who knows what you feel(?), a lab or your mouth? This item, as are many, is subject to be discontinued at any minute. I bought a 7 year supply. A similar item was DISCONTINUED. It took me 15 years to find this one (I wasted a LOT of $ and time), so I have made sure I have a WORKING product--No, I od not sell this product. I &#x27;believe&#x27; in this product</li>
            <li> bought for friend she liked it</li>
            <li> Two thoughts:  this product feels like it is burning the gums for a day or two after first applying,  Thereafter does well with hold for about three months which maybe it all it is supposed to last.  Anyway, some +/-</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, at first the taste is terrible.  The instructions states to remove the taste, soak the denture for 20 minutes in baking soda and water. I left mine in the sulution for about 45 minute and the taste was much more tolerable. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very satisfied  with product.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to get a similar product at a chain store but they no longer carry the product. I was thrilled to find some one that still supplies this product.</li>
            <li> Love it , it&#x27;s one of the best brands I have tried, &amp; I tried a lot. loveit love it love it.</li>
            <li> I like it...definitely a big improvement in fit...which is nice....but I tell that it is going to be very temporary</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother and she loves it! Her dentures fit snug and are comfortable. If she ever needs to reline again, we will buy this.</li>
            <li> Good thing this stuff is only temporary......</li>
            <li> works well but the taste is HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years.  It is great, but I wish it would fit snugger on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product.  I needed a reline because my lowers were &amp;#34;Immediates,&amp;#34; the kind that are put in right after an extraction.  After a few weeks, the swelling in the gums goes down, and they become loose.  Since I got my dentures at a dental school, it would take a while to get a reline appointment.  So I tried this product and am very happy with it.  It arrived quickly after my order, and if you follow the instructions exactly, it works as well as the professional reline.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply... even closely following instructions and extremely difficult to remove. I&#x27;ll give it one more try and if anything changes I&#x27;ll write a follow-up review.</li>
            <li> ProSoft Denture Reliner-Relines 2 Denture Plates worked really well. I have denture&#x27;s that do not fit tight on my gums, trying this ProSoft Denture Reliner-Relines 2 Denture Plates helps my denture&#x27;s to say in place. Really happy with product. I will recommend this product to other.</li>
            <li> It took longer to set up, than I expected.I used it ti reline my wife&#x27;s lower denture, and she said the taste was worse than acryline 2.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product  !</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does not taste near as bad as some folks say. Worked like a charm and now I don&#x27;t have to pay for extra reline visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner  I only needed to reline  lower denture and found that one bottle was way to much for the lower denture and therefore wasted a large amount of the product.  Had no problem mixing and applying the pro soft and it is very comfortable.  Lower dentures typically do not fit as well as the uppers and I am very pleased thus far even though I don,t think this reline will last too long.  Would have given five stars had I not wasted so much.</li>
            <li> Keeps the teeth comfortable.</li>
            <li> chemicals seemed to burn mouth This was a new product for me.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply but even after a week the chemical taste was terrible. I am not able to use it.</li>
            <li> the product worked very well and was happy with it</li>
            <li> Has a bad taste even after months of use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful I went to my dentist 3 times in a month for soft lining and it just was too thin it peeled off etc. I used pro soft and it&#x27;s soft it cushioned my dentures they fit and stayed without any adhesive or sea bond. The only thing I recommend is when you mix the compound let get a little thicker than honey then pour it in and don&#x27;t put to much pressure just normal pressure from your mouth closed and teeth together.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> works good but cant take the taste is very bad only had 3 days that was it</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and expected. Compares well to Denturite!</li>
            <li> did not work well. also had a bad taste no matter what I dd. no more .</li>
            <li> Th reliners provided good improvement I will rate again after using the relined dentures for a longer time period.</li>
            <li> I had to buy several now because they don&#x27;t last long. I even bought a more expensive one and was VERY disappointed! The chemical in it was so strong it burned my mouth. And it didn&#x27;t last the 2 years it was supposed to. For the price I can&#x27;t complain about this one</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Pro Soft to help my new dentures fit better.  It lasts several months and works just like the relining material the dentist uses.</li>
            <li> Was easy to use and it Works!</li>
            <li> very different from permasoft.&lt;br /&gt;prosoft pros: gel like easy on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;  cons: flimsy tears easily.&lt;br /&gt;permasoft pros: lasted about a year because it is hard set. easy to remove once it started separating on its own just pull and pry out use hot water in between prying and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;  cons: nasty taste on initial setting. took up to a week without using baking soda solution to help kill the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both may require more then one application if the back of your denture has a big gap from your gums shrinking.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is they don&#x27;t give you enough liquid, I always run out of liquid when I have powder left.&lt;br /&gt;Gladys Faulk&lt;br /&gt;gladysfaulk@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I have used the doc recline kit before trying this one. I will not be buying the doc again. Prosoft was much better for me. There is a weird taste from the liner that lingers fir a day or so. I kept some hard candy around to offset the flavor. There is a bit of a tingle as the liner is setting but, it&#x27;s very mild compared with the burning from the doc recline kit. Time for recline took me about an hour, much of that was waiting for curing and cleaning the dentures. 3 mins in the mouth for moulding on each denture. I will be keeping an extra kit handy just in case of damage. My dentures are better now than ever before. I still use a it of adhesive to secure each denture as I like to be sure of no slipping. I have only been wearing mine for about 10 months and have had lots of shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use. No irritations or aftertaste. Doesn&#x27;t taste like the smell of acetone. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, I got dentures.  The dentist didn&#x27;t put a liner in, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Very messy to apply. Comfortable when finished but lasted only 4 -5 days before needing replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other brands and I find them all to be about the same. Buy the one with the best price.</li>
            <li> Worked ok not as great as it said it was. Only lasted a month.</li>
            <li> Instructions are very good had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Its easy to use and makes my partial plate feel and fit better.  It lasted 4 months the first time I used it.  I highly recommend ProSoft and will purchase it again.  I have never used a similar product but I can&#x27;t imagine that anything else could work better.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews but since the reviews on this product is why I purchased, I wanted to give my opinion. First, the packaging was very generic, which is okay but made me a little nervous that maybe it was manufactured and boxed in a home somewhere. Second, the reline is not enough for two dentures. I wanted to order this aa I only have the upper denture but wanted an extra in case of a mishap or If I liked it well enough to use it again (it is temporary). The directions were very easy to follow but there is not enough product to cover my entire top plate. unfortunately I did not realize that until after the fact. I also brush my denture each night and soak them. I find that this breaks down the reline. It has been very temporary for me as it is wearing away quickly with brushing and soaking. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing again. It was just too temporary for me..just a matter of a week. Definately not for any sort of long term use at all. I am looking into other products that state are good for two years or longer. I will be investigating the brushing and soaking aspect on those prior to purchase as well!</li>
            <li> Because I have been using Perma Soft and it always kept my gums sore because it was too hard, so I tried ProSoft and so far my gums have not gotten sore at all. I understand it has to be replaced more often but I am anxious to see just how long it lasts. How will I know when it needs to be replaced? Please forward this question to Perms Labs as I would like an answer</li>
            <li> Rating is because it&#x27;s at least as good as the more expensive brand. I just wish they both worked better.</li>
            <li> This product works great, but it does leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth which can be removed after soaking in baking soda water.</li>
            <li> it really works well..I was very pleased.I will reorder.....</li>
            <li> This was an easy fix for awhile,easy  to do.I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Has the most horrible taste.  Have tried soaking in baking soda like it said for over half an hour and still is horrible.</li>
            <li> The denture reline kit was worth the money, easy to use and no nasty after taste.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again !</li>
            <li> ProSoft is my first denture reliner kit that I&#x27;ve tried. I read some of the reviews for ProSoft and other reliner kits, and decided to go with ProSoft. My kit was delivered in a timely manner. I read the instructions about 5 or 6 times before starting because I didn&#x27;t want to make a mistake. I was nervous after reading the negative reviews...because one negative review said it tasted bad and that baking soda didn&#x27;t help. Another review stated there wasn&#x27;t enough liquid. Well I&#x27;m here to tell you that I had no problems at all. I was bracing myself for all the negatives that I read about, but I didn&#x27;t experience those problems. I just relined my upper denture and it feel absolutely great. The instructions were perfect. I will monitor ProSoft to see how long the reliner last. I read PermaSoft last longer than ProSoft, but is not comfortable. Comfort is important to me. I am so glad my choice was ProSoft. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised .will order again.Waiting to see how long it will last.would like to know if  it is cheaper if  you purchase more</li>
            <li> Had upper dentures and near full mouth partial completed Feb 2013.  After a month of different discomforts. Ordered ProSoft after reading reviews.  Several times I got the Pro Soft out, and then decided didn&#x27;t need it right then.  Finally 8/30 did my lowers.  Very easy.  Afterwords I went to Taco Bell, ate every thing crunchy, dentures held, did not shift as they sometimes did.  The uppers however, did shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the lowers in this am, they fit great.  This am, did the uppers.  Have not tested them yet, but they feel comfortable. Thanks Amazon and Pro Soft.</li>
            <li> It gives you a soft reline in the convience of your home, to do whenever it needs it. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but is rather tricky to apply, being very, very gooey!  The icecream-cup wood spoon is a bad choice as a mixer. I used a demitasse spoon and also applied the mixture with it. I found one pack sufficient for both uppers and lowers. It has been about a week now and looks like I&#x27;ll have a add a b&#x27;it more to both which would incline me to subtract a star. But it could still be the best solution out there.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cbb30e4e39748038a754cfdc1afaf51a]]I posted the video as a picture of my teeth right after installing the PROSOFT.&lt;br /&gt;If you have been thinking about buying this product, this review will have you also buying a stock for future use.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for the second time, I ordered 5 more.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to have enough on hand that I never have to worry about availability.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t quite get a good result on your first try, don&#x27;t give up. Have an extra pack on hand so you can see how great it can be.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth never fit right, so I went to a local dentist asking for a reline.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh no, those don&#x27;t work!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;According to the dentist, you should be ready to spend 5,000 to $7,000 every time your gums shrink a little more.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I learned.... buy the Prosoft and not the Permasoft.&lt;br /&gt;Permasoft tastes sooooo bad! Prosoft, I found out yesterday, doesn&#x27;t bother me, even right after putting it in.&lt;br /&gt;I DO taste it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste so bad I can hardly stand it, like Permasoft did.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is, Prosoft is their second try at making a useful product..&lt;br /&gt;Also (guessing again), I have a feeling they wanted to make a product for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Selling to dentists, they could charge much more money.&lt;br /&gt;Making this available to the public was, I think, a last resort, after they realized dentists don&#x27;t want to save people money.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:  Buy two packs to start with for about $30.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, and when you see that it works fairly well, you might do what I did and buy 5 more.&lt;br /&gt;Being soft, makes it so comfortable right away. Soft is a real good quality!&lt;br /&gt;When I got my dentures brand new, it took several trips back to have the dentist make adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;The soreness and pain in my mouth was hard to bear.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my teeth didn&#x27;t fit very well even when band new.&lt;br /&gt;I COULD NOT actually eat food with them.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes a custom fit for you.

            <li> I found this product to work just fine. Would recommend it! It saves you money and who wouldn&#x27;t like to do that! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best reliner I have ever used. It stays fairly soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums, although it does have a bad taste, it goes away after a couple days.</li>
            <li> To thick wont use it again it really hurt my bite I will wait till I go to affordable dentures</li>
            <li> excellent product thank you</li>

            <li> My dentures fit so bad and this product really helped a  lot. Taste bad for a few days</li>
            <li> It was terrible. Didn&#x27;t work well and the after taste remains even now after most has been removed.\&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t even want to stay on after very carefully following instructions. Did two sets of teeth,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using cushion grip for years and never had any problems like this. Have implants and can us the&lt;br /&gt;cushion grip and it works great up to two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure wish they would put it back on the market as most elderly people in this town have always depended upon this&lt;br /&gt;product. I am 84 and can&#x27;t get my teeth fixed any more due to cost and surgery involved. No longer have the replacement&lt;br /&gt;parts available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you should put out a better product and help these old people!</li>
            <li> I have had to reline my dentures more than once, because I simply do not have the money to buy new dentures- who does these days? I have tried other competing products, but the reviews convinced me to try ProSoft. Wow, what an improvement over other products! Here&#x27;s how I managed to get a great fit with ProSoft, and some helpful hints: ProSoft really does edge out the competition. It is the best reline kit, in my opinion. But remember: you should be thinking about new dentures. It&#x27;s not good to keep relining. By the way, the other products turn brown at the edges over time. Uck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my tips to add to the sparse directions included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Be sure you do the procedure on a washable surface- a ceramic counter is perfect; I used my sink ledges to work.The product does get thickly gooey and may drip onto the surface you are working on.&lt;br /&gt;2. Be sure you have a clock and a good, small paring knife.  It is important to time everything just right as per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;3. I washed each denture in turn with my usual paste and hand sanitizer before I started. I rinsed them VERY thoroughly, and dried them. I wanted my dentures super clean. Be sure to do one plate at a time.  When it comes time to insert the denture to get an impression, you will need the other plate in your mouth to have something to bite against.&lt;br /&gt;4. The cups are too small. I agree with others who have said this. So, knowing this, be prepared to stir extremely carefully all the time you are mixing, especially at first. Otherwise, you end up slopping the stuff over the edge of the tiny cup. Mixing a powder and a liquid is tricky. At first, watch for lumps of dry powder in the mixture. Stir gently.&lt;br /&gt;5. I like the mixture to be truly as thick as cold honey. If you move too fast, you will have a mess.&lt;br /&gt;6. Pour the reline mixture into the denture. If your denture used to rock in your mouth, be sure to tip the denture a bit towards the side that needs to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;7. Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP. I felt like I was biting about three-quarters of the way when i was doing it. Be prepared for the icky taste- it&#x27;s just a little odd and stings a bit. Be sure to time those three minutes exactly.&lt;br /&gt;8.Be sure your water is cold. It&#x27;ll help the setting of the reliner. Again, be sure to time exactly.&lt;br /&gt;9. When the time is up, it is time to trim away the excess. I used my paring knife carefully, and only trimmed a bit at a time. This will prevent you from pulling off too much reliner and ruining your work!&lt;br /&gt;10. When you have trimmed your denture, pop it in for fit- it should be close to perfect. You can use your thumb to press down the edges at the back of the denture, being careful not to mess up the impression.&lt;br /&gt;11. I hope these tips will help you get a perfect fit! One more thought: try to figure out a way to get new dentures. I am using a jar to save my change and dollars I have to spare. It&#x27;s slow, but better than putting up with bad dentures. They can really wreck your gums and underlying bone if you put it off too long.thicker.&lt;br /&gt;7. Most important of all: DO NOT BITE DOWN TOO HARD OR DEEP.

            <li> The permasoft was painful and left sores and blisters but this stuff is amazing... I have half a one left but since I am still in my immediates and poor... I like to have this on stock...</li>
            <li> A bit of the taste is still with me after 2 weeks, but I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a Sea Bond cushion to the lower and now I eat anything I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> EASY TO APPLY. WORKS WELL. ONLY CON IS THAT IT HAS TO BE REDONE ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND SOMETIMES THE TASTE IS LINGERING.</li>
            <li> My gums are still shrinking pretty fast, and I know my dentist is getting tired of having to reline my upper over and over again. This service is included in the original cost of the denture, but I feel my welcome there is beginning to wear a little thin. The ProSoft reliner material did the trick -- at least for the time being. One thing is for sure, it is definitely \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; as the product documentation states. It&#x27;s a lot softer and gummier than the stuff the dentist uses. The only down side is that Sea-Bond wafers are very difficult to get off of the denture at the end of the day without scraping off the ProSoft reliner material. As far as the taste goes, it was not at all noticeable the second day after soaking my dentures overnight in effervescent denture cleanser from CVS. I guess I&#x27;d give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- NEXT DAY: It seems ProSoft takes a little extra time to cure. I had no problem removing Sea-Bond from last night, and the reliner material is no longer gummy. It now feels pretty much the same as the stuff the dentist uses. So if I had given this 4 1/2 stars, I would now upgrade my rating today to a full 5. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, and to prove it I&#x27;ve just ordered another box, as I am quite sure my gums will keep right on shrinking over the next 4 or five months, as that is how long my dentist wants to wait before applying a permanent hard acrylic liner.</li>
            <li> This works just great. No more loose denture, I would recommend this to anyone who has had their denture over a year. I had no problems getting the mixture to the right consistancy.  It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works much better and has much better taste and smell compared to other similar products.Almost works too good.Maybe its just in my case,but for people who have recently had oral surgery and are doing their own relines using these products,you will not get the two years out of it.That number is for the person who&#x27;s gums have settled years ago,and drink very few hot drinks.For the rest of us who just had oral surgery,this might last two months before you&#x27;ll need to do it again because your mouth is changing rapidly.That being said,when the time comes this stuff doesn&#x27;t just peel out.I think a lot of people using it drink a lot of coffee,where I do not.Coffee would slowly soften the liner until it simply peeled away.In my case,with no hot drinks the liner is very very much attached.None of the tricks work.Hydrogen peroxide overnight,doesn&#x27;t do a thing.Running it under hot water....notta.&lt;br /&gt; This can be highly discouraging when it comes time to reline again and you cant remove the old liner that no longer fits.So just a heads up to others who have had surgery in the last few years,and don&#x27;t drink hot beverages regularly.&lt;br /&gt; I think next time its starting to come loose,I will plan a day to reline it a week or so away,and drink hot drinks up to then to soften it a bit.I mean the stuff really grips on there if its not ready to come off.Think about it,its not that the liner is worn,its your gums that backed away from the liner.The liner is still like new.Anyway just a heads up for the non coffee drinkers.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable I will be buying this again in the future way better than 60 for the dentist/</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for me.Maybe the dentures were too loose to begin with. Followed the instructions to the letter, just didn&#x27;t work for me.I thought it would save me some money and a trip to the dentist.... WRONG!  Save your money and use it to pay your dentist. Didn&#x27;t find the taste as bad as some made out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both ProSoft and PermaSoft and prefer the softer ProSoft for my sensitive gums. I reline approximately every 6 months or so. Both are sometimes challenging to remove, I heat up water for a couple of minutes in the microwave... hot but NOT anywhere near boiling..then soak the dentures for 5 minutes or so. I use a rubber glove to hold the denture to remove the old liner as it can get pretty warm to the touch with a bare hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reline at night and after soaking in cold water, as instructed, I soak the dentures overnight in water with a little baking soda. Next morning their is zero chemical taste or smell.</li>
            <li> I had been gluing my uppers (my only plate) in since my gums had healed, as they fell out when I yawned.  But after using this, they stay in when they are supposed to, and I can pull them out and rinse them off if I get something underneath them during the course of the day.  I recommend them to anyone with loose-fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> tasted really bad and it came off as fast as it went on save your money  ! and go to a dentist.</li>
            <li> Pro soft denture recliner works very well. I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> wonderful !  nice soft liner, longer lasting than comfort grip and so much more comfortable than re- line it (and the after taste is not as offensive !</li>
            <li> Good product! Dentures now fit very snugly and comfortable for about a week now. It seems I&#x27;ll be fine until I can get new ones. I still have to use some Fixodent for maximum hold but that is not a problem. I just put them in cold water at night and the next morning the adhesive easily wipes right off. I recommend this product. SECURE CARE adhesive however is a rip off. No better than Fixodent!! BEWARE!</li>
            <li> ProSoft did exactly what it said and it was very easy to use. Only gave 4 stars because it tastes terrible. My soft reline is still good after 3 weeks BUT the horrible taste is still there.</li>
            <li> this is a life saver. i did not have the money to get my teeth relined. so while i was saving the money up for a reline i used this produce.. iIt worked great.. it to use works well. i glad i found it.</li>
            <li> This ProSoft is really a blessing for those who have pain with their dentures. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better, but even as a first-time user the product was not hard to work with, as I feared it might be. For my first try, I did pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Cushion Grip and it is a good product. The only bad thing is that to get it thick enough to where it protects the underlying bone and gum from the denture, it keeps squirting out and around the denture every time you apply pressure by biting or chewing. This ProSoft doesn&#x27;t do that. Altho it actually does remain very cushiony soft, it \\&quot;sets up\\&quot; and does not continue to overflow the denture when biting or chewing pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it. Well, except that it does have a bit of a taste but I&#x27;m sure if you soak it in baking soda and water mixture like they say, that would be fixed. I did mine last night and did not use this mixture, but tonight it has finally gone away.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it and says it,s a good product. He has me reorder once a year. The dentist can&#x27;t seem to get his dentures to fit his mouth right and he has settled with this product. Works better than what the dentist has done for him.</li>
            <li> I tried this prosoft liner and have fell in love! I have had so many problems with the liner that my dentist used and then my upper denture was to loose and giving me sore spots. I tried the prosoft and I truly love this. I will be purchasing some more as needed! I highly recommmend this product!</li>
            <li> Save your money. I followed the directions to the letter. If you can stand the gross chemical taste, the liner does not last longer than 1 day.</li>
            <li> this stuff will save your life if you cant get to the dentist right away. a few easy steps and no more nasty adhesives.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware. This product does not work as advertised. Carefully followed the instructions but found my dentures to be ill-fitting and the liner pulled right out within hours.</li>
            <li> This works great. I tried some different ones, but ProSoft is the best yet. It&#x27;s easy to reline you&#x27;re dentures and make them fit!!!</li>
            <li> yes it did so much better Thanks</li>
            <li> WowZaaaaa...I got my ProSoft today in the mail and I could not wait to try it out! I read all the POSITIVE reviews before buying. I have to say, I really didn&#x27;t believe it would stay soft once applied to the dentures. I thought it would harden up like others I have tried. Wahlaaaa...its like a soft rubber and so - so - so comfortable. I followed the directions that came with the kit. I did use my fixedent powder as I do love a full hold in case I end up some wheres during the day that I didnt expect to go to and perhaps chow down ..I just like the extra protection and it feeling more like my own real teeth in a sense and also I have a habit of moving my dentures around in my mouth and I hate when I do that. I could not use the fixedent powder before I added the ProSoft as my teeth where to loose for it to really work. But now I have a hold that should last through the day. Needless to say, the ProSft is a good tight fit without the Fix- powder. Now for as long this will last before having to buy more ProSoft we will see. But for Now I am amazed! No Cons at this time!! Do try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to say that I have tried D.O.C. Reline-It, Advanced Denture Reliner and I didnt like that as it was hard and wore off quickly!</li>
            <li> I have used most of these products, and this product is above wonderful. Easy to use and when set and crunchy foods are eaten, it does NOT crawl out from where it meets the gums. I will be ordering more of this, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try, despite the many, many reviews stating that the chemical taste is....well, chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say, the other reviewers aren&#x27;t wrong or exaggerating!  While the liner quality itself is good (it stays soft, it&#x27;s easy to apply and trim, etc.), the chemical aftertaste is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  I read some reviewers say that it only lasts a couple of days.  This is absolutely false.  The taste lasted for over TWO FULL WEEKS in my upper and lower.  I even soaked them in baking soda and water for over 6 hours (the instructions in the box recommend only like 30 minutes to resolve the taste), and it made absolutely no impact whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked in denture cleansing tablets (spearmint flavored) every single night, overnight, for 7 nights in a row, and this had no effect on the terrible taste, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now in my third week after doing the reline, and I can finally wear them without wanting to throw up from the taste.  The process of getting here was absolutely nightmarish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the quality of the liner is excellent.  The liner stays pliable/soft, making my dentures much more comfortable to wear.  However, due to the extremely terrible chemical taste that lingers for two weeks, I will never order this product again.</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems, tons of material, always have extra.  Much better than the Re-Line it stuff.  You can get 2 full relines or 4 relines on just an upper or just a lower if you split the material in half before mixing.</li>
            <li> This product works very good. However leaves an after taste that I cannot get rid of. I soaked the dentures in baking sida water, as per manufactors instructions, and still after over a week has taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my dentures fit snug and are cushion soft against my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentist charges $150.00 per plate for this.</li>
            <li> used to be better. separates from denture even after following exact instructions and the taste never lasted this long before. Finally I used apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Upper came out as advertised, Excellent.  Bottom needs to be done over, but, no more product!!  Have to order again to do lower denture</li>
            <li> soon as I ate something, it turned to much in my mouth and dentures slipped</li>
            <li> The stuff works great for a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used liners before. This is a different maker, but basically the same thing and it works fantastic, and was the cheapest one I could find. They all taste nasty at first, so I&#x27;m used to that.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product. After using 2 other brands this is by far the best. Very easy and the softness is very comfortable. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I like the product and would recommend to friends. I will order again. Its certainly better and cheaper than the dentist.</li>
            <li> Ordered for a friend.  Worked really great, and her dentures fit better than ever.  As a retired dental lab tech, it is better and easier to use than any denture line I ave ever worked with.  My friend says her dentures are more stable and more comfortable than when the were new.Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is actually a reorder. When it was time to reline I ordered a different product and it didn&#x27;t have the cushioning the prosoft does and it made mealtime extremely difficult so I came back to the &amp;#34; tried and true.&amp;#34; this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My dentures are so comfortable now and no need for adhesives! I highly recommend it for anyone with loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> Did not adhere well.  We still need something which contains a thermoplastic base.</li>
            <li> The envelope it was shipped in was sealed tight but the factory box was opened and the product was loose in the envelope. Tried it today and the mixture never did set it is sticky and dentures can&#x27;t be used as food would just stick to the denture causing major discomfort.</li>
            <li> Good product but sometimes the chemical is much too strong for too long.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. I am satisfied with it and will order it again. I am still on the first application on my lower plate and it has been 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> The taste is awful, first application did not go as well, When I took out my top dentures, part of the liner came with it, it had not set, I put them in cold water immediately after, ( with other past liners, it set faster), best time to apply is at night before you go to bed , so they can harden by morning.</li>
            <li> I love it. I had used Acryline, but this is much better.  I find it adheres better, it stays soft, and doesn&#x27;t continually slip. The taste isn&#x27;t pleasant at first, but can easily be remedied. I do intend to purchase some more in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> this product did live up to all the reviews I read while it does help, it neither soft or very long lasting, in the long run it&#x27;s cheaper to get&lt;br /&gt;your lower dentures relined, I don&#x27;t use on upper denture so I can rate it</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely, product was easy to use.  I expected it to last a little longer than it did (3 mos.), and did not like the different color it turned after about a month of use.  I&#x27;m going to try again, to see if I did anything wrong. (although the directions were quite good and specific).  I&#x27;ll keep advised.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. I have had my new, very costly dentures for not even a year, I have had so many problems, especially with the lower plate. The dentist can not, or I feel, will not fix this problem. So contacted another dentist, and he saw the problems I was having right away, however I have already spent almost $1000 on the set I have now, and the procedure that he wants to do sounds like just what I need, but costly, and I want to do this in the future. I thought if I could just find a product that would make my lower dentures comfortable, then I could be saving my money for new dentures that would be made right, well this product did it for me, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth for a while, but this will finally go away, because of this product I am able to wait to have to spend another huge amount of money right away! Better product than I even expected. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> DID NOT STICK CAME OFF AND PEELED CRACKED NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I found that it was not as soft as I expected. would I buy it again yes ,because it works &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty taste in your mouth like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. Easy to follow instructions and works very well. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great. My upper plate hasn&#x27;t fit like this for years</li>
            <li> ProSoft  is easy to use and last longer than other products.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some I have used, but it is okay for  temporary liner. I will have to fine a dentist to do  a reline.</li>
            <li> Very good product, did everything I wanted  it to.</li>
            <li> I followed directions to a t, read them several times before starting. Mixed fine, poured ok, shaped, trimmed.  Fit good, however after 1st meal, out they came...rinsed off and out came the lining in tact.  I waited quite awhile before eating and didn&#x27;t eat anything requiring biting etc.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  What a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Works as well as Permasoft, which is more expensive. I love this product; it&#x27;s saved me a bundle!</li>
            <li> It has been helpful with my dentures.  I need to order more.</li>
            <li> my dentures have never fit this well!  For the first time since I got them, my gums don&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;ll be using this until I get my new dentures.</li>
            <li> They worked very well, but left a nasty after-taste in my mouth, which eventually subsided.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> The portions provided arent enough. I had to ise both applications for my upper plate. The taste is absolutey horrible and no matter how long you soak them in baking soda water. The only thing that was nice was is was really soft just cant get past everything tasting like spary paint</li>
            <li> Wow! I was pleasantly surprised! Once I got over my fear of trying this (being a former &#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27; fan), it was great!! My dentures fit great!! Of course, I had to trim and file a bit, but now my denture &#x27;fits like a glove!&#x27; The reason I gave it four stars is because it does taste &#x27;funky&#x27; for awhile, but that&#x27;s a small price to to pay for the good comfort and fit! I have a bottom denture that I&#x27;ve learned to control without adhesives and we all know what a PIA a bottom denture is and how it hurts without a &#x27;cushion&#x27; of some sort, but with ProSoft, the denture stays put and is comfy. This is my first try with ProSoft and I will say that Perma Labs as got another satisfied customer. I&#x27;ll be back for more!!&lt;br /&gt;PS-Perma Soft People: Don&#x27;t change the formula. It works wonderfully. I, for one, will deal with the taste to have the hold and fit I now have!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It is definitely soft on the gums.  I did find though that I needed an extra half of the formula to totally seal.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stay in my lower partials for even two hours. I&#x27;ve tried every method listed here to no avail. When they first go in they feel great but within 2 hours everything is lifting off. Complete waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> IT HAS HELD UP ABOUT 3 MONTHS,SO FAR.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for me. I&#x27;ve had a full upper and partial lower (molars, both sides) for a little under a year, I had my first hard reline about 3 months ago after having had a couple of soft relines as my gums healed in the office. I just installed this product on both upper and lower, though I did both at the same time, against the advice of the product directions, I had enough material to do both at once with ample squeeze out and good coverage of both dentures. The taste and odor were no where as bad as I&#x27;d expected from reading some other reviews, their is some bad aftertaste but I expect after a night in a cold water bath should dissipate this, just as it did with the office soft relines, which I might add were both worse tasting and burned while they cured in my mouth, I had no burn with the ProSoft. Although I am just in my first few hours with this product I am quite pleased, it is exceeding my expectations, in fact I love pecans and cashews and haven&#x27;t eaten either for about 2 years, I just ate some pecan halves and am actually ecstatic!....Both plates stayed in my mouth with none of the nuts getting under either denture!!!! Like I said, I haven&#x27;t eaten nuts, or anything else crunchy for that matter, in at least 2 years and I&#x27;m eating pecans again!!! I expect I will be using this product for as long as I have dentures!</li>
            <li> Always fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> Was hard to work together. First batch just oozed out of plate. Going to try 2nd batch with some help. Didn&#x27;t set up fast enough. More after 2nd attempt</li>
            <li> For now the only concern I have is that some of the material has pealed off the side of the denture. Applicatiin was easy and the directions clear and concise. As far as any smell or after taste I noticed a very slight chemical taste the first day. It wasn&#x27;t string or objectionable and it disappered within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was the statement that the user should see a dentist soon and have the dentures professionaly lined. In reading the information on the product I got the impressiin that this would not require any further action other than to reline them again when time and wear dictated. If I should really not continue to use this but should have a dental lab do them why buy this in the first place?</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product .... I was a cushion grip user and when it became discontinued I searched for a similar product . This product gets the job done and it&#x27;s super quick and simple to use .  There is not a lot of maintenance to it and you can quickly get on with your life .  Although , it holds dentures in and works great there is one drawback : it taste awful !!!!!  It stated to soak in baking soda but it only diminishes the taste a tiny bit .  I&#x27;ve gotten used to the taste now but it made me gag for several days .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you are searching for a temporary fix in between denture relines .  Wish they made it with a better taste  .</li>
            <li> worked ok until we seen the dentist</li>
            <li> It had a bad taste.  I soaked it in baking soda and water overnight and it did not help much.  I had to remove it after a couple of days because it made all food taste bad.</li>
            <li> It was ok in the beginning but it started coming apart after two eatings. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with it at all. I have been unemployed for almost 2 years and I bought it only because the over the counter items were costly and wasn&#x27;t what I could afford.</li>
            <li> This is for one box with 2 applications.  Not 2 boxes with 4 applications.  It&#x27;s good but too expensive.  The Walgreen brand denture reliner kit for $5.59 is just as good (if not better) than pro soft.  Pro soft lifts right out of my plastic temporary plates even after roughing them up with sandpaper.  Acryline 2 or the Walgreen brand does not lift.  It&#x27;s stickier.</li>
            <li> Great comfort.  No sore spots anymore.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t actually had the chance to use the product yet but I love it I am sure it will be fine</li>
            <li> it works and it works well. it is easy to use, watch a helpful video on utube before trying first time it will help you out. now the bad part. it tastes like you are chewing on a paint bucket. it says some people dont mind the taste, if you were made out of plastic and lost your since of taste in the war no problem. but it is rough and it lasts for a few days. soaking helps and so does breath mints, washing mouth with old sewer water and brushing teeth with draino would help too. the stuff is good and i would go threw taste again for the quality job it does.</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived fast. Does not taste good the first day but I was overall very pleased</li>
            <li> I am a new denture wearer. My gums have shrunk and shifted, leaving my first set extremely loose. I got a soft liner from my dentist that helped tremendously. Due to missing work and inconvenience of going at all, I searched to find a product similar to what they had used. The reviews were good here so I tried it. Comes with 2 applications, which could actually be broken down into four. Applied almost a month ago and it&#x27;s still holding strong. Provides a softer pallet and fills in gaps. This is not an adhesive. I still use a powder on top to assist in holding the plate in place. I will continue to use this product when my dentures feel loose. Beats going to the dentist!</li>
            <li> Good price, very good service, and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> These reliner kits are great compared to other liners that usually get rock hard after they set up on the dentures. Had to soak them several times because of the fact that they stay soft, they also hold the chemical smell and taste longer but it went away in a couple days. Now when I bite down, the liners actually feel that they are massaging my gums. Also, when I received them I only got 1 of the 2 boxes that I ordered. I sent the email to Amazon and they sent it to the supplier who apologized for the oversight and shipped it out that same day I received them in 2 days. No harm, no foul. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Does not adhere to adhesives very well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble !</li>
            <li> the taste is very unpleasant even after a month.  easy to use but doesnt seem to adhere very well. too bad</li>
            <li> I read all good reviews and decided to try it.  mixed &amp; applied fine, taste was really bad for a few days, even after doing baking soda soak.  One week later still getting real unpleasant aftertaste.  Would be 5 star if not for the taste</li>
            <li> awful didn&#x60;t last a week</li>
            <li> I use it to cushion my upper denture. It works fine until I can get to the denturist for a more permanent reline.</li>
            <li> A quick to use product, and although not quite as nasty tasting as another I have used, it still retains the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; a long time despite soaking in baking soda and water as instructed. The company does not tell you how to store the relined denture plate, either, to maintain the comfort.</li>
            <li> After taste lingers a little bit longer than I like</li>
            <li> Found this product to be very good. Easy to mix and apply. Left a taste for a couple of days then fine. No longer have the need for denture cream to keep them in place. This holds great without it.</li>
            <li> A great product that is very easy to use. This is an excellent product to make comfortably soft relines for dentures.</li>
            <li> the fit was good, but the taste was TERRIBLE, and lasted for weeks even after using baking soda.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply - came out as professionally as it would at the dentist! I&#x27;ll never pay the dentist to do my relines again. I love that I can reapply whenever I need to and adjust it at my own whim. It&#x27;s super easy, cheap and quick...definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Easy to do. There indeed is a slight after taste for a few days but no worse then the paste I have used to hold denture in. Overall experience is awesome. I will use again. While living in the bush of A&lt;br /&gt;Alaska is awesome getting denture care done is costly and they send your dentures away for weeks. So being able to help myself is important and now my lower plate does not rub or hurt me. I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother. It held for quite a while, one treatment was empty so used the other because she needed it right away</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It has made my life much better.  When you go out to dinner you want to be able to enjoy the food you buy.  This ProSoft denture Reliner has been a blessing for me.  The taste is not the greatest but if you do what they suggest it works out fine.  I will buy more of this when needed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, and it tastes awful</li>
            <li> worked great--they fit a lot better now--was very easy to use</li>
            <li> Product works if you will follow the directions and don&#x27;t bite to strong at first try. I gave it 4 stars because it came with packaging if plastic bag with no original box.</li>
            <li> It works great, chill it in the fridge for a few hours to slow down the working time. The cushion feel is nice</li>
            <li> I have dentures and others in my family, I do the relining for them also and this stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just as easy to use as they claim and a lot cheaper than having professional relining done.&lt;br /&gt;O wo;; buy it again, if I need it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a small, bottom partial \\&quot;flipper\\&quot;. I was really torn about whether to purchase ProSoft, Perma Soft or Acryline II. In the end, due to the reviews, I decided on ProSoft. Also, I emailed Permalabs and asked them the difference between ProSoft and Perma Soft. I received the following reply \\&quot;Perma Soft is a longer-lasting reliner and gets very firm.  ProSoft is softer and more flexible, but lasts around 6 months to a year instead of up to 2 years like Perma Soft\\&quot;. I was a little wary of the Perma Soft being too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product it was packaged ok and there were no leaks or spills. Since I received enough to do both a full top and bottom plate and only needed enough to do one small partial, I actually split one vial of the liquid and one container of the powder in two, which will give me enough to re-line them 4 times (although I hope to have my permanent partial at the beginning of the year). The splitting of the product equally was a little difficult, but doable. Once I split it and mixed it up, the process was relatively quick and easy. The taste wasn&#x27;t that bad, but I still opted to soak the relined partial in the baking soda/water mix and it worked out fine and has not bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been 4-5 days since I did this, but I must say the difference is amazing. My partial had become very loose and was requiring me to use the adhesive 4 or more times a day. I would not be able to even get through a snack or meal or a 4 hour shift at work without it becoming loose and having to reapply an adhesive. Since using ProSoft, I still have to use a little adhesive initially, but after that it lasts all day, through meals, talking on the phone at work, etc. All in all this product is well worth the money seeing how it costs less than $20 and I will be able to get 4 uses out of it. Of course, though, I cannot say how long it will last. If it does not last at least till the beginning of the year, I will update this review, but it is supposed to last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have also used Cushion Grip and this product is much better. ProSoft does squish out or change it&#x27;s shape once you set it up in the cold water.</li>
            <li> product is acceptable except it does not last as long as advertised</li>
            <li> Taste needs to be improved though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a family member. They are a little financially strapped at the moment, and this looked like a great temporary solution for their loosened dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came me in a box that looks as if it was printed on a home computer. The paper used isn&#x27;t even the right stock used in normal packages. The perforated folding lines were all wrong, and the ink lines are really messed up, too! MY RED FLAGS at first glance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bar code printed on the packaging, but the bar code association has no records of this product or the bar code number used on the box. It is not a registered bar code!!! There isn&#x27;t an ingredients list, or helpful company information, either! It looks like someone threw some stuff in a small box! I am wondering who...Hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents inside... an ice cream pop-cycle stick (not kidding), and two containers with unlabeled contents. The directions are a hand typed black and white carbon copied generic instruction sheet that is folded very sloppy with an 800 number and a P.O. Box address. These are NOT manufactures directions! Typed at home, and carbon copied!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one answers when you call the number, either. I have tried to contact them through Amazon, mail, and phone, and no response from any method tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not trust this product at all, and I do not recommend ANYONE putting this in their mouths since we have no idea what it is. For those of you who have...you are brave. After receiving this, I have decided to just help my family member and pay the $$$ for their realignment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone spending their hard earned money on this, or putting unidentifiable contents in your mouth!</li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time to get rid of the taste and it burns while it is curing.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this product years ago and it didn&#x27;t do that then.</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with, and they give you plenty to work with incase you mess up. I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with ill fitting dentures and can&#x27;t afford the dentist all the tme. I just have problems with my lower. And it takes me awhile before I can get them to a point that is comfortable for me to even eat with. So I will be ordering more again soon. I have&#x27;nt found anything else that works better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this is the best but it is very close.  Easy to mix and easy to use.  No heating tube  or trying to get the wax products trimmed correctly and then you have a crease.  It is just really easy to use.</li>
            <li> did not work, made dentures worse. would not recommend this product to a friend, does not hold up for any length 9f time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had dentures for 2 months and as gums heal they were coming undone when I ate. I was afraid to go out to eat in public with my friends. This product makes them fit much better while you are waiting for your gums to heal completely so you can get a hard reline at the dentist. So much better now. I still use the powder to be sure they stay in, but so much better than before.</li>
            <li> I think the problem some of you are having with your kits are the same as mine. My kit came with a the right amount of liquid in one, and I added it to the powder as directed - that liner came out perfectly. A consistency like honey, as directed. However, the second did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, they put a quarter of the amount of liquid in the second vial, so the powder didn&#x27;t cure properly, it came out like chunky gobs, I wouldn&#x27;t even go so far as to call it a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing their quality control is somewhat iffy, even if the product - when given the proper amounts of both ingredients - works properly.</li>
            <li> taste was so bad ,even after several attttemps to get rid of i had to throw the unused portion away and remove the applicatin freon the dentores</li>
            <li> I am impressed!!&lt;br /&gt;Your product was easy to use and works very very well!&lt;br /&gt;It gave me the fit of a profession reline.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that one would pay a small fortune for at the dentists office.  And without all the waiting and re-fittings.  Its easy and fast to do for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> It works ! Filled the denture to fit properly,,, The taste for the first day or so was annoying - but its fine  now ,,,&lt;br /&gt;So far it has set up and adhered to the denture and shows no sign of ever coming loose , TY ProSoft</li>
            <li> Its OK for a one day use I found other items that worked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other products that were horrible. This was what I needed. The directions were easy to follow and the result was great. I was expecting the horrid taste that I got from the other products, but there wasn&#x27;t any. Thank you! I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> The liner is soft as described, it was easy to apply. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the bitter aftertaste. It has been a month and I still taste bitterness. I did soak them in baking soda water, it helps a little.</li>
            <li> Everything is included in this package, instructions, and most importantly correct measures to mix, for a durable comfortable soft reline. This should be done as needed, sometimes every few months, as the gums tend to retract, and/or change shape, in time.&lt;br /&gt;It takes less than 10 minutes, from beginning to end, very convenient, and will save you a lot of money, spent for the dentist.</li>
            <li> So far, the best of the liquid reliners I&#x27;ve tried.  10 more words required.  Gosh I hate this format!  Darn</li>
            <li> was soft and sticky hard to handle compared to past purchases. just worked with it best i could. once i finished, it set good, it is  areally comphy fit, still comphyey  other hardened got irritations but simply used fine emery board to smooth it,  this last purchase is still soft can comfortable.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions like they said and Pro Soft worked perfectly.  I definitely would buy ProSoft from this company again.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and last several months.  It is well worth the price.  Be sure to follow the directions, cause I messed up the first time I used it.  JR</li>
            <li> This products works as promised.  It is easy to use and a very good value for the money.  I recommend/</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good and am sure when I use it again it will go more smoothly, now that I know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Did not do well for me.  Would not recommend it for the price and quality.  Its way overpriced.</li>
            <li> First tried PermaSoft, then this. In the future will pay the $10 extra for the Permasoft. While boxes and contents looked almost identical, the ProSoft did not harden as quickly. That made fitting sloppy with a poorer result.</li>
            <li> would purchase again product worked as described would recommend this purchase to a friend there where no problems associated with this purchase</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. My husband checked with his dentist and found out it would cost over $400.00 to get his dentures relined. I relined mine with Pro Soft and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I did it about 2 months ago and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li> I like it to some extent, because it&#x27;s soft and comfortable. Even after it has completely set it is rubbery and flexible. I left the remnants sitting in the mixing cup overnight to see how hard it would actually get if left to dry and set without being used. It never did get hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for something soft for someone who has tender guns and mouth, this is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I like to eat nuts, granola, popcorn and such, so I  regret it every time I buy this instead of PermaSoft. They look the same, the instructions are different and I&#x27;m sure the chemical ingredients are similar but not the same, or not in the same ratios. Whatever, I&#x27;ve got some PrSoft in my bathroom cabinet and I&#x27;m here to order PermaSoft so I can eat what I want over Christmas without worrying about getting grit stuck in the soft lining material of my dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate having to get new dentures - got ripped of the last time. But it&#x27;s in my near future. :(</li>
            <li> I used it for my lower denture and it works wonders.  Had a problem with food hurting under my denture and now I can eat with no worry.  It is well worth the money. A dentist wants $250 or more to reline my lower teeth, and that is for a soft reline. I&#x27;m buy more, just to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I used to use the other soft liner that was taken off the market.  In my opinion, this one is much better.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Since Cushion Ease went off the market, have been searching everywhere for a viable substitute and this is it!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked well for me.</li>
            <li> it was easy to use and works great ... i would recommend this to everyone.. price was not so great but had to have it</li>
            <li> The after taste doesn&#x27;t go away for days, I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Very good product and quick shipping.  It has made my denture usable again.</li>
            <li> Was easy to use but did not perform as well as I had hoped</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if they could change the taste, the backing soda didn&#x27;t doo it too well. The seller was great , and the product came on time, it mixed nicely , and has done a great job</li>
            <li> I never know what to write about perma lab products. They provide one of the very best products for relining dentures at home.  But the product seems to be very inconsistent.  I will get one that will not set up right and has a awful taste that just will not go away for months!  And then I will get one that sets up perfectly and the bad taste and odor goes away in a day.  I am guessing that is why there are so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like what my dentist used.</li>
            <li> Works Great better than expected just mix and pour</li>
            <li> I have had my dentures for nearly 4 years now. I have never had a reline done and knew nothing of soft liners until a few months ago. My husband got dentures and about a month later they were loose and not fitting well. When he went back the dentist put in a soft liner. Now they fit great and no more pressure points. Now I was jealous. My denture don&#x27;t fit badly but they are not the worlds most comfortable things either. They wanted $150 to do one on mine and I&#x27;m a cheapskate so that wasn&#x27;t happening. Instead I came straight home and hit Amazon and found this little box of wonderful. I read all the reviews and ordered it thinking if it worked great if it failed at least I&#x27;d only be out $20 bucks. It came in today and I immediately used it following the instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my lower first as it is the worst fit. Despite everything I have read in the reviews I got a little impatient and did not let it thicken enough before placing it in my lower denture. When I put it in my mouth and bit down nearly all the liner goo squeezed out. So I will be ordering again to fix that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the way my lowers turned out I was more patient with the uppers and let the goo get good and thick before pouring it into the teeth and putting it in my mouth. Now you need to know my upper teeth fit great before using this, no shifting no pinching or slipping. I did however frequently have tender spots on my gums from the constant pressure of hard plastic against soft tissue. Once the goo was in set and trimmed I popped those baby&#x27;s back in and WOW! they are a million times more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say much on how longer the liner lasts yet but I will update again when I can.</li>
            <li> This is the second time we have purchased this product and it is awesome. Way better then paying the money for a re-liner at the dentist.</li>
            <li> prosoft worked great  for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.beats paying a denturist $200.00 for ea relining .then you have to go back so they can grind it out because of the sore spots. with prosoft you don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, pretty nasty taste but the baking soda and water soak seems to have taken care of that. I definitely would suggest it to any new denture wearer as their gums and bones change. Worked like a charm for me allowing me to gradually eat more and more solid foods.My only advice to the ProSoft folks would be to get the product shipped quicker, seemed like a long time to get a small pkg. from oh. to n.c.</li>
            <li> I greatly regret this purchase. The better you put it in, the harder it is to get it out. The taste is unforgivably bad. I&#x27;ve worn dentures for over 40 years and relined them several times.  Never the awful experience this has been. Soaking in baking soda does not help at all.</li>
            <li> Good idea but do not work well on partials and the edges curl up on dentures.  I was disappointed!  Do you have another product that works better?</li>
            <li> Not that I like wearing dentures but like is as it is. Due to dislike of&lt;br /&gt;Going to dentist I am a DIY person , this product is great, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and you will be satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> Easy directions, easy to use, no bad aftertaste or smell. Not quite as soft as a reline I had done at the dentist once, but not bad either. Recommended.</li>
            <li> May be good for some, but for the application that it was used for..wasn&#x27;t quite right. Was easy to apply &amp; set-up.</li>
            <li> Very good but for the taste.  Baking soda and water does not take away the bitter taste. I would recomend</li>
            <li> Even though my husband had no trouble putting the liner in, and no complaints on taste, It did not help, but gummed up. The denture had to be redone by the dentist.</li>
            <li> does good. save me some more.</li>
            <li> My initial thought was that this did indeed have a pungent odor. However, it has lived up to it&#x27;s claim...so far!</li>
            <li> Yes, it tastes bad.  But it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very easy to use. I was amazed.😃😃😃😃</li>
            <li> The liner itself worked great, but it smelled and tasted was so bad I had to remove it after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I damaged my $6,000 dentures while using a razor blade to get this stuff off of them! It hardens like cement after it&#x27;s been in there awhile, unlike Perma Soft which peels off when you&#x27;re ready to reline. I will NEVER buy this stuff again!</li>
            <li> This product worked great.  A little messy but did a fine job once you got the right amount in the plate and held about as many days as it advertised.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed. Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement in the fit and actually feel like the denture is in worse shape after a month.</li>
            <li> I liked how soft it was but the taste is aweful and I couldn&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Hands down, its the easiest to use, non-clumping, longest lasting commercial liner on the planet. I only buy the drug store reliner in emergencies.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use but was a little too soft for my liking.  Also the foul taste never went away.  I had to take it out and reline with my normal product after several days of being unable to taste anything but the mix.  I will stick with Perma Soft....the taste goes away in a couple of days with it.</li>
            <li> This product is better than the D.O.C Reline-It, because it keeps soft.I bought it for my father and he liked it.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use and worked very well on the uppers. My lowers need replaced and it did not work well at all on those, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the ProSoft.</li>
            <li> i found it impossible to use and it didn&#x27;t work,  nothing else much to say except to do the required words</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this stuff long ago. Best thing that has happened with my dentures since getting them. I purchased this in Sept 2013 and used it about a week later. It was VERY easy. Don&#x27;t mix the stuff for too long, it needs to be like runny honey in order to spread out on the denture easily. After I put it in my mouth for the impression, I followed the advice of others and soaked it in a little bowl of water with a good bit of baking soda for about 30 mins to help counteract any chemical taste. After the soak I trimmed it with a box cutter type of knife and viola! The best fit in ages. I noticed a slight chemical taste/smell briefly (much less than when my dentist did a soft line for me). Once it was in place the only time I ever noticed a bit of chemical taste was momentarily when I took it out to clean it. I sleep with my denture in since I only have an upper and stab myself with my bottom teeth if I don&#x27;t. So, I rarely noticed it and of course, after a while there is no chemical taste. The fit is superb. I will never go without having some of this stuff always on hand. I am just now feeling a bit of a need to maybe remove this liner and put a new one in because my gums have shrunk a bit more and it just this week has gotten a tad loose when I bit into something hard. Anyway, I purchased 2 and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this particular product and am very happy with the results.  The Reliners from the store seem to harden, and end up being very uncomfortable.  Of course the Drug Store prices will vary but I believe this may be about twice the price of other OTC brands but for me it is worth it. I will stay with ProSoft because of the comfort. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because there is still the after taste, although, not as bad as Perma Soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Followed directions &amp; the product worked just as promised.  Have recommended the product to others.</li>
            <li> ...the chemical taste which persists and my rookie mistakes the system works well so far. When mixing the two elements of the kit together I found the cup supplied was rather small and the mixing paddle supplied a bit too large causing me to spill a bit over the sides. I was in too much of a hurry causing the mixture to set up later than was optimum. This is why I bought two kits; to correct my mistakes next time. Over all the product does as advertised and I feel I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth. I left a call back/email from the manufacturer concerning whether or not I can soak my dentures in any cleaning pills, but have not heard anything in a month. So much for customer service.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and result was good.  I no longer have to use goo to keep the uppers in place.</li>
            <li> Have tried several similar products.This product meets all my needs. Stay soft and works well! Nothing beats this reliner! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered ProSoft to try because I need a soft liner for comfort.  Less than 3 weeks ago I paid $60.00 to have the dentist do a soft reline for me.  It was supposed to last 3-4 months but it didn&#x27;t even last a month.  I decided to try a home reline kit.  After reading all of the reviews ProSoft seemed to be the reline kit of choice so I ordered a kit.  Once I received it I read the instructions and did exactly as it said.  I first did my upper denture.  When it was done and cured in cold water I put my upper denture back in my mouth and then mixed the second vial and did my lowers.  I had no problems with mixing the solutions.  It worked just like it was supposed to.  My dentures are now comfortable and perfectly realigned.  The solution did leave a bad taste so I soaked them in baking soda per the instructions and it eliminated the problem.  Some who wrote reviews said that this product didn&#x27;t work for them.  I had no problems what so ever.  The kit was enough to do both dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I suggest is that when you are trimming off the excess with a knife be careful near the back of your dentures.  If you aren&#x27;t really careful the knife will take off too much and lift the liner from the denture.  This happened to me but I pushed the liner back down onto the denture and put it back in the cold water to finish curing.  I will be more careful next time.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last but I am guessing it will last at least as long as the reline that was done by the dentist, it costs less, and the fit is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  It is well worth the money.  My dentures feel great!  I highly recommend and I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Below is my initial review of this product. Now that I have used it once again, I have some advice you might find helpful. To maximize the benefit of this great product when the instructions tell you to bite down and hold it for 3 minutes, I know of no one who can hold their mouth still for three minutes, and just the slight movement will create gaps and pockets which deter from the fit. When you bite down, don&#x27;t chomp hard, but bite slowly until it feels comfortable and then after three or four seconds, relax your jaw. By doing that you will not be doing any gum wiggling and the fit will be even better. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first time using this re-liner. It is, however, my first time ordering it through Amazon, which I will continue to do as the price is better and it arrived faster. As to the re-liner kits, this company discovered the perfect balance between soft and comfortable yet hard enough to last. Follow the directions to the letter, and don&#x27;t bite down too soon or too fast, just slow pressure until you achieve a full on bite, then hold it firm and do not let up until the proper time has passed; otherwise your dentures will be extremely comfortable but won&#x27;t stay in very well. I say this as the stuff is so soft, it can make you think you&#x27;re biting all of it out when your bite is firm. Hope your experience is as good as mine have been with this company.</li>
            <li> This is the best Reliner out there!!  I couldn&#x27;t eat without this product.</li>
            <li> It was a very weak repair and did not work at all. Very dissatisfied and would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> i really like the pro soft, it iavery comfortable and last a long time and ir never gets hard. i dont like the Perma Soft becaus it is to hard and uncomfortable it gets really hard and if you try to smooth it it tears it up so i dont like it but i hope you continue to carry the pro soft,it is comfortabl andnever gets really hard.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;GF</li>
            <li> Works really well!  Holds up for a really long time and isn&#x27;t&#x27; hard to use.  Set up time is not as short as some, making it easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I luv this stuff. Dentures never felt or fit better. Easy to apply</li>
            <li> I just reordered this product.  Really works well as intended.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!! It is great, easy to use and very soft. I recommend it to people. Great service</li>
            <li> I will say I was a little doubtful about this product but that was before I tried it. I thought about paying $100.00 more dollars to have my plate lined again and having to go without my denture. I thought what the heck, I do not have that much to lose so I ordered the PROSOFT. It worked great. My denture is tight and I have a good fit and I am not out of a hundred dollars. It has only been a few months but so far I have no  problems with the product and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> For all I know, both Perma Soft and ProSoft may be the same product, but both of them work well as a denture reliner, but the solvent used tastes really awful, and lingers for days.  I&#x27;ve moved over to EZO cushions, which are much less expensive, and have no taste at all.  We&#x27;ll see how they work over time.</li>
            <li> If you have dentures and need a quick fix for short term use this is the go to product for me. I have had an occasional need to use this reliner for temporarty solutions and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> ist time it did not last one week ill have to try it again the i will let you know .</li>
            <li> Made my dentures fit better and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I can eat with my dentures in again! And no pain!  (I should have ordered two kits to start as I didn&#x27;t do the bottom perfect the first time.)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve yet to find any other product that comes close, it&#x27;s simple and effective. I do find that I&#x27;m having to do it more often (monthly) as it either becomes too hard or it becomes discolored (I&#x27;m a smoker so this is understandable). I try to catch it when they&#x27;ve got special deals going on...that is, like I said, until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I have a problem mouth due to maxillo facial surgeries that did not turn out as they should have.  and now through the years I have lost all the ridge for my upper denture to adhere to. I cannot have the denture fit too snugly as I have to have room for the Poligrip to make a surface of adherence.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold like advertized</li>
            <li> About the best home remedy there is.</li>
            <li> I do like this liner a little spendy but you don&#x27;t need much and it does work. Dentures, well if you have them and they don&#x27;t fit well, as in my case, one little sore spot can curtail chewing, so if you have ill fitting dentures this works. Not a glue and it is a 2 part liquid/power you mix together but it feels soooo good to have that sore spot go away and you don&#x27;t have make a denist appt.  It does&#x27;t last forever but a good amount of time before you have to remove the old and put in some new. Wish they made an instant facelift this easy and no pain. Read the directions and you&#x27;ll feel better soon, It might take you a while to figure out just how much to use of each ingrediant but its not much (as they say less is more) a little powder and a little fluid (the hardner) goes a long way and get a tiny eye droper the fluid is I guess oily like and it does run down the side of the bottle.(Don&#x27;t want to loose the fluid to a tissue better in the powder or the bottle) Waste not want not!  I did mine about 4 days ago and the comfort is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Pain to use - did not like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Will not ever buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Do not suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I found this when doing a search for another item. I like this much better. I am home bound so being able to fit my dentures myself is absolutely wonderful. I can now eat again. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> mixed well but still has a taste three weeks later</li>
            <li> Provides a fit as good or better than most professional relines I have had at a cost hundreds of dollars less. It takes less than 15 minutes with little clean up.  It is also important to me there is little or no after taste.</li>
            <li> works very well.  will order again.</li>
            <li> Prosoft reliner was great . like your product well .</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again. It was very easy to use. Great results, Better and much easier to use than I had expected</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how this has made my dentures fit and feel. No longer the constant pain while chewing. I tried the cheaper reliner from the drug store but it was too hard. This is soft- exactly what I needed! I had to redo the bottoms in a few weeks but that was my fault. I trimmed off too much of the excess after the cold water soak. Now my uppers and lowers are doing great. Well worth the money.  Can&#x27;t thank Perma Labs enough!</li>
            <li> Simply didn&#x27;t work well. It was applied correctly but it just didn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> This is the best reliner for dentures that I have found yet! The price on Amazon makes it affordable  to purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to hold me over until I get my permanent dentures. My immediates were so loose that they just fell right out without using Seabond wafers and adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received my order for one kit, I realized that instead of an instruction sheet, there was just a blank sheet of paper folded up in the box. I also felt like the box looked a little funny. Nothing wrong but just off. I was upset about this - as I really needed to use the product right away, but knew that I needed directions, and was weary of the packaging. I emailed the seller, and they got back to me that same day. She explained that Perma Labs is a small family owned company which processes and packages all of their product themselves. She apologized over and over about the missing instructions, and then priority shipped me two boxes for my trouble! I was beyond satisfied with the customer service that I received.&lt;br /&gt;Now - the product. I got to do my reline, and I can not say enough good things about this kit! It was very easy to use. Stir, pour, bite down, trim. That&#x27;s it. I would suggest taping down a piece of wax paper over your work surface, as you will most likely spill some. Also, don&#x27;t be in a hurry to pour the mixture into the denture. It takes a good minute or more for it to thicken to the consistency of honey. I even let mine get a tiny bit thicker when I did the second debture and it took a much better impression - and less oozing out. The taste is not unbearable. I did do the suggested soak in baking soda and water for 20 minutes. It helped, and what little taste was left went away the following day. It&#x27;s been 3 months since my extractions, and the one thing I still could never do was bite into things with my front teeth. I can do that now! In fact, I can eat anything, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about adhesive or wafers anymore! I even ate Cheetos today! I would recommend this product to anyone having issues with loose or rocking dentures. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again.  It is not even close to being soft &amp; you can buy it in the store&#x27;s for half the price</li>
            <li> This works great and looks great.  There is an unpleasant taste for a couple of days but then it goes away.  I was really surprised how well it worked.  I mixed it up as directed with no issues.  You really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there because the color blends with the denture.  I paid to have mine hard lined and I swear they did nothing to help.  This stuff worked perfectly.  I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worked exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> VERY EASY TO USE &amp; FEELS GREAT</li>
            <li> a lot of trouble for very little. it tastes pretty bad, didnt line dentures well and lasted only a few days. i am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but then decided to try this particular product. After trying this product I am impressed as to how soft and comfortable my dentures know fit and feel. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that there could have been a little bit more material giving in order to completely fill the upper plate. Also trying to mix the mixture in those small cups was a pain because it was hard to tell when the material be came the consistency of honey. However overall I am very impressed with this product. We will see how long they last though, but I will purchase this product again if I have to realign my dentures again in the future.</li>
            <li> i like it however they advertise 2 relines and it took both containers to just do the top denture. The good news is it&#x27;s a much better reline than what I got from the dentist. I now have good suction on the top denture.</li>
            <li> So, I tried my own reline for the first time and want to share my experience. I bought this ProSoft reliner kit for my full lower denture. It is an \\&quot;immediate\\&quot; type denture, which I started using after my lower teeth were extracted six weeks ago. The package I bought was enough for two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very quickly, direct from the manufacturer, in a padded envelope with all the things I needed in a small box. The directions were very easy to follow. The solution set up smoothly, and actually a little more quickly than I thought it would. The picture on the package shows the product being poured onto the denture, but the mixture is not that runny. So that stir stick also was handy for scooping and smearing. But overall, once the solution was in the groove of the denture, it distributed quite smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is were I made a bit of a mistake! To me, it looked like there was way TOO MUCH liquid, so I panicked and scooped some back out! I was afraid that I would be stuck with a goopy mess that I&#x27;d never be able to fix! Then, I continued with the rest of the procedure. Well, I should have stayed the course, because clean up was a cinch. After the setting time, most of the excess material was removed with just my finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, because I removed some of the mixture, I left a open gap toward the front of my denture. For the next couple days, I&#x27;ll try using a spot of adhesive in the front and see how that works out. But the backs of my dentures are so cushiony comfortable now!!! I can bite down with no discomfort! If that gap in the front is bothersome, I will use the second half of the kit to redo. This kit is well worth the price just for the comfort alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update later about how this works in conjunction with the adhesive in about a week.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  First, the fit didn&#x27;t last a day. The material shrank and left my bottom denture loose once again. Second, the chemical had a rancid taste that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. It made me loose my appetite and left me feeling nausea.  Third, it was extremely difficult to remove the material from the denture. There is still some of the residual stuck to my denture. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this for my husband and he likes it better than any other similar product he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on reline kits, trying to find the right one. Some of them became hard as a rock within a few days, others had caustic chemicals that burned my gums badly. This product is gentle, easy to use, very minimal in terms of chemical odor, taste, irritation and it stays soft enough to be gentle. If you are a denture wearer, then you know how little it takes to create a nasty irritation on the gums. This got rid of a whole lot of that. It was better than my last professional hard reline.</li>
            <li> takes a little practice but works well. will purchase again and tell a friend it is a good product and advise them to try it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had occasion to use this product yet, but after looking it over, I&#x27;m fairly certain that it will work as well as the Coe-Soft (which is no longer available) did.  When I ordered it, it seemed to be the next best option from what is available.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rate a product until I have used it. I am a long time Cushion Grip user and when they quite making it, I was lost. I went searching. This package contains two applications. The directions are a bit sketchy, but you can work your way through them. If you were a former Cushion Grip user, you will know when it is right. I mixed per directions, waited until it was thick (thicker than the honey called for in the directions) spread in my denture, leveled with the stir stick provided, ran under cold water for about 2 minutes, then popped in my mouth for the 3 minutes. Took out and continued to cure in the cup of cold water for 3 minutes. Since I had waited for the mixture to cure a bit longer before putting in my mouth, I was able to do any clean up prior to this step. After the last cure time, I put in my mouth and IT WAS MY OLD CUSHION GRIP all over again! The taste is nothing, so don&#x27;t worry about what it says about taste (I was concerned at first). I have worn the denture with the new lining for a couple of days and it works great. If you are looking for something that works like your old Cushion Grip..This is it!</li>
            <li> easy to use sticks to plate very well would buy it again</li>
            <li> this stuff really is good!!!</li>
            <li> I was grateful when I received the Pro Soft. My mouth was extremely sore. My Husband mixed it together for me &amp; I have been smiling ever since. I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> New haven&#x27;t had to use it as of yet.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a game changer when it comes to getting your dentures to fit more comfortably. My &#x27;trial&#x27; with dentures has been a long drawn out process lasting more than 4 years. I went through the temporary denture phase then got my permanent dentures. They didn&#x27;t fit from the beginning &amp; I used this product until I could see the dentist again. My upper dentures were so ill fitting I was given new ones at no cost, however that led to my lower dentures not fitting since they were molded to fit the first upper plates. After struggling with them for over 6 months and stil not being able to bite into a sandwich because the bite was so &#x27;off&#x27; I went back to the dentist. They wanted $475 to reline them but I insisted n new lowers because I felt they would still impede my ability to eat &#x27;real&#x27; food without cutting it up into small pieces. Even though adjustments always need to be made with new dentures to prevent sore places the dentist seemed impatient with me when I would tell him I needed him to do so. After my second visit where he rushed through the adjustments, not even marking where I told him I was having pain, I ended up leaving with my mouth hurting more than before I went to correct the problem. Since I all ready knew about Prosoft I told my daughter I was never going back &amp; would take care of the problem myself. I came home, ordered prosoft and am now able to eat with a snugger fit and less pain. My sister was going through the same need of needing her dentures relined and was given a price of $600. I told her about Prosoft which she promptly bought. It DOES have a horrible, chemical taste in the beginning but I put them in baking soda overnight as someone recomended and it takes care of that issue. My sister ordered another kit to have on hand in the event she needs it again and can have no delay. Since I only needed to reline my lower plates I only use half the kit but the moment I use the other vial I will order another kit to have on hand. If this was not available I don&#x27;t believe I would be able to wear my dentures without being in pain the entire time so it has changed my life for the better. I whole heartedly recommend this product for anyone with loose dentures or dentures that are painful. It does stress me since I have to turn the denture upside down to get it in my mouth so I have to watch closely to get the product the right consistency. As others have said, thick honey and it changes quickly from that consistency to being too thick to get a good impression but I&#x27;ve managed to be successful and not waste any product. I like the fact that it has a soft feel and have had no problem with it not adhering to my denture but if it happens it takes 10 minutes and you&#x27;re back to having snug fitting dentures. I was happy to know I had this product to rely on as well as helping my sister so there are now two happy women with dentures that stay in place and aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> would and will buy this again</li>
            <li> I thought it was easy and great</li>
            <li> the said two years Ha!! lucky to get two weeks.  It also eroded after a brief period of time leaving a very thin lining for the last week  (if I got two weeks out of it)</li>
            <li> This product tastes terrible; doesn&#x27;t do as advertised though can reline denture doesn&#x27;t stay on long and flakes in mouth.  Makes me cough and gag from the smell and taste.</li>
            <li> I hate it very much. It didnt work very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent works great and lasts forever! Super quick shippers. Was very easy to use,and made my dentures fit prefectly!!!Thanks SO much</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use so as to save money on relining.  Just following the instructors.  Did have a small amount of taste for a few days but not enough to be a bother.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and ProSoft works the best so far. Taste isnt offensive and it lasts longer than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I haven &#x27;t tried this liner yet.  If you remember, I purchased several and want to try them all out.</li>
            <li> works very well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Product was very easy to use and worked as instructed.  You will still have to have a professional reline done, but works well for a temporary reline.</li>
            <li> It worked well and after a year I thought I&#x27;d better remove the old and add a new application. I thought I&#x27;d removed all of the old material but the new batch did not cover places that showed up a different color after I applied it. I am bummed out and trying to clean this out so what do I do to totally remove the old so I can reapply it? Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProSoft is anyone there that can  help?</li>
            <li> works perfectly, always keep more on hand just in case I need it, and the price is great. Yes, its recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that your dentist will use for your &amp;#34;tissue conditioner&amp;#34; and charge you $300.00 for.  I used to buy it over the counter at my neighborhood drug store but they quit selling it retail.</li>
