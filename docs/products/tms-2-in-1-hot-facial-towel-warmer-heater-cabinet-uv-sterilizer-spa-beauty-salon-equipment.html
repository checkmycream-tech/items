            <li>My clients love the warm towels!</li>
            <li>some do as they warm up.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made haven;t used it to warm towels yet</li>
            <li>I am, so far, very impressed.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply put together rust color coming out of sides of unit makes me feel like it was already used..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews before purchasing a towel warmer.</li>
            <li>For the price it was ok.</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to move.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing heats up fast and keeps the towels warm.</li>
            <li>Enjoying it so very much!!</li>
            <li>Great price compact and heats super fast which is important in my aesthetic business.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyway,I have it packaged and ready to return for a full refund; surprisingly with no hassle from the business.</li>
            <li>exactly how it was described and we love it.</li>
            <li>so when its needed I need it to heat and sanitiize quickly and accurately.</li>
            <li>Everything was working fine the first time I turned it on.</li>
            <li>Keeps your towels VERY hot.</li>
            <li>WOW, I love these.</li>
            <li>This hot towel warmer burns my hot towels and males them smell like burnt towels</li>
            <li>It works that&#x27;s way too hot</li>
            <li>The hot towel warmer that I received, was not working well.</li>
            <li>The hot towel warmer had gotten the towels too hot and burned them and was burning the inside rubber off the door.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Nice and big, will hold a lot of towels and will last me a full day at work.</li>
            <li>Works well at getting the towels hot and fast.</li>
            <li>But after much thought, I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>Then a second time, I smelt burning and noticed the UV light wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>Builds up too much condensation and takes coils forever to heat up.</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way, I bought a dozen towels and it will hold all of that and probably a little more.</li>
            <li>As for any smells, all new products have some smell but it was not noticeable and it didn&#x27;t transfer to the towels.</li>
            <li>I turned it on, rolled up some wet, rung out micro fiber towels (purchased from Amazon), and within 15 minutes they were very hot.</li>
            <li>Then I thought I&#x27;d try to replace the bulb with the extra one they gave me and turns out the entire circuit board is covered in grease and burnt it to a crisp when I plugged it in.</li>
            <li>After my client leaves I open the door and turn it back on to keep towels hot.</li>
            <li>We dont use it often so generally don&#x27;t have it on all day</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the strong smoky odor that emitts from the device.</li>
            <li>Works well - heats up towels much faster then expected with a bonus of low price.</li>

            <li> This hot towel warmer burns my hot towels and males them smell like burnt towels.. I&#x27;m afraid the unit will catch on fire because of how hot the unit gets... Can&#x27;t control heat setting... Very cheaply put together rust color coming out of sides of unit makes me feel like it was already used.. I&#x27;m not picky... But this unit is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews before purchasing a towel warmer. They all seem to have their share of pros and cons. But after much thought, I purchased this one. I am, so far, very impressed. I turned it on, rolled up some wet, rung out micro fiber towels (purchased from Amazon), and within 15 minutes they were very hot. As for any smells, all new products have some smell but it was not noticeable and it didn&#x27;t transfer to the towels. So, all in all, I am very glad I chose this warmer. Oh and by the way, I bought a dozen towels and it will hold all of that and probably a little more.</li>

            <li> awesome, heat up towels very quickly</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Everything was working fine the first time I turned it on. Then a second time, I smelt burning and noticed the UV light wasn&#x27;t working. I tried a different outlet but still nothing. Then I thought I&#x27;d try to replace the bulb with the extra one they gave me and turns out the entire circuit board is covered in grease and burnt it to a crisp when I plugged it in. The box definitely should have said &amp;#34;handle with care&amp;#34; on it. Anyway,I have it packaged and ready to return for a full refund; surprisingly with no hassle from the business. I unfortunately have to buy another one--but do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well at getting the towels hot and fast. My only complaint is the strong smoky odor that emitts from the device. I turn it off during massages to keep it from building up in the room. After my client leaves I open the door and turn it back on to keep towels hot.</li>
            <li> exactly how it was described and we love it.</li>
            <li> My clients love the warm towels!</li>
            <li> Good quality, perfect size,very useful for my job.</li>
            <li> It works great but how do I get rid of the burning smell?</li>
            <li> Works perfect love this purchase</li>
            <li> Works well - heats up towels much faster then expected with a bonus of low price.</li>
            <li> It works that&#x27;s way too hot and there&#x27;s no function to change the heat</li>
            <li> I got it in time. Great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! Great size for our counter top, doesn&#x27;t smell upon turning on like some do as they warm up. Works beautifully!</li>
            <li> The hot towel warmer that I received, was not working well. The hot towel warmer had gotten the towels too hot and burned them and was burning the inside rubber off the door. Purchase this towel warmer on June 9th 2015, and received it June 18th 2015. And now the towel warmer no longer works. It has barley hit a&lt;br /&gt;Month and the towel warmer no longer works very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this warmer makes every towel smell like it&#x27;s burning. The entire machine smells and we&#x27;ve only just plugged it in for one day. Not worth the price if it makes everything smell horrible. Clients unhappy with a towel that smells burned.</li>
            <li> Great price compact and heats super fast which is important in my aesthetic business. We dont use it often so generally don&#x27;t have it on all day so when its needed I need it to heat and sanitiize quickly and accurately. Simple set up instructions are also helpful.</li>
            <li> Perfecttt as it supposed to</li>
            <li> Builds up too much condensation and takes coils forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made haven;t used it to warm towels yet but I have two of them now!</li>
            <li> Keeps your towels VERY hot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  amazing! thanks!</li>
            <li> WOW, I love these. Very light and easy to move. Heats up very quickly. Nice and big, will hold a lot of towels and will last me a full day at work.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing heats up fast and keeps the towels warm.</li>
            <li> Bought this item and it kept blowing my breaker into salon. I never received and compensation or another warmer for replacement. Very dissatisfied:(</li>
