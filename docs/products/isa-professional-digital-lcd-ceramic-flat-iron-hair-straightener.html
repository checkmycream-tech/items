            <li>Awesome..nice and hot, excellent</li>
            <li>Omg, I love how my hair feels when its straightened now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this straightener!  </li>
            <li>love the 10 foot power cord!</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>She love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>The ISA heats up very quickly and has worked great for all hair types that we have come across in the salon.</li>
            <li>A pleasant surprise for her, and for me as well. :)</li>
            <li>This is great, but you will notice that during use, it&#x27;s easy to hit the buttons and change the temp.</li>
            <li>I ran a quick brush through my hair and was good to go!</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing straightener.</li>
            <li>She did an amazingly meticulous job, which took about 45 minutes, which is about what it takes to straighten my hair, even with an iron with a plate twice the size of this one.  </li>
            <li>I was sent this straightener, for free, to review on my blog and it is great.</li>
            <li>And the ability to curl my hair is a nice bonus to refresh the curls at the end of the day to go out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own to prevent burning anything around.</li>
            <li>This has nice features like adjusting the temp setting and a swivel cord to help with straightening.  </li>
            <li>As I am straightening my hair I keep pressing them, it is kind of unavoidable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a straightener that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice temp control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like if a gun had the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; feature turned on and off by pulling the trigger; basically defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they kindly gave me the refund</li>
            <li>I find that the best place to hold the iron is right on top of the temp display where it shows the degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LCD display is a very good feature of this iron and the temperature sets up very fast.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always on the look out for an affordable yet very effective flat iron and this one works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Welll, I got so many compliments and so many people said it looked like I was luminous and bright looking</li>
            <li>iron itself is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love, love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li>Best straightener for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>the product is so great  and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smooth and beautiful on the very first try.</li>
            <li>so no straightening but, to their delight an joy, curling was extremely quick and easy with the tool reaching the desired temperature within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sleek and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so nice and its easy to manage.</li>
            <li>The fact that it came with a 2 year warranty is just a cherry on top.</li>
            <li>[yes, I like to be sure about whatever I invest my money on]</li>
            <li>This is surely gonna be of great use to you if you prefer your hair spooky straight...</li>
            <li>Lovely hair straightener, I used this straightener almost every twice a week for work</li>
            <li>At over $100 I expect it to work better than a $50 straightener I bought at Target.</li>
            <li>Better than all others I have tried.</li>
            <li>hear that unlike metal or ceramic-coated plates, the tourmaline ceramic plates transfers heat faster and more evenly.</li>
            <li>Putting the controls on top means that every time you do a pass of the iron on your hair you hit the power button.</li>
            <li>I love, love this hair straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the display shows the temperature realtime as you raise it or lower it.</li>
            <li>I have thinner, curlier hair on top and almost wavy, thicker hair closest to the neck</li>
            <li>so she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once.  </li>
            <li>The digital temperature control is awesome.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to lock the buttons once it reaches your desired heat level.</li>
            <li>There is actually more info about the product and usage on the Amazon product page!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how I can control the temperature –</li>
            <li>The LED panel allows me to better control the temperature.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is okay.</li>
            <li>So glad I waited.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I keep hitting them, then have to check to make sure I locked it.</li>
            <li>The humidity does a great deal of damage to my hair and makes it very frizzy.</li>
            <li>For even better results if suggest ARGON OIL which I also relieved from their brand</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a way to switch it to Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Most are two separate \\&quot;tongs\\&quot;, but this on has one on a swivel that pinches.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that she was able to &amp;#34;flatiron&amp;#34; my hair into curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>many, many times.</li>
            <li>im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>so that most of the time she used bands in her hair.</li>
            <li>But now she can makes her hair unbound just because of this lovely product.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was time to invest in a more quality product</li>
            <li>The on/off switch was is on top where I held it to use and would turn off even with the lock on.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that, having a connection with the vendor and them sending me more information before hand to prepare me to what I will be receiving in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Very nice fast heating &amp; LOVE</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m not one for spending close to $100 on a flat iron but my best friend recommended it and after using hers I had to have it!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Not the best flat iron for the money.</li>
            <li>Lets start off by saying these are the best flat irons I have ever owned.</li>

            <li>Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>Now I am very happy with my Babyliss flat iron again.......</li>
            <li>Very fast heat and does a great job taking all curl out and making my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>(think classic car) handle is a joy to look at.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to obtain the perfect temperature when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>Straighter works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The handles are lengthy and I love the fact that it can be used (easily) with either hand.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more smooth and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>Very nice, smooth glide, fast heat up.</li>
            <li>Kept pressing the temperature setting buttons as it is placed in the area where it is most comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the feel of this tourmaline hair straightener.</li>
            <li>WOW, does this thing work great.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It also has some unique features that make styling your hair easier and more</li>

            <li>no tangle cord, which makes it easy when you are moving around in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Curls are bouncy and easy to do just by turning the wrist.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite wavy, but easily damaged.  </li>
            <li>This coating can chip off easily and damage hair as it glides over the chipped areas.</li>
            <li>The liquid crystal display is easy to read and the controls are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to grasp</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds</li>
            <li>/&gt;Locking the heat is easy (press the power button twice), but your hands still hit the buttons.</li>
            <li>very very quickly and no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is still kicking strong.</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s amazing for your hair, but didn&#x27;t come with the hot chick 🐥.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent quality straightener, especially for such a good price.</li>
            <li>used the iron on my own hair and two friends the first day I got it.</li>

            <li>I was looking for a new hair straightener and this one looked really good to me.</li>
            <li>Always accurate and easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this product was priced around $40 it would be fine.</li>
            <li>She uses it to flatten or straighten her hair and it does a wonderful job in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>so the thumb touching does not change the temp, but you still hear the beep each time you hit it and hitting it twice in quick succession unlocks the keys.</li>
            <li>own hair slid easily through the plates and came out straight and smooth and glossy.</li>

            <li>You could already tell it was miles ahead of the cheap ones I had bought before at walgreens.</li>
            <li>, I losed my free trial time with Amazon</li>
            <li>But- the sound</li>
            <li>The cord didn&#x27;t tangle and was rotatable which I absolutely adored, but the best part was the bounce and volume it left on my hair.</li>

            <li>one in particular has a wonderful digital display, and its on the top instead of in the middle which I liked.</li>
            <li>she is very adept with flat irons...</li>
            <li>In combination with heat protectant, ammonia free dye, sulfate free shampoo and this new flat iron, my hair has never looked healthier and more beautiful.</li>
            <li>I purchased it after my InfraShine burned out and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Something that might not be too important but is a nice elegant touch is the red color of the plates.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this product came.</li>
            <li>I chose 2 day shipping because I was too excited to test it</li>
            <li>I´ve always had Babyliss flat irons and they are awesome, but I was moving to the United States and I wanted to leave my Babyliss iron in Mexico and buy a new one for here.</li>
            <li>Plates are super smooth.</li>
            <li>I was also able to get a nice curve at the bottom simply by twisting my wrist when I got to the end of each strand.</li>
            <li>I was also able to get a nice curve at the bottom simply by twisting my wrist when I got to the end of each strand.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and runs smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li>important if you are trying to be super</li>
            <li>The way that my curls caught the light made my whole complexion seem brighter and better.</li>
            <li>I have very strong curly hair and like to straighten them up before going out or to work for my particular hairstyle.</li>
            <li>The digital LCD in my opinion is a great addition to this and makes it look much more high end and techwise.</li>
            <li>and I began to see so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away how easily my hair ran through the iron.</li>
            <li>The control buttons/on/off are placed right where you hold it so it is easy to change the setting inadvertently.</li>
            <li>They automatically set to the perfect temperature so that I wouldn&#x27;t over heat or burn out my hair, unlike my old flat iron.</li>
            <li>Excellent Flat Iron - Professional Quality.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and safe to use, and a much higher quality build than our old one.</li>
            <li>In no time at all, I had straight, almost professional salon style hair – something I have never been able to create on my own.</li>
            <li>Full 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>It has 360 degree full swivel</li>
            <li>I also like the 360 degree full swivel</li>
            <li>And the company guarantees this hair straightner for 2 full</li>
            <li>But I did love how fast it heated up.</li>
            <li>Update: Was contacted by customer service and they promptly apologized for the mishap and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li>, I was looking for a hair straightener recently and purchased this unit on the advice of a good friend.</li>
            <li>, more gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great straightener that doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage with several months of daily use.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast, I love the control lock so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally pressing a button while styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I always love my hair straight</li>
            <li>In any case, the iron is beautiful to look at and it did run smoothly down my hair and it did not pull at my hair or pull my hair out.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was awesome to try such a fabulous flat iron.......</li>
            <li>The weight and balance are just right, and the unit is comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and works great with my hair type even if you only use it for special occasions, it just makes your hair prettier.</li>
            <li>A good flat iron makes a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works quickly and has a ridged grip area at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a stylish and elegant look in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair damaged at all.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, locks at temp, does the job.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Compact and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done, press the power button twice quickly and the screen will display an unlocked lock.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats quickly and evenly, from 175 to 425 degrees.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair which the InfraShine made beautifully soft, shiny and perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>My hair isn’t super curly to begin with, but it helps with keeping the friz at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient that it heats up quickly</li>
            <li>The straightener heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a product and much better than your typical Walmart flat iron.</li>
            <li>It has a temperature gauge and the ability to set it at a pretty precise level.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing - my hair is always so frizzy and this keeps is looking sleek and smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li>This product made me want to get two because my hair is so smooth and pretty now.</li>
            <li>As a lefty, I am especially happy with this flat iron because the buttons are centrally located for use in either hand.  </li>
            <li>She said it has to do with the body shape of the ISA and that it makes doing everything from straight to curly super easy.</li>
            <li>but if you want to be able to wear a smooth, straight hairstyle no matter what your natural hair type is, this straightener by ISA is a top of the line tool at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you want to be able to wear a smooth, straight hairstyle no matter what your natural hair type is, this straightener by ISA is a top of the line tool at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ceramic is much smoother and lets hair slide easily between the plates.</li>
            <li>The Isa flat iron is one of the best flat irons out on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and I have feel in love with it so far!</li>
            <li>This one, by far, tops the list! :)</li>
            <li>it is very quick and ready to use right away</li>
            <li>As usual, I had to research every highly rated hair straightener for comparison, and this seems like the best!</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to really maneuver the flat iron, which comes in handy when trying to do curls.</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair professional, but they love it because of the sleek design and</li>
            <li>are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li>My own hair is color treated and tends toward being coarse, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My own hair is color treated and tends toward being coarse, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - solid good quality product from a manufacturer that has been very responsive to questions about using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I splurged, and spent a few more bucks, to got a great product.</li>
            <li>always managed to kink my hair when making curls with my old straightener, but this one is so far so good.</li>
            <li>how it looks sitting around, but the brilliant red plate and candy apple red</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments and my hair looks great and is undamaged after over a year of near daily use.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth getting ISA instead of CHI.</li>
            <li>so this is kind of a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>I like the ability to adjust the temperature setting; I tested the iron at various settings until I found what I feel is the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; for my own hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, is comfortable to hold, has a nice design and does a great job straitening hair (cut their time in half over the previous one)</li>
            <li>and I live in humid weather - so quick, consistent, easy to change temperature control</li>
            <li>She tells me that this is an amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li>digital display is bright and the temperature rises fast and consistently.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this flat iron as it has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>The feel of the iron doesn’t seem right.  </li>
            <li>but it allows me to get the right temperature for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>and now I can set the temp just right.</li>
            <li>power button and the temperature adjustment buttons are located right where your hand goes when using the iron.</li>
            <li>My stylist was right.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the issue right away, immediately hitting the buttons while attempting to straighten.</li>
            <li>and I could never manage to flick my wrist right to achieve the curl that I wanted, but it was a breeze to curl my hair with this</li>
            <li>Got it  right away.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch and heat adjustment are right where you would hold it to straighten.</li>
            <li>Works well but the on/off switch is right on the handle where you would hold it</li>
            <li>so I actually had to turn the heat down to 180 degrees, and that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Tourmaline is a silicate that, when crushed to a fine powder and then added ceramic coatings on the plates or baked on the plates by itself, makes a very smooth surface on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very little time needed is a great reason to buy this.</li>
            <li>my wife and daughter absolutely love it; it works so much better than their previous one.  </li>
            <li>It has a wide range of temperatures, from warm to super hot real fast.</li>
            <li>This flat iron has many cool features that others don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>though she has a nice long hair</li>
            <li>I have owned many flat iron in my life but none have been better than this one so far.</li>
            <li>Solid Tourmaline Ceramic plates protect your hair and leave it silky smooth, You won&#x27;t believe how silky smooth your hair will be,</li>
            <li>After I learned that you canclick the power button quick twice to lock the controls I was much happier.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you need a high-quality, professional grade hair straightener because this one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product I use it daily!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this hair straightener from ISA because it works really well and is designed with features that make it easy to use for all ages.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is easy to hold and easy to use, and performed the job very well.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up very fast</li>
            <li>no doubt the iron is of premium quality and very very durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also left handed and all I can say is that it&#x27;s super easy to work with</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates were top of the line, and the digital display made adjusting the heat effortless.</li>
            <li>The most compelling feature of this hair straightening include e.g 100% Solid Tourmaline ceramic plates; Fast and safe straightening, curls, waves; 360 degree no tangle cord; Digital Temperature control up to 220 degree Celsius;</li>
            <li>exactly how hot it is.</li>
            <li>I use it to straight my hair and also to make waves on it!</li>
            <li>and I love the digital display!</li>
            <li>The ISA has design flaws that they are aware of.  </li>
            <li>The heat control on this is not only safe</li>
            <li>was hoping for the hot bit to be bigger so that I could straighten more of my hair at one time.</li>
            <li>so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.</li>
            <li>I was able to turn in back on each time, but it continued to do this.</li>
            <li>I guess there&#x27;s the reason this was returned in the first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not getting too hot for your hair to burn.</li>
            <li>a side note, they ship extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Many plates that claim to be  tourmaline or ceramic are actually metal plates with a ceramic/tourmaline coating baked on.</li>
            <li>Then I looked closely at the plates and saw that each one can rock back and forth in place, making sure your hair is never pulled or yanked no matter what position your arm is</li>
            <li>I was surprised that each one of us ended up with smooth, straightened hair that had a lot of shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the smoothness remains even in my hot, humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised that each one of us ended up with smooth, straightened hair that had a lot of shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the smoothness remains even in my hot, humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing it as hot as 425, but it shows the range of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was surprised by how light it is.  </li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair feeling nearly as smooth as my 3 year old babyliss straightener.</li>
            <li>Ceramic - helps heat up the plates quicker and evenly with no \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I work in a job that has me in the warehouse a lot, which is extremely hot with lots of humidity.</li>
            <li>When I first used them they did not burn my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, but it could be designed better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also so pretty to look at on the counter.</li>
            <li>only thing that ticks me off sometimes is that the buttons are on top</li>
            <li>Well, the hair was barely hot.</li>
            <li>My palm hit the buttons on top sometimes but it locks by double click.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to use Argon oil with the ISA to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast too, I received it in 2 days!</li>
            <li>I have frizzy and wavy hair, and it can get pretty damaged as I color it.</li>
            <li>[*] Seems to require a higher temperature setting than I need on my Chi.</li>
            <li>That is this one didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as her aging Baby Bliss Pro straightening iron which I was trying to help her replace,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>I keep hitting the digital temperature controls on the top of the iron.</li>
            <li>when I reviewed it in the mail it came in a box brand new, the vendor was nice enough to message me before hand to let me know all about the iron before I got it.  </li>
            <li>So far this one is working very well and easy.</li>
            <li>The ISA Professional flat iron hair straighter does a fantastic job of smoothing out your hair and making it look smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I love this feature because I usually flat iron my hair into rounds because it is so kinky and curly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more than my share of flat hair irons over the years, buying what I had the money for or that was on sale</li>
            <li>I have been using this flat iron over the weekend and am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>The isa&#x27;s easy too hold and easy to use and cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li>ISA Professional Digital Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers the best of both worlds in one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a very nice flat iron if you can overlook some minor issues.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the grips don&#x27;t give a very tight hold to straighten the hair, so it easily slips between the plates.</li>
            <li>First of all is ready for use extremely fast!</li>
            <li>This flatiron is good enough for occasional use but not well designed.</li>
            <li>Love it, because my old one always looked like a knotted mess, and the coating was wearing away after so many times wrapping it</li>
            <li>: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.o about the product and usage on the Amazon product</li>
            <li>: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I received this hair straightener as a &#x27;for review&#x27; sample and, of course, there were no discussions concerning me supplying a &#x27;positive&#x27; review in exchange.</li>
            <li>It also leaves the hair pretty straight</li>
            <li>The digital display and fine temperature controls turn this from an appliance into a precision tool to get exactly the results you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li>Simply set the desired temperature and then press the power button twice very quickly.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the long cord and LCD screen.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this hair straightener because it works very well and is designed with features that make it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to wait at all</li>
            <li>Last night she called me and told me that she absolutely LOVED her new flat iron</li>
            <li>and she was astounded that she could get such smooth, straight</li>
            <li>and she was astounded that she could get such smooth, straight</li>
            <li>It does not need much time to get your hair straightened.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair and made it very shiny and glossy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wonder if this works for guys haha.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of the 1 Hour Auto shut off Safety Feature, in case</li>
            <li>I do like the neon colored LCD display so you can see it even in low light</li>
            <li>like i do helps soooo much.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say I agree too much with it as it still leaves the opportunity for things to happen.</li>
            <li>the plastic inside holding the iron was very wrinkled.</li>
            <li>they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it was ready for use.</li>
            <li>I used it, and the light weight actually helps with arm fatigue while straightening sections of longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>really like the 10ft cord.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast..</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks ISA#</li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and silky without that &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling when I ran my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>The vendor was very accommodating which I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors of this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for all types of hair Even ethnic curly hair like mine!</li>
            <li>but they always died really fast</li>
            <li>Fast straightening.</li>
            <li>My hair is really think and frizzy and I wanted to get something for once</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this Product!</li>
            <li>I noticed though, at the salon they always got my hair much smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li>] Heats up very quickly&lt;br /&gt;[+]</li>
            <li>ISA has really outdone themselves with this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>Will NEVER go back to the cheap stuff again.</li>
            <li>Since ahes been using this she absolutely loves it and</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>(sorry, I&#x27;m a guy, this is the best I can describe it) there was a gap between the clamps near the handle side.</li>
            <li>and tourmaline are also considered superior because when heated, they emit negative ions.</li>
            <li>I shamefully admit I’ve come home more than once and realized I left my old straightener on, which scared me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair (which is naturally a mousy brown that&#x27;s bleached to blonde) is in better shape than it was in before I started to use the ISA</li>
            <li>Wow where to start!!!</li>
            <li>It seems this industry is a difficult one - so many are made, promising great results, but then fall flat.    </li>
            <li>it was ready for use and the cable is really long about 10-12 feet in length and easy for me to use</li>
            <li>It has a vast range of temperatures, from curling iron hot to super hot&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have my friend Lizza, who also got one of these, straighten my hair with it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I always make purchases based off reviews so when I saw the amount of positive reviews on this straightener, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one than the ISA professional flat iron..</li>
            <li>The cheap flat iron I had took FOREVER to get my hair straight and made my hair look like straw.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with this ISA professional Flat Iron</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is that the box; it&#x27;s an elegant glossy white gift box that slides open.</li>
            <li>iron straighteners consist of two flat plates which are heated and then sections of hair are slid between them to straighten and smooth the hair.</li>
            <li>There is one other issue that she mentioned which was hardly able to be tested by comparison.  </li>
            <li>The heat also seems to transfer evenly due to its ceramic plates and I feel confident with my purchase because of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>an aside, it&#x27;s easy to see almost any color of hair on the vivid red plates...</li>
            <li>My previous one I have really liked and been using for a few years is a Chi Turbo, so my review is based mostly as a comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to turn on (hit power button), lock in (hit it twice) and turn off (hold it for a few seconds)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and then you are able to turn it down if you wish to your desired temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it had the option to lock the buttons because I&#x27;m ALWAYS pushing the up and down temp buttons while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to any girl who needs a new one!</li>
            <li>[*] Not going to list this as a con since this is more of a personal taste, but I think I prefer the slightly larger size of my Chi.</li>
            <li>Its great for my thin blonde hair, it doesn’t pinch or damages the hair and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>fantastic , i have really curly hair and most flat irons simply don&#x27;t work, or they burn my hair by the time it goes straight, this iron on the other hand is genuine salon quality , its works so good, ill never use anything else!</li>
            <li>She was able to get my frizzy limp blonde hair into shape - a shape that was sleek and full of body and shine and curls.</li>
            <li>She also mentioned that because African Americans often have to use a lot of moisturizer and other products in their hair, it&#x27;s important to clean the plates after every use to avoid product building up and baking onto the plates, which will make them work</li>
            <li>She also mentioned that because African Americans often have to use a lot of moisturizer and other products in their hair, it&#x27;s important to clean the plates after every use to avoid product building up and baking onto the plates, which will make them work</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It also does not feel like it reaches the high tempts of 450 degree</li>
            <li>So I moved my hand way up high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li>This creates high pitched beeping noises every time you grip it.</li>
            <li>The temperature range is between 80-220f which is quite high for a straightener.</li>
            <li>I should have read previous reviews more carefully, as the placement of the control buttons are a huge annoyance.</li>
            <li>I seemed to go through the cheap ones like nothing, so I decided to invest in the ISA Professional Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>Wish the cord was a little more heat resistant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly and truly works wonders--even if you only use it for special occasions and limited glamorous evenings out, it just makes hair prettier.</li>
            <li>No tangles, slides smoothly, temp control, and lasts a really long time!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this one thinking I could replace my CHI (which was amazing), but alas, this one seems pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cord is long enough and it has held up well for many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra $$</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates are really what you want to look for when buying a high quality flat iron and this one has exactly that.</li>
            <li>and I couldn´t straighten it even if I went through the same part 3 times, after that I touched my hair and it was barely hot, conclusion, the flat iron didn´t worked (many people in their reviews had the same problem).</li>
            <li>with the other irons I&#x27;ve used, after a couple of hours I&#x27;m left with a frizzy mess that doesn&#x27;t look good on anybody!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is definitely a grade above the one i used to own.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no sealed plastic packaging or some sort of manufacturer seal, not even on the outside box, so we basically knew right away</li>
            <li>I imagine the engineers who designed this appliance do not have long hair or are not in touch with stylists or women who use flat irons :-)</li>
            <li>The device has a decent sized display that allows you to set your desired temperature, and my wife has found her desired setting to be consistent across several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Of course the return window has now closed, so I may just be out a significant amount of money.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid area, and my hair seemed to be protected from the humidity.</li>
            <li>HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS???  </li>
            <li>I figured it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to get her a new one immediately to fix my mistake.</li>
            <li>and I live in a humid climate, so</li>
            <li>It just happens that testing - not by me because my hair is not long enough but by Ms. D and our daughter - concluded that this is very much as good as it gets maybe with one little issue.</li>
            <li>What I especially like is the digital temperature control, that heats up very quickly like a truly professional model.  </li>
            <li>construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 356g (12.6 oz.), which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  </li>
            <li>Spending the extra money for a quality and professional straightener like the ISA is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Once I did that I was totally in love with this little iron!</li>
            <li>Definitely brush your hair first, and make sure that you don&#x27;t have any product left over that&#x27;s wet before using.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, I was finally able to get a straight look that I can wear outside!</li>
            <li>A good flat iron is hard to find.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have found so far that is able to straighten my hair with minimal product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a digital readout so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it and so far no complaints (that&#x27;s an achievement in itself!)</li>
            <li>in all I would definitely recommend the Isa flat iron if you’re looking for shiny, smooth, bouncy salon quality hair from within the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li>The digital control allows for setting the exact temperature and will keep it there for the duration of your use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to learn to hold my hand higher on the straightener, which leads to me burning my hand occasionally.</li>
            <li>also feel that other straighteners actually create better curls.</li>
            <li>I first came across this at the salon where my stylist used it on me before a big event - my sister&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li>There are other straighteners on the market for about the same price that are much better than this one (CHI, Sedu, etc.).</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s a screaming design flaw, considering it is such a basic piece of equipment, and that&#x27;s the most basic function.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about that long and my hair is still healthy, which hasn&#x27;t been the case for me with other high end straighteners in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sucker glides so easily through my hair too!</li>
            <li>The plates are made of high quality ceramic that heats evenly and smoothly distributes heat on your hair without snagging, pulling, or uneven results.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;ISA Professional Digital LCD Flat Iron Hair Straightener&amp;#34; has a temperature control option that she can use it with comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li>The buttons on the ISA are exactly where my thumb naturally lands and constantly get pressed accidentally.</li>
            <li>My first flat so I can&#x27;t compare it.</li>
            <li>They have it exactly where you are to hold a flat iron.</li>
            <li>the flat iron didn´t get as hot as it should,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this straightener to anyone that wants a long-lasting flat iron.</li>
            <li>and it was actually even better than her previous one because of the pin point temperature control that she did not have before.</li>
            <li>hair was very smooth and shiny after being straightened, usually it is type 3A curls, but you couldn&#x27;t tell that by looking at me today!</li>
            <li>Very sleek, and smaller than my old</li>
            <li>It is clear to read and tells you the temperature as it rises or lowers.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is naturally frizzy.</li>
            <li>My Onei is almost a year old and no problems.  </li>
            <li>I was rather surprised by the smoothness of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take away the natural shine in her hair.</li>
            <li>(Tourmaline emits the most negative ions when heated.)</li>
            <li>something my old straightener, which was at this price point – didn’t do.  </li>
            <li>When you use it the controls are near where you hold it</li>
            <li>This unit does not burn my hair as my old cheapo hair straightener did.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to spend my whole break waiting for it to turn on to the proper heat setting.</li>
            <li>but everything is working flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li>and it helped make my lifeless hair look alive again.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this I wasted time and money buying cheap straighteners from drugstores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It glides from roots to end very well when you use smaller</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>, how much did your last salon appointment cost?</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my Wife as a gift of our last Anniversary and she really like it.</li>
            <li>and wow, I don&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li>Zero complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>and it is kind of irritating.</li>
            <li>I only give it two stars because the temperature gage only reads in Celsius and the buttons are right where you hold the straighter while using so</li>
            <li>And because these plates are solid tourmaline ceramic and do such an exceptional job of smoothing, you may find you need a lower setting than with your previous flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>flat iron does not get hot enough, did not get my hair straight, and the plates did not meet evenly or tight enough to give a smooth pass on a section of hair.</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron, I received this as a gift but gave it to my cousin because she has been focusing on her hair lately, and I was amazed at the quality of this thing.</li>
            <li>You could throw a new plastic bag on the unit we just returned and essentially pass it off as new.</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another change I noticed from the previous model is how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li>The cord is extremely long which is a plus for me ,being from a large household I&#x27;m always moving.</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re going to pay a high price.  </li>
            <li>My old chi finally died, and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>High quality ceramic feels very sturdy and I would expect it to last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using a ceramic or tourmaline straightener leaves the hair much shinier and smoother because the negative ions close the follicles and smooth the hair by neutralizing the positive charge present in dry or damaged</li>
            <li>This is an absolute necessity for avoiding heat damaged hair over the long haul.</li>
            <li>Works reasonably well but still prefer using my curling iron to straighten my long curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our testers&#x27; hair is long and straight</li>
            <li>and it takes a long time to get the whole hair done.</li>
            <li>I run a small hair salon and this is the flat iron that most of my employees use.</li>
            <li>This particular flat iron has a spot where you can sit your thumb away from the controls.</li>
            <li>I like the fact you will be able to see any product build up to clean plates versus other flat irons with black on black; color also helps ensuring the width of the hair strand while you style is completely covered by the plates.&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>It makes my frizzy hair sleek and smooth, with only a few minutes every morning.</li>
            <li>One friend has thick smooth hair that&#x27;s almost impossibly naturally curly.</li>
            <li>One friend has thick smooth hair that&#x27;s almost impossibly naturally curly.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the plates are made of tourmaline which is preferable to the standard metal or even gold as it is far smoother and less likely to pull hair, it&#x27;s far more likely to just glide through and straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>I first iron my whole head at 400 Fahrenheit, then do a second round to flip the edges at 150 or an even lower temperature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and small enough to take anywhere in a bag or purse if you are staying somewhere.</li>
            <li>friend with the super curly hair took the longest to finish because we had to use small sections since it is so curly naturally.</li>
            <li>friend with the super curly hair took the longest to finish because we had to use small sections since it is so curly naturally.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a new flat iron taking over.</li>
            <li>Dry, damaged hair is positively charged which leaves the hair follicles open.</li>
            <li>for it.scribed above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up very quickly with range of different temperatures and straightened her hair without trouble.</li>
            <li>Tourmaline - which produces negative ions which helps smooth out your hair follicles.</li>
            <li>As a newly natural, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different hair products and this is def one of my must haves!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone natural.</li>
            <li>5 stars for customer support, 1 star for product design and apparently malfunction (2 separate issues).</li>
            <li>Other flat iron cords always get tangled which makes this flat iron unique for its swiveling cord</li>
            <li>It gets really hot obviously but it just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I expected it to...</li>
            <li>I’m not sure if the temperature is true to the setting either.  </li>
            <li>So you either need to hold it too far back - which doesn&#x27;t get a tight grip or above the buttons which can get really hot!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this flat iron, especially those of you on the fence</li>
            <li>She first noticed the box was slightly ajar and</li>
            <li>Her old Flat Iron went out and needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li>The ISA Professional Hair Straightener is a flat iron-style straightener with tourmaline ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>Very tech forward but does not straighten as well as other products on the market.</li>
            <li>My mom who&#x27;s an all natural girl hates flat ironing her hair, but used these once and asked to keep them.</li>
            <li>Fantastic results with straightening and subtle curling</li>
            <li>Personally, I could tell right away from how those little plastic things were tied around the power cord..</li>
            <li>you are looking for flat iron hair straightener of this size, style and design, for use similar to what I have described above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had ones in the past where the ceramic coating flaked off the plate and it made me so mad; solid ceramic plates is the best</li>
            <li>every other one I&#x27;ve ever had, over my slightly curly, fine hair, I had to run the flat iron 1-2 times.  </li>
            <li>My last straightener barely functions.</li>
            <li>I like how high it heats up to, because my thick hair really needs a lot of heat.</li>
            <li>She was quite surprised that I actually bought her one and initially,I believe, she had low expectations about it since I know nothing about flat irons.</li>
            <li>I thought the previous model was fast, well this one is even faster.</li>
            <li>Does not warm up as quick as the babyliss brand.</li>
            <li>Not only is that horribly harsh on your hair but your hair should almost be so hot it&#x27;s almost on fire.</li>
            <li>I recommend that others with coarse mixed hair should put the heat on a little bit higher to reduce the straightening time.</li>
            <li>It also reduces very fast so no more hassle of waiting it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome..nice and hot, excellent</li>
            <li> Omg, I love how my hair feels when its straightened now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this straightener!  </li>

            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> She love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> The ISA heats up very quickly and has worked great for all hair types that we have come across in the salon.</li>
            <li> A pleasant surprise for her, and for me as well. :)</li>
            <li> This is great, but you will notice that during use, it&#x27;s easy to hit the buttons and change the temp.</li>
            <li> I ran a quick brush through my hair and was good to go!</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing straightener.</li>
            <li> She did an amazingly meticulous job, which took about 45 minutes, which is about what it takes to straighten my hair, even with an iron with a plate twice the size of this one.  </li>
            <li> I was sent this straightener, for free, to review on my blog and it is great.</li>
            <li> And the ability to curl my hair is a nice bonus to refresh the curls at the end of the day to go out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own to prevent burning anything around.</li>
            <li> This has nice features like adjusting the temp setting and a swivel cord to help with straightening.  </li>
            <li> As I am straightening my hair I keep pressing them, it is kind of unavoidable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a straightener that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice temp control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like if a gun had the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; feature turned on and off by pulling the trigger; basically defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they kindly gave me the refund</li>
            <li> I find that the best place to hold the iron is right on top of the temp display where it shows the degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LCD display is a very good feature of this iron and the temperature sets up very fast.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always on the look out for an affordable yet very effective flat iron and this one works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Welll, I got so many compliments and so many people said it looked like I was luminous and bright looking</li>
            <li> iron itself is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love, love this hair straightener!</li>
            <li> Best straightener for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> the product is so great  and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smooth and beautiful on the very first try.</li>
            <li> so no straightening but, to their delight an joy, curling was extremely quick and easy with the tool reaching the desired temperature within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sleek and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so nice and its easy to manage.</li>
            <li> The fact that it came with a 2 year warranty is just a cherry on top.</li>
            <li> [yes, I like to be sure about whatever I invest my money on]</li>
            <li> This is surely gonna be of great use to you if you prefer your hair spooky straight...</li>
            <li> Lovely hair straightener, I used this straightener almost every twice a week for work</li>
            <li> At over $100 I expect it to work better than a $50 straightener I bought at Target.</li>
            <li> Better than all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> hear that unlike metal or ceramic-coated plates, the tourmaline ceramic plates transfers heat faster and more evenly.</li>
            <li> Putting the controls on top means that every time you do a pass of the iron on your hair you hit the power button.</li>
            <li> I love, love this hair straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how the display shows the temperature realtime as you raise it or lower it.</li>
            <li> I have thinner, curlier hair on top and almost wavy, thicker hair closest to the neck</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once.  </li>
            <li> The digital temperature control is awesome.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to lock the buttons once it reaches your desired heat level.</li>
            <li> There is actually more info about the product and usage on the Amazon product page!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how I can control the temperature –</li>
            <li> The LED panel allows me to better control the temperature.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is okay.</li>
            <li> So glad I waited.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I keep hitting them, then have to check to make sure I locked it.</li>
            <li> The humidity does a great deal of damage to my hair and makes it very frizzy.</li>
            <li> For even better results if suggest ARGON OIL which I also relieved from their brand</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a way to switch it to Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> Most are two separate \\&quot;tongs\\&quot;, but this on has one on a swivel that pinches.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that she was able to &amp;#34;flatiron&amp;#34; my hair into curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> many, many times.</li>
            <li> im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> so that most of the time she used bands in her hair.</li>
            <li> But now she can makes her hair unbound just because of this lovely product.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was time to invest in a more quality product</li>
            <li> The on/off switch was is on top where I held it to use and would turn off even with the lock on.  </li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that, having a connection with the vendor and them sending me more information before hand to prepare me to what I will be receiving in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Very nice fast heating &amp; LOVE</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m not one for spending close to $100 on a flat iron but my best friend recommended it and after using hers I had to have it!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not the best flat iron for the money.</li>
            <li> Lets start off by saying these are the best flat irons I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best flat iroin I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> Now I am very happy with my Babyliss flat iron again.......</li>
            <li> Very fast heat and does a great job taking all curl out and making my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> (think classic car) handle is a joy to look at.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to obtain the perfect temperature when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> Straighter works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The handles are lengthy and I love the fact that it can be used (easily) with either hand.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more smooth and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth glide, fast heat up.</li>
            <li> Kept pressing the temperature setting buttons as it is placed in the area where it is most comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the feel of this tourmaline hair straightener.</li>
            <li> WOW, does this thing work great.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li> It also has some unique features that make styling your hair easier and more</li>
            <li> This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds</li>
            <li> It shows the temperature and it&#x27;s easy to control it.</li>
            <li> no tangle cord, which makes it easy when you are moving around in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Curls are bouncy and easy to do just by turning the wrist.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite wavy, but easily damaged.  </li>
            <li> This coating can chip off easily and damage hair as it glides over the chipped areas.</li>
            <li> The liquid crystal display is easy to read and the controls are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to grasp</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds</li>
            <li> /&gt;Locking the heat is easy (press the power button twice), but your hands still hit the buttons.</li>
            <li> very very quickly and no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is still kicking strong.</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s amazing for your hair, but didn&#x27;t come with the hot chick 🐥.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality straightener, especially for such a good price.</li>
            <li> used the iron on my own hair and two friends the first day I got it.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a new hair straightener and this one looked really good to me.</li>
            <li> Always accurate and easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this product was priced around $40 it would be fine.</li>
            <li> She uses it to flatten or straighten her hair and it does a wonderful job in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> so the thumb touching does not change the temp, but you still hear the beep each time you hit it and hitting it twice in quick succession unlocks the keys.</li>
            <li> own hair slid easily through the plates and came out straight and smooth and glossy.</li>

            <li> did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed</li>
            <li> You can lock the temperature and it makes a sound when you unlock it, so you notice it immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really great hair straightener.</li>
            <li> You should start out at the lowest temperature setting and gradually increase it until you find the lowest setting that will straighten and smooth your hair satisfactorily.</li>

            <li> You could already tell it was miles ahead of the cheap ones I had bought before at walgreens.</li>
            <li> , I losed my free trial time with Amazon</li>
            <li> But- the sound</li>
            <li> The cord didn&#x27;t tangle and was rotatable which I absolutely adored, but the best part was the bounce and volume it left on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied by the quality, I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly to a temperature that was perfect for our daughter&#x27;s use, and I even had to adjust it down a bit for myself.</li>

            <li> It always comes out very smooth and straight, at work my friends tell me it seems like I go to the salon every week!</li>
            <li> I liked my older hot tools better.</li>
            <li> one in particular has a wonderful digital display, and its on the top instead of in the middle which I liked.</li>
            <li> she is very adept with flat irons...</li>
            <li> In combination with heat protectant, ammonia free dye, sulfate free shampoo and this new flat iron, my hair has never looked healthier and more beautiful.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after my InfraShine burned out and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Something that might not be too important but is a nice elegant touch is the red color of the plates.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this product came.</li>
            <li> I chose 2 day shipping because I was too excited to test it</li>
            <li> I´ve always had Babyliss flat irons and they are awesome, but I was moving to the United States and I wanted to leave my Babyliss iron in Mexico and buy a new one for here.</li>
            <li> Plates are super smooth.</li>
            <li> I was also able to get a nice curve at the bottom simply by twisting my wrist when I got to the end of each strand.</li>
            <li> I was also able to get a nice curve at the bottom simply by twisting my wrist when I got to the end of each strand.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and runs smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li> important if you are trying to be super</li>
            <li> The way that my curls caught the light made my whole complexion seem brighter and better.</li>
            <li> I have very strong curly hair and like to straighten them up before going out or to work for my particular hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The digital LCD in my opinion is a great addition to this and makes it look much more high end and techwise.</li>
            <li> and I began to see so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away how easily my hair ran through the iron.</li>
            <li> The control buttons/on/off are placed right where you hold it so it is easy to change the setting inadvertently.</li>
            <li> They automatically set to the perfect temperature so that I wouldn&#x27;t over heat or burn out my hair, unlike my old flat iron.</li>
            <li> Excellent Flat Iron - Professional Quality.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and safe to use, and a much higher quality build than our old one.</li>
            <li> In no time at all, I had straight, almost professional salon style hair – something I have never been able to create on my own.</li>
            <li> Full 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> It has 360 degree full swivel</li>
            <li> I also like the 360 degree full swivel</li>
            <li> And the company guarantees this hair straightner for 2 full</li>
            <li> But I did love how fast it heated up.</li>
            <li> Update: Was contacted by customer service and they promptly apologized for the mishap and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li> , I was looking for a hair straightener recently and purchased this unit on the advice of a good friend.</li>
            <li> , more gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great straightener that doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage with several months of daily use.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely fast, I love the control lock so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally pressing a button while styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I always love my hair straight</li>
            <li> In any case, the iron is beautiful to look at and it did run smoothly down my hair and it did not pull at my hair or pull my hair out.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was awesome to try such a fabulous flat iron.......</li>
            <li> The weight and balance are just right, and the unit is comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and works great with my hair type even if you only use it for special occasions, it just makes your hair prettier.</li>
            <li> A good flat iron makes a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works quickly and has a ridged grip area at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a stylish and elegant look in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair damaged at all.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, locks at temp, does the job.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Compact and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done, press the power button twice quickly and the screen will display an unlocked lock.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats quickly and evenly, from 175 to 425 degrees.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair which the InfraShine made beautifully soft, shiny and perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> My hair isn’t super curly to begin with, but it helps with keeping the friz at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient that it heats up quickly</li>
            <li> The straightener heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a product and much better than your typical Walmart flat iron.</li>
            <li> It has a temperature gauge and the ability to set it at a pretty precise level.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing - my hair is always so frizzy and this keeps is looking sleek and smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li> This product made me want to get two because my hair is so smooth and pretty now.</li>
            <li> As a lefty, I am especially happy with this flat iron because the buttons are centrally located for use in either hand.  </li>
            <li> She said it has to do with the body shape of the ISA and that it makes doing everything from straight to curly super easy.</li>
            <li> but if you want to be able to wear a smooth, straight hairstyle no matter what your natural hair type is, this straightener by ISA is a top of the line tool at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you want to be able to wear a smooth, straight hairstyle no matter what your natural hair type is, this straightener by ISA is a top of the line tool at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ceramic is much smoother and lets hair slide easily between the plates.</li>
            <li> The Isa flat iron is one of the best flat irons out on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I have feel in love with it so far!</li>
            <li> This one, by far, tops the list! :)</li>
            <li> it is very quick and ready to use right away</li>
            <li> As usual, I had to research every highly rated hair straightener for comparison, and this seems like the best!</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to really maneuver the flat iron, which comes in handy when trying to do curls.</li>
            <li> Worth buying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair professional, but they love it because of the sleek design and</li>
            <li> are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> My own hair is color treated and tends toward being coarse, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My own hair is color treated and tends toward being coarse, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - solid good quality product from a manufacturer that has been very responsive to questions about using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I splurged, and spent a few more bucks, to got a great product.</li>
            <li> always managed to kink my hair when making curls with my old straightener, but this one is so far so good.</li>
            <li> how it looks sitting around, but the brilliant red plate and candy apple red</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and my hair looks great and is undamaged after over a year of near daily use.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth getting ISA instead of CHI.</li>
            <li> so this is kind of a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I like the ability to adjust the temperature setting; I tested the iron at various settings until I found what I feel is the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; for my own hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, is comfortable to hold, has a nice design and does a great job straitening hair (cut their time in half over the previous one)</li>
            <li> and I live in humid weather - so quick, consistent, easy to change temperature control</li>
            <li> She tells me that this is an amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li> digital display is bright and the temperature rises fast and consistently.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this flat iron as it has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> The feel of the iron doesn’t seem right.  </li>
            <li> but it allows me to get the right temperature for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> and now I can set the temp just right.</li>
            <li> power button and the temperature adjustment buttons are located right where your hand goes when using the iron.</li>
            <li> My stylist was right.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the issue right away, immediately hitting the buttons while attempting to straighten.</li>
            <li> and I could never manage to flick my wrist right to achieve the curl that I wanted, but it was a breeze to curl my hair with this</li>
            <li> Got it  right away.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch and heat adjustment are right where you would hold it to straighten.</li>
            <li> Works well but the on/off switch is right on the handle where you would hold it</li>
            <li> so I actually had to turn the heat down to 180 degrees, and that worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Tourmaline is a silicate that, when crushed to a fine powder and then added ceramic coatings on the plates or baked on the plates by itself, makes a very smooth surface on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little time needed is a great reason to buy this.</li>
            <li> my wife and daughter absolutely love it; it works so much better than their previous one.  </li>
            <li> It has a wide range of temperatures, from warm to super hot real fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has many cool features that others don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> though she has a nice long hair</li>
            <li> I have owned many flat iron in my life but none have been better than this one so far.</li>
            <li> Solid Tourmaline Ceramic plates protect your hair and leave it silky smooth, You won&#x27;t believe how silky smooth your hair will be,</li>
            <li> After I learned that you canclick the power button quick twice to lock the controls I was much happier.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you need a high-quality, professional grade hair straightener because this one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product I use it daily!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this hair straightener from ISA because it works really well and is designed with features that make it easy to use for all ages.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is easy to hold and easy to use, and performed the job very well.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up very fast</li>
            <li> no doubt the iron is of premium quality and very very durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also left handed and all I can say is that it&#x27;s super easy to work with</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates were top of the line, and the digital display made adjusting the heat effortless.</li>
            <li> The most compelling feature of this hair straightening include e.g 100% Solid Tourmaline ceramic plates; Fast and safe straightening, curls, waves; 360 degree no tangle cord; Digital Temperature control up to 220 degree Celsius;</li>
            <li> exactly how hot it is.</li>
            <li> I use it to straight my hair and also to make waves on it!</li>
            <li> and I love the digital display!</li>
            <li> The ISA has design flaws that they are aware of.  </li>
            <li> The heat control on this is not only safe</li>
            <li> was hoping for the hot bit to be bigger so that I could straighten more of my hair at one time.</li>
            <li> so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.</li>
            <li> I was able to turn in back on each time, but it continued to do this.</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s the reason this was returned in the first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not getting too hot for your hair to burn.</li>
            <li> a side note, they ship extremely fast!</li>
            <li> Many plates that claim to be  tourmaline or ceramic are actually metal plates with a ceramic/tourmaline coating baked on.</li>
            <li> Then I looked closely at the plates and saw that each one can rock back and forth in place, making sure your hair is never pulled or yanked no matter what position your arm is</li>
            <li> I was surprised that each one of us ended up with smooth, straightened hair that had a lot of shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the smoothness remains even in my hot, humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised that each one of us ended up with smooth, straightened hair that had a lot of shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the smoothness remains even in my hot, humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing it as hot as 425, but it shows the range of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was surprised by how light it is.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair feeling nearly as smooth as my 3 year old babyliss straightener.</li>
            <li> Ceramic - helps heat up the plates quicker and evenly with no \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I work in a job that has me in the warehouse a lot, which is extremely hot with lots of humidity.</li>
            <li> When I first used them they did not burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, but it could be designed better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also so pretty to look at on the counter.</li>
            <li> only thing that ticks me off sometimes is that the buttons are on top</li>
            <li> Well, the hair was barely hot.</li>
            <li> My palm hit the buttons on top sometimes but it locks by double click.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to use Argon oil with the ISA to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast too, I received it in 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy and wavy hair, and it can get pretty damaged as I color it.</li>
            <li> [*] Seems to require a higher temperature setting than I need on my Chi.</li>
            <li> That is this one didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as her aging Baby Bliss Pro straightening iron which I was trying to help her replace,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> I keep hitting the digital temperature controls on the top of the iron.</li>
            <li> when I reviewed it in the mail it came in a box brand new, the vendor was nice enough to message me before hand to let me know all about the iron before I got it.  </li>
            <li> So far this one is working very well and easy.</li>
            <li> The ISA Professional flat iron hair straighter does a fantastic job of smoothing out your hair and making it look smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love this feature because I usually flat iron my hair into rounds because it is so kinky and curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more than my share of flat hair irons over the years, buying what I had the money for or that was on sale</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron over the weekend and am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> The isa&#x27;s easy too hold and easy to use and cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> ISA Professional Digital Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers the best of both worlds in one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a very nice flat iron if you can overlook some minor issues.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the grips don&#x27;t give a very tight hold to straighten the hair, so it easily slips between the plates.</li>
            <li> First of all is ready for use extremely fast!</li>
            <li> This flatiron is good enough for occasional use but not well designed.</li>
            <li> Love it, because my old one always looked like a knotted mess, and the coating was wearing away after so many times wrapping it</li>
            <li> : I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.o about the product and usage on the Amazon product</li>
            <li> : I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I received this hair straightener as a &#x27;for review&#x27; sample and, of course, there were no discussions concerning me supplying a &#x27;positive&#x27; review in exchange.</li>
            <li> It also leaves the hair pretty straight</li>
            <li> The digital display and fine temperature controls turn this from an appliance into a precision tool to get exactly the results you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li> Simply set the desired temperature and then press the power button twice very quickly.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is the long cord and LCD screen.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this hair straightener because it works very well and is designed with features that make it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to wait at all</li>
            <li> Last night she called me and told me that she absolutely LOVED her new flat iron</li>
            <li> and she was astounded that she could get such smooth, straight</li>
            <li> and she was astounded that she could get such smooth, straight</li>
            <li> It does not need much time to get your hair straightened.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair and made it very shiny and glossy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if this works for guys haha.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of the 1 Hour Auto shut off Safety Feature, in case</li>
            <li> I do like the neon colored LCD display so you can see it even in low light</li>
            <li> like i do helps soooo much.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say I agree too much with it as it still leaves the opportunity for things to happen.</li>
            <li> the plastic inside holding the iron was very wrinkled.</li>
            <li> they heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it was ready for use.</li>
            <li> I used it, and the light weight actually helps with arm fatigue while straightening sections of longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> really like the 10ft cord.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast..</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks ISA#</li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and silky without that &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling when I ran my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> The vendor was very accommodating which I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors of this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for all types of hair Even ethnic curly hair like mine!</li>
            <li> but they always died really fast</li>
            <li> Fast straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair is really think and frizzy and I wanted to get something for once</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this Product!</li>
            <li> I noticed though, at the salon they always got my hair much smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> ] Heats up very quickly&lt;br /&gt;[+]</li>
            <li> ISA has really outdone themselves with this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Will NEVER go back to the cheap stuff again.</li>
            <li> Since ahes been using this she absolutely loves it and</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> (sorry, I&#x27;m a guy, this is the best I can describe it) there was a gap between the clamps near the handle side.</li>
            <li> and tourmaline are also considered superior because when heated, they emit negative ions.</li>
            <li> I shamefully admit I’ve come home more than once and realized I left my old straightener on, which scared me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair (which is naturally a mousy brown that&#x27;s bleached to blonde) is in better shape than it was in before I started to use the ISA</li>
            <li> Wow where to start!!!</li>
            <li> It seems this industry is a difficult one - so many are made, promising great results, but then fall flat.    </li>
            <li> it was ready for use and the cable is really long about 10-12 feet in length and easy for me to use</li>
            <li> It has a vast range of temperatures, from curling iron hot to super hot&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have my friend Lizza, who also got one of these, straighten my hair with it the first time.  </li>
            <li> I always make purchases based off reviews so when I saw the amount of positive reviews on this straightener, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one than the ISA professional flat iron..</li>
            <li> The cheap flat iron I had took FOREVER to get my hair straight and made my hair look like straw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this ISA professional Flat Iron</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is that the box; it&#x27;s an elegant glossy white gift box that slides open.</li>
            <li> iron straighteners consist of two flat plates which are heated and then sections of hair are slid between them to straighten and smooth the hair.</li>
            <li> There is one other issue that she mentioned which was hardly able to be tested by comparison.  </li>
            <li> The heat also seems to transfer evenly due to its ceramic plates and I feel confident with my purchase because of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> an aside, it&#x27;s easy to see almost any color of hair on the vivid red plates...</li>
            <li> My previous one I have really liked and been using for a few years is a Chi Turbo, so my review is based mostly as a comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to turn on (hit power button), lock in (hit it twice) and turn off (hold it for a few seconds)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and then you are able to turn it down if you wish to your desired temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it had the option to lock the buttons because I&#x27;m ALWAYS pushing the up and down temp buttons while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to any girl who needs a new one!</li>
            <li> [*] Not going to list this as a con since this is more of a personal taste, but I think I prefer the slightly larger size of my Chi.</li>
            <li> Its great for my thin blonde hair, it doesn’t pinch or damages the hair and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> fantastic , i have really curly hair and most flat irons simply don&#x27;t work, or they burn my hair by the time it goes straight, this iron on the other hand is genuine salon quality , its works so good, ill never use anything else!</li>
            <li> She was able to get my frizzy limp blonde hair into shape - a shape that was sleek and full of body and shine and curls.</li>
            <li> She also mentioned that because African Americans often have to use a lot of moisturizer and other products in their hair, it&#x27;s important to clean the plates after every use to avoid product building up and baking onto the plates, which will make them work</li>
            <li> She also mentioned that because African Americans often have to use a lot of moisturizer and other products in their hair, it&#x27;s important to clean the plates after every use to avoid product building up and baking onto the plates, which will make them work</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It also does not feel like it reaches the high tempts of 450 degree</li>
            <li> So I moved my hand way up high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This creates high pitched beeping noises every time you grip it.</li>
            <li> The temperature range is between 80-220f which is quite high for a straightener.</li>
            <li> I should have read previous reviews more carefully, as the placement of the control buttons are a huge annoyance.</li>
            <li> I seemed to go through the cheap ones like nothing, so I decided to invest in the ISA Professional Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> Wish the cord was a little more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up quickly and truly works wonders--even if you only use it for special occasions and limited glamorous evenings out, it just makes hair prettier.</li>
            <li> No tangles, slides smoothly, temp control, and lasts a really long time!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this one thinking I could replace my CHI (which was amazing), but alas, this one seems pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> cord is long enough and it has held up well for many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra $$</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates are really what you want to look for when buying a high quality flat iron and this one has exactly that.</li>
            <li> and I couldn´t straighten it even if I went through the same part 3 times, after that I touched my hair and it was barely hot, conclusion, the flat iron didn´t worked (many people in their reviews had the same problem).</li>
            <li> with the other irons I&#x27;ve used, after a couple of hours I&#x27;m left with a frizzy mess that doesn&#x27;t look good on anybody!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is definitely a grade above the one i used to own.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no sealed plastic packaging or some sort of manufacturer seal, not even on the outside box, so we basically knew right away</li>
            <li> I imagine the engineers who designed this appliance do not have long hair or are not in touch with stylists or women who use flat irons :-)</li>
            <li> The device has a decent sized display that allows you to set your desired temperature, and my wife has found her desired setting to be consistent across several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Of course the return window has now closed, so I may just be out a significant amount of money.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid area, and my hair seemed to be protected from the humidity.</li>
            <li> HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS???  </li>
            <li> I figured it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to get her a new one immediately to fix my mistake.</li>
            <li> and I live in a humid climate, so</li>
            <li> It just happens that testing - not by me because my hair is not long enough but by Ms. D and our daughter - concluded that this is very much as good as it gets maybe with one little issue.</li>
            <li> What I especially like is the digital temperature control, that heats up very quickly like a truly professional model.  </li>
            <li> construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 356g (12.6 oz.), which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  </li>
            <li> Spending the extra money for a quality and professional straightener like the ISA is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Once I did that I was totally in love with this little iron!</li>
            <li> Definitely brush your hair first, and make sure that you don&#x27;t have any product left over that&#x27;s wet before using.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, I was finally able to get a straight look that I can wear outside!</li>
            <li> A good flat iron is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have found so far that is able to straighten my hair with minimal product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a digital readout so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it and so far no complaints (that&#x27;s an achievement in itself!)</li>
            <li> in all I would definitely recommend the Isa flat iron if you’re looking for shiny, smooth, bouncy salon quality hair from within the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li> The digital control allows for setting the exact temperature and will keep it there for the duration of your use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to learn to hold my hand higher on the straightener, which leads to me burning my hand occasionally.</li>
            <li> also feel that other straighteners actually create better curls.</li>
            <li> I first came across this at the salon where my stylist used it on me before a big event - my sister&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> There are other straighteners on the market for about the same price that are much better than this one (CHI, Sedu, etc.).</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s a screaming design flaw, considering it is such a basic piece of equipment, and that&#x27;s the most basic function.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about that long and my hair is still healthy, which hasn&#x27;t been the case for me with other high end straighteners in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sucker glides so easily through my hair too!</li>
            <li> The plates are made of high quality ceramic that heats evenly and smoothly distributes heat on your hair without snagging, pulling, or uneven results.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;ISA Professional Digital LCD Flat Iron Hair Straightener&amp;#34; has a temperature control option that she can use it with comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li> The buttons on the ISA are exactly where my thumb naturally lands and constantly get pressed accidentally.</li>
            <li> My first flat so I can&#x27;t compare it.</li>
            <li> They have it exactly where you are to hold a flat iron.</li>
            <li> the flat iron didn´t get as hot as it should,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this straightener to anyone that wants a long-lasting flat iron.</li>
            <li> and it was actually even better than her previous one because of the pin point temperature control that she did not have before.</li>
            <li> hair was very smooth and shiny after being straightened, usually it is type 3A curls, but you couldn&#x27;t tell that by looking at me today!</li>
            <li> Very sleek, and smaller than my old</li>
            <li> It is clear to read and tells you the temperature as it rises or lowers.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is naturally frizzy.</li>
            <li> My Onei is almost a year old and no problems.  </li>
            <li> I was rather surprised by the smoothness of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take away the natural shine in her hair.</li>
            <li> (Tourmaline emits the most negative ions when heated.)</li>
            <li> something my old straightener, which was at this price point – didn’t do.  </li>
            <li> When you use it the controls are near where you hold it</li>
            <li> This unit does not burn my hair as my old cheapo hair straightener did.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to spend my whole break waiting for it to turn on to the proper heat setting.</li>
            <li> but everything is working flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li> and it helped make my lifeless hair look alive again.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I wasted time and money buying cheap straighteners from drugstores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It glides from roots to end very well when you use smaller</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> , how much did your last salon appointment cost?</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my Wife as a gift of our last Anniversary and she really like it.</li>
            <li> and wow, I don&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Zero complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> and it is kind of irritating.</li>
            <li> I only give it two stars because the temperature gage only reads in Celsius and the buttons are right where you hold the straighter while using so</li>
            <li> And because these plates are solid tourmaline ceramic and do such an exceptional job of smoothing, you may find you need a lower setting than with your previous flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> flat iron does not get hot enough, did not get my hair straight, and the plates did not meet evenly or tight enough to give a smooth pass on a section of hair.</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron, I received this as a gift but gave it to my cousin because she has been focusing on her hair lately, and I was amazed at the quality of this thing.</li>
            <li> You could throw a new plastic bag on the unit we just returned and essentially pass it off as new.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another change I noticed from the previous model is how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li> The cord is extremely long which is a plus for me ,being from a large household I&#x27;m always moving.</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re going to pay a high price.  </li>
            <li> My old chi finally died, and I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> High quality ceramic feels very sturdy and I would expect it to last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using a ceramic or tourmaline straightener leaves the hair much shinier and smoother because the negative ions close the follicles and smooth the hair by neutralizing the positive charge present in dry or damaged</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessity for avoiding heat damaged hair over the long haul.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well but still prefer using my curling iron to straighten my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our testers&#x27; hair is long and straight</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to get the whole hair done.</li>
            <li> I run a small hair salon and this is the flat iron that most of my employees use.</li>
            <li> This particular flat iron has a spot where you can sit your thumb away from the controls.</li>
            <li> I like the fact you will be able to see any product build up to clean plates versus other flat irons with black on black; color also helps ensuring the width of the hair strand while you style is completely covered by the plates.&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> It makes my frizzy hair sleek and smooth, with only a few minutes every morning.</li>
            <li> One friend has thick smooth hair that&#x27;s almost impossibly naturally curly.</li>
            <li> One friend has thick smooth hair that&#x27;s almost impossibly naturally curly.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the plates are made of tourmaline which is preferable to the standard metal or even gold as it is far smoother and less likely to pull hair, it&#x27;s far more likely to just glide through and straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I first iron my whole head at 400 Fahrenheit, then do a second round to flip the edges at 150 or an even lower temperature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and small enough to take anywhere in a bag or purse if you are staying somewhere.</li>
            <li> friend with the super curly hair took the longest to finish because we had to use small sections since it is so curly naturally.</li>
            <li> friend with the super curly hair took the longest to finish because we had to use small sections since it is so curly naturally.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a new flat iron taking over.</li>
            <li> Dry, damaged hair is positively charged which leaves the hair follicles open.</li>
            <li> for it.scribed above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up very quickly with range of different temperatures and straightened her hair without trouble.</li>
            <li> Tourmaline - which produces negative ions which helps smooth out your hair follicles.</li>
            <li> As a newly natural, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different hair products and this is def one of my must haves!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone natural.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for customer support, 1 star for product design and apparently malfunction (2 separate issues).</li>
            <li> Other flat iron cords always get tangled which makes this flat iron unique for its swiveling cord</li>
            <li> It gets really hot obviously but it just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I expected it to...</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if the temperature is true to the setting either.  </li>
            <li> So you either need to hold it too far back - which doesn&#x27;t get a tight grip or above the buttons which can get really hot!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this flat iron, especially those of you on the fence</li>
            <li> She first noticed the box was slightly ajar and</li>
            <li> Her old Flat Iron went out and needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li> The ISA Professional Hair Straightener is a flat iron-style straightener with tourmaline ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> Very tech forward but does not straighten as well as other products on the market.</li>
            <li> My mom who&#x27;s an all natural girl hates flat ironing her hair, but used these once and asked to keep them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results with straightening and subtle curling</li>
            <li> Personally, I could tell right away from how those little plastic things were tied around the power cord..</li>
            <li> you are looking for flat iron hair straightener of this size, style and design, for use similar to what I have described above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had ones in the past where the ceramic coating flaked off the plate and it made me so mad; solid ceramic plates is the best</li>
            <li> every other one I&#x27;ve ever had, over my slightly curly, fine hair, I had to run the flat iron 1-2 times.  </li>
            <li> My last straightener barely functions.</li>
            <li> I like how high it heats up to, because my thick hair really needs a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> She was quite surprised that I actually bought her one and initially,I believe, she had low expectations about it since I know nothing about flat irons.</li>
            <li> I thought the previous model was fast, well this one is even faster.</li>
            <li> Does not warm up as quick as the babyliss brand.</li>
            <li> Not only is that horribly harsh on your hair but your hair should almost be so hot it&#x27;s almost on fire.</li>
            <li> I recommend that others with coarse mixed hair should put the heat on a little bit higher to reduce the straightening time.</li>
            <li> It also reduces very fast so no more hassle of waiting it</li>
            <li> prefer digital flat irons because you know actually what the temperature is at all times.</li>
            <li> and she uses a flat iron regularly to maintain her style.</li>
            <li> and she uses a flat iron regularly to maintain her style.</li>
            <li> ; if the supplier of this appliance can give the manufacturer some feedback for the next generation; please ask them to put the temperature dial ON THE SIDE of the flat iron</li>
            <li> So I went back and bought the flat iron and got my stylist to teach me how to use it and have been using it almost every day for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> is how I ruined my last flat iron.  </li>
            <li> There is also a hanging loop at the base of the cord which will let you hang a hot iron safely out of the way with a simple cup</li>
            <li> Basically, only the very front part of the iron actually properly closed around her hair, roughly half the size of the entire iron portion.</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high (today on Amazon it is $94.50).</li>
            <li> I straightened my hair on a daily basis for a very long time, and have used lots of different straighteners.</li>
            <li> was afraid she&#x27;d take forever to get ready to go out, but the ceramic heats up quickly and allows for rapid straightening.  </li>
            <li> Also the body does not heat up, even though it may get little warm behind the iron plates but not hot enough for you to get harmed.</li>
            <li> totally ridiculous to have the control right there.  </li>
            <li> Use small sections and glide the hair through, keeping the iron in motion the whole time.</li>
            <li> Use small sections and glide the hair through, keeping the iron in motion the whole time.</li>
            <li> Just received the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that the flat iron warms up very hot, but be careful not to touch the cord as the plates will melt it.  </li>
            <li> Within 1-2 strokes the hair goes flat n</li>
            <li> The flat iron itself is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> The temperature states it&#x27;s on 450, yet it takes twice as long to straighten my hair as when I use my roommates flatiron, where the temperature only goes up to 400.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned my hair time and time again with flat irons that come with the heat dial</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d never used a flat iron before</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d never used a flat iron before</li>
            <li> As you pull the flat iron, the ceramic seals each hair shaft so all frizz goes away</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry if you hear beeping if you accidentally touch the controls while flat ironing, the lock feature will keep the controls from being changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it swivels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can basically create any hair style with a flat.</li>
            <li> Had this flat iron three months now.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works on ALL hair types.</li>
            <li> of the features I appreciate about the Isa flat iron is the swivel cord attachment.</li>
            <li> $200 for a flat iron seemed like a lot, even for one that does curls too.</li>
            <li> I had the temp on 450 which is how I use all flat irons.</li>
            <li> Over a month ago I broke my Girlfriends flat iron when I knocked it over to the floor in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I know nothing about flat irons</li>
            <li> The flat iron arrived on time before I arrived to the United States, so I started using it immediately........</li>
            <li> I try to give this flat iron a chance by getting used to it</li>
            <li> I will now look for flat irons that the switch is on the inside.</li>
            <li> With my haircut most flat irons would leave my hair hard, dull, and motionless.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review to let anyone know that this is a truly well built and efficient flat iron that will take care of you strongest curl!</li>
            <li> There is no way that this flat iron has a temp of 450!</li>
            <li> Although it is &amp;#34;pricey,&amp;#34; this flat iron does the trick!  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about paying so much for a device I&#x27;d been using for years and had always bought wherever for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The flat power cable is 10 ft. long and resists tangling.  </li>
            <li> other friend owns a high end flat iron that she uses daily and which cost $300 when she bought it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> other friend owns a high end flat iron that she uses daily and which cost $300 when she bought it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It was working just fine, until two days ago when it began shutting itself off randomly and for no reason.</li>
            <li> The other friend is African American and has salon straightened hair</li>
            <li> The other friend is African American and has salon straightened hair</li>
            <li> This flat iron works like a dream!!!</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast and it has reduced my frizz by at least 80%.</li>
            <li> A bit complex, but it really did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does not really warm up that much</li>
            <li> Overall I rate this absolutely above average.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> power cord is quite long and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned this straightener for that long</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair</li>
            <li> Long power cord gives you ample mobility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not going to sugarcoat it, I&#x27;ve been a Chi fan for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift, and you should have seen her eyes open wide when she undid the wrapping.  </li>
            <li> (and we waited too long to return it) was the button placement.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone and if you forget to shut it down, no worries it will shut down on</li>
            <li> I tried holding it back and it would not clamp together tight enough to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> This isa takes just literally seconds to heat up, minutes to go thru my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> so you do press the buttons while your straightening which can be super annoying if suddenly you lose heat or power because you keep accidentally pressing the dang buttons haha.</li>
            <li> Additionally the location of the digital controls are poorly placed right where your hand OR fingers need to press to hold the plates tightly</li>
            <li> The only complaint she has is that the 1&amp;#34; plate is a bit big for her liking and she would have preferred a smaller size.  </li>
            <li> She always had a problem with setting the temp on other flat irons but this one has a screen allowing you to set the correct temp.</li>
            <li> My first thought about this was that I like the color scheme and the sleek thin design.</li>
            <li> Plus, the temperature degrees confused me at first.  </li>
            <li> shiny...and works amazingly on dry as well as wet hair...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not enough to justify something less than a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> , I only have one little problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> feel a little cheated that I paid $200 in the salon, but after 3 years of use I&#x27;ve definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She started using this after her previous GHD flat iron stopped working, and she has raved about it.</li>
            <li> I have updated my review from a 4 to 5 star since the flat iron has been remodeled to to show the temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius (the video shows the previous model).</li>
            <li> When air or blow dried, it puffs up to dizzying proportions, making it appear big and voluminous.</li>
            <li> She immediately noticed that as soon as she closed the iron around her hair</li>
            <li> It makes the whole straightening process frustrating.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to rely on a dial, or worry about it slipping.</li>
            <li> I hate using more heat than I need to, and I appreciate that the iron tells me when the heat actually reaches to the lower temperature</li>
            <li> There is a lock button but who can remember which button to hold down and for how long.  </li>
            <li> mentioned, the digital control buttons are placed in the perfectly wrong place and are always tweaked by my hand and fingers, but the unit&#x27;s work-around actually works: Once the flat iron heats up to the desired temperature, double clicking the power button will lock the controls to disable the buttons so you do not accidentally change the temperature.</li>
            <li> Did not realize how outdated my old flat iron was!</li>
            <li> I tested it out on a few friends and they wanted to take the flat iron from me.</li>
            <li> The explanation of how to use the lock feature is confusing and is hidden in tiny print in the middle of a wall of text.</li>
            <li> I cant put alot of oil and products in my hair because it gets stiff, this iron smooths my ends and my hair has grown alot due to me clipping my ends, heat protection and this flat iron every two weeks!</li>
            <li> and she says should wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything other than this one.  </li>
            <li> no more pinched hair from low quality metal plates.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The cord is heavy duty, long</li>
            <li> Besides straightening you can curl, spiral, bend and even flip your hair, the possibilities are endless - let your imagination take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a two-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other irons are a bit tricky to use</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers when they say a)</li>
            <li> Just as other people noted and I should have listened....</li>
            <li> I have frizzy long hair and find it very difficult to to strengthen, I was chosen to review this ISA Professional digital LCD flat iron and let me tell you</li>
            <li> I live in a very old house and have a meager number of electrical sockets in odd places.</li>
            <li> In the long run I was actually wasting money because I had to keep replacing them every other month and not to mention that they provided a serious amount of damage for my hair.</li>
            <li> She also says that it is well made compared to the other flat irons she has owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, it just looks like a quality product which is what I can&#x27;t say about other ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> and she was clearly upset about no longer having a flat iron and yelled at me because of how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking poofy, frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> I have pinched my fingers badly (hard) numerous time by this design.  </li>
            <li> and I have to clamp it hard and pass over my hair multiple times.</li>
            <li> not worth the cost</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> It works good but the button placement is horrible</li>
            <li> I expected to have this straightener for a few years, not 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly and somewhat coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone who commented about the buttons being located in a terrible spot were right, the first run at using this</li>
            <li> Ceramic also helps the iron glide down your hair with no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> wish you could get a tighter clamp down on the hair.</li>
            <li> she thinks it&#x27;s going down hill now after maybe 2 years.    </li>
            <li> your fingers do touch the on and off, up and down buttons when you are styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like I have to work less using a wider one.</li>
            <li> less well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> less well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This assists in having less breakage or burning your hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see Less breakage in my hair now that I changed to this straightener.  </li>

            <li> I have long, thick, black, Puerto Rican hair (I am Mrs. Brown).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;My hair is long, thick, and curly and it got the job</li>
            <li> I usually tend to have a hard time finding a reliable straightener since I have coarse African-American hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an iron before, it will take a little practice to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an iron before, it will take a little practice to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this product, definitely not worth the price!</li>
            <li> This straightener has helped reduce my frizz a little bit.</li>
            <li> There may be a way because I saw a little (F) on the backlit temperature display</li>
            <li> The heat does not damage my hair and it last for at least 3 days!</li>
            <li> but it was little curly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick hair, and have had trouble in the past with flat irons making my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> I had read one reviewer before had this issue, but I thought that if it wasn&#x27;t a very common one, then must not be a big issue.  </li>
            <li> Too bad companies don&#x27;t stand behind their product for more than 30 days.</li>
            <li> My wife has chin/neck length hair and wears her hair messy with a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> heating plates are solid ceramic, not metal with a thin ceramic coat as I have seen some hair straighteners for sale at the mall.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Once it heats up, quickly double click the power button to lock the heat on so that you do not accidentally change or power off the unit as you are flat ironing your hair since the buttons are somewhat in an awkward position.</li>
            <li> Metal is generally the least expensive (except for titanium) and is generally considered to be very hard on hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a curling iron for years to tame my locks and keep them under control.</li>
            <li> I have dark, thick hair, and this straightner does not straightnen well at all.</li>
            <li> To power off, just hold the power button down for at least 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clamp very tight.  </li>
            <li> this was at the least a previously used/returned item.</li>
            <li> In addition to doing a terrible job of straightening my hair (after I blew it out with a round brush and blow drier!), the buttons are in a terribly inconvenient location and I constantly was pressing them while straightening causing them to beep endlessly, which got old really fast.</li>
            <li> the temp button is located where you would usually place your thumb, so it keeps changing the temp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not pleased with the heat settings.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t using small sections since I&#x27;m used to my wider one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The swivel connection (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s called) to the unit is a godsend; I usually wrap myself with cords because I keep changing hands, so that helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always having to use extension cords for appliances because of where my few outlets are located but not with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it gets up to 450.</li>
            <li> So I told them my routine and this was the missing link!</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s because my Chi is understating the temperature on the readout or if the ISA is overstating the temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> Usually I have to redo my hair every morning, but the day after using this iron I got up</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no more tangling.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I like this straightener, overall, but the buttons on the outside of it are annoying as I&#x27;m always pushing them when trying to use it.</li>
            <li> I constantly kept pressing the buttons, which can get annoying after awhile even though I know it won&#x27;t turn it off from a single press.</li>
            <li> Hard to use</li>
            <li> Buttons feel responsive and durable; they are hard plastic and not a rubber overlay that will crack with use.</li>
            <li> Regardless I am stuck with this for at least 6 months to get some of the use for the price.</li>
            <li> this one doesn&#x27;t heat properly, the on off switch is awkward and the swivel can pinch your fingers as well as catch and pull your hair.  </li>
            <li> It sucks do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Even on thick hair.</li>
            <li> pivoting plates and spacing makes straightening thick hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> but the cord is quite thick</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that the included user&#x27;s manual doesn&#x27;t really outline the features as well as it could, partly because the layout is horrible.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and straightened very small amounts of hair, and i still had to go over it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with this straightener.</li>
            <li> now we&#x27;re too late to return the thing!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is too late for a return</li>
            <li> The button placement is frustrating.</li>
            <li> : The digital temperature dial is in a VERY BAD position.</li>
            <li> Others were saying that the buttons are in wrong place</li>
            <li> The controls buttons get in the way, I had to return it because of the weird placement.</li>
            <li> Don’t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> wife just received this (expensive) iron and immediately ran to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> the buttons are in a weird place and b)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the controller issue and the heat issue made this product a loser for me.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s including the expensive one that my sister has that she got for over two hundred bucks at a salon.</li>
            <li> and it is always difficult to find one</li>
            <li> This straightener has a horrible design, with the control buttons on the outside.</li>
            <li> the sensor is in the way , so holding it becomes complicated.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> the bad thing about this straightener is that when you are using it you hit the buttons, thats uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It drives me crazy##</li>
            <li> 1 - the item mentioned by others already - that the controls are in a really awkward place, 2.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was really disappointing!</li>
            <li> were part of the features that made me go for it because I can get very careless at times</li>
            <li> Its almost impossible to use this product with out hitting the buttons and turning it off.</li>
            <li> but it was impossible</li>
            <li> and it was impossible to contact the seller to make valid my two year guarantee, there were no telephone numbers neither a web site to contact them, nothing came inside the box, I had to contact Amazon explaining my problem</li>
            <li> I felt really bad about it</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will say that if there was no lock on temperature once set I would be very unhappy since I hit the button when using this flatiron.  </li>
            <li> Even when you lock it every time you accidentally hit the controls while using it there is a beep - that is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> This hair straitner is crap.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Being in Florida makes it impossible to do anything else with it, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from trying!</li>
            <li> But i am beyond disappointed!</li>
            <li> horrible, because of where the temperature controls are where your fingers have to hold the apparatus.</li>
            <li> hate it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair or leave it with that nasty burnt smell.</li>
            <li> This is the worst straightner I have had!</li>
            <li> the buttons are in a terrible spot!</li>
            <li> The worst iron ever.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife so all of this is from her.  She tells me that this is an amazing flat iron.  It makes her hair straighter longer and she says should wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything other than this one.  She also says that it is well made compared to the other flat irons she has owned in the past.  If you can&#x27;t figure out by now, this is a great product and I definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re in the market for one of these.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s been using this for awhile now and has had great results. It has a temperature gauge and the ability to set it at a pretty precise level. It works quickly and has a ridged grip area at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough and it has held up well for many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair straighteners on the market today! It does not need much time to get your hair straightened. Very little time needed is a great reason to buy this. This flat iron has many cool features that others don&#x27;t have. You are allowed to chose the temperate you desire and straighten your hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> A good flat iron is hard to find. I seemed to go through the cheap ones like nothing, so I decided to invest in the ISA Professional Flat Iron. The ceramic plates were top of the line, and the digital display made adjusting the heat effortless. I have naturally thick hair, and have had trouble in the past with flat irons making my hair frizzy. With the ISA, my hair stayed smooth all day. The fact that it came with a 2 year warranty is just a cherry on top. I would highly recommend this straightener to anyone that wants a long-lasting flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it. The flat iron heats up very quickly with range of different temperatures and straightened her hair without trouble. Its very easy to use and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used a curling iron for years to tame my locks and keep them under control. Because my hair is naturally frizzy. When air or blow dried, it puffs up to dizzying proportions, making it appear big and voluminous. I&#x27;ve used a few hair straighteners in my time but this hair straightener from ISA does an excellent job straightening and shaping my hair. In no time at all, I had straight, almost professional salon style hair – something I have never been able to create on my own. It straightened my hair and made it very shiny and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself is very easy to use. It provides a stylish and elegant look in a relatively short period of time. The most compelling feature of this hair straightening include e.g 100% Solid Tourmaline ceramic plates; Fast and safe straightening, curls, waves; 360 degree no tangle cord; Digital Temperature control up to 220 degree Celsius; Full 2 year warranty. This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds it was ready for use and the cable is really long about 10-12 feet in length and easy for me to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair straightener from ISA because it works really well and is designed with features that make it easy to use for all ages. It is even shipped in packaging that is both frustration-free and attractive</li>
            <li> Anyone who knows me, knows that I have always had curly hair. Being in Florida makes it impossible to do anything else with it, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from trying! The temperature control was a God-send and the plates don&#x27;t pull on my hair. With a little practice, I was finally able to get a straight look that I can wear outside! And the ability to curl my hair is a nice bonus to refresh the curls at the end of the day to go out.</li>
            <li> Wow where to start!!! This product is truly amazing. I have owned many flat iron in my life but none have been better than this one so far. I have very strong curly hair and like to straighten them up before going out or to work for my particular hairstyle. This iron heats up very fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to obtain the perfect temperature when you are in a rush. The digital LCD screen is very nice and let&#x27;s you know exactly how hot it is. The ceramic plates are really what you want to look for when buying a high quality flat iron and this one has exactly that. I wrote this review to let anyone know that this is a truly well built and efficient flat iron that will take care of you strongest curl! Highly recommended to anyone and if you forget to shut it down, no worries it will shut down on it&#x27;s own to prevent burning anything around.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed. Kept pressing the temperature setting buttons as it is placed in the area where it is most comfortable to hold.  It should have been placed somewhere where it is not a nuisance to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Just received the flat iron. I&#x27;ve used it one time and it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still partial to my old Chi straightener but couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on this straightener. Works as promised with no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I run a small hair salon and this is the flat iron that most of my employees use. The ISA heats up very quickly and has worked great for all hair types that we have come across in the salon. It works better than our curling irons too!  This iron definitely takes the cake!</li>
            <li> I usually tend to have a hard time finding a reliable straightener since I have coarse African-American hair. This is the only one I have found so far that is able to straighten my hair with minimal product. I recommend that others with coarse mixed hair should put the heat on a little bit higher to reduce the straightening time. I will be sticking with the ISA for a while.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife at Christmas time.  Her old Flat Iron went out and needed a replacement.  This has nice features like adjusting the temp setting and a swivel cord to help with straightening.  My wife has chin/neck length hair and wears her hair messy with a lot of product.  After a year of use it still works well and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;gummed&amp;#34; up at the plates.  The only complaint she has is that the 1&amp;#34; plate is a bit big for her liking and she would have preferred a smaller size.  The one complaint I have is that the flat iron warms up very hot, but be careful not to touch the cord as the plates will melt it.  Wish the cord was a little more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> Its great for my thin blonde hair, it doesn’t pinch or damages the hair and heats up very fast. If you press twice “on” button it will lock it self so if you touch while using it after setting up specific heat it wont effect it. Others were saying that the buttons are in wrong place but if you lock it there is no problem, and then unlock it by pressing “on” button twice again. This iron is perfect.</li>
            <li> Shoulda gone with the chi again for the same price as this one. It works good but the button placement is horrible so you do press the buttons while your straightening which can be super annoying if suddenly you lose heat or power because you keep accidentally pressing the dang buttons haha.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is absolutely perfect! First of all is ready for use extremely fast! Is not wasting my time and definitely it saves my money from electricity. I use it to straight my hair and also to make waves on it! It has 360 degree full swivel so I never worry about the cable anymore when I make my hair curly. I&#x27;m also left handed and all I can say is that it&#x27;s super easy to work with and I love the digital display! It shows the temperature and it&#x27;s easy to control it. I make my hair easier and faster then ever!</li>
            <li> Amazing straightener. Even on thick hair.</li>
            <li> This ISA hair straightener is the best that I have used at the moment, A friend recommended it to me, but Before getting it, I had to google it and learn more about it [yes, I like to be sure about whatever I invest my money on] and I began to see so many positive reviews, This was when I knew I had come to the end of the road when it comes to looking for a very good hair straightener. The fact that it came with a 2yr warranty and a 1 Hour Auto shut off Safety Feature were part of the features that made me go for it because I can get very careless at times but  thank goodness, it is still working. I share it with my niece and we use it like 5 or 6 times a week and it is still kicking strong. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this straightener to peeps out there, if it wasn&#x27;t good for me, I wouldn&#x27;t dare recommend it.</li>
            <li> The controls buttons get in the way, I had to return it because of the weird placement.</li>
            <li> This is surely gonna be of great use to you if you prefer your hair spooky straight... Within 1-2 strokes the hair goes flat n shiny...and works amazingly on dry as well as wet hair...Worth buying</li>
            <li> My sister and mom uses this. I&#x27;m no hair professional, but they love it because of the sleek design and how well it does its job. It makes their hair look great. I wonder if this works for guys haha.</li>
            <li> works like a charm. the temp button is located where you would usually place your thumb, so it keeps changing the temp. You can lock in the temp so the thumb touching does not change the temp, but you still hear the beep each time you hit it and hitting it twice in quick succession unlocks the keys.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product! It heats up so fast and it has reduced my frizz by at least 80%. I live in a humid area, and my hair seemed to be protected from the humidity. I like how high it heats up to, because my thick hair really needs a lot of heat. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this ISA!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the flat iron.  Don’t get me wrong it works just not as well as the Onei I gave to my granddaughter because her Onei died after 3 months.  My Onei is almost a year old and no problems.  The ISA has design flaws that they are aware of.  That is the biggest issue for me.  The controls are not played in the best area.  Unless you lock it the controls you can accidentally change the setting or turn the iron off.  The feel of the iron doesn’t seem right.  Even when you lock it every time you accidentally hit the controls while using it there is a beep - that is annoying.  I’m not sure if the temperature is true to the setting either.  Regardless I am stuck with this for at least 6 months to get some of the use for the price.</li>
            <li> Very fast heat and does a great job taking all curl out and making my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Lovely hair straightener, I used this straightener almost every twice a week for work and I have feel in love with it so far! The heat control on this is not only safe but it allows me to get the right temperature for my type of hair. It always comes out very smooth and straight, at work my friends tell me it seems like I go to the salon every week! I am very satisfied by the quality, I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome..nice and hot, excellent</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8efeffee053ce8cfc1ef8bee5e55569]] Solid Tourmaline Ceramic plates protect your hair and leave it silky smooth, You won&#x27;t believe how silky smooth your hair will be, no more pinched hair from low quality metal plates. Tourmaline ceramic is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not break or pull while using this iron.  I was rather surprised by the smoothness of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is a very good feature of this iron and the temperature sets up very fast. It also reduces very fast so no more hassle of waiting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even get curl by twisting your hands while using this. Also the body does not heat up, even though it may get little warm behind the iron plates but not hot enough for you to get harmed. Because that is where I was holding the iron while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE- I have updated this feature on my video too, that if you double press the power button, the temperature will get locked and so even if your fingers touch the temperature settings they won&#x27;t change. (a very useful feature)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no doubt the iron is of premium quality and very very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by- Shazia</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this flat iron. Doesn&#x27;t heat up. It does the same job as the $30 Walmart iron I replaced it for... Will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> Omg, I love how my hair feels when its straightened now! My hair feels more smooth and looks fabulous! And don&#x27;t get me started on how it curls my hair! Would recommend this to any girl who needs a new one!</li>
            <li> The flat iron itself is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Its everything you could wish for, I only have one little problem.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for the hot bit to be bigger so that I could straighten more of my hair at one time.</li>
            <li> my wife and daughter absolutely love it; it works so much better than their previous one.  It heats up quickly, is comfortable to hold, has a nice design and does a great job straitening hair (cut their time in half over the previous one)</li>
            <li> I should have read previous reviews more carefully, as the placement of the control buttons are a huge annoyance. I&#x27;m also not pleased with the heat settings. The temperature states it&#x27;s on 450, yet it takes twice as long to straighten my hair as when I use my roommates flatiron, where the temperature only goes up to 400. If this product was priced around $40 it would be fine. At over $100 I expect it to work better than a $50 straightener I bought at Target.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It makes my frizzy hair sleek and smooth, with only a few minutes every morning. It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair damaged at all. I would recommend. Better than all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use! Superb product</li>
            <li> My first thought about this was that I like the color scheme and the sleek thin design. It&#x27;s easy to hold and small enough to take anywhere in a bag or purse if you are staying somewhere. It&#x27;s light weight and sturdy. I really like the idea of the 1 Hour Auto shut off Safety Feature, in case I forget to shut it off. I also like the 360 degree full swivel no tangle cord, which makes it easy when you are moving around in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I hear that unlike metal or ceramic-coated plates, the tourmaline ceramic plates transfers heat faster and more evenly. I do like the neon colored LCD display so you can see it even in low light and it can be set any temperature between 175 to 450 F by pusing the arrow buttons. And the company guarantees this hair straightner for 2 full years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like wider straighteners. I have long hair and I feel like I have to work less using a wider one. Also, I did not like how I kept hitting buttons while holding it. Also it felt like it kept pulling my hair but that&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t using small sections since I&#x27;m used to my wider one. But I did love how fast it heated up. You can also see the temp rising on the screen too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this straightener!  It has a wide range of temperatures, from warm to super hot real fast.You can create waves or curls but I like it best for straightening.There is no frizz afterward which if you straighten your hair weekly like i do helps soooo much.It also has a digital readout so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.It heats up super fast and works great with my hair type even if you only use it for special occasions, it just makes your hair prettier.It&#x27;s easy to use and makes your hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have always used Chi flatirons, the ISA flatiron was advertised as tourmaline ceramic which is rated as being very good for your hair.  This along with ability to set temperature is why I chose this product.  I will say that if there was no lock on temperature once set I would be very unhappy since I hit the button when using this flatiron.  My hair does glide very nicely thru the flatiron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my straightener since the end of December. It was working just fine, until two days ago when it began shutting itself off randomly and for no reason. I was able to turn in back on each time, but it continued to do this. Today it shut off repeatedly, and then just wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. This was supposed to be a quality straightener, and was priced accordingly. I expected to have this straightener for a few years, not 3 months. Of course the return window has now closed, so I may just be out a significant amount of money. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase. There is no way that this flat iron has a temp of 450! I guess I&#x27;ll use as a backup but I&#x27;m buying a different one. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Putting the controls on top means that every time you do a pass of the iron on your hair you hit the power button.</li>
            <li> Update: Was contacted by customer service and they promptly apologized for the mishap and offered a full refund. Can&#x27;t help but update the review from a 1 to 3 star because of the customer service. They also informed me of a reason why the iron itself would not have proper \\&quot;packaging\\&quot; - a plastic wrapping or a seal or something - but I can&#x27;t say I agree too much with it as it still leaves the opportunity for things to happen. You could throw a new plastic bag on the unit we just returned and essentially pass it off as new. Ah well, I suppose that&#x27;s not for me to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife just received this (expensive) iron and immediately ran to try it out. She first noticed the box was slightly ajar and the plastic inside holding the iron was very wrinkled. There&#x27;s no sealed plastic packaging or some sort of manufacturer seal, not even on the outside box, so we basically knew right away this was at the least a previously used/returned item. Personally, I could tell right away from how those little plastic things were tied around the power cord.. Still, she gave it a try to see if it was a functioning unit. She immediately noticed that as soon as she closed the iron around her hair (sorry, I&#x27;m a guy, this is the best I can describe it) there was a gap between the clamps near the handle side. Basically, only the very front part of the iron actually properly closed around her hair, roughly half the size of the entire iron portion. I guess there&#x27;s the reason this was returned in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken units happen, what can you do.</li>
            <li> horrible, because of where the temperature controls are where your fingers have to hold the apparatus. hate it! don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Hard to use......don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> As a newly natural, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different hair products and this is def one of my must haves!</li>
            <li> I love, love this hair straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was looking for a hair straightener recently and purchased this unit on the advice of a good friend. First thing I noticed is that the box; it&#x27;s an elegant glossy white gift box that slides open. I keep all my hair styling equipment in a bag because I travel a lot, so I re-purposed the box to store jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating plates are solid ceramic, not metal with a thin ceramic coat as I have seen some hair straighteners for sale at the mall. I&#x27;ve had ones in the past where the ceramic coating flaked off the plate and it made me so mad; solid ceramic plates is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is bright and the temperature rises fast and consistently. I love how the display shows the temperature realtime as you raise it or lower it. I have thinner, curlier hair on top and almost wavy, thicker hair closest to the neck and I live in humid weather - so quick, consistent, easy to change temperature control is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting plates and spacing makes straightening thick hair a breeze. It doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair and the hair shaft shows no damage. Plates are super smooth. Curls are bouncy and easy to do just by turning the wrist. Buttons feel responsive and durable; they are hard plastic and not a rubber overlay that will crack with use. You can lock the temperature and it makes a sound when you unlock it, so you notice it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is quite long and sturdy. The swivel connection (don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s called) to the unit is a godsend; I usually wrap myself with cords because I keep changing hands, so that helps a lot. I think that because the swivel connection is angled that it will prevent cord damage but the cord is quite thick so I don&#x27;t think that would be an issue either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this hair straightener: it&#x27;s easy to use and gives gorgeous results!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new hair straightener and this one looked really good to me. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I bought it and I can&#x27;t complain at all. It&#x27;s not getting too hot for your hair to burn. Overall it&#x27;s a really great hair straightener. I recommend this hair straightener to anyone who is looking to buy one!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, locks at temp, does the job.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a gift since her Chi straightener was dying on her and she loved it! This is an excellent quality straightener, especially for such a good price. It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair or leave it with that nasty burnt smell. It also leaves the hair pretty straight so she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once.  I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take away the natural shine in her hair. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, they ship extremely fast!</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price.  I got this as a b-day gift for my girlfriend, and she&#x27;s really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid she&#x27;d take forever to get ready to go out, but the ceramic heats up quickly and allows for rapid straightening.  A pleasant surprise for her, and for me as well. :)</li>
            <li> This is the worst straightner I have had! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Although it is &amp;#34;pricey,&amp;#34; this flat iron does the trick!  My hair is quite wavy, but easily damaged.  What I especially like is the digital temperature control, that heats up very quickly like a truly professional model.  Consequently, it isn&#x27;t necessary to go over and over the sections of strands to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s amazing for your hair, but didn&#x27;t come with the hot chick 🐥.</li>
            <li> The digital temperature control is awesome. I&#x27;ve burned my hair time and time again with flat irons that come with the heat dial and now I can set the temp just right. I also like the fact that it heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Compact and heats up quickly. Just make sure to lock the buttons once it reaches your desired heat level.</li>
            <li> The ISA Professional Hair Straightener is a flat iron-style straightener with tourmaline ceramic plates. It also has some unique features that make styling your hair easier and more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron straighteners consist of two flat plates which are heated and then sections of hair are slid between them to straighten and smooth the hair. The plates are made of a variety of materials - metal, ceramic, tourmaline or a combination of those. Metal is generally the least expensive (except for titanium) and is generally considered to be very hard on hair. Ceramic is much smoother and lets hair slide easily between the plates. Tourmaline is a silicate that, when crushed to a fine powder and then added ceramic coatings on the plates or baked on the plates by itself, makes a very smooth surface on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic and tourmaline are also considered superior because when heated, they emit negative ions. (Tourmaline emits the most negative ions when heated.) Dry, damaged hair is positively charged which leaves the hair follicles open. Using a ceramic or tourmaline straightener leaves the hair much shinier and smoother because the negative ions close the follicles and smooth the hair by neutralizing the positive charge present in dry or damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ISA straightener features SOLID tourmaline ceramic plates. Many plates that claim to be  tourmaline or ceramic are actually metal plates with a ceramic/tourmaline coating baked on. This coating can chip off easily and damage hair as it glides over the chipped areas. A solid tourmaline ceramic plate will never chip or peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates on the ISA iron actually swivel, too! I noticed right away how easily my hair ran through the iron. Then I looked closely at the plates and saw that each one can rock back and forth in place, making sure your hair is never pulled or yanked no matter what position your arm is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also features adjustable temperature setting - from 175F to 425F. This is an absolute necessity for avoiding heat damaged hair over the long haul. You should start out at the lowest temperature setting and gradually increase it until you find the lowest setting that will straighten and smooth your hair satisfactorily. Different hair types require different temperatures. And because these plates are solid tourmaline ceramic and do such an exceptional job of smoothing, you may find you need a lower setting than with your previous flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button and the temperature adjustment buttons are located right where your hand goes when using the iron. The temperature is displayed in a bright LED readout. This is great, but you will notice that during use, it&#x27;s easy to hit the buttons and change the temp. ISA addressed this by including a lock mode. Simply set the desired temperature and then press the power button twice very quickly. The LED screen will display a locked lock. When you&#x27;re done, press the power button twice quickly and the screen will display an unlocked lock. To power off, just hold the power button down for at least 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a sleep function which automatically turns the iron off after 50 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 10 foot power cord! I live in a very old house and have a meager number of electrical sockets in odd places. I&#x27;m always having to use extension cords for appliances because of where my few outlets are located but not with this one! And the power cord swivels 360 degrees so it never gets tangled up as you use it. There is also a hanging loop at the base of the cord which will let you hang a hot iron safely out of the way with a simple cup hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the included user&#x27;s manual doesn&#x27;t really outline the features as well as it could, partly because the layout is horrible. The explanation of how to use the lock feature is confusing and is hidden in tiny print in the middle of a wall of text. There is actually more info about the product and usage on the Amazon product page!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the iron on my own hair and two friends the first day I got it. My own hair is color treated and tends toward being coarse, wiry and frizzy. One friend has thick smooth hair that&#x27;s almost impossibly naturally curly. The other friend is African American and has salon straightened hair and she uses a flat iron regularly to maintain her style. I was surprised that each one of us ended up with smooth, straightened hair that had a lot of shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend with the super curly hair took the longest to finish because we had to use small sections since it is so curly naturally. However, she was thrilled! She&#x27;d never used a flat iron before and she was astounded that she could get such smooth, straight results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other friend owns a high end flat iron that she uses daily and which cost $300 when she bought it a few years ago. She was very enthusiastic about this iron because it gave her the same results and she loved the easy-to-read temperature. Her hair looked glossy and smooth when she was done. She also mentioned that because African Americans often have to use a lot of moisturizer and other products in their hair, it&#x27;s important to clean the plates after every use to avoid product building up and baking onto the plates, which will make them work less well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own hair slid easily through the plates and came out straight and smooth and glossy. I even used the lowest temperature setting!  I was also able to get a nice curve at the bottom simply by twisting my wrist when I got to the end of each strand. And the smoothness remains even in my hot, humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is not like a curling iron. Use small sections and glide the hair through, keeping the iron in motion the whole time. Never stop in one place. If you&#x27;ve never used an iron before, it will take a little practice to get the hang of it but if you want to be able to wear a smooth, straight hairstyle no matter what your natural hair type is, this straightener by ISA is a top of the line tool at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.o about the product and usage on the Amazon product page!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the iron on my own hair and two friends the first day I got it.

            <li> This hair straightener from ISA does an excellent job straightening and shaping hair.  It has state-of-the art 7/8 in. x 3 1/2. floating plates made of tourmaline ceramic, and they heat up fast.  The temperature adjusts from 80 to 220 degrees Celsius in 5 degree increments (equivalent to 176 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit with 9 degree increments).  The liquid crystal display is easy to read and the controls are easy to use.  Tap the power button twice to lock or unlock the current temperature and press it for two seconds to power off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 356g (12.6 oz.), which is light enough to use for hours without strain.  The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control.  The flat power cable is 10 ft. long and resists tangling.  The connector has a 120 degree angle, strain relief, an eyelet for hanging, and swivels infinitely.  The plug is polarized and there is an automatic shutoff for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this hair straightener because it works very well and is designed with features that make it easy to use.  It is even shipped in packaging that is both frustration-free and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She started using this after her previous GHD flat iron stopped working, and she has raved about it. The plates are solid ceramic, unlike cheaper lighter materials that several flattening irons come with. She uses it to flatten or straighten her hair and it does a wonderful job in less than 5 minutes. The device has a decent sized display that allows you to set your desired temperature, and my wife has found her desired setting to be consistent across several weeks of use. Just remember to double click the controls to lock the temperature of your choice. I believe the iron can be used for curls as well, but my wife hasn&#x27;t used that feature just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - solid good quality product from a manufacturer that has been very responsive to questions about using it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had my ISA straightener for 2.5 years.  It still works like the day I received it.  I like the size and the digital number display.  It heats up quickly and runs smoothly through my hair.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love, love this hair straightener! I totally recommend it: it&#x27;s easy to use and gives good results! ! !</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.  It has a vast range of temperatures, from curling iron hot to super hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can create waves or curls but I like it best for straightening.  As you pull the flat iron, the ceramic seals each hair shaft so all frizz goes away and the gloss is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a digital readout so you know your exact heat and when to begin if it is preheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and truly works wonders--even if you only use it for special occasions and limited glamorous evenings out, it just makes hair prettier. Period.  Easy to use, easy to grasp, more gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair straightener provided by ISA</li>
            <li> This ceramic hair straightener works. Period. It heated up quickly to a temperature that was perfect for our daughter&#x27;s use, and I even had to adjust it down a bit for myself. This flat iron is easy to hold and easy to use, and performed the job very well. Yes, the placement of the digital controls is a design-issue that needs a rethink, but the unit has a work-around that works. If you are looking for a hair straightener then I can recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds it was ready for use. 30 seconds tops. My hair is thin so I actually had to turn the heat down to 180 degrees, and that worked perfectly. The weight and balance are just right, and the unit is comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, the digital control buttons are placed in the perfectly wrong place and are always tweaked by my hand and fingers, but the unit&#x27;s work-around actually works: Once the flat iron heats up to the desired temperature, double clicking the power button will lock the controls to disable the buttons so you do not accidentally change the temperature. I found that this worked well, though the buttons still kept beeping at me every time I touched them. When done, I double clicked the power button to remove the button lock, then then clicked it once again to turn the power off. A bit complex, but it really did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice looking unit that feels good in the hand. The documentation notes that this item includes a two year warranty, so if an issue arises within that time period I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this hair straightener gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for flat iron hair straightener of this size, style and design, for use similar to what I have described above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.scribed above, and can put up with a little design quirk that really does not hamper operation, then I absolutely recommend this unit based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
            <li> Smooth and beautiful on the very first try. Definitely brush your hair first, and make sure that you don&#x27;t have any product left over that&#x27;s wet before using.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the wife! I got it as a replacement to replace the one I accidentally broke. She loves it and so far no complaints (that&#x27;s an achievement in itself!) and I did overhear her recommending it to her sisters. I guess this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> One of the best styling items in the market right now for women. Bought one for my wife, EXCELLENT GIFT! A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the feel of this tourmaline hair straightener. It just doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as a GHD.&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it, and the light weight actually helps with arm fatigue while straightening sections of longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;And for whatever reason, the plates glide effortlessly through your hair. Zero friction. It smoothed out all the tatty ends, making my fragile hair look healthier and silkier. If your hair isn&#x27;t in the best condition, this straightener can help it look better.&lt;br /&gt;It heats quickly and evenly, from 175 to 425 degrees. I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing it as hot as 425, but it shows the range of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, it&#x27;s easy to see almost any color of hair on the vivid red plates...important if you are trying to be super precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test product supplied for review</li>
            <li> flat iron does not get hot enough, did not get my hair straight, and the plates did not meet evenly or tight enough to give a smooth pass on a section of hair. Additionally the location of the digital controls are poorly placed right where your hand OR fingers need to press to hold the plates tightly so it is constantly beeping and changing the heat setting.</li>
            <li> Well I was looking to update my hair straightener.. I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one than the ISA professional flat iron..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair straightener has some great features. I like the lcd display. Very sleek, and smaller than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the 10ft cord. It heats up really fast.. This hair straightener is an all around great choice.. My hair is silky smooth after using it, all my girlfriends want one...  I&#x27;m glad I splurged, and spent a few more bucks, to got a great product. Very Satisfied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this flat iron as it has so many great reviews. I purchased it after my InfraShine burned out and was so excited to try it out. Sadly, it was really disappointing! I have fairly curly hair which the InfraShine made beautifully soft, shiny and perfectly straight. The Isa didn&#x27;t even come close. It left my hair looking poofy, frizzy and dull. In addition to doing a terrible job of straightening my hair (after I blew it out with a round brush and blow drier!), the buttons are in a terribly inconvenient location and I constantly was pressing them while straightening causing them to beep endlessly, which got old really fast. I would never buy this product again and I am so happy to have returned it!</li>
            <li> PROS: Very nice fast heating &amp; LOVE the temperature adjustment for various styles. Sleek and very light weight. I like the lock in feature of the temperature and the swivel cable. Something that might not be too important but is a nice elegant touch is the red color of the plates. I like the fact you will be able to see any product build up to clean plates versus other flat irons with black on black; color also helps ensuring the width of the hair strand while you style is completely covered by the plates.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The digital temperature dial is in a VERY BAD position. I imagine the engineers who designed this appliance do not have long hair or are not in touch with stylists or women who use flat irons :-); if the supplier of this appliance can give the manufacturer some feedback for the next generation; please ask them to put the temperature dial ON THE SIDE of the flat iron so when people use it they don&#x27;t get annoyed by the sound every time they touch the dial while styling hair. I&#x27;ve been checking that the temperature has not unlocked accidentally every time I hear that &#x27;beep&#x27; and it is kind of irritating.</li>
            <li> My old chi finally died, and I needed a new one.  I almost bought another, but seeing this one with a digital display, I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair smooth, like it just came from the salon.  I love how I can control the temperature – something my old straightener, which was at this price point – didn’t do.  Even a bigger added bonus, it shuts off automatically.  I shamefully admit I’ve come home more than once and realized I left my old straightener on, which scared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always managed to kink my hair when making curls with my old straightener, but this one is so far so good. My hair isn’t super curly to begin with, but it helps with keeping the friz at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally -  no tangle cord!  Love it, because my old one always looked like a knotted mess, and the coating was wearing away after so many times wrapping it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a straightener, don’t hesitate on this one.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this flat iron.  When you use it the controls are near where you hold it so I keep turning it off. It also doesn&#x27;t clamp very tight.  I want to return it.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, black, Puerto Rican hair (I am Mrs. Brown).  Washing my hair is always a 3 hour ordeal.  This product came recommended by my stylist.  My stylist was right.  The first time I used it I was surprised by how light it is.  The LED panel allows me to better control the temperature.  This unit does not burn my hair as my old cheapo hair straightener did.</li>
            <li> I like it with the exception of the buttons. They should have been placed further up.</li>
            <li> This straightener is okay. I don&#x27;t like that the buttons get in the way- As I am straightening my hair I keep pressing them, it is kind of unavoidable.</li>
            <li> Does not warm up as quick as the babyliss brand. Very tech forward but does not straighten as well as other products on the market.</li>
            <li> My first flat so I can&#x27;t compare it. Works reasonably well but still prefer using my curling iron to straighten my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not the best flat iron for the money. I have thick, course hair it now takes me longer to do my hair. I have to take smaller sections and go over them a couple times. My daughter wanted me to order her one until she tried it. So glad I waited.&lt;br /&gt;And the buttons are in a terrible spot! I keep hitting them, then have to check to make sure I locked it. Poor design.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have my friend Lizza, who also got one of these, straighten my hair with it the first time.  She did an amazingly meticulous job, which took about 45 minutes, which is about what it takes to straighten my hair, even with an iron with a plate twice the size of this one.  The one thing I noticed about this iron was that there was no smell of burning hair, despite having it cranked all the way up to 220 degrees Celsius.  The display was very nice, with a LED number indicating the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very smooth and shiny after being straightened, usually it is type 3A curls, but you couldn&#x27;t tell that by looking at me today!</li>
            <li> I always make purchases based off reviews so when I saw the amount of positive reviews on this straightener, I had high expectations. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with this straightener. Everyone who commented about the buttons being located in a terrible spot were right, the first run at using this I noticed the issue right away, immediately hitting the buttons while attempting to straighten. The only reason this wasn&#x27;t a problem is because the power button doesn&#x27;t even work! I have to unplug it to even shut it off. It also does not feel like it reaches the high tempts of 450 degree tempts like it says. It did not leave my hair feeling nearly as smooth as my 3 year old babyliss straightener. It feels cheap, feels like it&#x27;s made of plastic so I can&#x27;t assume it is durable. The only good thing is the long cord and LCD screen. Other than that I would NOT recommend this product, definitely not worth the price! Don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9c089fec8217178008ad357c1d920886]] I have updated my review from a 4 to 5 star since the flat iron has been remodeled to to show the temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius (the video shows the previous model). Now I can tell what the temperature is at all times. When you turn it on it automatically goes up to 450 degrees and then you are able to turn it down if you wish to your desired temperature. Double click the power button to lock the temperature setting. Don&#x27;t worry if you hear beeping if you accidentally touch the controls while flat ironing, the lock feature will keep the controls from being changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another change I noticed from the previous model is how quickly it heats up. I thought the previous model was fast, well this one is even faster. It gets to 450 degrees in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ISA Professional Digital Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron offers the best of both worlds in one. Tourmaline - which produces negative ions which helps smooth out your hair follicles. This gives you silkier, smoother and shinier looking hair. It also aids in locking in moisture which tames those frizzes. Ceramic - helps heat up the plates quicker and evenly with no \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;. Ceramic also helps the iron glide down your hair with no tugging or pulling. This assists in having less breakage or burning your hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer digital flat irons because you know actually what the temperature is at all times. This particular flat iron has a spot where you can sit your thumb away from the controls. However, you can also lock the controls so you do not interfere with the temperature settings. The cord is heavy duty, long and it swivels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can basically create any hair style with a flat. Besides straightening you can curl, spiral, bend and even flip your hair, the possibilities are endless - let your imagination take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a two-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.sample.</li>
            <li> I got this hair straightener as a gift after having a friend recommend it. As usual, I had to research every highly rated hair straightener for comparison, and this seems like the best! It&#x27;s very easy and safe to use, and a much higher quality build than our old one. The digital display and fine temperature controls turn this from an appliance into a precision tool to get exactly the results you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li> I work in a job that has me in the warehouse a lot, which is extremely hot with lots of humidity. The humidity does a great deal of damage to my hair and makes it very frizzy. This straightener has helped reduce my frizz a little bit. I take it to work with me and I use it during my breaks to touch up. It&#x27;s convenient that it heats up quickly so I don&#x27;t have to spend my whole break waiting for it to turn on to the proper heat setting. I haven&#x27;t owned this straightener for that long but everything is working flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li> Had this flat iron three months now. My hair is fine/thick/curly. It drives me crazy## this clat iron was perfect! I cant put alot of oil and products in my hair because it gets stiff, this iron smooths my ends and my hair has grown alot due to me clipping my ends, heat protection and this flat iron every two weeks! Thanks ISA#</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Received my hair straightener a few days ago and it&#x27;s awesome! I straightened my hair on a daily basis for a very long time, and have used lots of different straighteners. This one, by far, tops the list! :)</li>
            <li> Lets start off by saying these are the best flat irons I have ever owned. They glide on your hair as if it were butter without the sizzling of course. When I first used them they did not burn my hair. They automatically set to the perfect temperature so that I wouldn&#x27;t over heat or burn out my hair, unlike my old flat iron. It left my hair smooth and silky without that &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling when I ran my fingers through my hair. The cord is extremely long which is a plus for me ,being from a large household I&#x27;m always moving. The cord didn&#x27;t tangle and was rotatable which I absolutely adored, but the best part was the bounce and volume it left on my hair. With my haircut most flat irons would leave my hair hard, dull, and motionless. This flat iron works on ALL hair types. I tested it out on a few friends and they wanted to take the flat iron from me. My mom who&#x27;s an all natural girl hates flat ironing her hair, but used these once and asked to keep them. Lets just say I know what she will be getting for Christmas. Overall I rate this absolutely above average. Watch out Infiniti there&#x27;s a new flat iron taking over. For even better results if suggest ARGON OIL which I also relieved from their brand and it helped make my lifeless hair look alive again. I hope this review was helpful! Pictures of the products coming soon.</li>
            <li> Got one for a friend - she loves it!</li>
            <li> The Isa flat iron is one of the best flat irons out on the market in my opinion. The plates are made of high quality ceramic that heats evenly and smoothly distributes heat on your hair without snagging, pulling, or uneven results. I am AA with kinky curly hair, and the results I get with this baby are comparable to a salon session.  My hair feels so silky and bouncy after using it. It makes me look and feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the features I appreciate about the Isa flat iron is the swivel cord attachment. It makes it easy to really maneuver the flat iron, which comes in handy when trying to do curls. Other irons are a bit tricky to use and I could never manage to flick my wrist right to achieve the curl that I wanted, but it was a breeze to curl my hair with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is the temperature display. It is clear to read and tells you the temperature as it rises or lowers. I love this feature because I usually flat iron my hair into rounds because it is so kinky and curly. I first iron my whole head at 400 Fahrenheit, then do a second round to flip the edges at 150 or an even lower temperature. I hate using more heat than I need to, and I appreciate that the iron tells me when the heat actually reaches to the lower temperature so I don’t burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would definitely recommend the Isa flat iron if you’re looking for shiny, smooth, bouncy salon quality hair from within the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I wasted time and money buying cheap straighteners from drugstores. In the long run I was actually wasting money because I had to keep replacing them every other month and not to mention that they provided a serious amount of damage for my hair. Spending the extra money for a quality and professional straightener like the ISA is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It does not straighten hairs, just only about 40%.</li>
            <li> I received this hair straightener as a &#x27;for review&#x27; sample and, of course, there were no discussions concerning me supplying a &#x27;positive&#x27; review in exchange. It just happens that testing - not by me because my hair is not long enough but by Ms. D and our daughter - concluded that this is very much as good as it gets maybe with one little issue. And here it is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The ceramic blades are handle hair perfectly, they glide easily and make for super-easy straightening or curling.&lt;br /&gt;- The digital control allows for setting the exact temperature and will keep it there for the duration of your use.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to turn on (hit power button), lock in (hit it twice) and turn off (hold it for a few seconds)&lt;br /&gt;- Almost maintenance free, requiring no lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our testers&#x27; hair is long and straight so no straightening but, to their delight an joy, curling was extremely quick and easy with the tool reaching the desired temperature within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only one issue one might have is that the temperature display appears to be Celsius only and I wasn&#x27;t able to find a way to switch it to Fahrenheit. There may be a way because I saw a little (F) on the backlit temperature display but I couldn&#x27;t find it but that&#x27;s not enough to justify something less than a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron. Multiple heat settings are a plus.</li>
            <li> The straightener heats up quickly. I wish the temperature readings could be read in BOTH Celsius and Fahrenheit rather than just Celsius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave hair with a after smell. It&#x27;s nice to find a straightener that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides from roots to end very well when you use smaller sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how the buttons are so close to where you have to hold it. I constantly kept pressing the buttons, which can get annoying after awhile even though I know it won&#x27;t turn it off from a single press. The directions could definitely be clearer that double clicking the button locks temperature in place and then double clicking the button again unlocks. I didn&#x27;t know this until I got an email from the manufacturer after being sent this device as a sample to review. The email also said that the directions in the future would be redone to make this clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you could get a tighter clamp down on the hair. I think the price is a little high (today on Amazon it is $94.50). It&#x27;s great hair straightener but there are a lot of options out there that come with a smaller price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;My hair is long, thick, and curly and it got the job done.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is a joint effort with my daughter-in-law who has the curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like this straightener, overall, but the buttons on the outside of it are annoying as I&#x27;m always pushing them when trying to use it. I like the auto-off feature and the swivel cord, but I would&#x27;ve bought a different one if I had thought about the buttons on the outside. I liked my older hot tools better.</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron, I received this as a gift but gave it to my cousin because she has been focusing on her hair lately, and I was amazed at the quality of this thing. The digital LCD in my opinion is a great addition to this and makes it look much more high end and techwise. It heats up almost instantly it is very quick and ready to use right away so you will be saving yourself time when in a rush. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like it except the temp control can get in the way of styling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and it won&#x27;t turn off with the button. not worth the cost</li>
            <li> The worst iron ever.  I bought it for my daughter...she is very adept with flat irons...this one doesn&#x27;t heat properly, the on off switch is awkward and the swivel can pinch your fingers as well as catch and pull your hair.  Thought I was buying the best... I was WRONG.  I have been out of the country, she just told me it was unusable...now we&#x27;re too late to return the thing! Too bad companies don&#x27;t stand behind their product for more than 30 days. Would never recommend.</li>
            <li> There are two things that led to this rating.  1 - the item mentioned by others already - that the controls are in a really awkward place, 2. I have pinched my fingers badly (hard) numerous time by this design.  Most are two separate \\&quot;tongs\\&quot;, but this on has one on a swivel that pinches.  I ended up returning it after the return window.  The vendor was very accommodating which I really appreciate.  That said,  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> it does not really warm up that much and it takes a long time to get the whole hair done. Unfortunately it is too late for a return but I would not recommend for purchase</li>
            <li> I really like the colors of this. It straightens well. I agree with other reviewers when they say a) the buttons are in a weird place and b) I&#x27;m not sure it gets up to 450. I want to do an at home keratin treatment as well, so this is an issue for me. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great straightener that doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of damage with several months of daily use. I&#x27;ve been using it for about that long and my hair is still healthy, which hasn&#x27;t been the case for me with other high end straighteners in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locking the heat is easy (press the power button twice), but your hands still hit the buttons. I&#x27;ve had to learn to hold my hand higher on the straightener, which leads to me burning my hand occasionally. Drat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel that other straighteners actually create better curls. Overall I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, but it could be designed better.</li>
            <li> My girl friend just bought this! She love&#x27;s it! I think she looks a lot hotter when we go out together!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing - my hair is always so frizzy and this keeps is looking sleek and smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li> Best straightener for my natural hair. I love it. The heat does not damage my hair and it last for at least 3 days! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone natural.</li>
            <li> Wow. I love it. I first came across this at the salon where my stylist used it on me before a big event - my sister&#x27;s wedding. She was able to get my frizzy limp blonde hair into shape - a shape that was sleek and full of body and shine and curls. I was amazed that she was able to &amp;#34;flatiron&amp;#34; my hair into curls. She said it has to do with the body shape of the ISA and that it makes doing everything from straight to curly super easy. When she told me the price I balked! $200 for a flat iron seemed like a lot, even for one that does curls too. I said I&#x27;d think about it and went on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welll, I got so many compliments and so many people said it looked like I was luminous and bright looking and I realized that I hadn&#x27;t done anything different except for my hair. The way that my curls caught the light made my whole complexion seem brighter and better. So many people said how wonderful I looked and it got me thinking that I wanted to look that way all the time. So I went back and bought the flat iron and got my stylist to teach me how to use it and have been using it almost every day for about 3 years. My hair (which is naturally a mousy brown that&#x27;s bleached to blonde) is in better shape than it was in before I started to use the ISA and I understand that&#x27;s because of the tourmalene ceramic plates which condition and smooth the hair cuticles while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also so pretty to look at on the counter. I know, I know, it&#x27;s about how it makes you look not how it looks sitting around, but the brilliant red plate and candy apple red (think classic car) handle is a joy to look at. The things that you use every day should be beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel a little cheated that I paid $200 in the salon, but after 3 years of use I&#x27;ve definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that ticks me off sometimes is that the buttons are on top and I press by accident when doing the hair on the back of my head. After I learned that you canclick the power button quick twice to lock the controls I was much happier. I find that the best place to hold the iron is right on top of the temp display where it shows the degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one dies I&#x27;m definitely getting another ISA.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> Got it  right away. WOW, does this thing work great. I have thick, curly and somewhat coarse hair. The cheap flat iron I had took FOREVER to get my hair straight and made my hair look like straw. This isa takes just literally seconds to heat up, minutes to go thru my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT THIS???  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> My last straightener barely functions. It doesn&#x27;t heat up that well and I have to clamp it hard and pass over my hair multiple times. I figured it was time for a new one. So far this one is working very well and easy.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is good enough for occasional use but not well designed. The control buttons/on/off are placed right where you hold it so it is easy to change the setting inadvertently. Annoying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it and returned it and bought a chi</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this product came. Read great reviews about it. Used it once, immediately boxed it up and returned it.  Let me tell you why.  1. the controls are on the outside of the iron. Which means every time you hold it, you hit the controls and it beeps and/or changes the temp. They have it exactly where you are to hold a flat iron. I tried holding it back and it would not clamp together tight enough to hold my hair. So I moved my hand way up high and I would either burn my fingers or hit the control with the back of my hand. totally ridiculous to have the control right there.  2. I had the temp on 450 which is how I use all flat irons. every other one I&#x27;ve ever had, over my slightly curly, fine hair, I had to run the flat iron 1-2 times.  With this one, I literally counted, 8 times, minimum on every strand I did. Not only is that horribly harsh on your hair but your hair should almost be so hot it&#x27;s almost on fire. Well, the hair was barely hot. I&#x27;m guessing the temp control wasn&#x27;t working properly or something.  In any case, the iron is beautiful to look at and it did run smoothly down my hair and it did not pull at my hair or pull my hair out. Those are awesome features. Unfortunately, the controller issue and the heat issue made this product a loser for me.</li>
            <li> Exclent!!! The best ever!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome! It heats up really fast and does an amazing job. I see Less breakage in my hair now that I changed to this straightener.  I would highly recommend for all types of hair Even ethnic curly hair like mine!</li>
            <li> Horrible! don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Is not what I spected</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she is very satisfied with this straightener. It is the best one she is ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more than my share of flat hair irons over the years, buying what I had the money for or that was on sale but they always died really fast the coating poeeled off the plate or ripped hair or the heat stopped working mysteriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best flat iroin I&#x27;ve ever used and that&#x27;s including the expensive one that my sister has that she got for over two hundred bucks at a salon. The isa&#x27;s easy too hold and easy to use and cuts down on styling time. I get lots of compliments and my hair looks great and is undamaged after over a year of near daily use.</li>
            <li> Over a month ago I broke my Girlfriends flat iron when I knocked it over to the floor in the bathroom. I felt really bad about it and she was clearly upset about no longer having a flat iron and yelled at me because of how expensive it was. I knew I had to get her a new one immediately to fix my mistake. I know nothing about flat irons but I found this one and thought it would get the job done. She was quite surprised that I actually bought her one and initially,I believe, she had low expectations about it since I know nothing about flat irons. A couple of weeks passed and she finally decided to use it. Last night she called me and told me that she absolutely LOVED her new flat iron and it was actually even better than her previous one because of the pin point temperature control that she did not have before. She invited me over and told me she wanted to thank me personally... All I can say is that she was happy with this product, and when she is happy, then so am I.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. I&#x27;m pleased with it. Nice temp control. Fast straightening. My palm hit the buttons on top sometimes but it locks by double click. Great workaround.</li>
            <li> fantastic , i have really curly hair and most flat irons simply don&#x27;t work, or they burn my hair by the time it goes straight, this iron on the other hand is genuine salon quality , its works so good, ill never use anything else!</li>
            <li> the bad thing about this straightener is that when you are using it you hit the buttons, thats uncomfortable</li>
            <li> With my Chi, I had to use a lot of products to keep my hair silky and manageable. I&#x27;ve only had to use Argon oil with the ISA to keep my hair healthy. For the price, it&#x27;s worth getting ISA instead of CHI. The shipping was really fast too, I received it in 2 days!</li>
            <li> My hair is really think and frizzy and I wanted to get something for once that didn&#x27;t give up on me after a month. This product made me want to get two because my hair is so smooth and pretty now. I always get compliments on it at work and school. The flat iron heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to wait at all which is a great plus. Oh and let me tell ya my hair hasn&#x27;t sizzled once while using this.I&#x27;m totally in love with this ISA professional Flat Iron the product is so great  and totally worth the price. I highly recommend everyone to buy this product. You will see some amazing results I can assure you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron, I don&#x27;t like the location of the power and heat controls. Although I have only turned it off once during use.</li>
            <li> This hair straitner is crap. Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as my $20 one from Walmart. I hate it. My hair curls up and frizzes as soon as I&#x27;m done striaitning It. It sucks do not buy this. It&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so nice and its easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This is beautifully packed and comes in a sturdy box. The ceramic hair straightener works well and the enclosed guide is detailed on settings and usage parameters. The heat it generated was good for me, and the end product was great! It is a great gift for women and college girls. Sample was provided to me and my review is based on my experience with it.</li>
            <li> Great Flat iron but I agree -you cannot avoid pressing the buttons while using it.  This model has a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; mode to prevent you from turning it off every time you use it.  However, it keeps beeping when you press the button accidentally.  It&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Came very very quickly and no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She say&#x27;s best one shes ever used and her hair really looks amazing everynight with shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good thing i got this!</li>
            <li> Have you ever had a day where your hair gets the &amp;#34;Frizzies&amp;#34; and you dont know what to do with it? The ISA Professional flat iron hair straighter does a fantastic job of smoothing out your hair and making it look smooth and shiny! People will think you have just come from a salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly Recommend this Product!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing. I was really skeptical about paying so much for a device I&#x27;d been using for years and had always bought wherever for much cheaper. I noticed though, at the salon they always got my hair much smoother and shinier. So I told them my routine and this was the missing link! A good flat iron makes a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one in particular has a wonderful digital display, and its on the top instead of in the middle which I liked. No worries about accidentally changing settings, you simply double click the power button to lock your settings. Auto-off feature, which surprisingly a lot of models don&#x27;t have.  This sucker glides so easily through my hair too! I have frizzy and wavy hair, and it can get pretty damaged as I color it. In combination with heat protectant, ammonia free dye, sulfate free shampoo and this new flat iron, my hair has never looked healthier and more beautiful. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flat iron, especially those of you on the fence like I was. And maybe this helps you too, how much did your last salon appointment cost? If you loved how you looked when they did it, you can get those results by upgrading!</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron over the weekend and am really enjoying it. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a product and much better than your typical Walmart flat iron. I have long, curly hair and it is always difficult to find one I&#x27;m completely happy with. My previous one I have really liked and been using for a few years is a Chi Turbo, so my review is based mostly as a comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;[+] I like the back-lit digital temperature readout. Always accurate and easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;[+] Heats up very quickly&lt;br /&gt;[+] Fantastic results with straightening and subtle curling&lt;br /&gt;[+] *Love* the one hour safety shut-off for peace of mind (my Chi doesn&#x27;t have this)&lt;br /&gt;[+] High quality ceramic feels very sturdy and I would expect it to last a long time&lt;br /&gt;[+] Long power cord gives you ample mobility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;[-] The button placement is frustrating. The buttons on my Chi are recessed so my thumb never accidentally presses them. The buttons on the ISA are exactly where my thumb naturally lands and constantly get pressed accidentally. I could retrain myself to hold it differently, but I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about it. The button lock-out feature doesn&#x27;t help with this because that button is among those accidentally being pressed, so I will still accidentally unlock it. It&#x27;s kind of like if a gun had the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; feature turned on and off by pulling the trigger; basically defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;[*] Not going to list this as a con since this is more of a personal taste, but I think I prefer the slightly larger size of my Chi. But that could just be because I&#x27;ve become used to that size after using it so long.&lt;br /&gt;[*] Seems to require a higher temperature setting than I need on my Chi. Not sure if that&#x27;s because my Chi is understating the temperature on the readout or if the ISA is overstating the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very nice flat iron if you can overlook some minor issues.

            <li> I am not going to sugarcoat it, I&#x27;ve been a Chi fan for a long time. It took mine 8 years before it went out so I knew replacing it would be no simple task. I actually settled on a Paul Mitchell straightener after talking to some cosmetology friends of mine. I was sent this straightener, for free, to review on my blog and it is great. I now wish I would&#x27;ve gotten this one instead of the Paul Mitchell one. It heats up extremely fast, I love the control lock so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally pressing a button while styling my hair. The handles are lengthy and I love the fact that it can be used (easily) with either hand. I&#x27;m a lefty so this is kind of a big deal to me. Sure, it&#x27;s pricier than some others on the market but the quality of this straightener plus the warranty that is included makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift, and you should have seen her eyes open wide when she undid the wrapping.  She was, and is delighted with it.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot obviously but it just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as I expected it to...especially for the amount it was</li>
            <li> For a product this expensive, I would expect better quality than what I received. This straightener has a horrible design, with the control buttons on the outside. This creates high pitched beeping noises every time you grip it. It makes the whole straightening process frustrating. On top of that, the grips don&#x27;t give a very tight hold to straighten the hair, so it easily slips between the plates. There are other straighteners on the market for about the same price that are much better than this one (CHI, Sedu, etc.). I bought this one thinking I could replace my CHI (which was amazing), but alas, this one seems pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you need a high-quality, professional grade hair straightener because this one doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Its almost impossible to use this product with out hitting the buttons and turning it off. I don;t understand how others aren&#x27;t have the same problem. The on/off switch and heat adjustment are right where you would hold it to straighten. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth glide, fast heat up. Did not realize how outdated my old flat iron was! Glad I went for the top of the line on this one!! Well worth the extra $$ You will not be disappointed. As others have said in previous reviews. Once it heats up, quickly double click the power button to lock the heat on so that you do not accidentally change or power off the unit as you are flat ironing your hair since the buttons are somewhat in an awkward position. Once I did that I was totally in love with this little iron!</li>
            <li> the sensor is in the way , so holding it becomes complicated. Plus you pinch your hand every now and then</li>
            <li> Great product. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightner because it had excellent reviews here on Amazon. But i am beyond disappointed! I have dark, thick hair, and this straightner does not straightnen well at all. I followed the instructions and straightened very small amounts of hair, and i still had to go over it many, many times. I have used Royale hair straightners for years and loved every one. When my last one broke, i decided to try something different and i regret it. A waste of money!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife.  The one issue she had with it (and we waited too long to return it) was the button placement.  She is left-handed, and would constantly turn the straightener off.  I had read one reviewer before had this issue, but I thought that if it wasn&#x27;t a very common one, then must not be a big issue.  After we realized that my wife was having the same issue, we thought that maybe it is a left-handed vs right-handed problem.  Either way, it&#x27;s a screaming design flaw, considering it is such a basic piece of equipment, and that&#x27;s the most basic function.    There is one other issue that she mentioned which was hardly able to be tested by comparison.  That is this one didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as her aging Baby Bliss Pro straightening iron which I was trying to help her replace, b/c she thinks it&#x27;s going down hill now after maybe 2 years.    I would personally say keep looking.  Especially if you&#x27;re going to pay a high price.  It seems this industry is a difficult one - so many are made, promising great results, but then fall flat.    --Update-- 10/14/2014 --   I had missed the emails from the seller, but the seller ended up refunding the total purchase price.  That alone points to a manufacturer and seller who stands by their product.  That alone should make them a consideration.  I modified my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  5 stars for customer support, 1 star for product design and apparently malfunction (2 separate issues).</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron! It works great. I&#x27;m glad it had the option to lock the buttons because I&#x27;m ALWAYS pushing the up and down temp buttons while I&#x27;m using it. If it didn&#x27;t have that feature, it would have been a 1 star.</li>
            <li> ISA has really outdone themselves with this hair straightener. It has a digital readout so I don&#x27;t have to rely on a dial, or worry about it slipping. The temperature range is between 80-220f which is quite high for a straightener. Secondly, the plates are made of tourmaline which is preferable to the standard metal or even gold as it is far smoother and less likely to pull hair, it&#x27;s far more likely to just glide through and straighten your hair. Tourmaline by the way Is a crystal boron silicate mineral which is ideal for use in hair straighteners. Overall it&#x27;s a great product I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m not one for spending close to $100 on a flat iron but my best friend recommended it and after using hers I had to have it! It arrived on time (thank you Amazon!) and it looked great in the box. You could already tell it was miles ahead of the cheap ones I had bought before at walgreens. I was super excited to try it out. My hair is wavy and I live in a humid climate, so with the other irons I&#x27;ve used, after a couple of hours I&#x27;m left with a frizzy mess that doesn&#x27;t look good on anybody! This flat iron works like a dream!!! No tangles, slides smoothly, temp control, and lasts a really long time!!! Usually I have to redo my hair every morning, but the day after using this iron I got up and it still looked perfect! I ran a quick brush through my hair and was good to go! Saved me a good 20 min off my morning routine. Will NEVER go back to the cheap stuff again. Recommending this to all my girlfriends and buying one for my mom and sister for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.  Shes always complaining that her straightener burns her hair. Since ahes been using this she absolutely loves it and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> Works well but the on/off switch is right on the handle where you would hold it so you can&#x27;t help but constantly turn it off.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my Wife as a gift of our last Anniversary and she really like it. With this Hair Straightener she can makes her hair much more attractive than before. though she has a nice long hair but it was little curly. so that most of the time she used bands in her hair. But now she can makes her hair unbound just because of this lovely product. This &amp;#34;ISA Professional Digital LCD Flat Iron Hair Straightener&amp;#34; has a temperature control option that she can use it with comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She always had a problem with setting the temp on other flat irons but this one has a screen allowing you to set the correct temp. She loves it and it has been the only one she has used since.</li>
            <li> I´ve always had Babyliss flat irons and they are awesome, but I was moving to the United States and I wanted to leave my Babyliss iron in Mexico and buy a new one for here. I read all the reviews about this item and I thought it was awesome to try such a fabulous flat iron.......WRONG!!!!! The flat iron arrived on time before I arrived to the United States, so I started using it immediately........ the flat iron didn´t get as hot as it should, I have very thin hair and I couldn´t straighten it even if I went through the same part 3 times, after that I touched my hair and it was barely hot, conclusion, the flat iron didn´t worked (many people in their reviews had the same problem). I try to give this flat iron a chance by getting used to it but it was impossible, I losed my free trial time with Amazon and it was impossible to contact the seller to make valid my two year guarantee, there were no telephone numbers neither a web site to contact them, nothing came inside the box, I had to contact Amazon explaining my problem and they kindly gave me the refund but I lost $20.00 dlls. of returning fees!! Now I am very happy with my Babyliss flat iron again.......</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair so I&#x27;ve been looking for a straightener that would do the job. I have a couple of non-brand ones at home but I thought it was time to invest in a more quality product and i found this one online and I took a chance and wow, I don&#x27;t regret it at all. It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and it is very easy to use. Get this if you need something that is easy to use and has the best results! :)</li>
            <li> Received next day .. Will use today to determine how well it works.</li>
            <li> As a lefty, I am especially happy with this flat iron because the buttons are centrally located for use in either hand.  I like the ability to adjust the temperature setting; I tested the iron at various settings until I found what I feel is the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; for my own hair.  The iron feels well-balanced, and, after dropping it accidentally a couple of bleary Monday mornings, I can attest to the fact that it&#x27;s definitely sturdy.  Speaking of bleary Monday mornings, the LCD read-out is a big &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; on this model!</li>
            <li> Excellent Flat Iron - Professional Quality.  The ONLY drawback is the placement of the digital temperature control -- occasionally fingers hit the controls during use - changing the temp... But- the sound -&#x27;beep&#x27; warning helps to prevent an accidental  increase in temperature...</li>
            <li> I sent it back!!  The on/off switch was is on top where I held it to use and would turn off even with the lock on.  I will now look for flat irons that the switch is on the inside.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy long hair and find it very difficult to to strengthen, I was chosen to review this ISA Professional digital LCD flat iron and let me tell you I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I reviewed it in the mail it came in a box brand new, the vendor was nice enough to message me before hand to let me know all about the iron before I got it.  I love that, having a connection with the vendor and them sending me more information before hand to prepare me to what I will be receiving in the mail.  I chose 2 day shipping because I was too excited to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a night out with the girls, so I decided to test it out then, that night I received all the attention because of how beautiful my hair looked.  I told them I got it from amazon and how great the product was.  It works so great and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Straighter works pretty good. I only give it two stars because the temperature gage only reads in Celsius and the buttons are right where you hold the straighter while using so you are constantly changing the temp .. So you either need to hold it too far back - which doesn&#x27;t get a tight grip or above the buttons which can get really hot!</li>
            <li> Just as other people noted and I should have listened....your fingers do touch the on and off, up and down buttons when you are styling your hair.  There is a lock button but who can remember which button to hold down and for how long.  Plus, the temperature degrees confused me at first.  I don&#x27;t feel it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the cheaper models. Wish I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Works great. Heats up quickly. Zero complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is definitely a grade above the one i used to own.  Out of the box, it just looks like a quality product which is what I can&#x27;t say about other ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  The backlit lcd is great for determining the perfect temperature every time.  It has a 1 hour auto shut off feature which is a must because not turning it off is how I ruined my last flat iron.  Other flat iron cords always get tangled which makes this flat iron unique for its swiveling cord so there&#x27;s no more tangling.  The heat also seems to transfer evenly due to its ceramic plates and I feel confident with my purchase because of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I wished the buttons were place somewhere else. I keep pressing the power button accidentally as I use it &amp; it gets aggravating.</li>
            <li> I always love my hair straight so I&#x27;m always on the look out for an affordable yet very effective flat iron and this one works great! A perfect gift for my girl friends!</li>
            <li> Still wish I had bought the baby bliss again.  I keep hitting the digital temperature controls on the top of the iron.</li>
