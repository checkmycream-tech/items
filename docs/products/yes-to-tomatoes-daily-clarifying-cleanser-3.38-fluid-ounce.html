            <li>Smells so good</li>
            <li>Good ingredients I guess.</li>
            <li>The balancing lotion is also really good....</li>
            <li>but I would not mind the price if it was so good.</li>
            <li>I assume that it depends on your skin type if this product does any good to your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my beloved Burt&#x27;s Bees Garden Tomato bar when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great, i really love the yes to tomatoes line.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a number of years and love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s done anything amazing</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried the Yes to Tomatoes and really liked some of these products.</li>
            <li>Thought product is of good quality, refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This a nice face wash.</li>
            <li>Using this product makes it nice to not have to use s toner afterward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product but the smell was a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind it in a body wash, but I don&#x27;t like to smell my own face for an hour after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and gets off my makeup.</li>
            <li>The gel is a bit watery, which means that it doesn&#x27;t lather up all nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li>Would have liked more, but it is effective.</li>
            <li>Either way, the cleanser has a mild scent to it, and my face felt great after putting it on.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>love love love it!</li>
            <li>The tomato/watermelon/red tea scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this product for about a year and are pretty happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>It smells pleasant, is slightly foamy, and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but if your looking for something gentle and effective thats not drying and smells so good buy this.</li>
            <li>it smells great lathers nicely and cleared my skin completely</li>
            <li>I love the my skin feels after using it, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>Price is okay.</li>
            <li>I really love that this is an acne wash that doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid or BP.</li>
            <li>I love the Yes to Tomatoes scrub, but cannot use that every day.</li>
            <li>I love &amp;#34;yes to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>the tea tree cleanser seems to work better</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my husband and a friend of mine both made comments today that my face looks better.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing!</li>
            <li>, so I feel it is maintaining a healthy balance for my skin rather than stripping</li>
            <li>And foaming can be caused by ingredients that are not part of the healthy</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a week, and my skin got significantly better.  </li>
            <li>so you have to buy more acne products.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best facial cleaners I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, which is mostly oily.</li>
            <li>and my face is much better.</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is more oily since I&#x27;ve started using this product so goodbye to one star.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews that this works well for most people, and I&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li>Make sure you know your acne type before buying this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, and nice.</li>
            <li>May not be the best for acne affected skin but definitely a good wash that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling too dry, but clean.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love all yes to products, this is no exception.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite beauty product.  </li>
            <li>It feels really good to use, smooth and makes a rich lather.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it, helps that it is organic, and love that it is animal friendly.</li>
            <li>which by the way I highly recommend), and I was hoping I would be happy with another</li>
            <li>face is very clean after using and the cleanser is economy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good face wash.</li>
            <li>I love the texture, smell and that they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great products, but it didn&#x27;t agree with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to God that He has provided us with everything we need in nature!! :):)</li>
            <li>Also have there face wipes which are nice for a quick clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong it made me gag....</li>
            <li>This has a strong, perfumey scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>I think it is strong stuff</li>
            <li>The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t bother me although it is strong.</li>
            <li>I should add, my skin is oily and tend towards more hormonal breakouts and teeny bumps, rather than full fledged acne.</li>
            <li>Good for oily and normal skin.</li>
            <li>But, I am okay with that if my face feels clean and oil free when done, which it does.</li>
            <li>But once a day it is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff is more for mild acne.</li>
            <li>it leaves my fave feeling fresh and the product has a nice light sweet scent.</li>
            <li>My one gripe is that this is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes, it has a light lingering watermelon-ey scent.</li>
            <li>Great daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>Nice and light non irritating great price nice smell.  </li>
            <li>and they are fine, nothing extraordinary,  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok and who really cares if the stuff works!</li>
            <li>It is so much more effective than cetaphil, and I&#x27;ve only just started using it.</li>
            <li>It just gets my skin clean and allows it to take care of itself, like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Not only is it natural but it leaves my face feeling great!</li>
            <li>Does not make my skin feel clean like Cetaphil does.</li>
            <li>It DOES clean (I used as a morning cleanser)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin and makes it feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean after you wash.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean (though sometimes not as clean as I would like esp.</li>
            <li>It would leave my face FEELING clean, but it can&#x27;t obviously be clean if this is happening.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad that this cleanser isn&#x27;t more popular, as it is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I had bought this before at a brick and mortar store and love that I can find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer so much.</li>
            <li>Suds up nicely and leaves skin clean, make sure to use a moisturizer after because it does dry you out!</li>
            <li>Yes,to tomatoes daily clarifying cleanser works great with my oily skin and and leaves it smooth and normal.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so mild, I even use it to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>and my acne has cleared tremendously.</li>
            <li>but I feel like there&#x27;s more than likely something better than this out there.</li>
            <li>It works great on mild acne, but won&#x27;t make a dent in the more serious stuff.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was using the Yes to Tomatoes Daily Pore Scrub, and that worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect this to smell like when I ordered it, since tomatoes don&#x27;t smell that great, especially for personal care products.  </li>
            <li>I was a little aprehensive to try something fragrance free that depends on tomatoes, but its a light scent that makes me feel all fresh and good.</li>
            <li>It smells strong like a real chemical (it irritates my eyes).</li>
            <li>I rarely ever get a breakout anymore</li>
            <li>I purchased this productand the matching moisturizer for my 12 year old daughter who experienced an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>whatever you touch with the stuff on your fingers, and this one, probably because it&#x27;s more natural, doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The Clarifying Cleanser is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried this</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of ointment, medication, $100 facial sessions to rid my acne...and surprisingly this $10 facial cleanser works better...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a mild scent that I did not care for at first.</li>
            <li>I am unsure if it&#x27;s a rumor or not, but as of right now, they still have on their website and products they don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>My acne came back full speed and more than ever.</li>
            <li>I guess just because it looks nice and is a little more costly than the regular stuff doesn&#x27;t always means that it will be better.</li>
            <li>Its a great daily cleanser and has really kept my breakouts from being so frequent!</li>
            <li>After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  </li>
            <li>It smells great, but I think that for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, adding no extra ingredients is essential.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this stuff is strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Walgreens hoping it would work better since it seemed like it would be a natural, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is also the first acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used that I feel fairly certain reduces breakouts!</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin clear, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Just finishing my first tube</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I find that I am really enjoying the yes to tomato facial product line.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I thought I got a tampered product at first, then I read the reviews here.</li>
            <li>Seems to work at first..</li>
            <li>do have a few good things to say about this product, though.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this product dried out my skin and caused it to sting a great deal</li>
            <li>She does have sensitive skin, but I thought because it used natural ingredients (or so I thought) that it would be okay for her.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty dry mostly, but prone to breakouts around my nose, chin, and hairline.</li>
            <li>I recommend the whole YTT line.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have had problem skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>I also really like the Acne Roller Ball Spot Stick.</li>
            <li>I also want to note that it may not help much in removing makeup.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked very well until I found this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It lathers gently</li>
            <li>Definitely will not purchase this product again, even if it was free.</li>
            <li>it is the ONLY moisturizer I can put on without it making my skin look strange/greasy (even the oil free ones give a \\&quot;glaze\\&quot;).....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the things designed with acne-fighting combined with anti-aging, because anti-aging ingredients seem to be too much &amp; cause me to break out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this cleanser removes my makeup well, and on the days when my face feels greasy, it gently removes that as well.  </li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t amaze me that much.</li>
            <li>but this is the one that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>As a whole, I like this product line.</li>
            <li>and I used up this whole tube</li>
            <li>It really clears my face up</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very cleansing and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and right</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this as a replacement for the discontinued Burt&#x27;s Bees garden tomato facial cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can normally apply just a light moisturizer after,( I recommend</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I originally bought this product as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; product to use when I ran out of my last face wash.</li>
            <li>The first few days of using it, my skin seemed to be clearing up, but within a week I had more acne than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people who need something that&#x27;s gentle, but not wimpy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this product&#x27;s fragrance is very much like baby powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better than any of the other products I&#x27;ve ever tried and this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, this is a very gentle gel cleanser with very light, lathery, small suds.</li>
            <li>The one downside (although it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit) is that these products can sometimes have a funny smell from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Yes To Tomatoes product has worked very well for me, and I am a new fan of Yes</li>
            <li>Fantastic for sensitive skin and is not overly perfume-y definitely gender neutral scent.. smells like baked goods.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin.</li>
            <li>purchased this product hoping it would help my mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>skin is very oily and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This works just as nice and smells soothing - to me at least.</li>
            <li>I have used proactiv in the past for good results, but have recently been getting away from products that have all the parabens and alcohols and etc in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already put it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list, and now I&#x27;m trying out a few more products from Yes To.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this wash I did break out more, which was disconcerting to say the least.</li>
            <li>I break out a lot, but my skin also dries very easily, so it&#x27;s tough to find a product that is both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a new cleanser for a while.</li>
            <li>Yes To Tomatoes is my new skin care line.</li>
            <li>I typically have fairly sensitive skin, but I thought I would be okay using this product because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin and highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Its a clear liquid that is very thick, doesnt really foam, but glides on easily and makes your face feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>After I wash, my skin feels soft and smooth, healthier than any other face wash has ever made it feel.</li>
            <li>For the past year, I have not been able to keep cystic acne breakouts away.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer fragrance-free products, but when I saw that my breakouts were getting better, I decided that I could overlook the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited that I finally found a not-too-expensive skin care system that I can pick up at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I want to first start this review off by saying this is how I personally feel about the product, and how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product, especially for someone with combination and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Sort of a clear gel-like wash.</li>
            <li>but I think my face has been clearer since using it, but then again I&#x27;m also taking supplements that&#x27;s also supposed to clear acne</li>
            <li>when I feel like a deeper clean and in drier weather, the wash does dry my skin enough to break out my heavier Cetaphil cream, but since I&#x27;ve started using Yes</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier and just as clear as it was using Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days my skin started to clear up and with continual use has stayed cleared.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised by it.</li>
            <li>So when I found the Yes To company, I was psyched to try the all natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>i like it but can&#x27;t really tell a difference with my skin, still oily and still occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>I think maybe because it&#x27;s so natural my skin gets used to it and always needs it.</li>
            <li>I had about 4-5 red, inflamed spots on my forehead and 1 on my cheek that were reduced to very light-pink, almost gone.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and using this wash once a day truly seems to help eliminate breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My guess is the natural ingredients of this product agree with my skin because even during my hormone-spike every month my skin stays relatively clear.  </li>
            <li>No fillers  95% natural.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, and this product line doesn&#x27;t aggravate it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, go for it, but if you do, beware of this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t suggest you try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Could it be that this product is all natural?</li>
            <li>If it removes everything  it most likely has a harsh detergent in it like sls anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-you need just a little to clean off all the pollution and make-up.</li>
            <li>This is really not a big deal, since I know logically \\&quot;foam\\&quot; does not equal \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>I purchased this facial cleanser a few months ago because I thought by looking at its ingredients that it would be more natural and gentle than the other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still breaking out the Clean and Clear for the serious breakouts, but this does a decent job in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad; just a few spots, really, but I want perfect skin just like everyone else does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only minor drawback is this doesn&#x27;t foam up very much.  </li>
            <li>For various reasons, I actually stopped using the Mia and have been using this cleanser for about a month, and have to say, I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products without noticing much difference.</li>
            <li>Many have complained about the scent, however I actually like the scent a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really noticed any positive effect from cetaphil.</li>
            <li>After about 2 days of use, my active cystic acne breakout was very much improved.</li>
            <li>Now there is barely any evidence that they were there!</li>
            <li>After a week of using this cleanser daily, I had teenage pizza face all over again for the first time in several years.  </li>
            <li>I used this product twice, and the result was that my skin dried right out, and I got a rash on my nose, chin, and a few other places on my face, that lasted for the better part of the week.</li>
            <li>To products in general now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple mail order sets (like SkinID and Murad) and plenty of other face washes available in retail stores, including some other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it barely did anything for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stinging kind of feeling (definitely not a pleasant feeling) and my skin is red all over for a long time after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>skin has really improved with breaking out far less, and I am convinced it is because I am using a gentler cleanser combined with a moisturizer that is basically moisture with no added anti-acne or anti-aging additives.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be just a regular old facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d heard that&#x27;s pretty common when using a new face wash.</li>
            <li>Be very careful with this product, especially if you have sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>My face feels soft when I rinse it, but I do still use burt&#x27;s bees salicylic acid moisturizer afterwards to keep from getting dry.</li>

            <li> but it feels great in my skin.</li>

            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>

            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Smells so good</li>
            <li> Good ingredients I guess.</li>
            <li> The balancing lotion is also really good....</li>
            <li> but I would not mind the price if it was so good.</li>
            <li> I assume that it depends on your skin type if this product does any good to your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my beloved Burt&#x27;s Bees Garden Tomato bar when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great, i really love the yes to tomatoes line.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a number of years and love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s done anything amazing</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried the Yes to Tomatoes and really liked some of these products.</li>
            <li> Thought product is of good quality, refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This a nice face wash.</li>
            <li> Using this product makes it nice to not have to use s toner afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but the smell was a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind it in a body wash, but I don&#x27;t like to smell my own face for an hour after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and gets off my makeup.</li>
            <li> The gel is a bit watery, which means that it doesn&#x27;t lather up all nice and sudsy.</li>
            <li> Would have liked more, but it is effective.</li>
            <li> Either way, the cleanser has a mild scent to it, and my face felt great after putting it on.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> love love love it!</li>
            <li> The tomato/watermelon/red tea scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for about a year and are pretty happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> It smells pleasant, is slightly foamy, and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> but if your looking for something gentle and effective thats not drying and smells so good buy this.</li>
            <li> it smells great lathers nicely and cleared my skin completely</li>
            <li> I love the my skin feels after using it, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> Price is okay.</li>
            <li> I really love that this is an acne wash that doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid or BP.</li>
            <li> I love the Yes to Tomatoes scrub, but cannot use that every day.</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;yes to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the tea tree cleanser seems to work better</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my husband and a friend of mine both made comments today that my face looks better.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> , so I feel it is maintaining a healthy balance for my skin rather than stripping</li>
            <li> And foaming can be caused by ingredients that are not part of the healthy</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a week, and my skin got significantly better.  </li>
            <li> so you have to buy more acne products.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleaners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily.</li>
            <li> and my face is much better.</li>
            <li> I will say, though, that I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is more oily since I&#x27;ve started using this product so goodbye to one star.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews that this works well for most people, and I&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li> Make sure you know your acne type before buying this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is light, and nice.</li>
            <li> May not be the best for acne affected skin but definitely a good wash that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling too dry, but clean.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love all yes to products, this is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite beauty product.  </li>
            <li> It feels really good to use, smooth and makes a rich lather.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it, helps that it is organic, and love that it is animal friendly.</li>
            <li> which by the way I highly recommend), and I was hoping I would be happy with another</li>
            <li> face is very clean after using and the cleanser is economy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good face wash.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, smell and that they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great products, but it didn&#x27;t agree with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to God that He has provided us with everything we need in nature!! :):)</li>
            <li> Also have there face wipes which are nice for a quick clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong it made me gag....</li>
            <li> This has a strong, perfumey scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> I think it is strong stuff</li>
            <li> The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t bother me although it is strong.</li>
            <li> I should add, my skin is oily and tend towards more hormonal breakouts and teeny bumps, rather than full fledged acne.</li>
            <li> Good for oily and normal skin.</li>
            <li> But, I am okay with that if my face feels clean and oil free when done, which it does.</li>
            <li> But once a day it is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff is more for mild acne.</li>
            <li> it leaves my fave feeling fresh and the product has a nice light sweet scent.</li>
            <li> My one gripe is that this is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes, it has a light lingering watermelon-ey scent.</li>
            <li> Great daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> Nice and light non irritating great price nice smell.  </li>
            <li> and they are fine, nothing extraordinary,  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok and who really cares if the stuff works!</li>
            <li> It is so much more effective than cetaphil, and I&#x27;ve only just started using it.</li>
            <li> It just gets my skin clean and allows it to take care of itself, like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not only is it natural but it leaves my face feeling great!</li>
            <li> Does not make my skin feel clean like Cetaphil does.</li>
            <li> It DOES clean (I used as a morning cleanser)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin and makes it feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> Face feels clean after you wash.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean (though sometimes not as clean as I would like esp.</li>
            <li> It would leave my face FEELING clean, but it can&#x27;t obviously be clean if this is happening.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this cleanser isn&#x27;t more popular, as it is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I had bought this before at a brick and mortar store and love that I can find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer so much.</li>
            <li> Suds up nicely and leaves skin clean, make sure to use a moisturizer after because it does dry you out!</li>
            <li> Yes,to tomatoes daily clarifying cleanser works great with my oily skin and and leaves it smooth and normal.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so mild, I even use it to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> and my acne has cleared tremendously.</li>
            <li> but I feel like there&#x27;s more than likely something better than this out there.</li>
            <li> It works great on mild acne, but won&#x27;t make a dent in the more serious stuff.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was using the Yes to Tomatoes Daily Pore Scrub, and that worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect this to smell like when I ordered it, since tomatoes don&#x27;t smell that great, especially for personal care products.  </li>
            <li> I was a little aprehensive to try something fragrance free that depends on tomatoes, but its a light scent that makes me feel all fresh and good.</li>
            <li> It smells strong like a real chemical (it irritates my eyes).</li>
            <li> I rarely ever get a breakout anymore</li>
            <li> I purchased this productand the matching moisturizer for my 12 year old daughter who experienced an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> whatever you touch with the stuff on your fingers, and this one, probably because it&#x27;s more natural, doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The Clarifying Cleanser is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried this</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of ointment, medication, $100 facial sessions to rid my acne...and surprisingly this $10 facial cleanser works better...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a mild scent that I did not care for at first.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it&#x27;s a rumor or not, but as of right now, they still have on their website and products they don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> My acne came back full speed and more than ever.</li>
            <li> I guess just because it looks nice and is a little more costly than the regular stuff doesn&#x27;t always means that it will be better.</li>
            <li> Its a great daily cleanser and has really kept my breakouts from being so frequent!</li>
            <li> After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  </li>
            <li> It smells great, but I think that for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, adding no extra ingredients is essential.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this stuff is strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens hoping it would work better since it seemed like it would be a natural, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is also the first acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used that I feel fairly certain reduces breakouts!</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> Just finishing my first tube</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I find that I am really enjoying the yes to tomato facial product line.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I thought I got a tampered product at first, then I read the reviews here.</li>
            <li> Seems to work at first..</li>
            <li> do have a few good things to say about this product, though.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product dried out my skin and caused it to sting a great deal</li>
            <li> She does have sensitive skin, but I thought because it used natural ingredients (or so I thought) that it would be okay for her.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty dry mostly, but prone to breakouts around my nose, chin, and hairline.</li>
            <li> I recommend the whole YTT line.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> I also really like the Acne Roller Ball Spot Stick.</li>
            <li> I also want to note that it may not help much in removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked very well until I found this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It lathers gently</li>
            <li> Definitely will not purchase this product again, even if it was free.</li>
            <li> it is the ONLY moisturizer I can put on without it making my skin look strange/greasy (even the oil free ones give a \\&quot;glaze\\&quot;).....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the things designed with acne-fighting combined with anti-aging, because anti-aging ingredients seem to be too much &amp; cause me to break out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this cleanser removes my makeup well, and on the days when my face feels greasy, it gently removes that as well.  </li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t amaze me that much.</li>
            <li> but this is the one that really works for me.  </li>
            <li> As a whole, I like this product line.</li>
            <li> and I used up this whole tube</li>
            <li> It really clears my face up</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cleansing and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and right</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as a replacement for the discontinued Burt&#x27;s Bees garden tomato facial cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can normally apply just a light moisturizer after,( I recommend</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I originally bought this product as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; product to use when I ran out of my last face wash.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using it, my skin seemed to be clearing up, but within a week I had more acne than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for people who need something that&#x27;s gentle, but not wimpy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product&#x27;s fragrance is very much like baby powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works better than any of the other products I&#x27;ve ever tried and this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, this is a very gentle gel cleanser with very light, lathery, small suds.</li>
            <li> The one downside (although it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit) is that these products can sometimes have a funny smell from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Yes To Tomatoes product has worked very well for me, and I am a new fan of Yes</li>
            <li> Fantastic for sensitive skin and is not overly perfume-y definitely gender neutral scent.. smells like baked goods.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin.</li>
            <li> purchased this product hoping it would help my mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> skin is very oily and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This works just as nice and smells soothing - to me at least.</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv in the past for good results, but have recently been getting away from products that have all the parabens and alcohols and etc in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already put it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list, and now I&#x27;m trying out a few more products from Yes To.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this wash I did break out more, which was disconcerting to say the least.</li>
            <li> I break out a lot, but my skin also dries very easily, so it&#x27;s tough to find a product that is both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new cleanser for a while.</li>
            <li> Yes To Tomatoes is my new skin care line.</li>
            <li> I typically have fairly sensitive skin, but I thought I would be okay using this product because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin and highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Its a clear liquid that is very thick, doesnt really foam, but glides on easily and makes your face feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> After I wash, my skin feels soft and smooth, healthier than any other face wash has ever made it feel.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I have not been able to keep cystic acne breakouts away.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer fragrance-free products, but when I saw that my breakouts were getting better, I decided that I could overlook the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited that I finally found a not-too-expensive skin care system that I can pick up at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I want to first start this review off by saying this is how I personally feel about the product, and how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product, especially for someone with combination and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Sort of a clear gel-like wash.</li>
            <li> but I think my face has been clearer since using it, but then again I&#x27;m also taking supplements that&#x27;s also supposed to clear acne</li>
            <li> when I feel like a deeper clean and in drier weather, the wash does dry my skin enough to break out my heavier Cetaphil cream, but since I&#x27;ve started using Yes</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier and just as clear as it was using Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days my skin started to clear up and with continual use has stayed cleared.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised by it.</li>
            <li> So when I found the Yes To company, I was psyched to try the all natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> i like it but can&#x27;t really tell a difference with my skin, still oily and still occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> I think maybe because it&#x27;s so natural my skin gets used to it and always needs it.</li>
            <li> I had about 4-5 red, inflamed spots on my forehead and 1 on my cheek that were reduced to very light-pink, almost gone.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and using this wash once a day truly seems to help eliminate breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My guess is the natural ingredients of this product agree with my skin because even during my hormone-spike every month my skin stays relatively clear.  </li>
            <li> No fillers  95% natural.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, and this product line doesn&#x27;t aggravate it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, go for it, but if you do, beware of this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t suggest you try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Could it be that this product is all natural?</li>
            <li> If it removes everything  it most likely has a harsh detergent in it like sls anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -you need just a little to clean off all the pollution and make-up.</li>
            <li> This is really not a big deal, since I know logically \\&quot;foam\\&quot; does not equal \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial cleanser a few months ago because I thought by looking at its ingredients that it would be more natural and gentle than the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still breaking out the Clean and Clear for the serious breakouts, but this does a decent job in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad; just a few spots, really, but I want perfect skin just like everyone else does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only minor drawback is this doesn&#x27;t foam up very much.  </li>
            <li> For various reasons, I actually stopped using the Mia and have been using this cleanser for about a month, and have to say, I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products without noticing much difference.</li>
            <li> Many have complained about the scent, however I actually like the scent a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really noticed any positive effect from cetaphil.</li>
            <li> After about 2 days of use, my active cystic acne breakout was very much improved.</li>
            <li> Now there is barely any evidence that they were there!</li>
            <li> After a week of using this cleanser daily, I had teenage pizza face all over again for the first time in several years.  </li>
            <li> I used this product twice, and the result was that my skin dried right out, and I got a rash on my nose, chin, and a few other places on my face, that lasted for the better part of the week.</li>
            <li> To products in general now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple mail order sets (like SkinID and Murad) and plenty of other face washes available in retail stores, including some other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it barely did anything for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stinging kind of feeling (definitely not a pleasant feeling) and my skin is red all over for a long time after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> skin has really improved with breaking out far less, and I am convinced it is because I am using a gentler cleanser combined with a moisturizer that is basically moisture with no added anti-acne or anti-aging additives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to be just a regular old facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d heard that&#x27;s pretty common when using a new face wash.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product, especially if you have sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> My face feels soft when I rinse it, but I do still use burt&#x27;s bees salicylic acid moisturizer afterwards to keep from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of cleansers lately, trying to find one that is right for my situation.  </li>
            <li> But this is not harsh like other gel cleansers I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so I&#x27;m not sure how helpful any review of these products really is -- but for me, this is a stand-out product.  </li>
            <li> very will with very little product.</li>
            <li> It also makes me pores look super small and tones down the redness in my cheeks a bit.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying/irritating for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first 12 or so ingredients on the actual product are unpronounceable chemicals and artificial fragrance, with a miniscule amount of tomato and red tea extract at the very end.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I actually use this every other night, opposite the deep pore scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 14 male and have an oily T-zone with dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> Halfway through my first bottle of this stuff, my face broke out bad and I remember thinking &amp;#34;it has to get worse before it can get better&amp;#34; and by the end of the bottle I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looked and it has stayed that way ever since.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever feel like my skin is parched after washing with this (like I have unfortunately found with many other products)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and there is absolutely no burning, as other reviewers have said, and my skin is not dried out.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks, it really dried me out and cleared up all of my acne and oil.</li>
            <li> And it may also mean that  it is gentle.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried other products in this line, but would consider at a later time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a little bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> It cuts through dirt and oil without drying out his skin (he uses a lot of acne medicine and sometimes gets dry patches.)</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin a bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a gel cleanser, which I was very skeptical about at first because I have found sudsy cleansers to be very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> It cleared up all my little pimples and white heads, but it hasn&#x27;t done much for the cyst like hard pimples.</li>
            <li> It has completely rejuvenated my face and it takes very little product to do so.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout worse then normal; my face also got red and splotchy.</li>
            <li> This stuff kicks butt, little red acne butt.</li>
            <li> Really no complaints.</li>
            <li> I squeeze out a bit of it on wet hands (not much is needed) and massage my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use stuff designed for teen breakouts, they&#x27;re just harsh.  </li>
            <li> not worth it, not clean enough, no tomato I can tell, not even comparable to burt bees, i wish it was.,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, has a really faint delicate smell, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sking and leaves my face feeling clean!</li>
            <li> But I can deal with a couple sore pimples as long as they aren&#x27;t accompanied by 30 little friends.</li>
            <li> I frequently buy this to use at night when I don&#x27;t want to waste my expensive natural cleanser before going to bed</li>
            <li> Other acne cleansers often contain ingredients that end up bleaching our washcloths or</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it has a tomatoe smell which I get past after using it.</li>
            <li> The smell of this was so overpowering, not like any of the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and other</li>
            <li> I have used the other products</li>
            <li> but it might work for other people.</li>
            <li> No more caking on make up to hide my acne, red spots, acne marks!</li>
            <li> I slowly adapted to it, but I would work up to regular use slowly if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> I hoped a natural company such as this would not rely on fake, chemical scents.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all the reviews that say this facial cleanser helps clear acne.  </li>
            <li> Since I also have very dry skin, I did not want to use a harsh product that is designed for teenagers.  </li>
            <li> To, I have needed other products much less often.   </li>
            <li> Helps keep blackheads down.</li>
            <li> The outcome was a let down, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I noticed that immediately after using it, it toned down the redness and uneveness in my skin.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this for almost a year now and see no need to look at any other products!</li>
            <li> Did not work to clear up acne spots, and dried skin out and made it much, much worse.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever used has even touched the blackhead situation on my nose-but this stuff makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The texture is smoother and I have less of the teeny bumps.</li>
            <li> It also happens to be around that time of month when hormones influence breakouts, and while I do have 2 spots trying to act up on me, they are MUCH less severe than the breakouts I have been getting, and I am hoping I can attack them with this face wash, the yes to tomatoes face mask, and some spot treatment and get them gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d usually get a few small whiteheads on my chin, and the occasional pimple on my cheek where my hair is.</li>
            <li> little about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I follow it with a little bit of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The price is doable, and a little goes</li>
            <li> a little bit goes along way</li>
            <li> I got this to try to clear up one random breakout.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all dried out after use, which makes it a lot easier for me to use it as my everyday cleanser rather than just on breakout days.</li>
            <li> You can smell the Dead Sea mud, along with the sweetness of the fruits and veggies.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the cleanser again for a few days, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is obviously a moneymaking scheme... make your acne worse</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product especially if your acne isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> and I think this will be my everyday cleanser for years to come!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> useorganic, naturally-derived body care products to avoid parabens and harsh chemicals, and this product seems to deliver on it&#x27;s list of ingredients!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the moisturizer is add-on only here on Amazon; however, they sell it at target</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> but when I received the package, the bottles were marked in gray as though someone had gotten them from a dirty warehouse, or a sticker had been peeled off them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it within just a few days!  </li>
            <li> We like the organic ingredients, the faint smell, and the way it has treated his acne and my occasional break out.  </li>
            <li> I get random pimples here and there and in the midst of trying to prevent them by using other products, my skin majorly dried out from all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Recently, I started using a Mia and it dried my skin out so badly,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, including Proactiv (which totally dried out my skin and made my breakouts worse).  </li>
            <li> But after a few days of using the product, it made my breakouts much much worse.</li>
            <li> But here and there, I&#x27;ve tried other stuff (expensive products....</li>
            <li> I mean it doesn&#x27;t say anything about acne on the tube.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money and spend it on something you deserve!</li>
            <li> I have not worn any make up since starting this product, I keep my hair up, and I cannot think of any reason as to why I have broken out so badly except this</li>
            <li> : Smell isn&#x27;t too unpleasant, small amount needed, makes up for the small bottle.</li>
            <li> , ill never try another product again</li>
            <li> : Not everyone may like the fragrance, a bit expensive, does not lather and that might bother some people, Takes awhile to rinse off.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious.</li>
            <li> but i have yet to see any crazy difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; stinks like bad knockoff perfume, and it made me break out.  </li>
            <li> However, I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> so if smells like that make you feel sick avoid this product,I&#x27;m still going to use it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cleanser is great, i really love the yes to tomatoes line. Smells so good and it lathers well. I frequently buy this to use at night when I don&#x27;t want to waste my expensive natural cleanser before going to bed lol. This works just as nice and smells soothing - to me at least. Fantastic for sensitive skin and is not overly perfume-y definitely gender neutral scent.. smells like baked goods. Anyway claims it has antioxidants but i have yet to see any crazy difference in my skin. but if your looking for something gentle and effective thats not drying and smells so good buy this. I recommend the whole YTT line.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This cleanser is the best i have tried and i have tried them all believe me, ill never try another product again it smells great lathers nicely and cleared my skin completely its even helped with scars im amazed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a while now, if I try something else I always regret it. I rarely ever get a breakout anymore and it&#x27;s all thanks to this stuff. I follow up with the Yes to Grapefruit CC Cream Moisturizer. Halfway through my first bottle of this stuff, my face broke out bad and I remember thinking &amp;#34;it has to get worse before it can get better&amp;#34; and by the end of the bottle I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looked and it has stayed that way ever since. (: Just be patient with it and stick to it</li>
            <li> Helps keep blackheads down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this productand the matching moisturizer for my 12 year old daughter who experienced an occasional breakout.  She used this product 3 times and it BURNED her skin.  Her forehead and nose look like she got a severe sunburn!!  Her forehead turned brown and now it is beginning the peeling process.  It is tender to the touch still and it has been almost two weeks since she used it.  We took her to the doctor about it because we were so concerned. He said it would just have to heal and not to use the product again (that was a no-brainer!). She does have sensitive skin, but I thought because it used natural ingredients (or so I thought) that it would be okay for her.  Be very careful with this product, especially if you have sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin that&#x27;s pretty dry mostly, but prone to breakouts around my nose, chin, and hairline. This is by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found. Other acne cleansers often contain ingredients that end up bleaching our washcloths or whatever you touch with the stuff on your fingers, and this one, probably because it&#x27;s more natural, doesn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all dried out after use, which makes it a lot easier for me to use it as my everyday cleanser rather than just on breakout days. This is also the first acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used that I feel fairly certain reduces breakouts! The tomato/watermelon/red tea scent is mild and pleasant. Really no complaints. Just finishing my first tube and I think this will be my everyday cleanser for years to come!</li>
            <li> Did not work to clear up acne spots, and dried skin out and made it much, much worse. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s skin has seen a noticeable improvement. He uses it every morning. It cuts through dirt and oil without drying out his skin (he uses a lot of acne medicine and sometimes gets dry patches.) Doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes. Sort of a clear gel-like wash. Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, has a really faint delicate smell, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sking and leaves my face feeling clean! Love it! Have been buying this for almost a year now and see no need to look at any other products!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone, dry cheeks, enlarged pores and adult acne. I originally purchased this as a replacement for the discontinued Burt&#x27;s Bees garden tomato facial cleansing bar. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a couple months now and I prefer it to the Burt&#x27;s Bees soap. My T-zone still oily, but my pores appear smaller and my breakouts are under control. Love this stuff and will definitely purchase again! I only wish the bottle came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Works well on oily skin!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have had problem skin my whole life. I have used proactiv in the past for good results, but have recently been getting away from products that have all the parabens and alcohols and etc in it. I tried the Yes to Tomatoes and really liked some of these products. The Clarifying Cleanser is my favorite so far. I also really like the Acne Roller Ball Spot Stick. I love the my skin feels after using it, and I love the smell. Nothing I have ever used has even touched the blackhead situation on my nose-but this stuff makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for pre-teen acne.  Thought product is of good quality, refreshing.  Haven&#x27;t tried other products in this line, but would consider at a later time.</li>
            <li> This a nice face wash. Love that it is organic. Price is okay. Size isn&#x27;t that big. Would have liked more, but it is effective.</li>
            <li> Yes,to tomatoes daily clarifying cleanser works great with my oily skin and and leaves it smooth and normal.The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it has a tomatoe smell which I get past after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used  it leaves my fave feeling fresh and the product has a nice light sweet scent. Using this product makes it nice to not have to use s toner afterward.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does not foam or lather at all. I was a bit surprised by it. I squeeze out a bit of it on wet hands (not much is needed) and massage my face. It does dry my skin a bit but I think my face has been clearer since using it, but then again I&#x27;m also taking supplements that&#x27;s also supposed to clear acne so I&#x27;m not sure. I also want to note that it may not help much in removing makeup. I only wear eye makeup, so this wasn&#x27;t tested on foundation. But the eye makeup remains even after cleansing, but for that I use castor oil to remove afterwards, not a big deal for me. And it may also mean that  it is gentle. If it removes everything  it most likely has a harsh detergent in it like sls anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smell isn&#x27;t too unpleasant, small amount needed, makes up for the small bottle. Good ingredients I guess. No reactions (for me)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not everyone may like the fragrance, a bit expensive, does not lather and that might bother some people, Takes awhile to rinse off. Dries skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a new cleanser for a while. My dermatologist had recommended cetaphil, which I&#x27;ve been dutifully using for years. I&#x27;ve never really noticed any positive effect from cetaphil. The last straw was when I read the ingredient list! So when I found the Yes To company, I was psyched to try the all natural cleanser. And then I tried it, and the angels went AHHHlelujah in my head. This stuff kicks butt, little red acne butt. It is so much more effective than cetaphil, and I&#x27;ve only just started using it. And if that weren&#x27;t enough, it smells delish. I dont even like tomatoes, so I was a little aprehensive to try something fragrance free that depends on tomatoes, but its a light scent that makes me feel all fresh and good. I definitely recommend this stuff, for oily-acne prone faces looking for something fresher than all that synthetic stuff on the market.</li>
            <li> I find that I am really enjoying the yes to tomato facial product line. It has completely rejuvenated my face and it takes very little product to do so. I will be using this for the foreseeable future as it cleans my skin very will with very little product. It is a great value and works wonders.</li>
            <li> A great acne cleanser. Works better than any of the other products I&#x27;ve ever tried and this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. I break out a lot, but my skin also dries very easily, so it&#x27;s tough to find a product that is both gentle and effective. I&#x27;ve tried a couple mail order sets (like SkinID and Murad) and plenty of other face washes available in retail stores, including some other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands. Nothing worked very well until I found this cleanser. It did exactly what I needed. It feels really good to use, smooth and makes a rich lather. It&#x27;s gentle enough that I can normally apply just a light moisturizer after,( I recommend Yes To Tomatoes Balancing Moisturizer). It&#x27;s so mild, I even use it to remove eye makeup. After I wash, my skin feels soft and smooth, healthier than any other face wash has ever made it feel. I really love that this is an acne wash that doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid or BP. It just gets my skin clean and allows it to take care of itself, like it&#x27;s supposed to. While I can&#x27;t vouch for it reducing redness immediately, over time it has noticeably calmed and cleared my skin.    I still use a salicylic scrub on occasions when I feel like a deeper clean and in drier weather, the wash does dry my skin enough to break out my heavier Cetaphil cream, but since I&#x27;ve started using Yes To, I have needed other products much less often.   My one gripe is that this is not fragrance free. It smells great, but I think that for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, adding no extra ingredients is essential.    But seriously, this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend it for people who need something that&#x27;s gentle, but not wimpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a number of years and love it! I have sensitive, acne prone skin and highly recommend this cleanser. Not only is it natural but it leaves my face feeling great! It doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne overnight but does make a difference over time.</li>
            <li> I had bought this before at a brick and mortar store and love that I can find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  I have oily/combination acne-prone skin and I prefer to use this in combination with the Yes to Tomatoes Acne Control Gel Cleanser.  The two of them used together seem to do the trick in keeping my breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> It works great on mild acne, but won&#x27;t make a dent in the more serious stuff. I could imagine that a combination of Yes to Tomatoes products, or a stronger scrub might do the job though. I&#x27;m still breaking out the Clean and Clear for the serious breakouts, but this does a decent job in between.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser itself has a very pleasant smell. You can smell the Dead Sea mud, along with the sweetness of the fruits and veggies. It gives the cleanser a very pleasant smell. It lathers gently but well, and always leaves my face feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;That said, this stuff is strong for sensitive skin. For the first few weeks, it really dried me out and cleared up all of my acne and oil. I would only use it once in 24 hours, then covered my face in lotion. I slowly adapted to it, but I would work up to regular use slowly if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it because I like the smell and the way it makes my skin feel, but I won&#x27;t rely on it as my only acne fighter.</li>
            <li> This product has a lingering unnatural smell.  If you don&#x27;t like perfume smells than avoid this.  It&#x27;s a nice product but the smell was a deal breaker for me.  I hoped a natural company such as this would not rely on fake, chemical scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good face wash. I&#x27;m 14 male and have an oily T-zone with dry cheeks. I used this product for probably 3-4 days 2x a day and my acne has cleared tremendously. but I&#x27;m not big on the smell!</li>
            <li> I switched to the Say Yes to Tomatoes line of facial care about 5 years ago from Proactiv. I am definitely a convert. My skin is healthier and just as clear as it was using Proactiv. Even my husband has switched over. The one downside (although it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit) is that these products can sometimes have a funny smell from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer so much.</li>
            <li> The smell of this was so overpowering, not like any of the other products in this line. I thought I got a tampered product at first, then I read the reviews here. The smell is so strong it made me gag....and that was after I washed it off my face.  Does not make my skin feel clean like Cetaphil does. Feels like there is a filmy residue. I love the Yes to Tomatoes scrub, but cannot use that every day. Definitely will not purchase this product again, even if it was free.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s done anything amazing but it feels great in my skin. I love the texture, smell and that they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This has a strong, perfumey scent that lingers. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it in a body wash, but I don&#x27;t like to smell my own face for an hour after I wash it. I have combination, sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t feel like this irritated my skin, but it did leave it feeling a bit dry/tight.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear, clean, and fresh. Plus it&#x27;s natural so that&#x27;s a bonus. Smells nice too. I love &amp;#34;yes to&amp;#34; products. Also have there face wipes which are nice for a quick clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap three times in a row. It lathers up nicely and gets off my makeup. I even use it with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This face wash is great. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> i like it but can&#x27;t really tell a difference with my skin, still oily and still occasional breakout. the tea tree cleanser seems to work better</li>
            <li> Originally, I was using the Yes to Tomatoes Daily Pore Scrub, and that worked AMAZINGLY. Until, it suddenly stopped working. My acne came back full speed and more than ever. So, I tried a different Yes to Tomatoes product, this one. The outcome was a let down, it didn&#x27;t do anything. I think maybe because it&#x27;s so natural my skin gets used to it and always needs it. :/</li>
            <li> love love love it! there is no any tomato -like juice- smell! its rather smells some melon and something else. face is very clean after using and the cleanser is economy-you need just a little to clean off all the pollution and make-up. ideal for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Yes To Tomatoes is my new skin care line. I have tried every product under the sun in order to minimize my pores; while this product doesn&#x27;t make them disappear, they are noticeable smaller. It has a nice smell to it, helps that it is organic, and love that it is animal friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this cleanser isn&#x27;t more popular, as it is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. For years, I&#x27;ve used either Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash or simply Dove bar soap. But here and there, I&#x27;ve tried other stuff (expensive products....Clinique, Bliss, etc.) Recently, I started using a Mia and it dried my skin out so badly, I switched over to this cleanser. I noticed that immediately after using it, it toned down the redness and uneveness in my skin. For various reasons, I actually stopped using the Mia and have been using this cleanser for about a month, and have to say, I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products without noticing much difference. My skin actually feels as if it&#x27;s improved. I should add, my skin is oily and tend towards more hormonal breakouts and teeny bumps, rather than full fledged acne. The texture is smoother and I have less of the teeny bumps. Also, it seems to help balance oil production. The balancing lotion is also really good....it is the ONLY moisturizer I can put on without it making my skin look strange/greasy (even the oil free ones give a \\&quot;glaze\\&quot;).....again it calms and smoothes out the redness. Definitely give this try. Many have complained about the scent, however I actually like the scent a lot. Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes, it has a light lingering watermelon-ey scent. I say try this!</li>
            <li> I am 26 and have adult-onset acne that started after I tried the Oil Cleansing Method, and I believe has been sustained by stress and hormones. For the past year, I have not been able to keep cystic acne breakouts away. I have to admit that I originally bought this product as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; product to use when I ran out of my last face wash. I went to Wal Greens in desperation to find something that would hold me over until I could do my research to find a &amp;#34;better product.&amp;#34; I had no expectations from this! After about 2 days of use, my active cystic acne breakout was very much improved. I had about 4-5 red, inflamed spots on my forehead and 1 on my cheek that were reduced to very light-pink, almost gone. Now there is barely any evidence that they were there! I have been using this for about 2 weeks now, and my husband and a friend of mine both made comments today that my face looks better. It also happens to be around that time of month when hormones influence breakouts, and while I do have 2 spots trying to act up on me, they are MUCH less severe than the breakouts I have been getting, and I am hoping I can attack them with this face wash, the yes to tomatoes face mask, and some spot treatment and get them gone quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a gel cleanser, which I was very skeptical about at first because I have found sudsy cleansers to be very drying to my skin. However, this is a very gentle gel cleanser with very light, lathery, small suds. My face feels soft when I rinse it, but I do still use burt&#x27;s bees salicylic acid moisturizer afterwards to keep from getting dry. But this is not harsh like other gel cleansers I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild scent that I did not care for at first. I usually prefer fragrance-free products, but when I saw that my breakouts were getting better, I decided that I could overlook the scent. Now, I have grown used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I useorganic, naturally-derived body care products to avoid parabens and harsh chemicals, and this product seems to deliver on it&#x27;s list of ingredients! Thanks to God that He has provided us with everything we need in nature!! :):)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so we will see what happens! Dare I hope that I can finally have my acne under control??!!! I plan to update after I have used it for longer!</li>
            <li> I also used to use the Burts Bee&#x27;s tomato soap but unfortunately it was discontinued. This is the next best thing! I&#x27;ve been using it and other Yes to tomato products ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of cleansers lately, trying to find one that is right for my situation.  I am 37, but still break out occasionally with blackheads and hormonal acne.  I can&#x27;t use stuff designed for teen breakouts, they&#x27;re just harsh.  I can&#x27;t use the things designed with acne-fighting combined with anti-aging, because anti-aging ingredients seem to be too much &amp; cause me to break out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Yes To Tomatoes product has worked very well for me, and I am a new fan of Yes To products in general now.  I find this cleanser removes my makeup well, and on the days when my face feels greasy, it gently removes that as well.  I don&#x27;t ever feel like my skin is parched after washing with this (like I have unfortunately found with many other products), so I feel it is maintaining a healthy balance for my skin rather than stripping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has really improved with breaking out far less, and I am convinced it is because I am using a gentler cleanser combined with a moisturizer that is basically moisture with no added anti-acne or anti-aging additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect this to smell like when I ordered it, since tomatoes don&#x27;t smell that great, especially for personal care products.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this product&#x27;s fragrance is very much like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor drawback is this doesn&#x27;t foam up very much.  This is really not a big deal, since I know logically \\&quot;foam\\&quot; does not equal \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  And foaming can be caused by ingredients that are not part of the healthy Yes To product standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve already put it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list, and now I&#x27;m trying out a few more products from Yes To.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This stuff smells amazing!!!! Its a clear liquid that is very thick, doesnt really foam, but glides on easily and makes your face feel so fresh. I love the smell too. Its a great daily cleanser and has really kept my breakouts from being so frequent!</li>
            <li> It DOES clean (I used as a morning cleanser) your face but I feel like there&#x27;s more than likely something better than this out there. This just feels...so generic to me I guess? It just didn&#x27;t amaze me that much. Won&#x27;t buy again. Also, doesn&#x27;t smell too great.</li>
            <li> I had been using Alba Botanical Coconut Milk Face Wash, and while it smelled nice, I started breaking out massively after 3-4 weeks of use.  Trying to keep the ingredients more natural, I tried this Yes To Tomatoes clarifying Face Wash and the moisturizer.  After only 1 use, the bright red of my breakout spots were no longer bright red!  This stuff is amazing!!!  It smells pleasant, is slightly foamy, and leaves my skin looking and feeling wonderful.  I have combination skin and there is absolutely no burning, as other reviewers have said, and my skin is not dried out.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so I&#x27;m not sure how helpful any review of these products really is -- but for me, this is a stand-out product.  I have adult acne and using this wash once a day truly seems to help eliminate breakouts.  I think it is strong stuff and if I use it twice a day I start to get irritation.  But once a day it is fine for me.  I have used the other products n the Yes to Tomatoes line and they are fine, nothing extraordinary,  but this is the one that really works for me.  I follow it with a little bit of the moisturizer.  I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell.  I think it&#x27;s ok and who really cares if the stuff works!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever used. I get random pimples here and there and in the midst of trying to prevent them by using other products, my skin majorly dried out from all the chemicals. Once I started using this my skin cleared up. It also makes me pores look super small and tones down the redness in my cheeks a bit. I&#x27;m obsessed. Use it with the moisturizer for the best results. Unfortunately the moisturizer is add-on only here on Amazon; however, they sell it at target but it&#x27;s just a little bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve passed by this product several times at Walgreens thinking I didn&#x27;t want to try yet another skin-clearing cleanser.  I finally decided to give it a try and was so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very oily and sensitive.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, including Proactiv (which totally dried out my skin and made my breakouts worse).  My guess is the natural ingredients of this product agree with my skin because even during my hormone-spike every month my skin stays relatively clear.  It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin and makes it feel really clean.  I&#x27;m really excited that I finally found a not-too-expensive skin care system that I can pick up at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial cleanser a few months ago because I thought by looking at its ingredients that it would be more natural and gentle than the other products on the market. I think it&#x27;s overpriced but I would not mind the price if it was so good. I have sensitive skin and right after I apply it, my skin starts burning. It&#x27;s a stinging kind of feeling (definitely not a pleasant feeling) and my skin is red all over for a long time after I wash it off. I assume that it depends on your skin type if this product does any good to your skin. It smells strong like a real chemical (it irritates my eyes). I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have sensitive skin. Based on my experience with this product, I have to give it one star and I won&#x27;t purchase it anymore but it might work for other people.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list on this listing is inaccurate.  The first 12 or so ingredients on the actual product are unpronounceable chemicals and artificial fragrance, with a miniscule amount of tomato and red tea extract at the very end.  I don&#x27;t know how they get off calling this junk &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; stinks like bad knockoff perfume, and it made me break out.  I got this to try to clear up one random breakout. It wasn&#x27;t bad; just a few spots, really, but I want perfect skin just like everyone else does.  After a week of using this cleanser daily, I had teenage pizza face all over again for the first time in several years.  I stopped using it for a week, and my skin got significantly better.  Then I tried the cleanser again for a few days, and oh look, another breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is obviously a moneymaking scheme... make your acne worse so you have to buy more acne products.  Tsk tsk.</li>
            <li> Great daily cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it! Suds up nicely and leaves skin clean, make sure to use a moisturizer after because it does dry you out!</li>
            <li> not worth it, not clean enough, no tomato I can tell, not even comparable to burt bees, i wish it was.,</li>
            <li> Deceptive marketing strategies, with the different labels and same ingredients. Save your hard earned money and spend it on something you deserve!</li>
            <li> Great product for oily skin. I bought it to replace my beloved Burt&#x27;s Bees Garden Tomato bar when it was discontinued. Please consider making a bar!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and went to the dermatologist from the time I was 13 until I was 17. I stopped going because my dermatologist would send me home with 6 prescriptions at a time, all of which never worked for me. I bought this product along with the acne spot stick at Walgreens about a week ago and I absolutely love it! I literally could see the difference in my acne in just three days, and I am not exaggerating at all. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but when I received the package, the bottles were marked in gray as though someone had gotten them from a dirty warehouse, or a sticker had been peeled off them. Either way, the cleanser has a mild scent to it, and my face felt great after putting it on. I&#x27;ve noticed my face is clearer too.</li>
            <li> Nice and light non irritating great price nice smell.  Face feels clean after you wash. No fillers  95% natural. Good for oily and normal skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleaners I have ever used. I highly recommend the daily cleanser. However, I do nto recommend the face mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens hoping it would work better since it seemed like it would be a natural, gentle cleanser. It made me breakout worse then normal; my face also got red and splotchy.</li>
            <li> If you have acne, this is the product for you.  I recently found myself at age 48 with pimply skin around the chin and nose area.  Since I also have very dry skin, I did not want to use a harsh product that is designed for teenagers.  This product worked great.  Within a couple of days my skin started to clear up and with continual use has stayed cleared.  I would strongly recommend this product, especially for someone with combination and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily. I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious. As a whole, I like this product line. With this product, I actually use this every other night, opposite the deep pore scrub. It definitely helps with the oil. The gel is a bit watery, which means that it doesn&#x27;t lather up all nice and sudsy. But, I am okay with that if my face feels clean and oil free when done, which it does. I also have sensitive skin, and this product line doesn&#x27;t aggravate it. I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant. As of today, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work at first.. But after a few days of using the product, it made my breakouts much much worse.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like tomatoes or anything natural,it has this flowery perfume smell so if smells like that make you feel sick avoid this product,I&#x27;m still going to use it but I wish it the smell wasn&#x27;t so over powering.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it within just a few days!  I am very happy with the product, the quality, the price and the great service I received! I received excellent service, along with a great product!  I would recommend this cleanser to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin. When I first started using this wash I did break out more, which was disconcerting to say the least. But I&#x27;d heard that&#x27;s pretty common when using a new face wash. So I pushed through and kept using it 2 times a day. I&#x27;m now at the end of my 2nd week and my face is much better. It cleared up all my little pimples and white heads, but it hasn&#x27;t done much for the cyst like hard pimples. The ones that are just red, sore and sit there taunting you. But I can deal with a couple sore pimples as long as they aren&#x27;t accompanied by 30 little friends. I also haven&#x27;t got anymore of the stubborn pimples so there is that. I will say, though, that I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is more oily since I&#x27;ve started using this product so goodbye to one star. I use the Yes to Tomatoes Facial Cleansing Pads to help with the oil. The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t bother me although it is strong. Overall, I would recommend this product especially if your acne isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for about a year and are pretty happy with the product.  We like the organic ingredients, the faint smell, and the way it has treated his acne and my occasional break out.  It isn&#x27;t rated as well on the EWG Skin Deep website as we would like, but for the price and effectiveness we are content.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews that this works well for most people, and I&#x27;m sure it does. I typically have fairly sensitive skin, but I thought I would be okay using this product because it&#x27;s natural. However, I was very wrong. I used this product twice, and the result was that my skin dried right out, and I got a rash on my nose, chin, and a few other places on my face, that lasted for the better part of the week. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything in it, so I&#x27;m assuming it was just my skin&#x27;s reaction to the acids in it. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, go for it, but if you do, beware of this product.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is more for mild acne. This line is way to over advertised. I have moderate acne and I used up this whole tube and it barely did anything for me. I guess just because it looks nice and is a little more costly than the regular stuff doesn&#x27;t always means that it will be better. Make sure you know your acne type before buying this product.</li>
            <li> The tomato series has not agreed with my skin. It sometimes burns or makes my skin turn red when I use it. They&#x27;re great products, but it didn&#x27;t agree with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works well. Leaves skin feeling clean (though sometimes not as clean as I would like esp. on my nose). Can be a little drying/irritating for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I want to first start this review off by saying this is how I personally feel about the product, and how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product hoping it would help my mild to moderate acne. I&#x27;d usually get a few small whiteheads on my chin, and the occasional pimple on my cheek where my hair is. I use the Yes To Carrots conditioner (which by the way I highly recommend), and I was hoping I would be happy with another Yes To product. The first few days of using it, my skin seemed to be clearing up, but within a week I had more acne than I&#x27;ve ever had. I have sensitive skin, and this product dried out my skin and caused it to sting a great deal (I have been using the product for almost two weeks, and the burning/stinging started about four days ago). I have not worn any make up since starting this product, I keep my hair up, and I cannot think of any reason as to why I have broken out so badly except this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few good things to say about this product, though. The smell is light, and nice. It would leave my face FEELING clean, but it can&#x27;t obviously be clean if this is happening. The Yes To company doesn&#x27;t test on animals (although I recently read an article saying they have started to test on animals. I am unsure if it&#x27;s a rumor or not, but as of right now, they still have on their website and products they don&#x27;t). The price is doable, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest you try this product if you have sensitive skin. Again, this is just what I experienced, and my opinion of the product. If you do decide to use it, I would suggest going to your local Target, or Wal Mart (I know they carry the product there, I purchased mine at Target), saving the receipt, trying the product, and if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, take it back to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li> Very good product. You get what you pay for. I use this as a morning cleaner &amp; it does the job. May not be the best for acne affected skin but definitely a good wash that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling too dry, but clean.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this dried it out way too much. It really clears my face up but I didn&#x27;t like the dryness effect.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s very cleansing and a little bit goes along way</li>
            <li> Love all yes to products, this is no exception. Works well and would recommend as a daily cleanser, I alternate between this and the deep pore.</li>
            <li> great stuff. great price</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all the reviews that say this facial cleanser helps clear acne.  I mean it doesn&#x27;t say anything about acne on the tube. It&#x27;s suppose to be just a regular old facial cleanser. After washing my face with it for a couple weeks, I noticed I didn&#x27;t have acne anymore. Could it be that this product is all natural? I have tried tons of ointment, medication, $100 facial sessions to rid my acne...and surprisingly this $10 facial cleanser works better...I would like to thank you the yahoo beauty article for directing me to this product. I wouldn&#x27;t have known otherwise. Try it without breaking your bank! You have nothing to lose.  This is now my favorite beauty product.  No more caking on make up to hide my acne, red spots, acne marks!</li>
