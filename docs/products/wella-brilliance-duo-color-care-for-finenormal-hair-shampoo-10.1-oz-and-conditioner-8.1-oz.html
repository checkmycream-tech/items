            <li>One of the best shampoos/conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>And the smell is just the BEST.</li>
            <li>Best of all is the smell is awesome!</li>

            <li>The shampoo smells great!</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair with a beautiful shine of color and volume!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair shiny</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;m hoping that the conditioner will make it even better!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I tried a travel size from Ulta and liked it</li>
            <li>I have not tried the conditioner yet, but the shampoo is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>The shine was outstanding.</li>
            <li>love the shine it leaves in  your hair</li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo and conditioner for fine hair and would recommend regular usage to everyone!</li>
            <li>To their credit, these products have a great fragrance that is not too heavy and is very likable.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay, but seems to take a lot of it to feel like it is really cleaning.  </li>
            <li>hair has never felt softer or looked more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend - holds color and repairs any dryness in the follicles.  </li>
            <li>Based on great reviews online, I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner for my color-treated hair after I really damaged my ends experimenting with the ombre look, didn&#x27;t like it, and colored back over it right away.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>the scent is fresh and heavenly.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my hair is soft and super shiny thanks to the diamond dust.</li>
            <li>These products are specifically for fine hair, so I expected better results.</li>
            <li>and I like how it leaves my hair soft and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I did a touch-up on just my root area and after the first washing with the Wella shampoo and conditioner, it had lightened a bit.</li>
            <li>I can barely comb out my hair, necessitating use of a leave-in product, which I don&#x27;t like because I can easily get oily.  </li>
            <li>and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well</li>
            <li>I think this helps keep my highlights vibrant for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these Wella products.</li>
            <li>This product was first used at my local salon.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s more expensive than drugstore products, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>By the way, my hair texture is fine and it is cut in layers with the longest part being maybe 3 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>pretty good deal - and definitely less expensive than if I bought it a the salon</li>
            <li>Also any other conditioner I have to use so much and still have issues getting it brushed out.</li>

            <li> I tried a travel size from Ulta and liked it so I ordered this and I like it just as much. It smells great and leaves my hair shiny and I can go a couple days between washing my hair without it getting greasy looking.</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos/conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried. And the smell is just the BEST.</li>

            <li> This product was first used at my local salon. The shine was outstanding. Now that I have found this product on amazon, I can continue to maintain that brillant salon shine! Thank you Wella</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!! I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down! Also any other conditioner I have to use so much and still have issues getting it brushed out. With this conditioner I can use a very small amount with no problems. Best of all is the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> love the shine it leaves in  your hair</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend - holds color and repairs any dryness in the follicles.  Also use with Brilliance treatment &#x3D; comes in a jar and I use a little a few hours before I shampoo.  All helps in keeping your hair in great condition!</li>
            <li> Based on great reviews online, I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner for my color-treated hair after I really damaged my ends experimenting with the ombre look, didn&#x27;t like it, and colored back over it right away. To their credit, these products have a great fragrance that is not too heavy and is very likable. Not flowery or fruity, it should work for both men and women. My disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair manageable at all. The shampoo is okay, but seems to take a lot of it to feel like it is really cleaning.  The conditioner gets an F for detangling. I can barely comb out my hair, necessitating use of a leave-in product, which I don&#x27;t like because I can easily get oily.  If I glop on a ton of the conditioner, then I can comb through it, but it is too expensive to be using so much each time. Besides, the brush still will not glide through as I am blow-drying, again necessitating use of some leave-in product. By the way, my hair texture is fine and it is cut in layers with the longest part being maybe 3 inches past my shoulders. These products are specifically for fine hair, so I expected better results. I&#x27;m also not sure if I can verify any color protection from this shampoo and conditioner. I did a touch-up on just my root area and after the first washing with the Wella shampoo and conditioner, it had lightened a bit. I feel that some of the inexpensive brands I&#x27;ve tried from the drugstore can give me the manageable hair I want, so I would not purchase the Wella again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my hair is soft and super shiny thanks to the diamond dust.</li>
            <li> pretty good deal - and definitely less expensive than if I bought it a the salon</li>
            <li> I have not tried the conditioner yet, but the shampoo is really nice.  It lathers up very well and I like how it leaves my hair soft and easy to style.  That&#x27;s why I bought this combo pack -- I&#x27;m hoping that the conditioner will make it even better!  (I was using up my other brand conditioner before I opened this one.)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist. It works for me.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great! A little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know what my issue is.. I can&#x27;t seem to find a shampoo where I can wash a couple times a week. I&#x27;m going to keep trying. I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for a couple weeks now and it feels and looks the same as when I use Nexxus hence the four stars. I&#x27;d give it a try if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves your hair feeling incredibly soft.</li>
