            <li> The only other thing is that I have a relatively large tub</li>
            <li> It seems to be a much smaller container than other bath salts on the market, but that is because it is concentrated...pays to read the labeling...instead of using cups of the product, you use tablespoons.</li>
            <li> Sadly the plastic container of one of them broke and it was a pain to clean it up out of the box.</li>
            <li> I also found this one&#x27;s scent to be very beneficial in helping to open the sinuses and clear the head when fighting a cold.  </li>
            <li> I have recently started taking baths at night because I have trouble getting up for work.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Would give this 5 stars - my husband loves it and swears by the effectiveness - I dropped a star due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> Was concerned it would be too pungent when I first opened the bottle, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was recently in a car accident and broke my foot pretty badly.</li>
            <li> And you only use a few cap gulls per bath, so it lasts a lot longer than any of the bath salts I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I felt warmer than I am use to, and that woke me up, after the fastest half hour I can ever remember.</li>
            <li> It was contained in plastic bag, but it was a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since a bath needs about 500mL of salt, I decided to mix this salt with plain cheaper epsom salt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 of these guys cost about 35$ (3 x 567g) &amp;#34;and&amp;#34; 20lb (9,960g) of plain epsom salt costs</li>
            <li> I bought the sample pouch of this product because i was skeptical about whether it would actually work.</li>
            <li> I only rated a 4 because it will leave a faint line around the tub</li>
            <li> We also keep some in a small jar to take with us to smell.</li>
            <li> Just sprinkle some on the floor and let the water dissolve them slowly.</li>
            <li> but it arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> It works well for my tired hands and feet, soothes muscle and joint pain.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I use it anytime I feel any ache.</li>
            <li> and they werent shipped to the wrong address.</li>
            <li> I wear heels 7 hours per day, and when I get home and take them off my feet are in pain and very tired.</li>
            <li> One of the lids was badly damaged, letting crystals out all over.</li>
            <li> it should help a bunch if your sick.</li>

            <li> These are good bath salts in a pinch. They are not as fragrant as I would like but they are still good for a post work out or high stress workday bath.</li>
            <li> Would give this 5 stars - my husband loves it and swears by the effectiveness - I dropped a star due to the packaging. One of the lids was badly damaged, letting crystals out all over.</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  I put the 2 capfuls in the water and soaked for about 20 minutes and the pain in my legs went away and didn&#x27;t return. It really works.</li>
            <li> Was concerned it would be too pungent when I first opened the bottle, but i was wrong. These are great. If you use more than recommended your body will tingle. I like the feeling, but wife hates it so she uses the recommended amount. The salts will turn the water green, which looks cool.</li>
            <li> Work amazing and came really fast!</li>

            <li> Big fan of this stuff, really does make a bath an oasis.</li>
            <li> I am a triathlete and get aches and pains every now and then after training. I bought the sample pouch of this product because i was skeptical about whether it would actually work. Needless to say, I use it anytime I feel any ache. It is very relaxing and, as a bonus, helps open up my sinuses. Great product!</li>
            <li> smells delightful....really does help those ol&#x27; legs feel so much better at the end of a long day...</li>
            <li> Really gets into your aching muscles and soothes them. Be warned though..you might feel very sleepy after having a bath with this</li>
            <li> Good product, very relaxing. Takes care of aches and pains.</li>
            <li> strong smell and turns the water green with food coloring but makes sore muscles feel better.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of these healing salts. A bath time pleasure.</li>
            <li> An hour of sheer heaven for the tub</li>
            <li> I love these bath salts.  They smell great and when I put them in hot water (it doesn&#x27;t always work if the water is warm) they make my whole skin tingle.  It really helps my muscles loosen after working out.</li>
            <li> Oh I have been using these for years and when my local store stopped carrying them I decided to buy them on Amazon, itâ€™s actually cheaper on Amazon than it was at the store. Sadly the plastic container of one of them broke and it was a pain to clean it up out of the box. This was of no fault of the product but the shipping so Iâ€™m not removing any stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells amazing. Itâ€™s very strong but once put in the bath them smell dissipates and it dissolves in under a minute.</li>
            <li> My entire family loves all of the bath salts.</li>
            <li> Our daughter keeps borrowing this relaxing concoction for her detox baths.  She says  it works really good. I think I&#x27;ll have to get some more soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and safe for the jetted tub.  It relieves stiffness and aches and pains for hours.</li>
            <li> I wear heels 7 hours per day, and when I get home and take them off my feet are in pain and very tired. This has helped me a lot, very relaxing, and smeels amazing</li>
            <li> The aromatherapy benefits of these bath salts are reason enough to buy it! You know you are using a product with eucalyptus in it the instant it is opened! It seems to be a much smaller container than other bath salts on the market, but that is because it is concentrated...pays to read the labeling...instead of using cups of the product, you use tablespoons. Terrific purchase!</li>
            <li> This was my second order of the multi-pack.  I received this as  a gift at first and loved it.  It has that wonderful eucalyptic fragrance and is so relaxing to mind and body.</li>
            <li> My brother loves this and said it works really well - this is the second time purchasing and will be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> It may be all psychological but whenever I add these crystals to my bath, I feel the aches and pains fade away.  I am on my 6th container; I won&#x27;t be without it in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> love these bath therapy soaks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted...love this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I used it after a ski trip when I was very sore, and it relieved my achy muscles! Great price too.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful but it arrived broken.  It was contained in plastic bag, but it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Love it.  So relaxing.</li>
            <li> nice for the jacuzzi - delightful aroma</li>
            <li> I like this a lot but have one request to the makers:  ***get rid of the coloring.***  Coloring isn&#x27;t good for us unless it&#x27;s plant based (e.g. beets).  Sure there&#x27;s a constructed mental equation for people with lilac &#x3D; lavender &amp; green &#x3D; eucalyptus (etc)...but .how about colored labels instead?  Right now I&#x27;m more inclined to just add my own oils to salt.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and the lady seems to really like it.  The smell of this stuff is strong and smells kind of like Vicks Vaporub ... it should help a bunch if your sick.</li>
            <li> Love this breand of sault and keep buying all of them.</li>
            <li> these are great items, i just wish i had paid attention and they werent shipped to the wrong address. my fault there.</li>
            <li> These are relaxing and rejuvenating bath salts. I mix them in with pure magnesium bath salts, like Ancient Minerals. The scent and color make the bath even more satisfying. i highly recommend</li>
            <li> Is it soothing and relaxing? I filled my tub over the suggested amount of crystals, climbed in, laid back, and promptly fell asleep.... For the first in years, in the tub. All of a sudden I felt warmer than I am use to, and that woke me up, after the fastest half hour I can ever remember. I felt refreshed, and no sore muscles or joints.&lt;br /&gt;When the tub was filling the scent was strong but lovely. Once the tub was full the scent was much softer. Not being a fan of strong perfumes, this was delicious. And you only use a few cap gulls per bath, so it lasts a lot longer than any of the bath salts I&#x27;ve used in the past. Because it isn&#x27;t a soap or bubble bath, I am able to use it with my jacuzzi turned on.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product and a great price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves all of these.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the woman in my family. Not too pricy, but almost. Might buy a different variation for my next gift.</li>
            <li> I love this bath soak. I have recently started taking baths at night because I have trouble getting up for work. Baths have become my sanctuary. A nice long soak and I am completely relaxed. I have tried many different brands. I do like everything in the california bath salt line. But this mineral soak, it at the top of my list. I smells nice and does help with aches and pains. It&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!! have purchased many times!</li>
            <li> Smell good and help relax you.</li>
            <li> I was recently in a car accident and broke my foot pretty badly. I&#x27;m against pain killers so I needed some natural relief. Let me just say that this stuff works WONDERS! I have to admit, I was influenced by a review I read of a woman saying she fell asleep the first time she used these. And boy, did she hit the nail on the head! My husband drew the bath for me and when I entered the bathroom I was overcome with a feeling of relaxation. The smell is heavenly. I almost fell asleep myself. It took virtually all of my pain away in my entire body and made my broken foot feel AMAZING. I would recommend this stuff for anyone who needs a nice, calm soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> I love this product is menthol smell so good but looks over price some times you can buy it at Wallmart for a cheaper price</li>
            <li> These were gifts and everyone loved them!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these due to the great value as opposed to buying them individually.  I only rated a 4 because it will leave a faint line around the tub but it is easy to clean up. The only other thing is that I have a relatively large tub so I use a little more than a normal tub would. The salts dissolve relatively well with a pleasant smell, not overpowering and very relaxing.  I also found this one&#x27;s scent to be very beneficial in helping to open the sinuses and clear the head when fighting a cold.  They arrived exactly as posted and described.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Good deal!!</li>
            <li> If you have aches and pains- arthritis- etc- you need to get this product!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;Put some of this in your bath and soak- it is marvelous- takes the edge off my constant arthritis pain and the aromatherapy is wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I really like these salts. Not overpowering smell but really makes you feel fresh. A++++</li>
            <li> As described. No damage.</li>
            <li> Great stuff after a workout. helps the day-after soreness</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. It tingles</li>
            <li> It was 19.99 when I bought it but now its 29.00 so I wont be purchasing it on line, I will probably just drive to targets. But I love the smell and how relaxing and refreshing it make my nightly bath rituals.</li>
            <li> We use this in the shower when we are congested. Just sprinkle some on the floor and let the water dissolve them slowly. We also keep some in a small jar to take with us to smell. It works great in the bath too.</li>
            <li> It works well for my tired hands and feet, soothes muscle and joint pain. I used it very frequently because it helps.</li>
            <li> perfect. you actually do get about 10 baths per bottle. well worth the money.</li>
            <li> always good product, became unavailable locally</li>
            <li> These are the best for aches at the end of a long day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great however if you are like me you will probably find the price to be a bit too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a bath needs about 500mL of salt, I decided to mix this salt with plain cheaper epsom salt. (500mL is about 1/2 one of the three containers that comes with this purchase)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 of these guys cost about 35$ (3 x 567g) &amp;#34;and&amp;#34; 20lb (9,960g) of plain epsom salt costs about 30$. I mixed these 2 products together in a plastic bin and was pleased at the results. (Instead of $35&#x27;s lasting 6 baths, $65&#x27;s lasted about 41 baths)</li>
