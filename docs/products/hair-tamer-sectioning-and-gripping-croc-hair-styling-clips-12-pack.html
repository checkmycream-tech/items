            <li>The spring on the product where the clip hooks to accommodate thicker and fuller is easily manipulated.  </li>
            <li>The spring on the product where the clip hooks to accommodate thicker and fuller is easily manipulated.  </li>

            <li>: The bottom part of the clip doesn&#x27;t slide in and out of hair easily, it snags a bit.</li>

            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was supposed to do something special.</li>
            <li>They are very strong and sturdy and are able to hold large amounts of hair in place at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clips are hands down the BEST!</li>
            <li>I wash them after use and they are good as new.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and leave no leftover creases in the hair.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fairly fine.  </li>

            <li>She needs to put up her hair every night for shower and they worked perfectly fine for that.</li>
            <li>Thicker hair would probably require more than one clip, but luckily this set comes with six!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Product as described and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I think they are very good if you don’t have short and very fine straight hair like I do.</li>
            <li>My other clips that came with my flat iron ended up breaking and these were a great replacement for a great price!</li>
            <li>I love these clips and it is so much easier to do my hair now!!</li>
            <li>I have much softer and fine hair and these clips are amazing for me as well.  </li>

            <li>They were delivered quickly and we were not disappointed!</li>
            <li>super excited about these clips and know I will get tons of use out of them!</li>
            <li>super excited about these clips and know I will get tons of use out of them!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Amazingly secure grip.</li>
            <li>Great hold and lasting clip.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>I thought these clips did a great job at securing back any amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say I that I will definitely be ordering a full pack of them soon as I am that impressed by them.  </li>
            <li>teeth- like that hold and secure the hair with in it.  </li>
            <li>, I can just grab one of these clips, and secure my hair in it.  </li>
            <li>I adjust the amount of hair as I smooth each section.</li>
            <li>They keep my hair in place and secure.</li>
            <li>All in all a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about these clips.  </li>
            <li>The gripper bits allow for a secure hold that doesn’t droop but still manages not to catch and tear your hair in the release.</li>
            <li>But given how fabulous these clips work</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li>Just one clip works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;For straightening, styling, coloring, blow drying and for daily use these clips work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also think they would be great for regular salon use.  </li>
            <li>Ease of opening, they feel sturdy when placed and they come out smooth.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is top quality and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li>These clips are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic, stay in place no hair snagging.  </li>
            <li>I received these clips for free as a promotion</li>
            <li>They hold my hair securely without pulling or hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li>Hair will not slip out of these fabulous hair clips.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comparable in price to similar clips and they come in an awesome array of colors!  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my last set, these snag the hair for some reason more than the others ones &amp; somehow don&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li>Comments/recommendations on products for fine, flat hair welcome).</li>
            <li>Works great to separate my hair securely while I&#x27;m flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to SalonGuys for sending me these!!!</li>
            <li>The croc clips were very useful in keeping the sections of my hair separate.</li>
            <li>that I think this will be very useful for.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that if the croc clip would hold my hair it would surely pull my fine hair out when I took it out.  </li>
            <li>Great for separating hair for drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I curl my hair on a normal basis and I love using this to section out my hair!</li>
            <li>Nice and decent packaging.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and these clips have been great for when I straighten my hair or even if I just need to pull it up and out of my face without crushing my curls.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying these hair clips very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li>$16 clips by Drybar and I  didn&#x27;t see a significant difference, besides price of course.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it here and there while styling and have found it sturdy and usefuL!</li>
            <li>To save money, I am always coloring my own hair and my kids when they request for a new look.</li>
            <li>Not only do they manage my youngest&#x27;s hair shorter and finer hair with ease the way these clips have a hinged hook to manage groups of hair with more body/volume makes them amazing for my hair as well.  </li>
            <li>always keep my sections clean and organized.</li>
            <li>Great tool used for sectionong hair to dry, straighten or curl.</li>
            <li>They work great for so many different situations in where you need to focus on something particular in your hair while keeping the rest out of the way.</li>
            <li>They work great for so many different situations in where you need to focus on something particular in your hair while keeping the rest out of the way.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and would definitely recommend them to my mom friends who are trying to recreate all those popular hairstyles and braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do you understand why they have so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>these are by far my favorite clips ever!</li>
            <li>They are unique in this manner and have a cool look to theml.</li>
            <li>I received these clips directly from the vendor and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>Overall, the quality of these clips are very good, strong, and completely adjustable for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>They work better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at large box stores.</li>
            <li>She says that, while she doesn&#x27;t typically wear make-up (and I love her for that!), they can be quite handy to keep hair out of one&#x27;s face while washing/cleansing.</li>
            <li>The finish on them is great when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>I love after coming home and ready to work in the kitchen</li>
            <li>so not THAT cool...</li>
            <li>They are also a nice matte-black color without design or logo which makes them look professional.</li>
            <li>She wants more hair clips for herself also.</li>
            <li>They have a nice &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; bite and  spring action, again showing both durability and versatility.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are made of good quality plastic and will also you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to grip and the teeth on the clip make sure your hair stays in place nice and comfortably without ripping you hair out or sliding down.</li>
            <li>It takes a little work just opening them, the spring is so strong, which is great, because you know immediately it&#x27;s going to have no problem staying put in hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a LOT of it, and I can actually pull all of my up on top of my head with one clip!</li>
            <li>Very useful and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>They held the hair exactly in place and the clip was easy to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li>These are most certainly well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are most certainly well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to open using the thumb lever and they certainly hold their section of hair securely until they&#x27;re released, and they release cleanly without catching or tearing at the hair as they come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strands are pretty fine, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>The clips were shipped quickly, I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that quick.</li>
            <li>the clips are great for holding my hair in place until I&#x27;m ready to go on to the next section.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I got the opportunity to try the Croc hair styling clips from hair Tamer in exchange of an unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>also love that it comes in a set of 6  which is more than enough for one head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(so I am giving them 4 stars), but luckily I got six of them</li>
            <li>They easily hold a large chunk of hair and when you remove them they don&#x27;t pull on your hair.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly strong and very high quality</li>
            <li>, They have a unique system that I&#x27;ve never seen before that allows for part of the clip to retract and catch on another part of the clip, which allows for more hair to fit in the clip, unlike standard alligator clips.</li>
            <li>the new ones have a slightly more tapered bottom to slide easier into hair.</li>
            <li>These clips are my new favorite hair tool.  </li>
            <li>These black croc clips are great.</li>
            <li>I bought a set from Dry Bar for $30 and these are just as good.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and really do hold a lot of slippery hair.</li>
            <li>They are easy to get a god grip with and they sit in the hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I need some good clips that can keep my hair up and out of the way when I&#x27;m trying to style or dry separate sections of my hair.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what they&#x27;re made to do!</li>
            <li>I’m willing to pick up a comb (sacrifices!).</li>
            <li>These do exactly what they say they should!</li>
            <li>They make it so easy to section of your hair for pretty much anything!</li>
            <li>I never thought I would ever come across such strong gripping hair clips.</li>
            <li>These clips have a great hold so if you need tight hair clips purchase these I recommend them.</li>
            <li>Traveling with these are great as they take little space.</li>
            <li>They are great for holding fine hair as well as thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and these clips hold it up perfectly!</li>
            <li>These clips are super strong right from the touch you can tell these are high quality, durable clips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are nice and large and very useful for a lot of different things.</li>
            <li>What makes that so amazing is that this very same clip will hold a twist containing ALL the rest of my hair, without sliding or budging either.</li>
            <li>The hinged clip in the croc clip really does keep the sections of my hair secure.</li>
            <li>These clips are amazing (and I’ve tried a LOT of different brands).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth  </li>
            <li>The spring has a nice tension that seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips have already come in handy far more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips have already come in handy far more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>This is also a nice clip to pull your hair back for washing your face or for putting on a mask without getting it in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li>They work great, but melt easily in barbicide if left in too long.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic clips with a unique holding action.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but they just don&#x27;t seem to provide the strong hold that I normally see at the hair salons.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and most clips just slide out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried these, and have given them to friends; all have found them comfortable, secure, and a nice change from our usual clips.</li>
            <li>I do have longer hair with a wavy texture so a lot of clips tend to just have my hair slip right through, but not these.  </li>
            <li>They are just the right size and seem to be well-made.</li>
            <li>I received these clips and used them right away.</li>
            <li>Good, solid hold and easy to grab and open when your hands are slippery with styling products or hair color.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but my long hair still gets tangled and caught in these clips.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the ability to adjust the tension/strength of the clip, especially on my daughters hair which is very fine.  </li>
            <li>Great grip and very heavy duty and durable</li>
            <li>love them, will be purchasing more and its a pretty good deal, only wish if they make in more colors other than black.</li>
            <li>They arrived in the mail right on time and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I received them quickly and they really hold your hair without pulling.</li>
            <li>These are strong, professional quality clips</li>
            <li>I only had to place the clip once, and it kept all of my hair perfectly out of the way, and stayed in place while I dried and styled section by section of my hair.</li>
            <li>These Black Croc Styling clips work perfectly whether it was a large volume of hair or down to a fine strand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had one problem with them once they got stuck in my hair while I tried pulling them out, but it was fine in the end they ended up coming out!</li>
            <li>Even right after hair is washed and clean and nothing seems to stay put in hair when it&#x27;s this soft!</li>
            <li>I use them on my hair and was very pleased because with other clips i have to use a couple of clips but these hold my hair only with one clip because you are able to move the sizing of the clips .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic and I would highly recommend these Croc Clips to absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li>I could easily place my focus on holding the dryer and brush and working on the other section of my hair, while these amazing clips kept the rest of my hair completely out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They provide a great hold on long and short hair with out snagging your hair.</li>
            <li>These are great for styling thick hair.</li>
            <li>With more use, I can see them getting &#x27;worn in&#x27; and getting easier to open.</li>
            <li>(at home, these aren&#x27;t exactly the type of hair clips you&#x27;d wear out and about.)</li>
            <li>I need to figure out exactly what the clasp is for.</li>
            <li>The double hinge, the teeth and the texture combine to work their magic no matter what amount of hair they are asked to corral.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better than tying it back in a ponytail..</li>
            <li>I also love that they do not snag the hair when I go to open the release and take them out.</li>
            <li>These will hold SO much hair!</li>
            <li>Two of my clips broke within the first week of receiving the package.</li>
            <li>I have used many a different clip and almost ALL of them sliip out or my hair doesn&#x27;t stay in.  </li>
            <li>A couple reviews say that they have had them break on the first use.</li>
            <li>My kid sister got married and came to me to do her hair before her reception.</li>
            <li>She wanted to dye her hair for the first time, and she wanted to try an ombre style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Creating an ombre style requires a lot of sectioning and clipping to keep the dye consistent.</li>
            <li>These clips are exactly what you want to have for holding up the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling!</li>
            <li>Pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>I wanted hair clips like the ones my hit dresser uses on my hair and these hit the mark exactly.</li>
            <li>but, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is hot from blow drying as I will leave creases.</li>
            <li>Other than that- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with them at all :) I would definitely re-order!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with them overall.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that these clips have an extra hinge on the top that essentially forms a triangle around your hair to keep it from spilling out.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and they work great.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was looking for, and as described.</li>
            <li>These make styling your hair so much easier!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so I was able to use one to clip back all of my hair while applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and wanted to order something cost effective, functional, and different than the clips most of our other stylists use so</li>
            <li>They make the hair styling process (flat ironing or curling) so much more effortless.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate a product that gets the job done and a company that takes care of business and delivers the product in the next 7 business day.now, I can consider myself a better stylist and not a baby stylist.</li>
            <li>When drying, styling, or coloring and I need to secure my baby fine, silky, soft, slippery, poker-straight hair, the last thing I need is a wrestling match with a clip.</li>
            <li>I will honestly never use another hair clip again after using these they are amazing!</li>
            <li>May be a bit rough for fragile hair but great for think hair as really holds during styling.</li>
            <li>I first tested these clips on my daughter and it didn&#x27;t matter how much she moved, the clips did not budge or slide off.</li>
            <li>It held very good in small and larger bunches of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got them and am now wondering how I&#x27;ve gone so long without them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got them and am now wondering how I&#x27;ve gone so long without them!</li>
            <li>Easy to open and handle when handling the hair.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t last as long as the ceramics, however they are a good deal.</li>
            <li>They work great in long hair as they hold a large portion of hair at one time without hair slipping.  </li>
            <li>They are surprisingly large, sturdy, and easily hold big bites of hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin curly hair that most clips fall out.  </li>
            <li>Great clips, holds thick hair!</li>
            <li>These clips have a great locking system for thick hair!</li>
            <li>Also are great for wet or dry use.  </li>
            <li>I always look for nice clips which can hold my hair tightly.</li>
            <li>At first I thought with the way they expand that theyd only be good for someone with thick hair or trying to secure a roller.  </li>
            <li>I have them 4 stars because they wont work as well on thinner hair... and a regular clip would work fine.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly hair and these clips are great for holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought they looked a little clunky for their purpose, however; after the first use I was able to get the hang of them.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:9fced77284c81ee361ffcadc70b53694]]I just recently figured out that it makes a HUGE difference when you are blow drying and straightening your hair to do it in sections.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>I was weary spending this much on hair clips since I could have gotten a 12 pack of metal clips from Target.</li>
            <li>Because I have so much hair, I&#x27;ve found it easier to section my hair off with clips to ensure that I&#x27;ve conditioned every strand.</li>
            <li>These work really well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>purchased a set a year ago, now I received a set free from the same seller (Salon Guys) for unbiased review.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like I had to use a million clips just to keep my hair up, because the clips I had didn&#x27;t stay very well.  </li>
            <li>The clips are equally fabulous at holding sections of various sizes while drying, straightening or curling.</li>
            <li>I used to use much thinner ones and compared to them</li>
            <li>I find them to work really well when you are foiling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really awesome.best clips ever it doesn&#x27;t brake you hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like the jagged teeth on these clips which will insure that these clips stay in place.</li>
            <li>found that anything that comes close to working well on my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my youngest whose hair is shorter and much finer.  </li>
            <li>and I assume very curly hair (of which I have neither).</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for 10 years and these croc clips are the best for sectioning hair, holding hair in place while foiling or cutting, or styling.</li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t pull the hair and they stayed in really well.  </li>
            <li>I also used them on someone with much thicker hair</li>
            <li>but I also use them just to keep my hair out of my face when I am doing my makeup and getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair in place really well.</li>
            <li>Styling is finally so much easier.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let go until you&#x27;re ready</li>
            <li>The clips are available in various colors and patterns.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really like croc clips.</li>
            <li>These clips are really durable.</li>
            <li>No complaints here and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>They hold very well.</li>
            <li>Durable, grips very well and doesn&#x27;t damage hair when removed.  </li>
            <li>They really are a ilfe saver when it comes to styling or drying hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really are a ilfe saver when it comes to styling or drying hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and well built.  </li>
            <li>really likes the hinge effect on the clips.  </li>
            <li>In her opinion, they worked really well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use hair clips to section out hair while styling as well as anyone who just wants to put hair up.  </li>
            <li>it really helps me divide my hair</li>
            <li>if its from having too much hair in it at once.</li>
            <li>The configuration of these clips really hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
            <li>They work really well in all hair types</li>
            <li>These work really well to clip up hair out of the way for curling or trimming.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li>and they hold very well.</li>
            <li>The clips hold really well all day.</li>
            <li>Another good thing was how wide the clip actually opens.</li>
            <li>These are the same type of clips my hair dresser uses - they work so much better than the old silver ones.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, being sturdy is most important &amp; they definitely past that test!</li>
            <li>Some days I love them, other days not so much.</li>
            <li>They are also really good for bleaching/dying hair, since they aren&#x27;t metal like other similar clips.</li>
            <li>I used these on myself and several other people while styling to give them a good trial run.</li>
            <li>top of it all they are extremely sturdily made.  </li>
            <li>top of it all they are extremely sturdily made.  </li>
            <li>The grip has a bit of texture that helps open up the clip which is unique.</li>
            <li>Perfect for holding my very long and heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li>They are specially designed to open fuller but still hold the hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and you can bet I&#x27;ll be keeping mine where I can easily get to them every single time i need to style my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and you can bet I&#x27;ll be keeping mine where I can easily get to them every single time i need to style my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many uses, when I get out of the shower I dry my hair first, then I use these to hold back my front and side bangs in order to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>I rely on clips like this when styling my hair and good ones like this a hard to come by!</li>
            <li>They are easy to grab and manipulate while hands are wet.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t slip and that was my main concern.</li>
            <li>These tamer hair styling clips are high on my list for sectioned wet hair, and holding the hair to allow for an easy blowout.</li>
            <li>Amazing clips that hold both soft and fine hair, and a big thick mop.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly hair that I blow out every day because I think it looks more professional.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has long thick hair &amp; these clips are perfect for her to section her hair when she is curling or straightening it.</li>
            <li>The clip looks normal but the top half is sort of hinged and bends in a triangular fashion, so as to move and expand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the clips.</li>
            <li>It has little teeth on top and bottom to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>The claw is covers the whole top section of the clip and is wide and big allowing for hold of even super big chunks of</li>
            <li>They have a nice big, tight spring, that really keeps a hold on the hair when placed in hair.</li>
            <li>They are too loose, don&#x27;t have good grip, and fall out easily, which can be incredibly frustrating when you&#x27;re already trying to hold a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other, to straighten out and smooth a separate section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These croc clips are about 5&amp;#34; long and made of a very heavy duty plastic with a unique double hinged design and two springs that allow them to adjust automatically to keep a good grip on any amount or thickness of hair.</li>
            <li>These clips work great with long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more in the near future!</li>
            <li>Maybe everyone doesn’t like to pay a few bucks more for the patterns.  </li>
            <li>Well made and sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice clips that hold my thick hair when blow dring without falling out.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and a package of six is definitely enough for most styles and a few extra.</li>
            <li>They were not hard.</li>
            <li>Very different in the right way.</li>
            <li>The cool way you can prop them open wider seems to indication you could put them around large bunches of hair or smaller rollers.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed these large styling clips for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>how did I live without them?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is reasonable, however next time I&#x27;ll just stick with a more well known brand, and purchase the type of flat metal hair clips used at actual salons.</li>
            <li>The only downside: because the gripper clamp begins immediately at the free end of the clip I’ve had to abandon my habit of using the tip to part out the next section.</li>
            <li>These are definitely a high quality, professional hair clip.</li>
            <li>One of the parts I like best, is that the part where you hold on to the clip in order to press it open has these little grips so that you have control (and are less likely to drop the clip.)</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, and these clips do a great job sectioning my hair when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li>They stay in and help me style my hair like II&#x27;ve not been able to in the past.</li>
            <li>These are much better quality than similar and more expensive clips I had been purchasing at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>While they are by no means something you would wear out into public, since they are simple and not particularly attractive, they are incredibly functional.  </li>
            <li>The most I have had to use out of a packet was 3, I usually just use 1 or 2 to give me a hand while curling my hair.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and hold as much or as little hair as needed.  </li>
            <li>I love them because they don&#x27;t pull at my hair yet have a very firm grip.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and were exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>They hold better than the other flat clips I have.  </li>
            <li>I thought these would be a good alternative to the metal ones and that they might be a little less damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li>But what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re trying to hold back a small amount of hair or a lot because it adjusts and clips snuggly no matter how much hair you clip in.</li>
            <li>Second hinge in these makes for a style that doesn&#x27;t fall loose as easily as others I&#x27;ve tried and still are gentle enough not to break the hair.</li>
            <li>The old model had a slightly thicker bottom part that sometimes didn&#x27;t slide smoothly into my hair.</li>
            <li>Hurrah, no need to have different size clips for different jobs and no more frustration at never being able to put my hands on the right size clip when I need it -</li>
            <li>These are also great for curling and straightening hair they have a really tight hold, so if you need clips for thick hair</li>
            <li>The extra piece on the top is a little funky.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe, just as a regular joe schmoe, that I haven&#x27;t used these clips earlier to better dry and style my hair!  </li>
            <li>My daughter who has very thick wavy hair tried the croc clip while she straightened her hair and is very impressed with the hold it has for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li>Will probably purchase another pack in the near future use to have a little more on hand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for sectioning off hair for cutting, coloring, or styling and they won&#x27;t slip when working with wet hair.</li>
            <li>I think these clips would work very well on straight hair, but not on Coily African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used them while getting ready to style my hair in different sections, around the house, and even out a couple times.</li>
            <li>I have always used the old school clips that don&#x27;t have teeth because I was under the impression that alligator style clips would leave kinks in my hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very versatile since I use them for holding different sections up while using a straightener or curling iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received these clips directly from the Salon Guys for the purpose of trying them out &amp; reviewing.</li>
            <li>The construction seems durable enough to last through lots of usage, and they would be as useful to a professional hair salon as they are in my home.</li>
            <li>They are of a professional salon quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clips are made of plastic and therefore are not heavy.</li>
            <li>These clips are so useful for holding up my hair when cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>They would likely be equally useful for the same purpose when applying make-up.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more if they are ever misplaced.</li>
            <li>these would be useful for anyone who is cutting or coloring their own hair.</li>
            <li>I see most reviews are from people with thick hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and hair clips usually slip out several times before I finish curling my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>A quick twist and one clip is all it takes to hold back my entire long, straight mane.</li>
            <li>my hair slides right out of the straight clips and I can use a few of these and clip my hair up completely</li>
            <li>Have to free my other hand to open the clip.</li>
            <li>but not extremely tight.</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away that they were indeed strong enough to do this all on their own, as my hair is really thick and makes quite a thick pony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away that they were indeed strong enough to do this all on their own, as my hair is really thick and makes quite a thick pony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality for such an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for such a high quality, durable item.</li>
            <li>I have super long, super thick hair</li>
            <li>They hold like no other!</li>
            <li>The black doesn&#x27;t look as cheaply made as the white.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to hold my hair but it too heavy...</li>
            <li>so I normally have to use multiple clips to hold up my hair, but not with these.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>It takes a little effort to get used to the strength required to open, but once you get that, you will enjoy these too.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and these hold up very well without creasing.</li>
            <li>; clips have two hinges to help them easily grab onto thick sections of hair.</li>
            <li>use these ALL THE TIME, I have never broken a single one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tight but it&#x27;s also not loose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tight but it&#x27;s also not loose.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>They do not come loose and the hold the hair very well.  </li>
            <li>The small teeth kept these clips from sliding while I was working and the spring hinge was easy to open</li>
            <li>No matter how much hair I throw into a bunch, it works on any amount, small and large.  </li>
            <li>I can use them for large or small hair sections while sectioning my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has very kinky/curly texture).  </li>
            <li>No slipping or budging when you use the croc hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have three girls with long thick hair in our household, so when I was invited to participate in a consumer research project to evaluate, test, and review these Hair Tamer Croc Hair Styling Clips I gladly accepted.  </li>
            <li>They are sturdy, which is extremely important for my thick course hair, when sectioning.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair/medium length (past my shoulders), and one of these does a really good job of holding up half of my hair while I am</li>
            <li>These hair clips, on the other hand, hold a large amount of hair and do not slide off.</li>
            <li>These clamps are just plain  fun.</li>
            <li>When I first gave them to her, she didnt expect them to be any different than other clips.  </li>
            <li>The seller was fast and they were shipped very carefully to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as well as far more expensive brand name.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, hard to open, hurts fingers when trying to open the clip.  </li>
            <li>They work great with wet or dry hair, really thin to super thick hair and everything in between, short hair or long hair, hair that has dye in it or does not.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t barely pinch them open because the clamp is so wobbly.</li>
            <li>I have long thick fine hair.  </li>
            <li>so I need something tough and strong to keep my hair UP.</li>
            <li>These things are made right, very durable for my thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t slip out of your fingers when wet.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, because my hair is also very fine, they would slide out while I was trying to use them.</li>
            <li>I also can appreciate how easily I can grip the clips while opening them up since the finger tip ends are ridged after dealing with the previous brands slipping out of my wet finger tips.</li>
            <li>The Black Croc clips are very versatile...</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>Other clips don&#x27;t have the extra clip on top and allows for thick hair  to slip through having to use several clips just to keep the hair up!</li>
            <li>not only do they work well with thick full hair but also on fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and have issues finding something that can hold it up, especially when blow drying,  These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These clips are fantastic for both fine/thin hair and thick hair as well!  </li>
            <li>These hair clips hold everything very well from towels around the neck to dry or wet hair to capes etc.</li>
            <li>I have super thick and coarse hair</li>
            <li>I used to have to keep a couple different clips handy at work, small ones for fine hair and giant claw clips for thick long hair, these clips seriously work for all hair types.</li>

            <li> I have much softer and fine hair and these clips are amazing for me as well.  </li>
            <li> Since they hold such a large amount of hair I&#x27;ve found them to be perfect for when I wash my face!</li>
            <li> They were delivered quickly and we were not disappointed!</li>
            <li> super excited about these clips and know I will get tons of use out of them!</li>
            <li> super excited about these clips and know I will get tons of use out of them!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Amazingly secure grip.</li>
            <li> Great hold and lasting clip.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> I thought these clips did a great job at securing back any amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say I that I will definitely be ordering a full pack of them soon as I am that impressed by them.  </li>
            <li> teeth- like that hold and secure the hair with in it.  </li>
            <li> , I can just grab one of these clips, and secure my hair in it.  </li>
            <li> I adjust the amount of hair as I smooth each section.</li>
            <li> They keep my hair in place and secure.</li>
            <li> All in all a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about these clips.  </li>
            <li> The gripper bits allow for a secure hold that doesn’t droop but still manages not to catch and tear your hair in the release.</li>
            <li> But given how fabulous these clips work</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li> Just one clip works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;For straightening, styling, coloring, blow drying and for daily use these clips work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also think they would be great for regular salon use.  </li>
            <li> Ease of opening, they feel sturdy when placed and they come out smooth.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is top quality and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> These clips are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They are fantastic, stay in place no hair snagging.  </li>
            <li> I received these clips for free as a promotion</li>
            <li> They hold my hair securely without pulling or hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li> Hair will not slip out of these fabulous hair clips.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comparable in price to similar clips and they come in an awesome array of colors!  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my last set, these snag the hair for some reason more than the others ones &amp; somehow don&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
            <li> Comments/recommendations on products for fine, flat hair welcome).</li>
            <li> Works great to separate my hair securely while I&#x27;m flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to SalonGuys for sending me these!!!</li>
            <li> The croc clips were very useful in keeping the sections of my hair separate.</li>
            <li> that I think this will be very useful for.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that if the croc clip would hold my hair it would surely pull my fine hair out when I took it out.  </li>
            <li> Great for separating hair for drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair on a normal basis and I love using this to section out my hair!</li>
            <li> Nice and decent packaging.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and these clips have been great for when I straighten my hair or even if I just need to pull it up and out of my face without crushing my curls.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying these hair clips very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li> $16 clips by Drybar and I  didn&#x27;t see a significant difference, besides price of course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it here and there while styling and have found it sturdy and usefuL!</li>
            <li> To save money, I am always coloring my own hair and my kids when they request for a new look.</li>
            <li> Not only do they manage my youngest&#x27;s hair shorter and finer hair with ease the way these clips have a hinged hook to manage groups of hair with more body/volume makes them amazing for my hair as well.  </li>
            <li> always keep my sections clean and organized.</li>
            <li> Great tool used for sectionong hair to dry, straighten or curl.</li>
            <li> They work great for so many different situations in where you need to focus on something particular in your hair while keeping the rest out of the way.</li>
            <li> They work great for so many different situations in where you need to focus on something particular in your hair while keeping the rest out of the way.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and would definitely recommend them to my mom friends who are trying to recreate all those popular hairstyles and braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do you understand why they have so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> these are by far my favorite clips ever!</li>
            <li> They are unique in this manner and have a cool look to theml.</li>
            <li> I received these clips directly from the vendor and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality of these clips are very good, strong, and completely adjustable for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> They work better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at large box stores.</li>
            <li> She says that, while she doesn&#x27;t typically wear make-up (and I love her for that!), they can be quite handy to keep hair out of one&#x27;s face while washing/cleansing.</li>
            <li> The finish on them is great when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I love after coming home and ready to work in the kitchen</li>
            <li> so not THAT cool...</li>
            <li> They are also a nice matte-black color without design or logo which makes them look professional.</li>
            <li> She wants more hair clips for herself also.</li>
            <li> They have a nice &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; bite and  spring action, again showing both durability and versatility.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are made of good quality plastic and will also you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to grip and the teeth on the clip make sure your hair stays in place nice and comfortably without ripping you hair out or sliding down.</li>
            <li> It takes a little work just opening them, the spring is so strong, which is great, because you know immediately it&#x27;s going to have no problem staying put in hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a LOT of it, and I can actually pull all of my up on top of my head with one clip!</li>
            <li> Very useful and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> They held the hair exactly in place and the clip was easy to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li> These are most certainly well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are most certainly well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to open using the thumb lever and they certainly hold their section of hair securely until they&#x27;re released, and they release cleanly without catching or tearing at the hair as they come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strands are pretty fine, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The clips were shipped quickly, I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that quick.</li>
            <li> the clips are great for holding my hair in place until I&#x27;m ready to go on to the next section.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I got the opportunity to try the Croc hair styling clips from hair Tamer in exchange of an unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> also love that it comes in a set of 6  which is more than enough for one head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so I am giving them 4 stars), but luckily I got six of them</li>
            <li> They easily hold a large chunk of hair and when you remove them they don&#x27;t pull on your hair.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly strong and very high quality</li>
            <li> , They have a unique system that I&#x27;ve never seen before that allows for part of the clip to retract and catch on another part of the clip, which allows for more hair to fit in the clip, unlike standard alligator clips.</li>
            <li> the new ones have a slightly more tapered bottom to slide easier into hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are my new favorite hair tool.  </li>
            <li> These black croc clips are great.</li>
            <li> I bought a set from Dry Bar for $30 and these are just as good.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and really do hold a lot of slippery hair.</li>
            <li> They are easy to get a god grip with and they sit in the hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I need some good clips that can keep my hair up and out of the way when I&#x27;m trying to style or dry separate sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what they&#x27;re made to do!</li>
            <li> I’m willing to pick up a comb (sacrifices!).</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they say they should!</li>
            <li> They make it so easy to section of your hair for pretty much anything!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever come across such strong gripping hair clips.</li>
            <li> These clips have a great hold so if you need tight hair clips purchase these I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Traveling with these are great as they take little space.</li>
            <li> They are great for holding fine hair as well as thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and these clips hold it up perfectly!</li>
            <li> These clips are super strong right from the touch you can tell these are high quality, durable clips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are nice and large and very useful for a lot of different things.</li>
            <li> What makes that so amazing is that this very same clip will hold a twist containing ALL the rest of my hair, without sliding or budging either.</li>
            <li> The hinged clip in the croc clip really does keep the sections of my hair secure.</li>
            <li> These clips are amazing (and I’ve tried a LOT of different brands).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth  </li>
            <li> The spring has a nice tension that seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clips have already come in handy far more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clips have already come in handy far more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> This is also a nice clip to pull your hair back for washing your face or for putting on a mask without getting it in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li> They work great, but melt easily in barbicide if left in too long.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic clips with a unique holding action.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t seem to provide the strong hold that I normally see at the hair salons.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and most clips just slide out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these, and have given them to friends; all have found them comfortable, secure, and a nice change from our usual clips.</li>
            <li> I do have longer hair with a wavy texture so a lot of clips tend to just have my hair slip right through, but not these.  </li>
            <li> They are just the right size and seem to be well-made.</li>
            <li> I received these clips and used them right away.</li>
            <li> Good, solid hold and easy to grab and open when your hands are slippery with styling products or hair color.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but my long hair still gets tangled and caught in these clips.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the ability to adjust the tension/strength of the clip, especially on my daughters hair which is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Great grip and very heavy duty and durable</li>
            <li> love them, will be purchasing more and its a pretty good deal, only wish if they make in more colors other than black.</li>
            <li> They arrived in the mail right on time and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received them quickly and they really hold your hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> These are strong, professional quality clips</li>
            <li> I only had to place the clip once, and it kept all of my hair perfectly out of the way, and stayed in place while I dried and styled section by section of my hair.</li>
            <li> These Black Croc Styling clips work perfectly whether it was a large volume of hair or down to a fine strand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one problem with them once they got stuck in my hair while I tried pulling them out, but it was fine in the end they ended up coming out!</li>
            <li> Even right after hair is washed and clean and nothing seems to stay put in hair when it&#x27;s this soft!</li>
            <li> I use them on my hair and was very pleased because with other clips i have to use a couple of clips but these hold my hair only with one clip because you are able to move the sizing of the clips .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic and I would highly recommend these Croc Clips to absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li> I could easily place my focus on holding the dryer and brush and working on the other section of my hair, while these amazing clips kept the rest of my hair completely out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They provide a great hold on long and short hair with out snagging your hair.</li>
            <li> These are great for styling thick hair.</li>
            <li> With more use, I can see them getting &#x27;worn in&#x27; and getting easier to open.</li>
            <li> (at home, these aren&#x27;t exactly the type of hair clips you&#x27;d wear out and about.)</li>
            <li> I need to figure out exactly what the clasp is for.</li>
            <li> The double hinge, the teeth and the texture combine to work their magic no matter what amount of hair they are asked to corral.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much better than tying it back in a ponytail..</li>
            <li> I also love that they do not snag the hair when I go to open the release and take them out.</li>
            <li> These will hold SO much hair!</li>
            <li> Two of my clips broke within the first week of receiving the package.</li>
            <li> I have used many a different clip and almost ALL of them sliip out or my hair doesn&#x27;t stay in.  </li>
            <li> A couple reviews say that they have had them break on the first use.</li>
            <li> My kid sister got married and came to me to do her hair before her reception.</li>
            <li> She wanted to dye her hair for the first time, and she wanted to try an ombre style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Creating an ombre style requires a lot of sectioning and clipping to keep the dye consistent.</li>
            <li> These clips are exactly what you want to have for holding up the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling!</li>
            <li> Pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> I wanted hair clips like the ones my hit dresser uses on my hair and these hit the mark exactly.</li>
            <li> but, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is hot from blow drying as I will leave creases.</li>
            <li> Other than that- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with them at all :) I would definitely re-order!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with them overall.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that these clips have an extra hinge on the top that essentially forms a triangle around your hair to keep it from spilling out.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and they work great.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for, and as described.</li>
            <li> These make styling your hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so I was able to use one to clip back all of my hair while applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and wanted to order something cost effective, functional, and different than the clips most of our other stylists use so</li>
            <li> They make the hair styling process (flat ironing or curling) so much more effortless.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate a product that gets the job done and a company that takes care of business and delivers the product in the next 7 business day.now, I can consider myself a better stylist and not a baby stylist.</li>
            <li> When drying, styling, or coloring and I need to secure my baby fine, silky, soft, slippery, poker-straight hair, the last thing I need is a wrestling match with a clip.</li>
            <li> I will honestly never use another hair clip again after using these they are amazing!</li>
            <li> May be a bit rough for fragile hair but great for think hair as really holds during styling.</li>
            <li> I first tested these clips on my daughter and it didn&#x27;t matter how much she moved, the clips did not budge or slide off.</li>
            <li> It held very good in small and larger bunches of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got them and am now wondering how I&#x27;ve gone so long without them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got them and am now wondering how I&#x27;ve gone so long without them!</li>
            <li> Easy to open and handle when handling the hair.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t last as long as the ceramics, however they are a good deal.</li>
            <li> They work great in long hair as they hold a large portion of hair at one time without hair slipping.  </li>
            <li> They are surprisingly large, sturdy, and easily hold big bites of hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin curly hair that most clips fall out.  </li>
            <li> Great clips, holds thick hair!</li>
            <li> These clips have a great locking system for thick hair!</li>
            <li> Also are great for wet or dry use.  </li>
            <li> I always look for nice clips which can hold my hair tightly.</li>
            <li> At first I thought with the way they expand that theyd only be good for someone with thick hair or trying to secure a roller.  </li>
            <li> I have them 4 stars because they wont work as well on thinner hair... and a regular clip would work fine.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and these clips are great for holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought they looked a little clunky for their purpose, however; after the first use I was able to get the hang of them.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9fced77284c81ee361ffcadc70b53694]]I just recently figured out that it makes a HUGE difference when you are blow drying and straightening your hair to do it in sections.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I was weary spending this much on hair clips since I could have gotten a 12 pack of metal clips from Target.</li>
            <li> Because I have so much hair, I&#x27;ve found it easier to section my hair off with clips to ensure that I&#x27;ve conditioned every strand.</li>
            <li> These work really well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> purchased a set a year ago, now I received a set free from the same seller (Salon Guys) for unbiased review.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like I had to use a million clips just to keep my hair up, because the clips I had didn&#x27;t stay very well.  </li>
            <li> The clips are equally fabulous at holding sections of various sizes while drying, straightening or curling.</li>
            <li> I used to use much thinner ones and compared to them</li>
            <li> I find them to work really well when you are foiling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome.best clips ever it doesn&#x27;t brake you hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like the jagged teeth on these clips which will insure that these clips stay in place.</li>
            <li> found that anything that comes close to working well on my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my youngest whose hair is shorter and much finer.  </li>
            <li> and I assume very curly hair (of which I have neither).</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for 10 years and these croc clips are the best for sectioning hair, holding hair in place while foiling or cutting, or styling.</li>
            <li> These work very well</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t pull the hair and they stayed in really well.  </li>
            <li> I also used them on someone with much thicker hair</li>
            <li> but I also use them just to keep my hair out of my face when I am doing my makeup and getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair in place really well.</li>
            <li> Styling is finally so much easier.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let go until you&#x27;re ready</li>
            <li> The clips are available in various colors and patterns.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really like croc clips.</li>
            <li> These clips are really durable.</li>
            <li> No complaints here and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> They hold very well.</li>
            <li> Durable, grips very well and doesn&#x27;t damage hair when removed.  </li>
            <li> They really are a ilfe saver when it comes to styling or drying hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really are a ilfe saver when it comes to styling or drying hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and well built.  </li>
            <li> really likes the hinge effect on the clips.  </li>
            <li> In her opinion, they worked really well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use hair clips to section out hair while styling as well as anyone who just wants to put hair up.  </li>
            <li> it really helps me divide my hair</li>
            <li> if its from having too much hair in it at once.</li>
            <li> The configuration of these clips really hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
            <li> They work really well in all hair types</li>
            <li> These work really well to clip up hair out of the way for curling or trimming.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> and they hold very well.</li>
            <li> The clips hold really well all day.</li>
            <li> Another good thing was how wide the clip actually opens.</li>
            <li> These are the same type of clips my hair dresser uses - they work so much better than the old silver ones.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, being sturdy is most important &amp; they definitely past that test!</li>
            <li> Some days I love them, other days not so much.</li>
            <li> They are also really good for bleaching/dying hair, since they aren&#x27;t metal like other similar clips.</li>
            <li> I used these on myself and several other people while styling to give them a good trial run.</li>
            <li> top of it all they are extremely sturdily made.  </li>
            <li> top of it all they are extremely sturdily made.  </li>
            <li> The grip has a bit of texture that helps open up the clip which is unique.</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding my very long and heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li> They are specially designed to open fuller but still hold the hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and you can bet I&#x27;ll be keeping mine where I can easily get to them every single time i need to style my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and you can bet I&#x27;ll be keeping mine where I can easily get to them every single time i need to style my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many uses, when I get out of the shower I dry my hair first, then I use these to hold back my front and side bangs in order to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I rely on clips like this when styling my hair and good ones like this a hard to come by!</li>
            <li> They are easy to grab and manipulate while hands are wet.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t slip and that was my main concern.</li>
            <li> These tamer hair styling clips are high on my list for sectioned wet hair, and holding the hair to allow for an easy blowout.</li>
            <li> Amazing clips that hold both soft and fine hair, and a big thick mop.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair that I blow out every day because I think it looks more professional.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has long thick hair &amp; these clips are perfect for her to section her hair when she is curling or straightening it.</li>
            <li> The clip looks normal but the top half is sort of hinged and bends in a triangular fashion, so as to move and expand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the clips.</li>
            <li> It has little teeth on top and bottom to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> The claw is covers the whole top section of the clip and is wide and big allowing for hold of even super big chunks of</li>
            <li> They have a nice big, tight spring, that really keeps a hold on the hair when placed in hair.</li>
            <li> They are too loose, don&#x27;t have good grip, and fall out easily, which can be incredibly frustrating when you&#x27;re already trying to hold a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other, to straighten out and smooth a separate section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These croc clips are about 5&amp;#34; long and made of a very heavy duty plastic with a unique double hinged design and two springs that allow them to adjust automatically to keep a good grip on any amount or thickness of hair.</li>
            <li> These clips work great with long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more in the near future!</li>
            <li> Maybe everyone doesn’t like to pay a few bucks more for the patterns.  </li>
            <li> Well made and sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice clips that hold my thick hair when blow dring without falling out.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and a package of six is definitely enough for most styles and a few extra.</li>
            <li> They were not hard.</li>
            <li> Very different in the right way.</li>
            <li> The cool way you can prop them open wider seems to indication you could put them around large bunches of hair or smaller rollers.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these large styling clips for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> how did I live without them?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is reasonable, however next time I&#x27;ll just stick with a more well known brand, and purchase the type of flat metal hair clips used at actual salons.</li>
            <li> The only downside: because the gripper clamp begins immediately at the free end of the clip I’ve had to abandon my habit of using the tip to part out the next section.</li>
            <li> These are definitely a high quality, professional hair clip.</li>
            <li> One of the parts I like best, is that the part where you hold on to the clip in order to press it open has these little grips so that you have control (and are less likely to drop the clip.)</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and these clips do a great job sectioning my hair when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> They stay in and help me style my hair like II&#x27;ve not been able to in the past.</li>
            <li> These are much better quality than similar and more expensive clips I had been purchasing at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> While they are by no means something you would wear out into public, since they are simple and not particularly attractive, they are incredibly functional.  </li>
            <li> The most I have had to use out of a packet was 3, I usually just use 1 or 2 to give me a hand while curling my hair.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and hold as much or as little hair as needed.  </li>
            <li> I love them because they don&#x27;t pull at my hair yet have a very firm grip.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and were exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> They hold better than the other flat clips I have.  </li>
            <li> I thought these would be a good alternative to the metal ones and that they might be a little less damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li> But what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re trying to hold back a small amount of hair or a lot because it adjusts and clips snuggly no matter how much hair you clip in.</li>
            <li> Second hinge in these makes for a style that doesn&#x27;t fall loose as easily as others I&#x27;ve tried and still are gentle enough not to break the hair.</li>
            <li> The old model had a slightly thicker bottom part that sometimes didn&#x27;t slide smoothly into my hair.</li>
            <li> Hurrah, no need to have different size clips for different jobs and no more frustration at never being able to put my hands on the right size clip when I need it -</li>
            <li> These are also great for curling and straightening hair they have a really tight hold, so if you need clips for thick hair</li>
            <li> The extra piece on the top is a little funky.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe, just as a regular joe schmoe, that I haven&#x27;t used these clips earlier to better dry and style my hair!  </li>
            <li> My daughter who has very thick wavy hair tried the croc clip while she straightened her hair and is very impressed with the hold it has for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> Will probably purchase another pack in the near future use to have a little more on hand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for sectioning off hair for cutting, coloring, or styling and they won&#x27;t slip when working with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I think these clips would work very well on straight hair, but not on Coily African American hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used them while getting ready to style my hair in different sections, around the house, and even out a couple times.</li>
            <li> I have always used the old school clips that don&#x27;t have teeth because I was under the impression that alligator style clips would leave kinks in my hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very versatile since I use them for holding different sections up while using a straightener or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received these clips directly from the Salon Guys for the purpose of trying them out &amp; reviewing.</li>
            <li> The construction seems durable enough to last through lots of usage, and they would be as useful to a professional hair salon as they are in my home.</li>
            <li> They are of a professional salon quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clips are made of plastic and therefore are not heavy.</li>
            <li> These clips are so useful for holding up my hair when cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> They would likely be equally useful for the same purpose when applying make-up.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more if they are ever misplaced.</li>
            <li> these would be useful for anyone who is cutting or coloring their own hair.</li>
            <li> I see most reviews are from people with thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and hair clips usually slip out several times before I finish curling my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> A quick twist and one clip is all it takes to hold back my entire long, straight mane.</li>
            <li> my hair slides right out of the straight clips and I can use a few of these and clip my hair up completely</li>
            <li> Have to free my other hand to open the clip.</li>
            <li> but not extremely tight.</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away that they were indeed strong enough to do this all on their own, as my hair is really thick and makes quite a thick pony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away that they were indeed strong enough to do this all on their own, as my hair is really thick and makes quite a thick pony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality for such an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for such a high quality, durable item.</li>
            <li> I have super long, super thick hair</li>
            <li> They hold like no other!</li>
            <li> The black doesn&#x27;t look as cheaply made as the white.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to hold my hair but it too heavy...</li>
            <li> so I normally have to use multiple clips to hold up my hair, but not with these.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a little effort to get used to the strength required to open, but once you get that, you will enjoy these too.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and these hold up very well without creasing.</li>
            <li> ; clips have two hinges to help them easily grab onto thick sections of hair.</li>
            <li> use these ALL THE TIME, I have never broken a single one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tight but it&#x27;s also not loose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tight but it&#x27;s also not loose.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> They do not come loose and the hold the hair very well.  </li>
            <li> The small teeth kept these clips from sliding while I was working and the spring hinge was easy to open</li>
            <li> No matter how much hair I throw into a bunch, it works on any amount, small and large.  </li>
            <li> I can use them for large or small hair sections while sectioning my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has very kinky/curly texture).  </li>
            <li> No slipping or budging when you use the croc hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have three girls with long thick hair in our household, so when I was invited to participate in a consumer research project to evaluate, test, and review these Hair Tamer Croc Hair Styling Clips I gladly accepted.  </li>
            <li> They are sturdy, which is extremely important for my thick course hair, when sectioning.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair/medium length (past my shoulders), and one of these does a really good job of holding up half of my hair while I am</li>
            <li> These hair clips, on the other hand, hold a large amount of hair and do not slide off.</li>
            <li> These clamps are just plain  fun.</li>
            <li> When I first gave them to her, she didnt expect them to be any different than other clips.  </li>
            <li> The seller was fast and they were shipped very carefully to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as well as far more expensive brand name.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, hard to open, hurts fingers when trying to open the clip.  </li>
            <li> They work great with wet or dry hair, really thin to super thick hair and everything in between, short hair or long hair, hair that has dye in it or does not.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t barely pinch them open because the clamp is so wobbly.</li>
            <li> I have long thick fine hair.  </li>
            <li> so I need something tough and strong to keep my hair UP.</li>
            <li> These things are made right, very durable for my thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t slip out of your fingers when wet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because my hair is also very fine, they would slide out while I was trying to use them.</li>
            <li> I also can appreciate how easily I can grip the clips while opening them up since the finger tip ends are ridged after dealing with the previous brands slipping out of my wet finger tips.</li>
            <li> The Black Croc clips are very versatile...</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> Other clips don&#x27;t have the extra clip on top and allows for thick hair  to slip through having to use several clips just to keep the hair up!</li>
            <li> not only do they work well with thick full hair but also on fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have issues finding something that can hold it up, especially when blow drying,  These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These clips are fantastic for both fine/thin hair and thick hair as well!  </li>
            <li> These hair clips hold everything very well from towels around the neck to dry or wet hair to capes etc.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and coarse hair</li>
            <li> I used to have to keep a couple different clips handy at work, small ones for fine hair and giant claw clips for thick long hair, these clips seriously work for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it hard to find the right hair clip to do what I want and hold it all together.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Black Croc Hair Styling Clips!  </li>
            <li> The tension on the clips work well on my fine slick hair as well as heavy, long client hair.</li>
            <li> I have very think, silky straight hair and have a difficult time finding clips that not only hold my hair, but also don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to last a long time, these hair styling clips will do the job.</li>
            <li> I like to hold sections of my hair in place while I use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> They seem as though they will last long</li>
            <li> Another Christmas present idea for some long hair members in my family......</li>
            <li> Dependable and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> flat ironing it or curling.</li>
            <li> Normal clips always fall out after a few minutes, even at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, but these clips work like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of croc clips; more expensive, cheaper, shorter, longer.</li>
            <li> These hair clips will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> They definitely get a good grip on my hair without damaging it or leaving annoying creases.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is extremely thick, so thick that many stylists comment that it&#x27;s the longest thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever worked</li>
            <li> The only thing that held me back from a five star rating was that since they are made of plastic, I question their durability and am not sure how long they will last will regular daily usage.  </li>
            <li> I think that the hinged clip also helps to hold a large amount of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional hairstylist</li>
            <li> She has a lot of long thick hair and they worked VERY well in her opinion.  </li>
            <li> I have monstrously thick hair which can rarely be contained by your average scissor-style clip.</li>
            <li> In other words, the individual strands are pretty thin, but I have a lot of hair overall.</li>
            <li> I am African American with VERY THICK natural hair that I co-wash regularly in the shower.</li>
            <li> Also, because there is more room, it does not leave an indent in my hair, as other clips I have used in the past have done, due to the tightness of my thick hair in the clip.</li>
            <li> I have 4C medium hair and these actually clamp onto my hair wet or dry!</li>
            <li> If you have extremely fine, thin hair, I&#x27;d look elsewhere because I think these would be too heavy.</li>
            <li> They are exactly like other croc clips I have ordered in the past from other sites.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that problem, but then again I&#x27;ve only used two and put the other four in storage as backup.</li>
            <li> so I could dry and style the underside of my hair.  </li>
            <li> And then I also used these on dry hair to section off while straightening</li>
            <li> Only when you use these with wet hands and wet hair</li>
            <li> The pivoting at the center really holds onto thick hair well...</li>
            <li> I found them very helpful to hold hair back for when I want to make small braids in my hair (bobby pins just pull and make a mess!).  </li>
            <li> No more strands of hair are ripped out of my head with the old metal clips I was using.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and grab the hair and hold it in place, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this type of croc hair clip as I have usually stuck with the duck bill clips in the past.  </li>
            <li> My hair diameter is bigger than a half dollar when straightened and thinned</li>
            <li> The black clips are functional and work well to hold the clients hair back during treatments.</li>
            <li> This actually makes it pretty difficult to clip my hair up for blowdrying.</li>
            <li> I use these constantly to keep my long hair up w/o getting a crease in my hair from harsh rubber bands.</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of clips in the past to try to manage my hair while styling and curling my hair and nothing compares to these.</li>
            <li> They probably work for all kinds of hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> And the part where you pinch to open the clip has little bumps so my fingers are less likely to slide off with hair products on my hands.</li>
            <li> I tried them with various thickness of hair and they held tight each time without pulling or snagging.  </li>
            <li> The Clips hold the hair tightly because they have double hinged design.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick, heavy, straight, slippery hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use clips similar to these that are flat metal.</li>
            <li> They have little grips where you open the clips so that your fingers does not slip off of them.</li>
            <li> they frustrated me more than anything.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly difficult to open, but I think that is because I haven&#x27;t used them too much.  </li>
            <li> They are sturdy and stay in place without slipping.</li>
            <li> I also use these clips to put my hair up when I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet and the product still held my hair up without me having to adjust the clips on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the durability of the product because I have only been using it for a few days, but so far the clips have not loosened yet, despite me using it to clip chunks my thick hair.</li>
            <li> These held up while my hair was wet</li>
            <li> Her hair, even wet will almost always slip out.  </li>
            <li> They hold  your hair in place without slipping.  </li>
            <li> I was sent these hair clips as part of SalonGuys Market Research program, but as my hair isn&#x27;t even remotely &amp;#34;clippable,&amp;#34; I asked my wife to try them out and give me her take on them instead.</li>
            <li> The product came just as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> I’m not ready for</li>
            <li> They keep the hair in place without slipping.</li>
            <li> Saw these in hair videos &amp; was curious.</li>
            <li> They were shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the adjustable swiveling tip with its spring would catch and pull my client&#x27;s hair, but I&#x27;ve just been careful not to get them tangled in the hair</li>
            <li> They hold the hair perfectly as expected and don&#x27;t rip hair out.</li>
            <li> Very useful when styling (or cutting) hair.</li>
            <li> No other clips would hold up my thick, heavy especially when wet, hair except these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how hard the croc clips are to open they need to be a little easier to open so that your not struggling to clip the hair up.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would snag my hair as i read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> but I have a tendency to misplace them since I&#x27;ll put them in at random times to keep my hair back and take them out in a more random place</li>
            <li> They hold my hair in place while I style the other pieces.</li>
            <li> I found other sites that had croc clips, but you don&#x27;t get 6 for this price.  </li>
            <li> The plastic they are constructed of is nice and thick, definitely not cheaply made so you aren&#x27;t afraid the thing is going to shatter in your hands.  </li>
            <li> The plastic they are constructed of is nice and thick, definitely not cheaply made so you aren&#x27;t afraid the thing is going to shatter in your hands.  </li>
            <li> They also worked well as fasteners to hold your styling cape closed!</li>
            <li> and id recommend it to other hairstylists.</li>
            <li> I also like that they don&#x27;t pull or break my hair like other clips do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend, even for those who may have difficulty with their hands (ie arthritis, or other disability), like me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often tried dozens of other clips that just don&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my clips from a local beauty shop</li>
            <li> However, due to their design and size, they might not work so well for thinner shorter hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I also like to pretend these clips are little alligators by making a little growling noise when I open them up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve similar products in the past and they would slip off or would not stay in.  </li>
            <li> Even when wet!</li>
            <li> As someone with very long, thick hair, I often have to section if off in order to flat iron it or to work on styling it just one section at a time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I need them in pink and other colors.</li>
            <li> Usually as I&#x27;m coloring my hair and working through, my old clips would slowly slide, hair would get loose</li>
            <li> Another disappointment was that they did not slide very well through my hair for me to actually use the clip.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dry or straighten my hair I need to use few clips to separate and hold them  while I work on one section of the hair.</li>
            <li> And I also found them a little difficult to open by pinching but perhaps this is just due to the fact that they are new.  </li>
            <li> However, due to the small “teeth” on the bottom half of the clip, it moves and tugs on my hair when I am initially clipping it in</li>
            <li> and I usually use hair crunches or other regular everyday use hair accessories to clip a section of hair.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the pegs at the bottom make it hard to get into the hair</li>
            <li> They are also bit hard to open.</li>
            <li> The clips were hard to open with slippery hands.  </li>
            <li> Similar plastic clips have become hard to find in store.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already in the ring, round 3 or 4, no holds barred, bare knuckled, fight to the death with my baby-fine, thin, flat hair (GRRRRR!!</li>
            <li> only downside is that they are pretty darn ugly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they eventually brake over time.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of this product alone sais a lot considering how thick and heavy my hair is, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> It even works on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Even with my hair as thick as it is I can section it off into two groups and using two of the clips it will hold it in place securely enough to keep it up and out of the way.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (long and thick), and if I&#x27;m careful I can get it all up with one clip.  </li>
            <li> They not only held my thick hair in place, but they didn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> So I have a wispy fringe I can pull down onto my forehead, or on the days I&#x27;m not feeling it, push the bangs into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> the grip makes its a lot easier for the hair not to fall out or the clips to slip down.</li>
            <li> They slide down my head and don’t stay</li>
            <li> They hurt my fingers a little if I hold them open for very long since there is a texture on the grip part, but that is a small complaint and because of the textured part they do not slide out of my grip like some others, even when my hands are damp.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so firm that it&#x27;s hard to pinch the ends together to get it to open.  </li>

            <li> (I reviewed these previously and mentioned it</li>
            <li> I use these black plastic clips to hold sections of my hair while blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I like that they come in a set of six hair clips as I typically use about 4 at a time, so</li>
            <li> I would  recommend these Black Croc Hair Styling Clips for all your clipping needs.  </li>
            <li> They have teeth all along the length of the clip grips along the inside of the bottom half of the clip.</li>
            <li> They are black.</li>
            <li> Even when pulled on slightly, they didn&#x27;t move.</li>

            <li> My eldest has long hair that is fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend these to anyone with thick long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and often need clips to hold my hair up and away when I am drying my hair or coloring it.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays tight all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hold the hair tight and don&#x27;t hurt my head when I am using them.  </li>
            <li> But I would prefer them to be a little longer for people who have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> These work for my thick long hair!  </li>
            <li> This clip holds those little bangs out of my face while I wash up or apply make up and it doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> however I will say my hair did get caught in one which hurt a little.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t figure out what the little piece that moved was for.  </li>
            <li> There are little bumps inside to help grip the hair and keep it in place.</li>
            <li> The spring is firm so as to keep a tight grip on the hair</li>

            <li> I have very VERY thick hair and these are the only clips I&#x27;ve found that work.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is when my clips just don&#x27;t hold up the hair or worse yet they slip out entirely.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick, so usually when I part it or try to section it off, I have trouble keeping it separated ...</li>
            <li> They hold my short, thin hair where I want it held while I style it.  </li>
            <li> Heavy Duty for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty.</li>
            <li> but that option is not available.</li>
            <li> I have used other clips that were hard and would not move.</li>
            <li> The ends where you put your fingers to pinch are textured with rows of small raised bumps so even if you hands are wet or a little slick from using a product in the hair these clips won&#x27;t go flying out of your fingers and shoot across the room!  </li>

            <li> I have extremely thick hair and every other clip I have used</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to adjust them several times or they get uncomfortable after half an hour</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, the clips hold my hair up but the teeth snag my hair not sure</li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;m not home, my hair is at least half up, and I always use a type of clip to hold up my hair- never a pony tail.</li>
            <li> No matter how thick or thin your hair these hold without any marks left in the hair.</li>
            <li> They hold tight and I have never heard a complaint about pulling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve bought plastic clips with small jaws before that</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s never any problem with getting my youngest&#x27;s hair up for styling, on occasions my eldest&#x27;s hair can be a small challenge in getting it up for styling but to keep mine in place for styling if it&#x27;s a stylist doing it</li>
            <li> My hands were slick with conditioner and I tried to use the clips to hold the sections of my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick and heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these clips because my hair stylist uses them when she does my hair and it works for her not sure why it does not snag with her.</li>
            <li> so I haave to section it off when styling, but it usually just slips out of the clip.</li>
            <li> With the previous Conair brand clips that I purchased, although they did hold lot of my hair in place as promised, the clamps began to snap off after a few uses which was quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair and all other brands I&#x27;ve tried snapped to pieces on me.</li>
            <li> They hold your wet hair - no matter how thin or thick - in place until you unclip them.</li>
            <li> and it’s hard to find clips that would hold her hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to manipulate with one hand.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and hard to pin up, my hairdresser recommended these</li>
            <li> They work well for keeping your hair back, sectioning, styling, cutting, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone that&#x27;s starting to cut hair or has been in the hair cutting business for a while.</li>
            <li> I hate having to constantly adjust my clips while styling to keep them from slipping out, and these I could just stick in place and not worry about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
            <li> I work a lot with thick, curly hair and these clips</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it holds every piece in place on my 10 hour job.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and these clips are a dream.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, though I have particularly thick hair and six clips won&#x27;t do D:</li>
            <li> I have extemely thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no hair slippage at all which is why I gave it 4 stars but to use the backside of the spring shaft takes two hands which is inconvenient however, I would recommend these clips to stylists working in the industry and women who just want to hoist their hair up</li>
            <li> Get at least 2 packs though!</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to find clips that will hold my small sections and</li>

            <li> I have very thick course hair</li>

            <li> I have thick curly hair that is difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> and I would end up being frustrated half way through.</li>
            <li> Hard to get thru my curly hair and a bit awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I feel for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these clips after reading about them on a blog.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy that they haven&#x27;t broken!</li>
            <li> They grasp and stay in place while cutting or styling hair.  </li>
            <li> Again, I was shocked at how this wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> If these clips can handle my crazy hair they can handle anyone&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair, and i used to hate curling it because it took forever trying to get my hair up in clips and get them secured, but with these, i can just stuff the hair in, clip it on, and it doesn&#x27;t slip or get tangled when I try to remove it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about the quality of these clips</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great clips, hold your hair really well and after I got them I noticed my stylist uses them too.</li>
            <li> Great clips. LOVE THEM&amp;#62;had many brands before but none as secure as these.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair but I have a lot of hair. I know this will hold back even the thickest of hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair clips I own! Amazingly secure grip. The pivoting at the center really holds onto thick hair well... Only thing is the pegs at the bottom make it hard to get into the hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> They work great, but melt easily in barbicide if left in too long.</li>
            <li> Great hold and lasting clip. May be a bit rough for fragile hair but great for think hair as really holds during styling.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great clips and arrived very quickly! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Luis</li>
            <li> I have long thick fine hair.  To my surprise, these worked so well in clipping my hair.  It can clip a good amount of hair at once. I was worried it would snag my hair as i read in other reviews. However, it didn&#x27;t snag my hair compared to the Vidal Sassoon type clips I had.  Great buy for me.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these! I have very fine hair and these clips work perfect!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! They grip like there is no tomorrow and do not damage hair!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what they&#x27;re made to do!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses these and thought I&#x27;d try them.  Love them.  They hold up sections of hair well during styling.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely great. They provide a great hold on long and short hair with out snagging your hair.</li>
            <li> These are great for styling thick hair. I bought a set from Dry Bar for $30 and these are just as good.</li>
            <li> Holds hair well. Definitely worth  the price. I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> These are amazing! My hair is very fine but I have tons of it. They stay in and help me style my hair like II&#x27;ve not been able to in the past. Love them.</li>
            <li> two of these will hold my hair up all day!&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that they are pretty darn ugly.</li>
            <li> Great styling clips to use when separating hair during styling. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I am a hairstylist and wanted to order something cost effective, functional, and different than the clips most of our other stylists use so I would know where mine were. These are much better quality than similar and more expensive clips I had been purchasing at the beauty supply store. They hold the hair effectively and don&#x27;t slip. Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick, heavy, straight, slippery hair. Clips like this never held my hair, but these do, without tangling or leaving creases or dents in my hair. It makes sectioning for styling and coloring so easy.</li>
            <li> High quality for such an affordable price! I&#x27;d purchase again later!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These are pretty great. So far they do everything that I expected them to do. However, I do happen to get my hair caught in the top since they are two pieces. Great product nonetheless. I was weary spending this much on hair clips since I could have gotten a 12 pack of metal clips from Target. These don&#x27;t slip and that was my main concern. What good is a clip if they don&#x27;t stay in place? These DO!</li>
            <li> These clips work great with long, thick hair. I would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Best hair clips I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I am African American with VERY THICK natural hair that I co-wash regularly in the shower. Because I have so much hair, I&#x27;ve found it easier to section my hair off with clips to ensure that I&#x27;ve conditioned every strand. With the previous Conair brand clips that I purchased, although they did hold lot of my hair in place as promised, the clamps began to snap off after a few uses which was quite frustrating. I&#x27;ve only used this brand a couple of times but already can feel the difference in the strength and quality of the product when opening and closing the clips. I also can appreciate how easily I can grip the clips while opening them up since the finger tip ends are ridged after dealing with the previous brands slipping out of my wet finger tips. Great buy. Will probably purchase another pack in the near future use to have a little more on hand.</li>
            <li> These work really well for my hair.  They have great grip and are sturdy and well-made.  I have pretty thick hair/medium length (past my shoulders), and one of these does a really good job of holding up half of my hair while I am blow drying it. They are slightly difficult to open, but I think that is because I haven&#x27;t used them too much.  With more use, I can see them getting &#x27;worn in&#x27; and getting easier to open. Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> To whoever called these &amp;#34;imitation clips,&amp;#34; I have the ones from the product photo and the so-called &amp;#34;imitation&amp;#34; clips and I prefer the latter. They are both great hair clips, extremely strong with alligator jaws that rotate to hold your hair. The old model had a slightly thicker bottom part that sometimes didn&#x27;t slide smoothly into my hair. (I reviewed these previously and mentioned it and perhaps they took my review into consideration?) the new ones have a slightly more tapered bottom to slide easier into hair. They still have the same strength and basic design but now improved!&lt;br /&gt;I use these ALL THE TIME, I have never broken a single one but I have a tendency to misplace them since I&#x27;ll put them in at random times to keep my hair back and take them out in a more random place (at home, these aren&#x27;t exactly the type of hair clips you&#x27;d wear out and about.) They work well for keeping your hair back, sectioning, styling, cutting, etc. my hair slides right out of the straight clips and I can use a few of these and clip my hair up completely and it won&#x27;t slide out because of the &amp;#34;croc&amp;#34; jaw hinged design. If I section parts off it stays. I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a set a year ago, now I received a set free from the same seller (Salon Guys) for unbiased review. My rating has gone from 4 stars to 5 based on the improved design with the thinner bottom edge. I would purchase these again in a minute.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9fced77284c81ee361ffcadc70b53694]]I just recently figured out that it makes a HUGE difference when you are blow drying and straightening your hair to do it in sections.  I had bought just whatever clips from the salon store when I started using clips but to be totally honest they frustrated me more than anything.  I have super thick hair and it seemed like I had to use a million clips just to keep my hair up, because the clips I had didn&#x27;t stay very well.  Then I got these crock clips and it made a world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can put up literally almost ALL of my hair with one clip and it stays put.  These are some amazingly great clips.  They&#x27;re very comparable in price to similar clips and they come in an awesome array of colors!  While I use these for at home use, these would also be great for any professional stylist.  I showed them to my sister in law, who is a stylist, and even she was so impressed with the quality she tried to talk me into giving them to her!  No way, she can go buy her own! These clips are definitely a must have for anyone who styles their hair on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these clips for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great clips for keeping your hair out of your face while you put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Hair clips aren&#x27;t among my favorite things to buy. They&#x27;re a necessity, kinda like bras and underwear. When drying, styling, or coloring and I need to secure my baby fine, silky, soft, slippery, poker-straight hair, the last thing I need is a wrestling match with a clip. I&#x27;m already in the ring, round 3 or 4, no holds barred, bare knuckled, fight to the death with my baby-fine, thin, flat hair (GRRRRR!! Comments/recommendations on products for fine, flat hair welcome). I came to take these croc clips for granted because they&#x27;re the perfect clip. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of croc clips; more expensive, cheaper, shorter, longer. Problem was they couldn&#x27;t hold my hair or they broke. I won&#x27;t run out of these again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works as well as far more expensive brand name. Holds hair in place without snagging. Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> these are by far my favorite clips ever! They stay put so well and adjust to varying thicknesses of hair.  I have a LOT of hair, and i used to hate curling it because it took forever trying to get my hair up in clips and get them secured, but with these, i can just stuff the hair in, clip it on, and it doesn&#x27;t slip or get tangled when I try to remove it.</li>
            <li> They work well. I need to figure out exactly what the clasp is for. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a use for it, but I didn&#x27;t see anything on the package regarding it. Work well for me!</li>
            <li> I received them quickly and they really hold your hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> I have long hair. The strands are pretty fine, but I have a lot of hair. And can&#x27;t make up my mind about bangs. Some days I love them, other days not so much. So I have a wispy fringe I can pull down onto my forehead, or on the days I&#x27;m not feeling it, push the bangs into the rest of my hair. This clip holds those little bangs out of my face while I wash up or apply make up and it doesn&#x27;t budge. What makes that so amazing is that this very same clip will hold a twist containing ALL the rest of my hair, without sliding or budging either. The clips are equally fabulous at holding sections of various sizes while drying, straightening or curling. Hurrah, no need to have different size clips for different jobs and no more frustration at never being able to put my hands on the right size clip when I need it - These babies do it all. The double hinge, the teeth and the texture combine to work their magic no matter what amount of hair they are asked to corral. I received this product free of charge from Salon Guys in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m providing this review of the Croc Hair Styling Clips from Salon Guys as part of their Market Research program. I received the shipment on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips are fantastic for both fine/thin hair and thick hair as well!  At first glance, I thought they looked a little clunky for their purpose, however; after the first use I was able to get the hang of them.  I appreciate the ability to adjust the tension/strength of the clip, especially on my daughters hair which is very fine.  I had been using the generic silver clips and they would just fall out of her hair. Now that I have these, that is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips stay in place to allow controlled sectioning of the hair while blow drying. I highly recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li> These tamer hair styling clips are high on my list for sectioned wet hair, and holding the hair to allow for an easy blowout. No matter how thick or thin your hair these hold without any marks left in the hair. They are easy to grab and manipulate while hands are wet. Traveling with these are great as they take little space.</li>
            <li> Hard to get thru my curly hair and a bit awkward to use. Pulls my hair when trying to place, and same when removing them from my hair. They are also bit hard to open. The extra piece on the top is a little funky. The black doesn&#x27;t look as cheaply made as the white. Instead of being a beauty aid they are a beauty hindrance and a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable, however next time I&#x27;ll just stick with a more well known brand, and purchase the type of flat metal hair clips used at actual salons.</li>
            <li> Great clips, holds thick hair!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair back in place without it sliding out. Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for styling my hair with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Only when you use these with wet hands and wet hair do you understand why they have so many positive reviews. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and hair clips usually slip out several times before I finish curling my hair in the morning.  I recently received and tried the croc clips. At first I thought that if the croc clip would hold my hair it would surely pull my fine hair out when I took it out.  But it didn’t!  It holds the hair in place and opens easily without pulling your hair out. Since they hold in place, I will definitely use them to separate my hair when I color it.  My daughter who has very thick wavy hair tried the croc clip while she straightened her hair and is very impressed with the hold it has for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> These black croc clips are great. I used to use much thinner ones and compared to them it&#x27;s a huge difference. They hold my hair in place while I style the other pieces. So many uses, when I get out of the shower I dry my hair first, then I use these to hold back my front and side bangs in order to put my makeup on. Also when I highlight hair, these are perfect for separating chunks and keeping them pinned away from the hair already colored. They are sturdy and stay in place without slipping. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have very think, silky straight hair and have a difficult time finding clips that not only hold my hair, but also don&#x27;t break.  This clip does both! My hair stayed in place each time I would resection it. The quality of the clip is great too, sturdy! I rely on clips like this when styling my hair and good ones like this a hard to come by!</li>
            <li> These clips are the greatest! They hold my hair up and never slip! I will always use these clips!</li>
            <li> I found other sites that had croc clips, but you don&#x27;t get 6 for this price.  They are exactly like other croc clips I have ordered in the past from other sites.  They hold great, while I blow out my hair or am applying hair coloring.  I feel for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are the best styling clips! I have very thick course hair and all other brands I&#x27;ve tried snapped to pieces on me. These are sturdy and grab the hair and hold it in place, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> One Word&#x3D;Flexibility. These hair clips are so flexible. I have used other clips that were hard and would not move. These clips were not like that. They were not hard. They did not make my head hurt. Another good thing was how wide the clip actually opens. It was easy to use them to separate my hair.</li>
            <li> High quality. Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Great Brand Newin Bag Clips, Great Quality, Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love the croc clips for all lengths of hair.  They work great in long hair as they hold a large portion of hair at one time without hair slipping.  The grip on them is great.  I have tons of these clips in both of my salons and will purchase many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula - Wisconsin</li>
            <li> I am not a professional hairstylist but I was looking for simple hair styling clips for personal use at home. I really liked how well these clips hold. I have pretty thick hair and I&#x27;ve bought plastic clips with small jaws before that just did not hold my hair up when I would part my hair for blow drying or curling. These clips are simple and also made of plastic, but I think the bigger jaws on the clips helped to hold my hair in place. I also use these clips to put my hair up when I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t want to get my hair wet and the product still held my hair up without me having to adjust the clips on my hair. I can&#x27;t comment on the durability of the product because I have only been using it for a few days, but so far the clips have not loosened yet, despite me using it to clip chunks my thick hair. I recommend this product for someone looking for standard, no-frills type hair clips for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The Croc Clips are Just AWESOME!!! I love how they are light weight. They have little grips where you open the clips so that your fingers does not slip off of them. They are great for holding fine hair as well as thick hair. It has little teeth on top and bottom to hold the hair in place. I find them to work really well when you are foiling. It holds several foils at a time. The clips does not pull the hair or tangle the hair in the teeth. I just love the Croc Clips and as a stylist they are my best friend!! :-)</li>
            <li> They give me the hold and grip that I was looking for. I really appreciate a product that gets the job done and a company that takes care of business and delivers the product in the next 7 business day.now, I can consider myself a better stylist and not a baby stylist. It&#x27;s really awesome.best clips ever it doesn&#x27;t brake you hair get it you will love it like I doo.thanks salon guys..</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this type of croc hair clip as I have usually stuck with the duck bill clips in the past.  I thought these clips did a great job at securing back any amount of hair.  I do have longer hair with a wavy texture so a lot of clips tend to just have my hair slip right through, but not these.  These held up while my hair was wet so I could dry and style the underside of my hair.  And then I also used these on dry hair to section off while straightening and there was no slippage.  The clips themselves are rather bulky so that is something to consider when storing.  And I also found them a little difficult to open by pinching but perhaps this is just due to the fact that they are new.  Either way I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair often and I used to use claw clips to put up my hair when straightening my it, but ever since I started using the croc clips I have not used anything else. The croc clips were very useful in keeping the sections of my hair separate. Compared to the claw clips I used to use, the croc clips are not bulky at all. The hinged clip in the croc clip really does keep the sections of my hair secure. I think that the hinged clip also helps to hold a large amount of my thick hair. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It even works on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I received these today and upon inspecting them, these seem to bee good clips. I really like the jagged teeth on these clips which will insure that these clips stay in place. The spring has a nice tension that seems like it will last forever. I&#x27;m excited have my good friend that cuts hair try them out too. If you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to last a long time, these hair styling clips will do the job. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone that&#x27;s starting to cut hair or has been in the hair cutting business for a while.</li>
            <li> SalonGuys sent me an assorted pack of sample items to review that included a pair of these clips. They are surprisingly large, sturdy, and easily hold big bites of hair. I clipped them onto my airbrush makeup setup to use in pulling hair back from the face while spraying makeup. They work just fine and leave no leftover creases in the hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried that hinged part on them, and am not even sure how it works; but for what I need, they do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> In our household there are three ladies; myself and my two daughters.  My youngest has short to medium length hair that&#x27;s fairly fine.  My eldest has long hair that is fairly thick.  I have very long hair that is extremely thick, so thick that many stylists comment that it&#x27;s the longest thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever worked with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s never any problem with getting my youngest&#x27;s hair up for styling, on occasions my eldest&#x27;s hair can be a small challenge in getting it up for styling but to keep mine in place for styling if it&#x27;s a stylist doing it I get the giant clips brought out and something that&#x27;s not even enough.  When I style it myself it&#x27;s always an act of creative genius to try to section my hair and secure it on top of my head and out of the way to style it.  So, in my house we have a couple different styles of clips; they&#x27;re things I&#x27;ve collected throughout the years in attempting to overcome the problem of keeping hair up and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that anything that comes close to working well on my hair doesn&#x27;t work for my youngest whose hair is shorter and much finer.  Her hair, even wet will almost always slip out.  Because of this I have to literally keep extra clips on hand so that our two very different hair types can be managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until I got sent two of these for the purpose of testing them for product review.  First off, let me say I that I will definitely be ordering a full pack of them soon as I am that impressed by them.  Not only do they manage my youngest&#x27;s hair shorter and finer hair with ease the way these clips have a hinged hook to manage groups of hair with more body/volume makes them amazing for my hair as well.  Even with my hair as thick as it is I can section it off into two groups and using two of the clips it will hold it in place securely enough to keep it up and out of the way.  With more I will be able to more effectively section my hair into groups for styling knowing that each section will stay securely on top of my head and out of the way.  These are most certainly well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of it all they are extremely sturdily made.  The plastic they are constructed of is nice and thick, definitely not cheaply made so you aren&#x27;t afraid the thing is going to shatter in your hands.  The spring is firm so as to keep a tight grip on the hair but it&#x27;s not so firm that it&#x27;s hard to pinch the ends together to get it to open.  The ends where you put your fingers to pinch are textured with rows of small raised bumps so even if you hands are wet or a little slick from using a product in the hair these clips won&#x27;t go flying out of your fingers and shoot across the room!  The spring on the product where the clip hooks to accommodate thicker and fuller is easily manipulated.  It&#x27;s not tight but it&#x27;s also not loose.  I would say it is practically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find nothing lacking with these clips.  The are simply to my mind amazing and the best clips I have ever come across for dealing with any type of hair!ll stay securely on top of my head and out of the way.

The are simply to my mind amazing and the best clips I have ever come across for dealing with any type of hair!</li>
            <li> The croc clips are good. But I would prefer them to be a little longer for people who have long thick hair. I don&#x27;t like how hard the croc clips are to open they need to be a little easier to open so that your not struggling to clip the hair up. Yet I do like the grip makes its a lot easier for the hair not to fall out or the clips to slip down.</li>
            <li> I love these clips!  At first I thought with the way they expand that theyd only be good for someone with thick hair or trying to secure a roller.  The clip looks normal but the top half is sort of hinged and bends in a triangular fashion, so as to move and expand.  It has grooves, teeth- like that hold and secure the hair with in it.  I have very thin hair and not a lot of it.  I love after coming home and ready to work in the kitchen, I can just grab one of these clips, and secure my hair in it.  The best part is that it leaves NO DENTS! I can take it out and be out the door without dented hair!  It also doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.</li>
            <li> I use these black plastic clips to hold sections of my hair while blow drying.  They have good teeth to hold hair in place and keep it where it needs to be held.  I like that they come in a set of six hair clips as I typically use about 4 at a time, so I have a couple of spare clips.  The only thing that held me back from a five star rating was that since they are made of plastic, I question their durability and am not sure how long they will last will regular daily usage.  However at this price, that&#x27;s OK.  Overall, I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These clips can actually be moved for thicker hair and I assume very curly hair (of which I have neither). They are unique in this manner and have a cool look to theml. I myself have thinner hair but know these would work great for my girlfriends with the thicker hair. I do love these however I will say my hair did get caught in one which hurt a little. The price is not bad. Although these are probably not meant to wear I plan on trying them out with a hair style of some sort of up do.  They are perfect for when you want to section off your hair for drying etc. It&#x27; worth a try.</li>
            <li> These clips keep disappearing on me cuz all my coworkers keep stealing them!! They ARE THAT GOOD! Haha. I work a lot with thick, curly hair and these clips always keep my sections clean and organized. I love them.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. I have very thick and long hair. Most people, when tying their hair into a ponytail, the diameter of hair would be dime to penny size. My hair diameter is bigger than a half dollar when straightened and thinned so I need something tough and strong to keep my hair UP. These clips are so useful for holding up my hair when cutting my own hair. Would recommend these to anyone with thick long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I also used a clip to hold up a curtain so these things are legit.</li>
            <li> I have 4C medium hair and these actually clamp onto my hair wet or dry! I&#x27;ve had them for over a month, and dropped them so many times it&#x27;s crazy that they haven&#x27;t broken!</li>
            <li> I read about these hair clips in an online blog and now they are 1 of my top 5 favorite hair/ beauty tools. They are strong and will hold hair securely, which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for 10 years and these croc clips are the best for sectioning hair, holding hair in place while foiling or cutting, or styling. I only use these extensions when I apply extensions.</li>
            <li> These clips are great. No more strands of hair are ripped out of my head with the old metal clips I was using. Love them!!</li>
            <li> I really like the Black Croc Hair Styling Clips!  They hold  your hair in place without slipping.  I tried them with various thickness of hair and they held tight each time without pulling or snagging.  I like to hold sections of my hair in place while I use a flat iron.  I adjust the amount of hair as I smooth each section. These Black Croc Styling clips work perfectly whether it was a large volume of hair or down to a fine strand.  I would  recommend these Black Croc Hair Styling Clips for all your clipping needs.  They also worked well as fasteners to hold your styling cape closed!</li>
            <li> These clips are so great to use and are a great price! Will definitely order more in the near future! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product didn’t work too well for me.  I used them while detangling my think Coily (4C) hair.  My hands were slick with conditioner and I tried to use the clips to hold the sections of my hair I was not working with.  The clips were hard to open with slippery hands.  Another disappointment was that they did not slide very well through my hair for me to actually use the clip.  I think these clips would work very well on straight hair, but not on Coily African American hair.  I would not buy more of these clips, I’ll still to my cheap beauty store clips.</li>
            <li> I was sent these hair clips as part of SalonGuys Market Research program, but as my hair isn&#x27;t even remotely &amp;#34;clippable,&amp;#34; I asked my wife to try them out and give me her take on them instead. She says that, while she doesn&#x27;t typically wear make-up (and I love her for that!), they can be quite handy to keep hair out of one&#x27;s face while washing/cleansing. They would likely be equally useful for the same purpose when applying make-up. Neither of us quite understood what the hinge in the middle was for or whether it was even necessary. These clips do seem quite solidly made with a sturdy hinge mechanism, though.</li>
            <li> These work very well but I thought the design was rather peculiar and I don&#x27;t understand why it has a double-jointed spring-shaft (lost a star for that). There is absolutely no hair slippage at all which is why I gave it 4 stars but to use the backside of the spring shaft takes two hands which is inconvenient however, I would recommend these clips to stylists working in the industry and women who just want to hoist their hair up but please don&#x27;t wear these outside...so not THAT cool...</li>
            <li> These clips are great for doing makeup. I use them to pin back my hair when I&#x27;m doing my face makeup and eye makeup and it&#x27;s so much better than tying it back in a ponytail.. No crease!! These are also great for curling and straightening hair they have a really tight hold, so if you need clips for thick hair like I have these are perfect! I&#x27;ve only had one problem with them once they got stuck in my hair while I tried pulling them out, but it was fine in the end they ended up coming out! These clips have a great hold so if you need tight hair clips purchase these I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I made my wife very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because the product works perfectly, i didnt dislike anything and id recommend it to other hairstylists.</li>
            <li> I use these clips almost every day for styling my hair. I was searching for clips to use for sectioning my hair. They make the hair styling process (flat ironing or curling) so much more effortless. They arrived in the mail right on time and they are exactly what I was looking for. They are just the right size and seem to be well-made. Most clips are cheaply made, but I never worry that these clips are going to break. They are also a nice matte-black color without design or logo which makes them look professional. I will definitely be purchasing more if they are ever misplaced.</li>
            <li> Second hinge in these makes for a style that doesn&#x27;t fall loose as easily as others I&#x27;ve tried and still are gentle enough not to break the hair. Looks cute done up, almost oriental like. I enjoyed working with these and found they work well for a quick attractive style in a hurry. Thanks to SalonGuys for sending me these!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great.  They didn&#x27;t pull the hair and they stayed in really well.  We couldn&#x27;t figure out what the little piece that moved was for.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was supposed to do something special.</li>
            <li> If I am home, my hair is up. Even if I&#x27;m not home, my hair is at least half up, and I always use a type of clip to hold up my hair- never a pony tail. I love these clips. They keep my hair in place and secure. I have used them while getting ready to style my hair in different sections, around the house, and even out a couple times. They seem as though they will last long and I hope that they do. They are the perfect clips in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I just used these clips to straighten my hair and they&#x27;re great! They easily hold a large chunk of hair and when you remove them they don&#x27;t pull on your hair.The finish on them is great when your hands are wet. They have a very secure grip and don&#x27;t fall out of your hair. The clips were shipped quickly, I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that quick. The product came just as expected and advertised. I compared these clips to my friends $16 clips by Drybar and I  didn&#x27;t see a significant difference, besides price of course. Again, this product is great and I would definitely recommend the Croc Clips to my friends.</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves is when my clips just don&#x27;t hold up the hair or worse yet they slip out entirely. These clips DON&#x27;T! I am so happy that Salon Guys sent me a sample of this product to review, because they are so worth it. They have teeth all along the length of the clip grips along the inside of the bottom half of the clip. They hold the hair up and they don&#x27;t slip at all! One of the parts I like best, is that the part where you hold on to the clip in order to press it open has these little grips so that you have control (and are less likely to drop the clip.) All in all i would say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> These clips that I got from the market research program are stylist and convenient. They have a great hold on any hair type. I used them on my hair which is thin and doesn&#x27;t hold well in any clip. I also used them on someone with much thicker hair and they worked great. they have grip on the inside of the clip that work well without pulling the hair. the shape makes them easy to manuever into hair and easy to remove. And the best part? They are black. They were easy to wash and store because of their shape and size. they are not all rubber so it was easy to wipe off.</li>
            <li> These clips have a great locking system for thick hair! Other clips don&#x27;t have the extra clip on top and allows for thick hair  to slip through having to use several clips just to keep the hair up! Love these!</li>
            <li> these clips are awesome! They made styling my hair so easy!  My hair is long and thick, so usually when I part it or try to section it off, I have trouble keeping it separated ... the clips are great for holding my hair in place until I&#x27;m ready to go on to the next section.  But what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re trying to hold back a small amount of hair or a lot because it adjusts and clips snuggly no matter how much hair you clip in. This croc clip is a must have if you&#x27;re into styling your own hair.  I would definitely recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair clip to section my hair while I straighten or curl it. My hair just seems to slip out of most clips I find but these ones work perfectly! They definitely get a good grip on my hair without damaging it or leaving annoying creases. They make it so easy to section of your hair for pretty much anything! Straightening, curling, coloring, or just having your hair out of your face. I even keep an extra one in my purse to hold my hair back when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and these clips do a great job sectioning my hair when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Good stong clips that assist during all hair needs.</li>
            <li> As someone with very long, thick hair, I often have to section if off in order to flat iron it or to work on styling it just one section at a time. For me, these clips are perfect! They are very strong and sturdy and are able to hold large amounts of hair in place at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice and large and very useful for a lot of different things. The teeth do a great job of holding the hair up when I&#x27;m styling but I also use them just to keep my hair out of my face when I am doing my makeup and getting ready for the day. I also love that they do not snag the hair when I go to open the release and take them out. I received a set to review and absolutely love them. I can honestly say that I find myself using them almost every day now. Give them a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have always used the old school clips that don&#x27;t have teeth because I was under the impression that alligator style clips would leave kinks in my hair. Unfortunately, because my hair is also very fine, they would slide out while I was trying to use them. I also had fears of this style pulling or tangling my hair. Again, I was shocked at how this wasn&#x27;t an issue. These will hold SO much hair! My hair is fine, but there&#x27;s a LOT of it, and I can actually pull all of my up on top of my head with one clip! These made dyeing my hair a breeze! They also did a great job keeping my shoulder towel held together when I was doing a dye job. All in all a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I have very VERY thick hair and these are the only clips I&#x27;ve found that work. They hold my hair in place really well.</li>
            <li> Good grip.  They work better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at large box stores.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! Great for separating hair for drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Two of my clips broke within the first week of receiving the package. I am very disappointed about the quality of these clips</li>
            <li> The black clips are functional and work well to hold the clients hair back during treatments. Durable and well made.</li>
            <li> very good quality, holds hair perfectly. love them, will be purchasing more and its a pretty good deal, only wish if they make in more colors other than black.</li>
            <li> Love these - they make styling my hair a breeze in the mornings ....how did I live without them?</li>
            <li> These are great!  They hold my short, thin hair where I want it held while I style it.  Styling is finally so much easier.  They are sturdy enough, don&#x27;t snag in my hair, and are breeze to remove.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever come across such strong gripping hair clips. These hair clips hold everything very well from towels around the neck to dry or wet hair to capes etc. I have been enjoying these hair clips very much. I would buy these hair clips over and over again. The seller was fast and they were shipped very carefully to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my daughter use these hair clips also and she loves them. She wants more hair clips for herself also. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like the durability and weight of the plastic they are made from. These hair clips will last a very long time. I plan on buying more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the fat time in which I received these hair clips, the way the shipper took care in packaging and their promptness.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these clips.  I have fine hair.  I have used many a different clip and almost ALL of them sliip out or my hair doesn&#x27;t stay in.  These clips stay where I put them and hold the hair I clip into.  I also like that they don&#x27;t pull or break my hair like other clips do.</li>
            <li> I have fine but dense hair. In other words, the individual strands are pretty thin, but I have a lot of hair overall. This actually makes it pretty difficult to clip my hair up for blowdrying. Normal clips always fall out after a few minutes, even at the salon. These are the only clips I have tried that actually stay in my hair until I take them out. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about these clips.  They&#x27;re very versatile since I use them for holding different sections up while using a straightener or curling iron.  I even use them for just holding my bags out of my face sometimes. No matter how much hair I throw into a bunch, it works on any amount, small and large.  As I said, my hair is thick and abundant and these have proven to be the best I&#x27;ve used.  These are strong, professional quality clips</li>
            <li> I received these clips and used them right away. The grip has a bit of texture that helps open up the clip which is unique. The tension on the clips work well on my fine slick hair as well as heavy, long client hair. My only complaint is they eventually brake over time. These are great for hair dessers or moms with daughters. Great tool used for sectionong hair to dry, straighten or curl. This product was provided to me no charge.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair that I blow out every day because I think it looks more professional.  Obviously a LOT of hair products are involved. I’ve got a system. Part of my routine necessitates clipping sections up while I work on smoothing and drying whatever piece I currently have wrapped around my brush. These clips are amazing (and I’ve tried a LOT of different brands). The gripper bits allow for a secure hold that doesn’t droop but still manages not to catch and tear your hair in the release. I work quickly, so not having to mess about with sections I’m not ready for is key.  The only downside: because the gripper clamp begins immediately at the free end of the clip I’ve had to abandon my habit of using the tip to part out the next section. But given how fabulous these clips work I’m willing to pick up a comb (sacrifices!).</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and hard to pin up, my hairdresser recommended these and they do the job. Going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> So far so good. A couple reviews say that they have had them break on the first use. I didn&#x27;t have that problem, but then again I&#x27;ve only used two and put the other four in storage as backup. So far I love them. They are easy to use and really do hold a lot of slippery hair.</li>
            <li> I will never use another clip in my hair but these.  I have thick hair and it holds every piece in place on my 10 hour job.  Another Christmas present idea for some long hair members in my family......what a great product!</li>
            <li> They work great in helping to keep  my hair in place while styling it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, met my expectations</li>
            <li> Great grip for all hair types!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my last set, these snag the hair for some reason more than the others ones &amp; somehow don&#x27;t hold as well. They are ok so if your in a pinch they&#x27;ll do, but I like my Color Trax better.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to hold my hair but it too heavy...</li>
            <li> My other clips that came with my flat iron ended up breaking and these were a great replacement for a great price!</li>
            <li> These clips hold my hair perfectly where I need it to stay during styling.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic junk. Can&#x27;t barely pinch them open because the clamp is so wobbly.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have issues finding something that can hold it up, especially when blow drying,  These fit the bill.  These clips are constructed of strong, durable material.  These would make an excellent gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best features:&lt;br /&gt;*They don&#x27;t let go until you&#x27;re ready&lt;br /&gt;*Firm grip&lt;br /&gt;*Professional grade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, even for those who may have difficulty with their hands (ie arthritis, or other disability), like me.  It takes a little effort to get used to the strength required to open, but once you get that, you will enjoy these too.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has long thick hair &amp; these clips are perfect for her to section her hair when she is curling or straightening it. They are sturdy &amp; easy to use. These are definitely a high quality, professional hair clip. They keep the hair in place without slipping. There are little bumps inside to help grip the hair and keep it in place. My daughter is thrilled with these clips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these clips directly from the Salon Guys for the purpose of trying them out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My kid sister got married and came to me to do her hair before her reception. She wanted to dye her hair for the first time, and she wanted to try an ombre style. While the procedure was a bit intimidating, these styling clips from Hair Tamer made it so easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creating an ombre style requires a lot of sectioning and clipping to keep the dye consistent. These 4&amp;#34; clips have two hinges to help them easily grab onto thick sections of hair. The small teeth kept these clips from sliding while I was working and the spring hinge was easy to open one-handed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course these clips are great for much more than special hair occasions. Since they hold such a large amount of hair I&#x27;ve found them to be perfect for when I wash my face! A quick twist and one clip is all it takes to hold back my entire long, straight mane. Thicker hair would probably require more than one clip, but luckily this set comes with six!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Tamer has made a wonderful hair clip that I&#x27;m excited to keep using! I was provided with a sample of this product but price doesn&#x27;t change how well they hold hair, nor does it effect my review.</li>
            <li> I have thick and heavy hair. When I blow dry or straighten my hair I need to use few clips to separate and hold them  while I work on one section of the hair. I always look for nice clips which can hold my hair tightly. Luckily I got the opportunity to try the Croc hair styling clips from hair Tamer in exchange of an unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;These hair clips come in a pack of 6. Nice and decent packaging. The clips are available in various colors and patterns.&lt;br /&gt;The croc hair styling clips  have great grip to hold and use on the hair. The Clips hold the hair tightly because they have double hinged design. No slipping or budging when you use the croc hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use these clips for holding my bun of place. Just one clip works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;For straightening, styling, coloring, blow drying and for daily use these clips work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the clip does not slip. My hair stays tight all day long.&lt;br /&gt;These croc clips are perfect for summer to keep hair away from your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with these clips and I would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I got this product in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like croc clips. These are fine and will get the job done. I prefer a more ceramic plastic than the lighter plastic. They won&#x27;t last as long as the ceramics, however they are a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it hard to find the right hair clip to do what I want and hold it all together.  And this clip does it.</li>
            <li> These clips are really durable. I use them on my hair and was very pleased because with other clips i have to use a couple of clips but these hold my hair only with one clip because you are able to move the sizing of the clips . Very different in the right way.</li>
            <li> These clips are exactly what you want to have for holding up the hair. They are easy to get a god grip with and they sit in the hair really well.&lt;br /&gt;I tried use them for making no heat waves on my hair, most clips I&#x27;ve tried for this either slides out so I have to adjust them several times or they get uncomfortable after half an hour but these I can have in my hair through the process without adjustments or feeling any discomfort.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair and lots of it! I purchased the Croc Clips to hold her hair in sections to make rag curls, spiral curls, etc. They work perfectly. We chose this vendor because of cost and availability. They were delivered quickly and we were not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love these silly things. Good, solid hold and easy to grab and open when your hands are slippery with styling products or hair color. A staple that I will not be without.</li>
            <li> Amazing clips that hold both soft and fine hair, and a big thick mop. I&#x27;ve tried these, and have given them to friends; all have found them comfortable, secure, and a nice change from our usual clips.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and these clips hold it up perfectly! Used them yesterday to straighten my hair and it was a breeze with these clips!</li>
            <li> The item is as described.  Very useful and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> These work great with my thick hair and are great for sectioning off hair when blowing drying without leaving a crimp mark. No complaints here and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> These clips are great. They hold a good amount of hair. I like the fact they have the grip all the way to the springs.I like that they have a flexible tip on top and I like that they are anti slip where your fingers grip to put them in the hair.I am suggesting theses clips to all the girls in our shop. My only complaint is I need them in pink and other colors. Lol</li>
            <li> I have been using these awesome clips because Salon Guys allowed me to join their market research program.  My daughter has very thick coarse hair and they hold her hair without falling out or hurting her.  I have much softer and fine hair and these clips are amazing for me as well.  They do not leave creases in my hair or let my hair slip out.  I like to use these for drying my hair in sections and straightening it.  These would work well for doing highlights as well.  The service from Salon Guys was great!  Fast arrival and nice people with good follow up.</li>
            <li> Croc clips are great and these are great ones. Nice finish, clasp, and weight.  Dependable and will last a long time.  Price is good for the quality.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love these clips for holding my hair in sections when I am coloring it.  They hold very well.</li>
            <li> i loved it,so large and hold all my hair up..recommendd it</li>
            <li> We have three girls with long thick hair in our household, so when I was invited to participate in a consumer research project to evaluate, test, and review these Hair Tamer Croc Hair Styling Clips I gladly accepted.  I&#x27;m not a beautician or stylist, but I am a mom with plenty of experience with various hair clips before these, and after using them now to help with a variety of styles for the kids hair I think these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These croc clips are about 5&amp;#34; long and made of a very heavy duty plastic with a unique double hinged design and two springs that allow them to adjust automatically to keep a good grip on any amount or thickness of hair. They&#x27;re easy to open using the thumb lever and they certainly hold their section of hair securely until they&#x27;re released, and they release cleanly without catching or tearing at the hair as they come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Hair Tamer Croc Hair Styling Clips work perfectly when I need to section off a part hair for braiding or styling.  The construction seems durable enough to last through lots of usage, and they would be as useful to a professional hair salon as they are in my home. They&#x27;re perfect for sectioning off hair for cutting, coloring, or styling and they won&#x27;t slip when working with wet hair. Durable, grips very well and doesn&#x27;t damage hair when removed.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> These things are made right, very durable for my thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t slip out of your fingers when wet.</li>
            <li> Perfect for straightening hair</li>
            <li> I have super long, super thick hair so I need some good clips that can keep my hair up and out of the way when I&#x27;m trying to style or dry separate sections of my hair. I&#x27;ve often tried dozens of other clips that just don&#x27;t hold. They are too loose, don&#x27;t have good grip, and fall out easily, which can be incredibly frustrating when you&#x27;re already trying to hold a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other, to straighten out and smooth a separate section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try out these salon-quality clips in hopes that it would keep a good grip on my hair. When these clips arrived, I was immediately impressed by the quality and grip just from holding them in my hand and opening and closing them. They are incredibly strong and very high quality and you can tell from the design they are made to last too! They have a nice big, tight spring, that really keeps a hold on the hair when placed in hair. It takes a little work just opening them, the spring is so strong, which is great, because you know immediately it&#x27;s going to have no problem staying put in hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the design of the claw on these clips too. The claw is covers the whole top section of the clip and is wide and big allowing for hold of even super big chunks of hair- like a ponytail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it comes in a set of 6  which is more than enough for one head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to place these styling clips in the hair, and once in, they&#x27;re not going anywhere! They hold like no other! Even right after hair is washed and clean and nothing seems to stay put in hair when it&#x27;s this soft! These clips don&#x27;t budge even a centimeter! I used mine to clip my hair up into different sections while blowdrying and styling. I only had to place the clip once, and it kept all of my hair perfectly out of the way, and stayed in place while I dried and styled section by section of my hair. I could easily place my focus on holding the dryer and brush and working on the other section of my hair, while these amazing clips kept the rest of my hair completely out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling! You don&#x27;t need to be a stylist to keep these on hand! They work great for so many different situations in where you need to focus on something particular in your hair while keeping the rest out of the way. I also found it works amazingly for using when braiding hair. You can clip one of these in at the end of the braid, while you pull the rest of your hair up in a ponytail for where the braid will meet and end. It also works perfectly for clipping hair back into a ponytail too until you can put a holder in it! I was completely blown away that they were indeed strong enough to do this all on their own, as my hair is really thick and makes quite a thick pony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips have already come in handy far more than I ever thought possible. I&#x27;m so glad I got them and am now wondering how I&#x27;ve gone so long without them! They really are a ilfe saver when it comes to styling or drying hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super excited about these clips and know I will get tons of use out of them! I highly recommend them and you can bet I&#x27;ll be keeping mine where I can easily get to them every single time i need to style my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product in exchange for my honest review.other section of my hair, while these amazing clips kept the rest of my hair completely out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips are an absolutely must have for anyone with hair that needs to be clipped out of the way while styling!

            <li> I have been in need of good hair clips that do not slip out and hold a good chunk of hair.  These Hair Tamer black croc styling clips are perfect for what I needed.  I also think they would be great for regular salon use.  They are strong, study and easy to use.  They stay were I put then without leaving my hair all crimped.  Perfect for when I am blowing out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> Best hair clips ever! They hold my hair and do not budge.</li>
            <li> These clips are my new favorite hair tool.  While they are by no means something you would wear out into public, since they are simple and not particularly attractive, they are incredibly functional.  They are great for sectioning hair or throwing it all up.  I have a lot of hair (long and thick), and if I&#x27;m careful I can get it all up with one clip.  These are really great for dying and styling hair.  They don&#x27;t snag on the hair at all, but they keep it up nicely.  They are also really good for bleaching/dying hair, since they aren&#x27;t metal like other similar clips.</li>
            <li> When I style my hair I usually use clips similar to these that are flat metal. I thought these would be a good alternative to the metal ones and that they might be a little less damaging to my hair.  The clips look and feel like they are a nice quality.  However, due to the small “teeth” on the bottom half of the clip, it moves and tugs on my hair when I am initially clipping it in AND when I am removing it.  For me the point of having these clips would be to use as a styling aid but they have made styling more challenging.  I would not repurchase these.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these clips to hold her section of her hair when she is coloring her hair.  She loves the.  They are very sturdy and well built.  They do not come loose and the hold the hair very well.  Once in place you can be sure that your hair will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She really likes the hinge effect on the clips.  these would be useful for anyone who is cutting or coloring their own hair. They are of a professional salon quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also uses them when she is doing chores or participating in activities that require her to hold her hair back.  They keep the hair back out of her face and do let go.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and handle when handling the hair. Don&#x27;t get stuck in the hair which is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  a great product.</li>
            <li> Nice clips that hold my thick hair when blow dring without falling out.</li>
            <li> To save money, I am always coloring my own hair and my kids when they request for a new look. I usually buy my clips from a local beauty shop but they just don&#x27;t seem to provide the strong hold that I normally see at the hair salons. I received these clips directly from the vendor and I absolutely love them! I can now section my hair and it actually stays in place! I first tested these clips on my daughter and it didn&#x27;t matter how much she moved, the clips did not budge or slide off. Usually as I&#x27;m coloring my hair and working through, my old clips would slowly slide, hair would get loose and I would end up being frustrated half way through. I received these clips for free to test, inspect, and offer my honest and unbiased opinion. Overall, the quality of these clips are very good, strong, and completely adjustable for all types of hair. The price is awesome for such great quality, I highly recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> I gave them to someone and she has a lot of long thick hair. In her opinion, they worked really well. However, due to their design and size, they might not work so well for thinner shorter hair. The hinged clip works well for adapting to different thickness of the hair that you want to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these clips after reading about them on a blog. I use these constantly to keep my long hair up w/o getting a crease in my hair from harsh rubber bands. I have about 20 of these all over my house. Great quality and value.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and these clips are a dream.  Ease of opening, they feel sturdy when placed and they come out smooth.  I can&#x27;t believe, just as a regular joe schmoe, that I haven&#x27;t used these clips earlier to better dry and style my hair!  A must have for any girl.</li>
            <li> Absolutely essential.  I use these all the time.  Great for holding curls in place as you use a curling iron or hot hair curler.  Great for use while dying hair.  Can be used to hold you&#x27;re hair up.  Pretty durable.  Get at least 2 packs though!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and these hold up very well without creasing.</li>
            <li> I wanted hair clips like the ones my hit dresser uses on my hair and these hit the mark exactly. They hold my hair so well that I&#x27;ve forgotten that I wasn&#x27;t wearing a barrette and have gone out with only these holding my hair! The effectiveness of this product alone sais a lot considering how thick and heavy my hair is, especially when wet. They even hold up in the shower.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> These are the clips that my hairdresser uses.  I love them because they don&#x27;t pull at my hair yet have a very firm grip.</li>
            <li> These Hair Clips hold great and are very comfortable to wear.  They held the hair exactly in place and the clip was easy to put in and take out.  No hair pulling - in fact it was very comfortable putting this in and taking it out.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use hair clips to section out hair while styling as well as anyone who just wants to put hair up.  It held very good in small and larger bunches of hair.</li>
            <li> Product as described and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered quickly and were exactly as expected.  Would order from this vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;(I also like to pretend these clips are little alligators by making a little growling noise when I open them up.  Whee!!)</li>
            <li> Works great- but, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is hot from blow drying as I will leave creases. Other than that- LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love these things! They grip well and are easy to work with.</li>
            <li> it really helps me divide my hair especially when im flat ironing it or curling. love it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, sturdily made, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and these clips have been great for when I straighten my hair or even if I just need to pull it up and out of my face without crushing my curls.</li>
            <li> works as described. but not extremely tight.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, the clips hold my hair up but the teeth snag my hair not sure if its from having too much hair in it at once. I bought these clips because my hair stylist uses them when she does my hair and it works for her not sure why it does not snag with her. I will continue to use them especially to put my hair up in my shower cap.</li>
            <li> The configuration of these clips really hold your hair in place. The plastic is top quality and is well worth the price. I plan to add more to my kits!</li>
            <li> The Black Croc clips are very versatile...not only do they work well with thick full hair but also on fine, thin hair. Also are great for wet or dry use.  They grasp and stay in place while cutting or styling hair.  They are easy to use, don&#x27;t get tangled up and are easily removed when  desired.  They don&#x27;t slip, pull your hair or drop strands also while in use. They have a nice &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; bite and  spring action, again showing both durability and versatility.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these large styling clips for my thick hair.  I&#x27;ve similar products in the past and they would slip off or would not stay in.  Great product and I love them!</li>
            <li> Croc Clips are basically the best type of hair clips ever made. They work great with wet or dry hair, really thin to super thick hair and everything in between, short hair or long hair, hair that has dye in it or does not. Basically it is the world&#x27;s best type of hair clip, when doing anything with your hair. I use these things for everything, especially when i&#x27;m at home and I don&#x27;t want to do anything with my hair except get it out of my face... They&#x27;re fantastic and I would highly recommend these Croc Clips to absolutely anyone. They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are different clips from what I&#x27;m used to but I have a wedding coming up that I think this will be very useful for. I&#x27;ve used it here and there while styling and have found it sturdy and usefuL!</li>
            <li> Similar plastic clips have become hard to find in store.....so I was happy to find these.  Good value and well made!</li>
            <li> When I first gave them to her, she didnt expect them to be any different than other clips.  She has a lot of long thick hair and they worked VERY well in her opinion.  They are specially designed to open fuller but still hold the hair in place.  My wife however didnt find them to work as well because she has thinner shorter hair.  I would recommend them for someone with thicker, longer hair.  I have them 4 stars because they wont work as well on thinner hair... and a regular clip would work fine.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and these clips are great for holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hairclips, including the ones you get at sally&#x27;s. I have very curly hair so I haave to section it off when styling, but it usually just slips out of the clip. That doesnt happen with these!!</li>
            <li> They are great and are doing their job</li>
            <li> Love theses clips. They hold my hair better while I am straightening or creating a stye. They are also good for hold clamps for up dos. These clamps are just plain  fun.</li>
            <li> These work for my thick long hair!  Even when wet!</li>
            <li> Does the job, though I have particularly thick hair and six clips won&#x27;t do D:</li>
            <li> These clips are fantastic.  I have thick curly hair that is difficult to style.  These clips securly hold the hair in place while I am drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin curly hair that most clips fall out.  Although these hold my hair if positioned correctly, they also get tangled in my hair easily.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, hard to open, hurts fingers when trying to open the clip.  I&#x27;m going to Ulta.</li>
            <li> Saw these in hair videos &amp; was curious. I like them. They are sturdy, which is extremely important for my thick course hair, when sectioning. They were shorter than I expected. In videos, they look a bit longer in length, (could be because of the video?) Unless they come in different sizes? Regardless, being sturdy is most important &amp; they definitely past that test!</li>
            <li> Probably the best clips I have ever used in my life.  I have very short hair and they hold it, I clip whatever I want to get it out of the way and it wont budge.  These are just so awesome. The most I have had to use out of a packet was 3, I usually just use 1 or 2 to give me a hand while curling my hair.</li>
            <li> These clips work perfect with my hair! I have very thick course hair and I wrap my hair up on top of my head at night and put one of these clips in and it will keep my hair up all night!! Does not move.</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding my very long and heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li> No other clips would hold up my thick, heavy especially when wet, hair except these. I have gone through so many types of clips, none of which would work. This dont pull or get tangled/break my hair and they hold my hair in place which is great when I&#x27;m battling with the blow dryer or straightener. Lol</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they say they should! I have had no problems with them at all :) I would definitely re-order!</li>
            <li> They are fantastic, stay in place no hair snagging.  I have extremely thick hair and every other clip I have used has popped out numerous times when using.  This stays in place and saves me time and frustration. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These clips are hands down the BEST! I have long thick hair so I normally have to use multiple clips to hold up my hair, but not with these. These clips have a flexible extension on the top of clip and it allows you to grab more hair and it holds it all in the clip. They are so amazing. The best hair clips i have ever used. I would HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
            <li> I received these Croc Hair Clips from SalonGuys as part of their market research program. I used these on myself and several other people while styling to give them a good trial run. They definitely grip well and hold a generous amount of hair! I hate having to constantly adjust my clips while styling to keep them from slipping out, and these I could just stick in place and not worry about. They are made of plastic with metal springs, and seem sturdy and well made. They hurt my fingers a little if I hold them open for very long since there is a texture on the grip part, but that is a small complaint and because of the textured part they do not slide out of my grip like some others, even when my hands are damp. I was worried that the adjustable swiveling tip with its spring would catch and pull my client&#x27;s hair, but I&#x27;ve just been careful not to get them tangled in the hair and I&#x27;ve had no problems with that yet. They work really well in all hair types and I&#x27;m pleased with them overall.</li>
            <li> I have monstrously thick hair which can rarely be contained by your average scissor-style clip. I was pleased to see that these clips have an extra hinge on the top that essentially forms a triangle around your hair to keep it from spilling out. There are teeth on all internal surfaces of the clip that also keep your hair from sliding out, so it would work well for both curly and super-straight, slippery hair. If you have extremely fine, thin hair, I&#x27;d look elsewhere because I think these would be too heavy. You&#x27;d really only need one or two of these to keep hair out of the way during a salon session.</li>
            <li> I have extemely thick hair. Regular barettes don&#x27;t work. They not only held my thick hair in place, but they didn&#x27;t slip. Even when pulled on slightly, they didn&#x27;t move. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> These are good clips for the price. I did have one break the day I got them (so I am giving them 4 stars), but luckily I got six of them so I wasn&#x27;t too upset. Some times I just wear them around the house as a hair clip. I have thick hair and they work great.</li>
            <li> These work really well to clip up hair out of the way for curling or trimming.  They hold better than the other flat clips I have.  Those don’t stay where you put them and these do.  I got the black but I see that they also come in zebra stripes and leopard patterns.  How cool is that!  Maybe everyone doesn’t like to pay a few bucks more for the patterns.  That was definitely sarcasm.  This is also a nice clip to pull your hair back for washing your face or for putting on a mask without getting it in your hair.</li>
            <li> The black croc hair styling clips are a wonderful tool in blowdrying and dying of your hair.  I have long, thick hair and often need clips to hold my hair up and away when I am drying my hair or coloring it.  Because my hair is so think, many clips don&#x27;t work and drop the hair with any movement.  Not these clips.  They are incredible.  Hold the hair tight and don&#x27;t hurt my head when I am using them.  Would order again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing hair for over 8 years and have tried all sorts of clips, while this style may not be the most attractive looking clip out there it definitely seems to work the best. I used to have to keep a couple different clips handy at work, small ones for fine hair and giant claw clips for thick long hair, these clips seriously work for all hair types. They hold tight and I have never heard a complaint about pulling.</li>
            <li> I see most reviews are from people with thick hair and/or a lot of hair.  I have a lot of very fine hair.  These worked surprisingly well, considering most clips slide right out of my hair.  These grip and hold without breaking my hair.  The cool way you can prop them open wider seems to indication you could put them around large bunches of hair or smaller rollers.  I found them very helpful to hold hair back for when I want to make small braids in my hair (bobby pins just pull and make a mess!).  They also work well for when I need to wash my face in the sink.</li>
            <li> I have received these clips from SalonGuys as a part of their market research program. I think they are very good if you don’t have short and very fine straight hair like I do. They slide down my head and don’t stay but no clips actually do. However, the work great on my daughter whose long hair is also very fine and it’s hard to find clips that would hold her hair. She needs to put up her hair every night for shower and they worked perfectly fine for that. They also held her hair nicely apart when I was braiding it so we are very happy with them. Thank you, SalonGuys!</li>
            <li> I have used several different types of clips in the past to try to manage my hair while styling and curling my hair and nothing compares to these. I received these clips for free as a promotion and I&#x27;m so happy that I got them, They have a unique system that I&#x27;ve never seen before that allows for part of the clip to retract and catch on another part of the clip, which allows for more hair to fit in the clip, unlike standard alligator clips. Also, because there is more room, it does not leave an indent in my hair, as other clips I have used in the past have done, due to the tightness of my thick hair in the clip. I love these clips and it is so much easier to do my hair now!! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and I usually use hair crunches or other regular everyday use hair accessories to clip a section of hair. It gets really uncomfy and messy because it may not hold the hair properly. These hair clips, on the other hand, hold a large amount of hair and do not slide off. The clips are made of plastic and therefore are not heavy. If you are dying your hair they are still good to be used. I use then when I dye my moms hair. I wash them after use and they are good as new. The color has not peeled off either. Overall, they are made of good quality plastic and will also you long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations. Purchased on www.salonguys.com</li>
            <li> Good product, good price. I would buy from this seller again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for, and as described. I may need to buy a 2nd pack, as I suspect my sisters will agree and steal mine!</li>
            <li> These croc clips are identical to the ones hairdressers use. They hold your wet hair - no matter how thin or thick - in place until you unclip them. Love them. And delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but my long hair still gets tangled and caught in these clips.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and most clips just slide out of my hair.  these are great and stay in well.  I used them to section my mom&#x27;s hair while doing a trim for her and they were awesome.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair on a normal basis and I love using this to section out my hair! I have very thin hair so it is difficult to find clips that will hold my small sections and these do a great job holding my hair without it falling out on me. I make my friends curl my hair all of the time so I will be brining these clips everywhere with me so that my friends can use them on me as well.  I would definitely recommend these for anyone!</li>
            <li> They are big (but not giant) and sturdy. They hold the hair perfectly as expected and don&#x27;t rip hair out. I&#x27;m very happy with these guys.</li>
            <li> These make styling your hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> These clips are a godsend!  I can use them for large or small hair sections while sectioning my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has very kinky/curly texture).  And the part where you pinch to open the clip has little bumps so my fingers are less likely to slide off with hair products on my hands.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic clips with a unique holding action.  They are easy to use and hold as much or as little hair as needed.  They probably work for all kinds of hair, wet or dry.  They stay put but are easy to remove; hair does not get tangled or pulled.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These clips stay on no matter what. Work great on smallest&lt;br /&gt;pieces of hair or can even be used to make a ponytail. They are great for styling.</li>
            <li> Hard to manipulate with one hand. Have to free my other hand to open the clip. Don&#x27;t have to do with the Croc clips. Also leaves hair crinkled. Don&#x27;t like that either. Would return if I could but that option is not available. Will stick with the Croc.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks1</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Good packaging. Great grip and very heavy duty and durable</li>
            <li> Works great to separate my hair securely while I&#x27;m flat ironing it. I have pretty thick hair, but these clips work like a charm. They hold my hair securely without pulling or hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li> These have to be the best hair clips I have ever used. I have super thick and coarse hair so most clips do not even hold my hair up. These clips are super strong right from the touch you can tell these are high quality, durable clips. The handle is comfortable to grip and the teeth on the clip make sure your hair stays in place nice and comfortably without ripping you hair out or sliding down. If these clips can handle my crazy hair they can handle anyone&#x27;s hair! I will honestly never use another hair clip again after using these they are amazing! Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for such a high quality, durable item. Thank you Salon Guys for another amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love these sturdy clips and was so happy to find them on Amazon</li>
            <li> These are some nice clips. Great for long/thick hair. Holds well, doesn&#x27;t sag, and no hair tugging when removing the clip. Well made and sure to last a long time. Great for any hair needs.</li>
            <li> Hair will not slip out of these fabulous hair clips. I love how the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; grip the hair and hold it in place while I style my daughters&#x27; hair in the morning. My hair is thinner so I was able to use one to clip back all of my hair while applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are well made and hold up to daily use. They are easy to use and a package of six is definitely enough for most styles and a few extra. I am pleased with the product and would definitely recommend them to my mom friends who are trying to recreate all those popular hairstyles and braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a complimentary product for review. No compensation was received. All opinions are my own.**</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well built. Great service</li>
            <li> i have a lot of hair and they hold it perfectly</li>
            <li> great grip, easy to use, love these!</li>
            <li> These are the same type of clips my hair dresser uses - they work so much better than the old silver ones.  The teeth hold the hair and there is an articulation in the design so it actually can &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; around the plait of hair.  Very useful when styling (or cutting) hair.</li>
            <li> Been using these for several months....owned a pair that lasted me a couple of years.  I have really thick hair and they hold very well.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product</li>
            <li> These clip hold incredibly well. They work so well I&#x27;ve begun using them in lieu of claw clips</li>
            <li> Pros: they stay put and grab a lot of hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bottom part of the clip doesn&#x27;t slide in and out of hair easily, it snags a bit. But i guess that&#x27;s why it works as a clip.</li>
            <li> Hair clips that grasp and hold any formation you wish. These hair clips are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair. The clips hold really well all day. Much better than using a head band. I&#x27;m so glad I found them. I highly recommend the clips.</li>
