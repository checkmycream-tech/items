    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent addition to your skin care regime!</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever...</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is wonderful; my son has used the sunscreen with the brush packaging for years.</li>
            <li>The applicator allows you to target the eye area and provides good protection.  </li>
            <li>The price was good, too.</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many freckles under my eyes since moving to Arizona!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have another way to protect my eyes with this powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, but just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This has 12% titanium dioxide and 12% zinc oxide, and it is best used on moisturized skin, so put on your moisturizing sunscreen first and then use this on top.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen - which even seems to help as a concealer.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love that I can wear this sun screen around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The powder is great and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions in my very hypersensitive skin, and I like that</li>
            <li>So... it&#x27;s skin-saving, I&#x27;m sure, but it also reminds me of my age (or lack of sleep).</li>
            <li>I put it on top of my moisturizing sunscreen around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This finely milled powder feels very light on my skin and contains mineral sunscreen ingredients that don&#x27;t burn and sting my eyes as do synthetic sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t go on easily, a puffy brush would have been so much better.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>The product is useful only if you are not going to sweat, otherwise it is perfect in texture, shade and application.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t brush on lightly, you have to pat it one and that causes it to clump and cakes.  </li>
            <li>Looks fine, although the expiration date is not as far out as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have a sunscreen for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>Only product I can use for coverage; not as good as full coverage from foundations but does have spf</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of being able to put even more sun protection around the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of this product, which is gentle, effective and flattering.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order from them again for more beauty products.</li>
            <li>I always wear physical sunscreens with a high SPF on my face, and this is another way to be sure my skin is protected.   </li>
            <li>It really blends well and makes me look awake,</li>
            <li>Only improvement would be a brush applicator instead of a sponge to make it easier to clean the applicator.</li>
            <li>Love their other products!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype - for me, anyway.  </li>
            <li>While the color matches up with my skin, this really does settle in and point out those nagging little fine lines.  </li>
            <li>So I purchased an eye makeup brush and use it instead with the added benefit that it fits in with my other makeup tools for that special OCD part of me.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another product from this company and was highly pleased with their service and very secure wrapping for items that might have otherwise been broken or made a mess!</li>
            <li>In the end, it was simply too much work</li>
            <li>Completely nonirritating.</li>
            <li>I love colorscience products, and while this is a necessary item for those of us with pale faces, this item does me no favors esthetically speaking.  </li>
            <li>Far too cakey and white for my taste.</li>
            <li>This method was better, but applying it to any other area around the eye but the lid emphasizes lines and adds a dull matte finish.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A little bit pale, even on my extremely pasty skin, but it blends in easily</li>
            <li> This arrived and it was definitely not new.</li>
            <li> This product blends well, a pale pink, natural look.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were right about the applicator; it&#x27;s not great</li>
            <li> be afraid of the color--a light shade of pink</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy sunscreen on my face especially in the summer or for that matter anytime.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a fan of mineral makeup, all other SPF sunscreens are irritating and this provides much needed protection without the distress.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last a while despite its small size.</li>
            <li> I received the item in good shape, but was very disappointed to find a foam pad as the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, extra sun protection for delicate undereye area.</li>
            <li> This is just silly, tacky, grainy stuff that does absolutely nothing except make your eyes look like there&#x27;s flakes of grit around them.</li>
            <li> Oh ... and about depositing that powder - it sprinkles down onto parts of the face</li>
            <li> The problem was, after a few weeks the little applicator end fell of and without it you can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that the brush included with the orb is Lilliputian and, for me, difficult to manipulate (in addition to getting lost in the drawer).  </li>
            <li> I tried to solve the problem by shaking powder into a small dish and then dipping an eyeshadow brush into it.  </li>
            <li> but I use the applicator to dab bits of powder along the underside of my eye and then use a small makeup brush to blend it in.</li>
            <li> no more puffiness.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the sponge applicator is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> What a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and if used with eye concealer or primer, it cakes terribly.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to use the product.</li>
            <li> Dislike :-(</li>
            <li> This powder was terrible to use.  </li>

            <li> Excellent addition to your skin care regime! I only use Colorescience facial products &amp; makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen - which even seems to help as a concealer.  It goes on easy.  I like the sponge applicator.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Colorescience Pro Sunforgettable and purchased the Eyescreen as well.  The applicator allows you to target the eye area and provides good protection.  It also brightens the eye area.</li>
            <li> This powder was terrible to use.  It&#x27;s heavy and if used with eye concealer or primer, it cakes terribly.  Not to mention, the sponge applicator is hard to use.  It wouldn&#x27;t brush on lightly, you have to pat it one and that causes it to clump and cakes.  Ugh.  What a total disappointment.</li>

            <li> This product arrived quickly and in good shape. I have ordered another product from this company and was highly pleased with their service and very secure wrapping for items that might have otherwise been broken or made a mess! The price was good, too. I would definitely order from them again for more beauty products. Thank you Beauty Bridge!  I am thrilled to have another way to protect my eyes with this powder sunscreen. I always wear physical sunscreens with a high SPF on my face, and this is another way to be sure my skin is protected.   This has 12% titanium dioxide and 12% zinc oxide, and it is best used on moisturized skin, so put on your moisturizing sunscreen first and then use this on top.</li>
            <li> This finely milled powder feels very light on my skin and contains mineral sunscreen ingredients that don&#x27;t burn and sting my eyes as do synthetic sunscreens.  While I&#x27;m not a fan of mineral makeup, all other SPF sunscreens are irritating and this provides much needed protection without the distress.  Until now, I&#x27;ve relied on my sunglasses alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of the color--a light shade of pink--I have medium skin tone and with concealer, it brightens and accentuates my eyes without emphasizing the lines (gasp, I have wrinkles!).  My only caveat is that the brush included with the orb is Lilliputian and, for me, difficult to manipulate (in addition to getting lost in the drawer).  So I purchased an eye makeup brush and use it instead with the added benefit that it fits in with my other makeup tools for that special OCD part of me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. A little bit pale, even on my extremely pasty skin, but it blends in easily and I like that I am protecting my eye area. I have gotten so many freckles under my eyes since moving to Arizona! It seems to last a while despite its small size. I will probably order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The product is useful only if you are not going to sweat, otherwise it is perfect in texture, shade and application.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.  The problem was, after a few weeks the little applicator end fell of and without it you can&#x27;t use the product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype - for me, anyway.  The applicator consists of a short wand with an oversized sponge tip at the end ... your hand has to get reeeeeally close to the eye in order to deposit the powder.  Oh ... and about depositing that powder - it sprinkles down onto parts of the face you don&#x27;t want it to go, but if you tap off \\&quot;excess\\&quot; powder, not enough remains on the applicator to cover the eyelid.  I tried to solve the problem by shaking powder into a small dish and then dipping an eyeshadow brush into it.  This method was better, but applying it to any other area around the eye but the lid emphasizes lines and adds a dull matte finish.  In the end, it was simply too much work and I&#x27;ve gone back to my Shiseido sunscreen for eyes - also SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever...I use this instead of eye shadow for a simple, nude look</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear this sun screen around my eyes.  My eyes are sensitive to most products.  This product blends well, a pale pink, natural look.</li>
            <li> Only product I can use for coverage; not as good as full coverage from foundations but does have spf and I don&#x27;t break out from using it.  I mix several shades.  Don&#x27;t get the ones with built-in brushes.  The brushes aren&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I received the item in good shape, but was very disappointed to find a foam pad as the applicator.  it doesn&#x27;t go on easily, a puffy brush would have been so much better.  I suspect I&#x27;ll start dumping some powder out of the vial onto a piece of paper &amp; using one of my brushes to apply.  I&#x27;m sure the product is wonderful; my son has used the sunscreen with the brush packaging for years.</li>
            <li> Far too cakey and white for my taste. Nice concept, but just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love colorscience products, and while this is a necessary item for those of us with pale faces, this item does me no favors esthetically speaking.  The powder is great and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions in my very hypersensitive skin, and I like that I&#x27;m getting an extra dose of protection.  While the color matches up with my skin, this really does settle in and point out those nagging little fine lines.  So... it&#x27;s skin-saving, I&#x27;m sure, but it also reminds me of my age (or lack of sleep).</li>
            <li> This is a powder - guess I didn&#x27;t read description well?  And it gets all cakey and rolls off!!! Dislike :-( Love their other products!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of being able to put even more sun protection around the delicate eye area. I put it on top of my moisturizing sunscreen around the eyes. Other reviewers were right about the applicator; it&#x27;s not great but I use the applicator to dab bits of powder along the underside of my eye and then use a small makeup brush to blend it in. It really blends well and makes me look awake, no more puffiness. Plus the sun protection. Great price too.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product, which is gentle, effective and flattering. It is my go-to eye primer, highlighter and concealer. Completely nonirritating.No shimmer. Just the finest, slighly pinkish powder. And it&#x27;s protective.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, extra sun protection for delicate undereye area. Only improvement would be a brush applicator instead of a sponge to make it easier to clean the applicator.</li>
            <li> This is just silly, tacky, grainy stuff that does absolutely nothing except make your eyes look like there&#x27;s flakes of grit around them.</li>
            <li> This arrived and it was definitely not new. Box was ragged and worn. No plastic wrap over the box. No protective seal around the opening of the liquid cosmetic. I am afraid to use the product. Returned it for a refund. No stars, actually.</li>
            <li> Looks fine, although the expiration date is not as far out as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have a sunscreen for my sensitive eye area. It doesn&#x27;t burn, turn my eyes, or turn my eyes puffy. And its a breeze to apply.</li>
