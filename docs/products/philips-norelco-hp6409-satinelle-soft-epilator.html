            <li>This product is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I use it to shave about everything and its very effective.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t any more impressed with the results of waxing, so</li>
            <li>This product is simply awesome, I gifted it to my wife &amp; she just loves it, for someone who is used to epilators &amp; knows how to operate them, its a great product, certainly \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as the name suggests, all the attachments work just perfect..!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good epilator..</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 years now and it still works.</li>
            <li>My life has become so much more convinient with this epilator.</li>
            <li>However the more i use it the more</li>
            <li>This product is worth the good reviews.</li>
            <li>it Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Ive realized the more</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this and try it!  </li>
            <li>are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Epilating lasts longer and feels more comfortable than shaving.</li>
            <li>this is designed for fine womans hair, but i tried it with mine</li>
            <li>The size is great, it didn&#x27;t hurt much (but it just broke off the hairs!), and seemed like a great little gizmo, but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and barely hurt on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by how little discomfort there was (as compared to waxing).  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is also nice for touching up areas too sensitive for pulling out hair.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to have perfectly smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though.</li>
            <li>Excellant, Excellant, It leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>THis is the second one I purchased and she tells me the epilator does a great job.</li>
            <li>unlike older version of epilators, this one is really nice and a lot softer on your skin.</li>
            <li>I do plan on upgrading once this one has worn out, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to own a Braun epilator (an old model from the 90&#x27;s) in Europe and when I moved to US, I started looking for another one because of the voltage difference.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this after reading many positive reviews, and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed</li>
            <li>Plucks out the hairs fast and easy.</li>
            <li>but the razor is just as useful.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>and I think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>it gets easier after the first time</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>There will be some pain at first when using this product, but its gets easier after the first time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ive used a equilator.</li>
            <li>its my second one of same philips company,nd i found it good,ya u may have problem of ingrowth hair,but its ok,u can handel it,overall this system is good for everytime use,better than vaxing,threading and creaming..............</li>
            <li>and it was nice not having to shave certain places for a week, but it is not worth the pain.</li>
            <li>The epilator doesn&#x27;t leave much of a mark on my skin (what it does leave goes away in about an hour) unlike the redness and pain</li>
            <li>very well n</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>The massager doesn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>but it really won&#x27;t be needed once you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>The massager was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messy but effective.  </li>
            <li>My friend has a different model of Santinelle Norelco that I tried and loved it, but this one breaks more hair than it pluncks, the massager is useless and you have to go many times over the same area to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>tho am not sure if it does such a great job of pulling hair...</li>
            <li>It does get a little warm after you&#x27;ve used it for more than a few minutes, but it hasn&#x27;t gone beyond that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and want to remind everyone it is a process each time you use it.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty regular use (a little more than once a month)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty basic</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, without any unnecessary gadgets that will make it cost more than it&#x27;s actually worth.</li>
            <li>Just like plucking your eyebrows where it hurt the first few times but after that it doesnt really.</li>
            <li>One fair warning though, don&#x27;t let hair grow out too much, or it WILL be painful.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried numerous ways to get rid of the hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>At first it hurts a little</li>
            <li>a side note: The \\&quot;carrying case\\&quot; that it comes with fell apart after the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got to tell you it hurt the first few times and</li>
            <li>I dont have to shave very often and each time the hair grows back there is less of it and its thinner.</li>
            <li>Though it isn&#x27;t the most comfortable sensation, I find it much less painful than waxing or using Nair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was amazed by how much different element were added to the epilator. I was just expecting the head with the massage head. but the razor is just as useful. unlike older version of epilators, this one is really nice and a lot softer on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I think it works pretty well. It&#x27;s pretty basic but I like the results. Though it isn&#x27;t the most comfortable sensation, I find it much less painful than waxing or using Nair. I have very sensitive skin and have tried numerous ways to get rid of the hair on my legs. The epilator doesn&#x27;t leave much of a mark on my skin (what it does leave goes away in about an hour) unlike the redness and pain I get after waxing or using Nair-like products. I do plan on upgrading once this one has worn out, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*On a side note: The \\&quot;carrying case\\&quot; that it comes with fell apart after the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 2 years now and it still works. It gets pretty regular use (a little more than once a month) and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It does get a little warm after you&#x27;ve used it for more than a few minutes, but it hasn&#x27;t gone beyond that. Still happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I got this as a present from my husband. My life has become so much more convinient with this epilator. Of course, like all others who think so, epilators are suited only to those who are accustomed to plucking of hair from roots.   The specialised detachable shaving heads work very well n are very easy to clean. I have now been using this for about an year n its perfect.</li>
            <li> The product is not bad and not good.  I tried the emjoi before and I prefer the emjoi.    Anyway, it depends on the preferrence though, some people might like it.  To me, it&#x27;s like can&#x27;t take all of my hair.</li>
            <li> i got this as an experiment in body hair. Ouch it gets easier after the first time but it still hurts. this is designed for fine womans hair, but i tried it with mine and it was nice not having to shave certain places for a week, but it is not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> This is a good epilator..I like the shaver head as well as the epilator..tho am not sure if it does such a great job of pulling hair...i see hair growth within 2 weeks...which tells me that it breaks hair when pulling and not really pulls them from their root.</li>
            <li> My hair grows back finer, lighter, and I only have to use it once every 2 weeks or so. Although, I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your bikini area or underarms until you&#x27;re used to waxing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and try it!  I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed so I wouldn&#x27;t have to contort my body to get to my legs.  Then I read all the reviews and decided I could save money if I just bought this instead of waxing.  Well, it didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I have light, thin hair on my legs and it just seemed to break them off.  The ones that it actually pulled out left little dot bruises on my legs so I had to wear long pants anyhow.  The hair all grew back within a few days (no better than shaving) and it left my legs really, really, really dry.  I wasn&#x27;t any more impressed with the results of waxing, so I think I&#x27;ll just be sticking with a razor.  The size is great, it didn&#x27;t hurt much (but it just broke off the hairs!), and seemed like a great little gizmo, but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> its my second one of same philips company,nd i found it good,ya u may have problem of ingrowth hair,but its ok,u can handel it,overall this system is good for everytime use,better than vaxing,threading and creaming..............</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this after reading many positive reviews, and the first time I used it I was impressed by how little discomfort there was (as compared to waxing).  However the more i use it the more I think it just breaks the hairs instead of actually plucking them.  In the month or so that I have had this thing...I&#x27;ve yet to have perfectly smooth legs.  I&#x27;m actually really bummed because I hate getting waxed and shaving is too irritating :(</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to. Plucks out the hairs fast and easy. The shaver head is also nice for touching up areas too sensitive for pulling out hair.    This product is worth the good reviews. It&#x27;s simple, without any unnecessary gadgets that will make it cost more than it&#x27;s actually worth. The massager doesn&#x27;t do much for me but it really won&#x27;t be needed once you get used to the pain. One fair warning though, don&#x27;t let hair grow out too much, or it WILL be painful.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!  I&#x27;ve waxed for 12 years.  It&#x27;s messy but effective.  I have two small children and NO time whatsoever to wax anymore.  With this epilator, I can stop and start at any time removing hair.  It&#x27;s very effective and barely hurt on my legs.  I do admit to using the massaging head for the underarm and bikini line.  The massager was very helpful.  It took me about 15 - 20 minutes to do my entire   leg(s), underarm and bikini line.  That includes using the razor head to touch up.  I&#x27;ll never go back to waxing.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. There will be some pain at first when using this product, but its gets easier after the first time. The key to using a epilator is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. If not, you will have some serious ingrown hairs. Don&#x27;t expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though. The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Braun epilator (an old model from the 90&#x27;s) in Europe and when I moved to US, I started looking for another one because of the voltage difference. I wanted to give Philips a try and I am very satisfied with it. I use epilator for my legs and my armpit. Epilating lasts longer and feels more comfortable than shaving. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It was not wat I was expecting! My friend has a different model of Santinelle Norelco that I tried and loved it, but this one breaks more hair than it pluncks, the massager is useless and you have to go many times over the same area to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> Excellant, Excellant, It leaves my skin smooth. &lt;br /&gt;Regrowth is softer eachtime.  &lt;br /&gt;Love it Love it. &lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for a month now and I love it. I was tired of shaving my legs every other day it seemed. Waxing was too expensive to have done professionally. And I found it too messy when I tried to do it at home. So I went searching for another way to solve the problem. I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator. I did some research online and decided to give it a try. I totally love it. It works really well. At first it hurts a little but I didn&#x27;t think it was as bad as waxing. After a few times though you really hardly feel it anymore. I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have any sticky wax and you don&#x27;t have to have water and soap or shaving cream. You can just whip it out turn it on and away goes the hair. I have only used it on my legs so I can&#x27;t comment on using it for any other hair removal. If you are tired of the mess and hassle of shaving and/or waxing I recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Philips epilator products. THis is the second one I purchased and she tells me the epilator does a great job. She recommends it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ive used a equilator. Got to tell you it hurt the first few times and it irritated my skin a little to. Ive realized the more I use it the less it hurts. Just like plucking your eyebrows where it hurt the first few times but after that it doesnt really. And now my skin doesnt get irritated. I use it to shave about everything and its very effective. I dont have to shave very often and each time the hair grows back there is less of it and its thinner. I highly recommend it and want to remind everyone it is a process each time you use it.</li>
            <li> This product is simply awesome, I gifted it to my wife &amp; she just loves it, for someone who is used to epilators &amp; knows how to operate them, its a great product, certainly \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as the name suggests, all the attachments work just perfect..!!! The twin speeds are another addition.</li>
