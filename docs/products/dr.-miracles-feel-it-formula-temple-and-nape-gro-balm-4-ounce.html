            <li>I&#x27;m really happy someone recommended I try this.</li>
            <li>Price was great...</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>The smell on the newer containers isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s nothing like this.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Gro Oil\\&quot; is remarkable and, it works.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I bought all of the Dr. Miracle products and I must say, I love it!</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe in the maxim \\&quot; to each his own\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of like menthol but goes away after use.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it 1 time and the smell is so strong like medicine made of some kind of herbs .</li>
            <li>Before purchasing the product I did my research and found many favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>Growth and growth and better quality hair.    </li>
            <li>and maybe that will be a better demo</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using castor oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to many friends with simular hair.</li>
            <li>, I love it .</li>
            <li>so I didnt get the chance to see if it works because I couldnt stand it more than 5 minutes I would wash it off.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped out fast, arrived on time, and a great shopping experience.</li>
            <li>I had to find more of Dr. Miracles products.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying some more .</li>
            <li>I can feel an amazing tingle it has thickened my edges SIGNIFICANTLY</li>
            <li>Just goes to show that sometimes the old tried and true remedies are best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It seems heavily medicated, but Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Temple and Nape Gro Balm is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>great product, seeing results after 60 days, 2nd purchase</li>
            <li>So far, I have noticed a good amount of growth in these areas of my hair.</li>
            <li>So the growth is looking good so far.  </li>
            <li>I found another product I use that I am able to put in my hair and go out right after.</li>
            <li>If I see significant improvement I will repurchase this product.  </li>
            <li>I guess this was the original formula</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a month now as an all over grease and special attentions to my nape and temple.  </li>
            <li>and yet i have a full head of hair now.</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;I am now using it throughout my whole scalp.</li>
            <li>Overall good experience</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a bad scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not really bad but smells like medicine or muscle rub.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got most of my back</li>
            <li>On one hand the scent is kind of nice, but on the other hand, I really couldn&#x27;t stand it!</li>
            <li>this is too strong for a all ready damaged scalp/hair follicles ...</li>
            <li>I actually started to feel my nape area becoming more dense with hair.  </li>
            <li>My scalps is really liquidly, which is like puss, which is also causing crusting!!</li>
            <li>in a couple of weeks i had way more new growth than i had in years of dr.miracle .use natural products it works way better than this</li>
            <li>My friends are using also and to know and see, you&#x27;ll be very suprised at how much the hair has grown, we love \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li>It kind of irritated my skin after the third day.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling sensation and how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I wash my hair around my hair line and nape area.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>I had used it in the past and got great results, so when I decided to grow my hair and take a break from extensions</li>
            <li>My edges are very think &amp; full now&#x27;</li>
            <li>I rarely put it on 2x daily as the box says more like once a day when I brush and style my hair.</li>
            <li>The formula is a bit greasy but doesn&#x27;t bother me, I actually find it to be a good thing as it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product however, after applying just one time, the very next day I experienced burning and itching and by the next day, I had scabs in my hairline.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This was the first product I used and it was alright.</li>
            <li>VERY GREASY!</li>
            <li>First it is difficult for me to give a perfect score on anything</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I admit that I forget to use it twice daily most of the time.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not want to believe it was the grease.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and light.</li>
            <li>I must say I am so glad I finally found something to help me with my hair lost.</li>
            <li>This is my first go at this product...</li>
            <li>, so the smell was pretty yucky.  </li>
            <li>I look at my hair line now and back when I started and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I really wish that I could be the kind of person who could religiously apply this twice daily for 30 days.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not making it grow as fast as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>I was losing hair so much i did not know what to do.  </li>
            <li>So now I am looking to buy the whole range and why not, since I have seen the results of one product line.    </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveee this product I use it twice a day</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast just hope it works for my edges</li>
            <li>She says it works very well for her.  </li>
            <li>Product worked fast; I could tell a difference in two or three weeks,</li>
            <li>so I wasnt really expecting results</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me except made my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much change.</li>
            <li>although one side more than the other I honestly believe this was made for AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR</li>
            <li>Shea moisture Black Jamacian Castor Oil edge restore formula is 100 times better.</li>
            <li>the Jamaican Black Castor Oil/Rasta Mango &amp; Lime mentholated grow spray, it feels way better and is easier to work into scalp if you have braids.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known this was the older formula.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have healthy natural hair other than the thinning crown area.</li>
            <li>They grew back after using this product twice a day consistently for three months straight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an offensive tingle, but the smell is a little strong.</li>
            <li>My edges were nearly bald after getting box braids.</li>
            <li>When someone finds a real miracle cure for my thinning hair that doesn&#x27;t require twice daily applications - please let me know!  </li>
            <li>I put it on my hair on Sunday night and by Monday it had completely burned my edges.</li>
            <li>This is a product that should be completely taken off the market.</li>
            <li>On You tube, I found a young woman who used Dr. Miracle and it took her hair out in spots all over her head.</li>
            <li>(I have natural hair/no chemicals.</li>
            <li>So i decided why not use it on the whole head, and yes it had the same effect.</li>
            <li>being someone that frequently gets braids i tend to lose mt edges often.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews, I was very scared to try this product but being the person that I am, I decided to try it because every person is different.</li>
            <li>I have used other products with minimal results, but this truly worked, so much so that I now only use Dr. Miracles&#x27; products on my hair and the results are truly amazing for me personally.</li>
            <li>From being a dancer all my life and having my hair always in a super tight ponytail or bun, my hairline suffered.</li>
            <li>I tried many other products with no success.  </li>
            <li>The hair is thick and strong around my head.  </li>
            <li>I have be losing hair around my temple due to tight braids for many years and after three weeks of use I can see \\&quot;re-growth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad because I liked it at first</li>
            <li>Need this item for my hair and it solve my problem on bare places around the temple and the nape just as it reads on the bottle</li>
            <li>So be careful not to spread too much on or you will be wiping your forehead all day.</li>
            <li>The old formula is creamier and less greasy than the new formula, and it feels like its working immediately into the hair follicles (tingling sensation).</li>
            <li>so I would cut those hairs super short so now that area has even less hair than the other side.</li>

            <li> Need this item for my hair and it solve my problem on bare places around the temple and the nape just as it reads on the bottle</li>
            <li> So be careful not to spread too much on or you will be wiping your forehead all day.</li>
            <li> The old formula is creamier and less greasy than the new formula, and it feels like its working immediately into the hair follicles (tingling sensation).</li>
            <li> so I would cut those hairs super short so now that area has even less hair than the other side.</li>
            <li> So much for growing my temple it caused more hair to fall out :(</li>
            <li> The some is long and some short,</li>
            <li> AND IT GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> After the rash finally calmed down, my edges literally burned, leaving the skin where my edges are 3 shades darker than my skin tone to this day (7 months later).</li>
            <li> Crazy thing is I never use this product I just decided to put a little on, and when I say a little I do mean a little &amp; it caused more damage than anything!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this it for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying rogaine briefly, and I have used half a jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Jamaican black castor oil now in hopes of my edges growing back in.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED ONLY A LITTLE</li>
            <li> the hair is coming in nicely not as fast as I wanted</li>
            <li> I used it for ONE DAY and by the second evening I had started forming blisters all round my hair.</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE CAREFUL AS WE DO NOT KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THESE PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product.  </li>
            <li> Will help slick down soft hair</li>
            <li> Not only am I too lazy to apply as directed, even if I did, I would be walking around looking like a grease head.</li>
            <li> I was not able to put this in my hair unless I planned on washing my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> Even in places other than my temples.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> SO BE VERY CAREFUL AND AVOID THIS STUFF.  </li>
            <li> I developed a raised &amp; angry rash around my edges, shortly after using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see that ever happening, so I will never know if this product really works.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product SEVERAL negative stars.</li>
            <li> Also, I read other reviews about the overpowering scent of this product, and let me tell you - they aren&#x27;t kidding!</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle sensation but it goes away, I use it twice a day morning and night</li>
            <li> i swear i put black castor oil on my edges and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my edges for a little over a month</li>
            <li> by the third day my scalp was burning with yellowish stuff running down from the blisters !!!!</li>
            <li> I had lost  my hair  in the front a few years ago.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not extremely strong or unbearable</li>
            <li> Very annoyed to have hoped to improve on my hair line only to lose the little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 27 days now, and nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t notice progress from hair products</li>
            <li> but I have noticed my problem area seem a little less thin.</li>
            <li> This made my hair very stiff and broke off my hair-</li>
            <li> After using half of the jar, my hair was broken and damaged and my scalp was scaling and flaking.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits yet, but there aren&#x27;t any negative drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a least a month.</li>
            <li> I WAS FORCED TO SEE MY DOCTORS FOR MEDICATION TO STOP THE SWELLING.</li>
            <li> that it either didn&#x27;t work or results were slow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing, slowly, but I do see improvement.</li>
            <li> morning after i had finally washed this crap out my hair</li>
            <li> SCARY</li>
            <li> I work closely with people and affraid they would smell it in my hair, it gets all over the pillow even though I wear a scarf, sorry</li>
            <li> this balm stinks.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was working because of the tingling, but I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Some have said they&#x27;ve had painful rashes and pustules...</li>
            <li> It burned like crazy for about 2 weeks--after no longer using (I suffered)!</li>
            <li> I also have a patch of albino hair that I used to hate growing up</li>
            <li> but I hate it</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING GOT WORST FROM THEN ON.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> but this one was shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Need this item for my hair and it solve my problem on bare places around the temple and the nape just as it reads on the bottle yes i will recommend.</li>
            <li> great products. my hair grew bACK</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Gro Oil\\&quot; is remarkable and, it works. My friends are using also and to know and see, you&#x27;ll be very suprised at how much the hair has grown, we love \\&quot;Dr. Miracle\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So far, I have noticed a good amount of growth in these areas of my hair. I have only been using the product for about 1 month, but that&#x27;s when the product box states you will notice improved growth in the temple and nape. I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff does tingle on the scalp, but that&#x27;s about all it did in my hair.  Will not be purchasing again.  No visible hair growth at all.  Will be trying castor oil next.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  My edges were nearly bald after getting box braids. They grew back after using this product twice a day consistently for three months straight</li>
            <li> I thought this product was working because of the tingling, but I was WRONG! After using half of the jar, my hair was broken and damaged and my scalp was scaling and flaking. I will NEVER purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my edges for a little over a month and I must say it does wonders for my edges the hair is coming in nicely not as fast as I wanted but I&#x27;m not going to stop using it because I can see results....</li>
            <li> I really wish that I could be the kind of person who could religiously apply this twice daily for 30 days. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see that ever happening, so I will never know if this product really works. Not only am I too lazy to apply as directed, even if I did, I would be walking around looking like a grease head. Also, I read other reviews about the overpowering scent of this product, and let me tell you - they aren&#x27;t kidding! On one hand the scent is kind of nice, but on the other hand, I really couldn&#x27;t stand it! And it&#x27;s not something that wears off either. When someone finds a real miracle cure for my thinning hair that doesn&#x27;t require twice daily applications - please let me know!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I honestly believe in the maxim \\&quot; to each his own\\&quot;.  In this scenario, that translates into, each person can have a different experience with the same product.  For this reason, I am not a shout it from the rooftop, encourage others to use what I use type of person.  I just want to speak truth about my experience.  This product truly worked for me.  I have be losing hair around my temple due to tight braids for many years and after three weeks of use I can see \\&quot;re-growth\\&quot;.  I have used other products with minimal results, but this truly worked, so much so that I now only use Dr. Miracles&#x27; products on my hair and the results are truly amazing for me personally.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT LAST WEEK FOR 2 DAYS. ON THE THIRD DAY THE BURNING ITCHING  WOKE ME FROM MY SLEEP.   EVERYTHING GOT WORST FROM THEN ON. THE NEXT MORNING MY FACE STARTED TO SWELL UNDER MY EYES.   I WAS FORCED TO SEE MY DOCTORS FOR MEDICATION TO STOP THE SWELLING. I WAS ARFRAID IT  WOULD TAKE MY VISION AWAY.  SO BE VERY CAREFUL AND AVOID THIS STUFF.  SCARY</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 and 1/2 days. by the third day my scalp went from tingling to burning !!!! I think i may have had an allergic reaction to it. So much for growing my temple it caused more hair to fall out :( Very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;the morning after i had finally washed this crap out my hair i woke up with my temple area covered in scabs all over!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> I would not suggest any one buy this product! I put it on my hair on Sunday night and by Monday it had completely burned my edges. My scalps is really liquidly, which is like puss, which is also causing crusting!! This is a product that should be completely taken off the market. Shea moisture Black Jamacian Castor Oil edge restore formula is 100 times better. I now have to go back to what I know and use my Shea moisture products. Crazy thing is I never use this product I just decided to put a little on, and when I say a little I do mean a little &amp; it caused more damage than anything!!! Now I&#x27;m stuck medicating my temple and edges, when just two days ago there wasn&#x27;t even a problem! I&#x27;m definetly throwing this s*** in the trash!</li>
            <li> I used it for ONE DAY and by the second evening I had started forming blisters all round my hair. by the third day my scalp was burning with yellowish stuff running down from the blisters !!!! I had a bad allergic reaction to it. Very annoyed to have hoped to improve on my hair line only to lose the little I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE CAREFUL AS WE DO NOT KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THESE PRODUCTS.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> Great buy and product. Second purchase, it works!</li>
            <li> Helped to restore my edges ( I thought they we&#x27;re permanently lost) and replaced my edge control. Will help slick down soft hair</li>
            <li> Great for itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Very good product. I had used it in the past and got great results, so when I decided to grow my hair and take a break from extensions I knew this would be the product that repairs my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Caused skin around hairline to turn red and flake off. I am allergic to it. Can&#x27;t use. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad because I liked it at first</li>
            <li> I like this product it works well for me, my hair was thinning and falling but I use this once a week and it seems to have stopped.</li>
            <li> From being a dancer all my life and having my hair always in a super tight ponytail or bun, my hairline suffered. I also have a patch of albino hair that I used to hate growing up so I would cut those hairs super short so now that area has even less hair than the other side. This was the first product I used and it was alright. VERY GREASY! I was not able to put this in my hair unless I planned on washing my hair the next morning. I found another product I use that I am able to put in my hair and go out right after.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits yet, but there aren&#x27;t any negative drawbacks. It&#x27;s not an offensive tingle, but the smell is a little strong. Wish this company was still black-owned though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the Jamaican Black Castor Oil/Rasta Mango &amp; Lime mentholated grow spray, it feels way better and is easier to work into scalp if you have braids.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the product I did my research and found many favorable reviews. I did read some reviews that it either didn&#x27;t work or results were slow. On You tube, I found a young woman who used Dr. Miracle and it took her hair out in spots all over her head. I submitted an order for this product as a backup for the one I found locally. I followed the directions of applying and massaging 2 times each day to a thinning area on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;On day 4 I touched the area and it was tender to the touch when I took a closer look a dime size of my thinning hair was &#x27;gone&#x27;. I immediately shampooed and deep conditioned my hair.  I&#x27;m praying that the hair will grow back in. I have healthy natural hair other than the thinning crown area. What a mistake I made in my purchase. I have thrown both jars away and suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li> This made my hair very stiff and broke off my hair- I have low porosity 4c hair. I stopped taking it awhile to see if it was the product and applied it again, and broke off again when I used it. NEVER AGAIN. Will try Profectiv Root Recovery Temple Moisterant next time.</li>
            <li> It seems heavily medicated, but Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Temple and Nape Gro Balm is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!  I look at my hair line now and back when I started and there is a huge difference. It&#x27;s not making it grow as fast as I&#x27;d like (I want 25 inches of hair in 2 weeks lol) but it does work. My hair line was receeding and it&#x27;s coming forward. Every thing else didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m really happy someone recommended I try this. (I have natural hair/no chemicals. My hair type is 3C.)</li>
            <li> This product caused me to break out in the areas where I would place it. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Didn&#x27;t notice any effects, probably since I didn&#x27;t give it a chance. It kind of irritated my skin after the third day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 27 days now, and nothing out of the ordinary. I get the tingling sensation, but I feel like thats all I get. I dont recommend it. I use it 2 times a day, and massage it into my scalp for 5 minutes. I was to throw it away but im not gonna do that becuase thats $7.99 in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had thinning around my edges.  I tried many other products with no success.  I&#x27;ve only been using this it for about a week and a half and already I see results. There is a slight tingle sensation but it goes away, I use it twice a day morning and night and I sleep with a silk scarf at night. I will continue to use it for a least a month. If I see significant improvement I will repurchase this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My edges are very think &amp; full now&#x27;</li>
            <li> First it is difficult for me to give a perfect score on anything coz I am so critical. But after getting my last child, my hair had practically fallen off from the temple and nape of my head because of perms and i guess breastfeeding. I was losing hair so much i did not know what to do.  So someone suggested that I try Dr Miracle, and so i did, what did i have to lose after all i had lost everything.  Voila! it been two months of applying the cream once a day in the night( not as regularly as a postman) and yet i have a full head of hair now. The hair is thick and strong around my head.  So i decided why not use it on the whole head, and yes it had the same effect. Growth and growth and better quality hair.    So now I am looking to buy the whole range and why not, since I have seen the results of one product line.    I will add my reviews after 2 months. Believe me, this is it for those who had given up on the stubborn areas with no growth.    One day I will get my pictures online and maybe that will be a better demo</li>
            <li> great product, seeing results after 60 days, 2nd purchase</li>
            <li> I noticed that my edges and baby hairs started to this out upon using this. You&#x27;re better off using castor oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am a person who loves to try products that are affordable and for my target issues, just to get results and share.  This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a month now as an all over grease and special attentions to my nape and temple.  My hair has increased and strengthened overall, especially on the side that was noticeably thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try one jar, and you will make it a staple of your haircare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fyi, I have 4b/c hair.</li>
            <li> I could feel the balm penetrating my temple.</li>
            <li> After one month of use I noticed that my hairline has begun to thicken and fill in! I have already purchased a second jar for month two!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me about it. I love the product. Would recommend to many friends with simular hair. Thanks.</li>
            <li> this balm stinks. I tried to use it 1 time and the smell is so strong like medicine made of some kind of herbs . I made my stomach hurt</li>
            <li> I absolutely loveee this product I use it twice a day especially after I wash my hair I can feel an amazing tingle it has thickened my edges SIGNIFICANTLY although one side more than the other I honestly believe this was made for AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR 😍😍😀😄☺️</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast just hope it works for my edges</li>
            <li> This product really works! being someone that frequently gets braids i tend to lose mt edges often. This product always helps for my hairline to grow back in., I love it .</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product upon recommendation from a friend.  She says it works very well for her.  I admit that I forget to use it twice daily most of the time.  Therefore, I&#x27;m not yet it a position to properly rate it.</li>
            <li> do not like this product, it smells, I couldnt use it for the simple fact it smells and I work closely with people and affraid they would smell it in my hair, it gets all over the pillow even though I wear a scarf, sorry but I hate it so I didnt get the chance to see if it works because I couldnt stand it more than 5 minutes I would wash it off.</li>
            <li> Price was great... Product worked fast; I could tell a difference in two or three weeks, love it!&lt;br /&gt;I am now using it throughout my whole scalp.</li>
            <li> I literally used this for years on my edges and no growth had came i waited and waited to see my edges were still bald . this is too strong for a all ready damaged scalp/hair follicles ...So I tryed tropic isle on amazon i swear i put black castor oil on my edges and in a couple of weeks i had way more new growth than i had in years of dr.miracle .use natural products it works way better than this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair growing in the nape area. It&#x27;s creamy and it tingles with you put it on. The smell is kind of like menthol but goes away after use. I will highly recommend this product to anyone. The seller shipped out fast, arrived on time, and a great shopping experience.</li>
            <li> My temples are my problem area. I always had thinning there since I can remember, probably from relaxers and various styles (sew ins and ponytails). I bought this product after trying rogaine briefly, and I have used half a jar. I rarely put it on 2x daily as the box says more like once a day when I brush and style my hair.I&#x27;m a skeptic to start with so I wasnt really expecting results but I have noticed my problem area seem a little less thin. As far as the smell it&#x27;s not extremely strong or unbearable and it&#x27;s not a bad scent.  Some have said they&#x27;ve had painful rashes and pustules... I have had none. The consistency is similar to Edge Control when you spread it on, but afterwards it will melt. So be careful not to spread too much on or you will be wiping your forehead all day. The formula is a bit greasy but doesn&#x27;t bother me, I actually find it to be a good thing as it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized. This and some organic Shea butter conditioner is all I use in my hair now they are my go to products. Overall good experience and I will be buying another jar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this stuff to work, but it has! Even in places other than my temples. Just goes to show that sometimes the old tried and true remedies are best.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it right after I wash my hair around my hair line and nape area. I love the tingling sensation and how soft it makes my hair. I definitely recommend that you try it!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me except made my hair greasy.  The smell is not really bad but smells like medicine or muscle rub.  You definitely don&#x27;t want to be around others smelling like methol!!  I truly believe this product is all hype.</li>
            <li> I had to find more of Dr. Miracles products.  Which I just ordered.  I can hardly wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product but the wheat strengthen version for about 4 weeks.  I have seen amazing results. At first I did not want to believe it was the grease.  But it was.  I also take hairfinity pills. So the growth is looking good so far.  I hope by the end of month 3 it will be fully back.  Yes to Dr. miracle Temple &amp; Nape. It works 100% for Me...</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, I was very scared to try this product but being the person that I am, I decided to try it because every person is different. I bought all of the Dr. Miracle products and I must say, I love it! It makes my hair feel soft and light. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. I just purchased it so I will write again when I actually stay to see growth!</li>
            <li> I started to see results on day two! I would definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Yea! My hair is growing back! I did not think I would get my hair back. I will be buying some more .</li>
            <li> just got it in the mail yesterday i started putting iot around my scalp i feel the tingling already lets see how my hair looks in 1mth</li>
            <li> My hair is growing.  I began treatment in April.  I followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;.  Two times a day for 30 days.  I noticed my hair was no longer falling out after 30 days.  I didn&#x27;t see growth at the temple and nape after 30 days however.  I continued for another month.  I actually started to feel my nape area becoming more dense with hair.  It has been 3 months since I began using the balm.  My friends and even my beautician are noticing my growth.  I understand that for some people, for whatever reason, this product does not work for them. I must say I am so glad I finally found something to help me with my hair lost.</li>
            <li> I developed a raised &amp; angry rash around my edges, shortly after using. It burned like crazy for about 2 weeks--after no longer using (I suffered)! After the rash finally calmed down, my edges literally burned, leaving the skin where my edges are 3 shades darker than my skin tone to this day (7 months later). I&#x27;m using Jamaican black castor oil now in hopes of my edges growing back in. I wish I could give this product SEVERAL negative stars.</li>
            <li> I had lost  my hair  in the front a few years ago.I try one of of the temple and nape.My hair has  grew back.The some is long and some short,The front what fell out.I am glad I got most of my back,I wish it was all even</li>
            <li> Two words: Heaven Sent! I was terrified after taking out braids to notice that I my edges were severely damaged. A friend recommended this product and it saved my hair. I usually don&#x27;t notice progress from hair products but this one was shocking. My edges were noticeably thicker! Miracle is the perfect word to describe this product.</li>
            <li> It works great but I don&#x27;t recommend using it with braids your braids WILL slip out</li>
            <li> This is my first go at this product...I like it.  I will continue to use it and give my final review later.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd container I purchased.  I guess this was the original formula, so the smell was pretty yucky.  The smell on the newer containers isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s nothing like this.  I wish I would have known this was the older formula.  I would have passed.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.  I&#x27;ve been using on my 3 year daughter for 3 months trying to grow her edges to the same length as her hair.  It&#x27;s growing, slowly, but I do see improvement.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much change.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Temple &amp; Nape Balm actually burned my edges as if I had left relaxer in my hair.  I wanted to like this product however, after applying just one time, the very next day I experienced burning and itching and by the next day, I had scabs in my hairline.  Please be careful with this product.  I don&#x27;t know the specific ingredients but I do know for a fact that it burns.  Now the hair that I was trying to regrow has totally gone bald as a result of using this product for only two separate occasions.</li>
            <li> Not too fond of the smell, but it helps to grow the hair.  The old formula is creamier and less greasy than the new formula, and it feels like its working immediately into the hair follicles (tingling sensation).</li>
            <li> NOTICED A DIFFERENCE RIGHT A WAY.  HAVE BEEN USING IT ON MY FRIENDS AND THEY LIKE IT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.  YOU NEED ONLY A LITTLE AND IT GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
