            <li>Good results.</li>
            <li>I have very fair light lashes even when I apply mascara</li>
            <li>This product however, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with!</li>
            <li>Amazing results?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably used every eyelash enhancer available, but this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>I saw improvement within the first month and my lashes are now better than ever!!</li>
            <li>The lash growth was a plus for me, but more helped with the irritation without a reaction.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look great with these product, it really Works.</li>
            <li>I also put Vitamin E stick on them(over top the SpeedLash) at night time.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are now looking dramatically better.</li>
            <li>Works great, lashes are visibly thicker in about a week, can&#x27;t say much for length in my case but definitely glad to see more fullness in my lashes</li>
            <li>The results haven&#x27;t been that outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>This product is safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but Speedlash is the best money spent no doubt.</li>
            <li>I love it because is not expensive and it works.</li>
            <li>I bought this product early 2014, after many tubes, I still love it.  </li>
            <li>The results are good enough for my liking.</li>
            <li>Many of my natural lashes fell out and the rest were damaged.</li>
            <li>I definitely notice more lashes and I haven&#x27;t worn mascara since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I am still on the first tube</li>
            <li>I read some positive reviews on the website for Speed Lash</li>
            <li>I have a friend who has glaucoma and is prescribed a liquid that resulted in very lush lashes, but of course she has to be prescribed it, and I do not think having glaucoma would be worth it.</li>
            <li>This was much more then I expected.  </li>
            <li>but this product did work, and work well, very well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in thickness though.</li>
            <li>It is works really fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving Speedlash a try and you will see longer lashes too!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much eye irritation or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>and I really think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>The cost was more than I wanted to pay if I could find something comparable for less.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed more lashes and they look a little longer.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Speedlash because I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and was really hoping I would see some &amp;#34;amazing results&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>the results begin to look like at 15 days but worth it, now my lashes are big and bushy.</li>
            <li>Other products I had allergic reactions to many similar (but chemical) products</li>
            <li>I will never be young again</li>
            <li>In all fairness, though, I may be too old for it to work well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 72 years old and my lashes are longer now than they were when I was a teenager since I started using Speed Lash.</li>
            <li>I use Speedlash Eyelash Growth along with Dive Stuff eyelash conditioner and although I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a month if seems that my lashes are getting longer and thicker and not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>I have used Speedlash every night &amp; day for 4 weeks now and see no difference so far.  </li>
            <li>If I was not so lazy to apply it daily, I think it would work better)</li>

            <li> I bought this product early 2014, after many tubes, I still love it.  Due to issues with dry eyes and allergies my lashes were thin esp during winter months.  This was much more then I expected.  Other products I had allergic reactions to many similar (but chemical) products, I almost gave up and did as the Dr said, pill drugs.  The antibiotics and steroid drops they prescribed did nothing to help the redness and esp the dry eyes ($600+ spent on Dr for no relief), my eyes were red, dry and irritated.  The lash growth was a plus for me, but more helped with the irritation without a reaction.  Often products won&#x27;t continue to work, this one has.  I will never be young again but this product did work, and work well, very well.  Amazing results? I will buy again and again. Overall, it helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> It did make my lashes a bit longer . Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in thickness though.</li>
            <li> My lashes look great with these product, it really Works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write a lot of reviews but I have to say this is the best eyelash growth serum I have used. I made the mistake of trying false eyelashes (which I didn&#x27;t need but did for fun) at the age of 48. It was an awful experience and the glue they used ruined my natural lashes. Many of my natural lashes fell out and the rest were damaged. I was horrified!! I tried several different growth serums including Elizabeth Arden which was about $120.00 per tube to no avail. I then bought Speedlash,  which I was skeptical about initially but tried anyway. I saw improvement within the first month and my lashes are now better than ever!! I have had several folks ask me if they are real or false which is a testament to this product. I use it twice per day everyday and will never be without it from now on. I also put Vitamin E stick on them(over top the SpeedLash) at night time.  I use the Vitamin E tube that looks like chapstick from Walmart that costs $2.99 per tube. I only use the Vit E at night because it is a little greasy. I would not use anything else but these 2 products again. I am a VERY pleased customer!!</li>
            <li> I had been using Latisse for a year with remarkable result. The cost was more than I wanted to pay if I could find something comparable for less. I read some positive reviews on the website for Speed Lash so I thought I would try it. It not only did nothing for my lashes it irritated my eyes. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Ive been using it for only a week now and I already see results! I had been looking for an eye lash grower for a while now, and they all seem to either be unsafe or ridiculously expensive. This product however, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with! They have my business and will continue to have it.</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thinning for years. This product is safe and easy to use. I am seeing a change.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is works really fast. I have longer, thicker lashes every had before. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This product works, but do not expect the lashes in the picture. I am happy with the product because it is organic. The results are good enough for my liking. I have a friend who has glaucoma and is prescribed a liquid that resulted in very lush lashes, but of course she has to be prescribed it, and I do not think having glaucoma would be worth it. Therefore I am happy with the results I am getting and would recommend Speedlash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luvtravel</li>
            <li> After 30 days of use I can see my lashes getting fuller, I can&#x27;t wait until they start to grow. I would buy again</li>
            <li> I had been wearing eyelash extensions for about 9 mos and recently decided to have them removed.  After the removal I basically had little eyelash nubbins.  Been using this product for about a week and my eyelashes are now looking dramatically better. I will post another update in 6 weeks...</li>
            <li> Waste of $. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for about a month now &amp; have not noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> I love it because is not expensive and it works. I highly recommend it. the results begin to look like at 15 days but worth it, now my lashes are big and bushy.</li>
            <li> Product does not work.  Waste of money.  Lilash is the best products</li>
            <li> Works great, lashes are visibly thicker in about a week, can&#x27;t say much for length in my case but definitely glad to see more fullness in my lashes</li>
            <li> The results haven&#x27;t been that outstanding.  I&#x27;ve been faithful in applications, and there may be some extra growth, but it is hard to tell.  In all fairness, though, I may be too old for it to work well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy, waste of time and money.... does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used every eyelash enhancer available, but this one is amazing! I&#x27;m 72 years old and my lashes are longer now than they were when I was a teenager since I started using Speed Lash. It took about three months of dedicated use.  They actually brush against my sunglasses.  This definitely works!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!!  I have used Latisse but Speedlash is the best money spent no doubt. The results are the same with longer lashes and for a lot less compared to expensive Latisse. I highly recommend giving Speedlash a try and you will see longer lashes too!</li>
            <li> We will see how good it is.</li>
            <li> loved, and continue buying chefgou in record time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not sure what to expect. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I do think it&#x27;s starting to work. I&#x27;ve noticed more lashes and they look a little longer. A few years ago I got individual lash extensions and they ripped off some of my natural lashes during removal. My lashes have never been the same since then. I think this product may help! Glad I tried it. I haven&#x27;t noticed much eye irritation or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/15/14&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I really think it&#x27;s working. I definitely notice more lashes and I haven&#x27;t worn mascara since I started using it. I used some tonight and I see the difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see my lashes in another month.</li>
            <li> Good results. I have very fair light lashes even when I apply mascara they are hard to see. After using speed lash my lashes look&lt;br /&gt;much longer and fuller with mascara application. I am still on the first tube so I am hopeful that my lashes will continue to flourish.</li>
            <li> I use Speedlash Eyelash Growth along with Dive Stuff eyelash conditioner and although I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a month if seems that my lashes are getting longer and thicker and not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to notice results but once you do it seems like they grow like weeds, very impressed. Happy with this product</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. Will not recommend at all. Actually lost lashes rather making it grow. Do not purchase it</li>
            <li> No visible effect after 1 month.  Irritated eyes</li>
            <li> Hi, I bought the product since a month and a half ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have five weeks using the product in the manner as is shown in the box. In the morning and at night sacredly. But the product DOESN&#x60;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;I did not write before, still waiting for the product to work, but the lashes do not grow or thicken, nothing. The product DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> I have used Speedlash every night &amp; day for 4 weeks now and see no difference so far.  I decided to try Speedlash because I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and was really hoping I would see some &amp;#34;amazing results&amp;#34;.  I will continue to use it til it&#x27;s gone as I know a lot of these formulas require several weeks usage before results are seen and I don&#x27;t want to stop just short of seeing some &amp;#34;amazing results&amp;#34; - I just hope I&#x27;m not wasting my time (and $) when I could be trying another brand/formula that would produce results.</li>
