            <li>more questions?</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and felt better after using this product.</li>
            <li>They smell great and leave me feeling really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>They do leave skin feeling soft and clean, with a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They wipe sweat away and leave a nice cool invisible powder on your skin.</li>
            <li>Was wonderful after my long runs!</li>
            <li>Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths are excellent cloths for a quick cleanup.  </li>
            <li>These are great for a lunch time workout and not being able to shower before I go back to my desk.</li>
            <li>They are great to have on days when it is especially hot and humid - it used it on my arms, my face, on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Too strong irritated my underarm.</li>

            <li>Anyways great product would definitely recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>Lightly scented so you can also apply perfume if you like.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;light powder\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool enough to refresh &amp; does have a light pleasant smell - easy to carry in a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>The contents really do feel refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been SO HOT here--anything helps!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;fresh spring\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great and quick service for a great product that is so difficult to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>This product is great for a little refresher!</li>
            <li>The blue packaging is our favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I know they cost more on a regular basis</li>
            <li>They fit well into small spaces, such as a pocket of your gym bag, so they are great for on the go freshening up.</li>
            <li>skin soft and clean</li>
            <li>They really do feel cool, however they have a strong scent and are much less economical than baby wipes.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than they are on here</li>
            <li>Speaking from a value standpoint, I believe buying a package of baby wipes, which are not only much larger and come with many more to a package, will serve the very same need at a  much lower price</li>
            <li>These cloths are lightly scented and apparently have just a touch of powder in them which leaves me feeling cool and dry.</li>
            <li>They are big enough to get the job done and in my opinion far better than baby wipes !</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t buy them on amazon, I found them at a local store much cheaper.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;soft clean\\&quot; - my favorite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I thought they worked good, but not sure it was any different than using a baby wipe or any other &amp;#34;freshening&amp;#34; wipe that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The price per cloth is pretty high, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again from Amazon.</li>

            <li> especially during/after a long flight.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a little larger, they are about the same size as facial cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li> Each cloth is 3.9&amp;#34; by 5.9&amp;#34; (9.9 x 14.9cm) according to the package and the package recommends using them within 45 days of purchase (probably so they don&#x27;t dry out).</li>
            <li> 4 by 6 inches, not too wet or too dry -</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended if you just want to splurge a little and have these on hand.</li>
            <li> I think they will dry out very quickly if not used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they were larger.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the cloths are a bit small.</li>
            <li> * Avoid contact with eyes, irritated or broken skin, and sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> basically it breaks down to this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need a little refresher then these will do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that residue feeling that usually comes with baby wipes.  </li>
            <li> well in a small purse/</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the sheets are rather small but they get the job done</li>
            <li> I thought I could get drunk with this wipe!</li>

            <li> We always have this in our carry-on when we travel.  Wonderful way to freshen up while traveling... especially during/after a long flight.  The blue packaging is our favorite scent.</li>

            <li> These are great, they leave skin feeling smooth and clean. They are wonderful after a workout as they leave me feeling fresh.

            <li> These are most definitely refreshing, as they claim to be. They fit well into small spaces, such as a pocket of your gym bag, so they are great for on the go freshening up. They do leave skin feeling soft and clean, with a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I could see were the smallish size of the sheets, and that they only come 10 to a package. Speaking from a value standpoint, I believe buying a package of baby wipes, which are not only much larger and come with many more to a package, will serve the very same need at a  much lower price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, these are good for being on the go, but so could a stack of baby wipes in a ziploc sandwich bag. It&#x27;s for that reason that I gave them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I had read about these online - several beauty blogs were talking about them.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores (where I have read they are cheaper than on Amazon) so I bit the bullet and ordered them.  I thought they worked good, but not sure it was any different than using a baby wipe or any other &amp;#34;freshening&amp;#34; wipe that I have tried.  The price per cloth is pretty high, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick freshening up during the day or after a workout!  Smells and feels good too.</li>
            <li> I love this they are nice on hot days when you need to quickly freshen up a keep this inmy purse at all times.  They make you smell so good after you use them.</li>
            <li> Love love these cooling cloths!  They are great to have on days when it is especially hot and humid - it used it on my arms, my face, on the back of my neck.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for sure!!  I did receive a discount on these in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> Bought these at Walgreens on sale. They were 1.99! Much cheaper than they are on here I know they cost more on a regular basis but  when its on sale for 1.99 it&#x27;s unbeatable !&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up because I work at a restaurant where I am constantly sweating and end up smelling like seafood after my shift. They are big enough to get the job done and in my opinion far better than baby wipes ! I would never use baby wipes but no one needs to shower with these baby towels its just to freshen up lol.. Anyways great product would definitely recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Great and quick service for a great product that is so difficult to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> They really do feel cool, however they have a strong scent and are much less economical than baby wipes.</li>
            <li> Like baby wipes for adults. 4 by 6 inches, not too wet or too dry - just right. Lightly scented so you can also apply perfume if you like. Perfect if you want to freshen up if heading straight from the office to dinner out. Perfect after a brisk walk at lunch and heading back into the office. Not a substitute for a shower after a gym workout. The contents really do feel refreshing but I am not a chemist so don&#x27;t know which ingredient gives that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;available in 3 scents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESTORE \\&quot;light powder\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENLIVEN \\&quot;fresh spring\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INVIGORATE \\&quot;soft clean\\&quot; - my favorite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have more questions? I found a dozen videos on YouTube with the search \\&quot;Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Avoid contact with eyes, irritated or broken skin, and sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** none of the Ban® products have been tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This product is great for a little refresher! I sweat a lot and felt better after using this product. Definitely recommended if you just want to splurge a little and have these on hand.</li>
            <li> It has a vodka smell. Alcohol Too strong irritated my underarm. I thought I could get drunk with this wipe!</li>
            <li> These work well. If you need a little refresher then these will do the job. They wipe sweat away and leave a nice cool invisible powder on your skin. The only down side is the cloths are a bit small. With only 10 to a package, you will probably use 2-3 for an upper body and thigh wipe.</li>
            <li> These cooling body cloths are very refreshing.  Great to use any time.  I wish they were a little larger, they are about the same size as facial cleansing cloths.  Also I wish theycame in a resealable package.  I think they will dry out very quickly if not used on a regular basis.  They do the trick though.  They have a very light scent, not too perfumey.  I would recommend.</li>
