            <li>I love how this helps to define and hold my curls without the crunch.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using Eco-styler gel.</li>

            <li>Dries very quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>the price value my natural hair never has to rob my wallet love is what this is lol</li>
            <li>This is a great natural hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed it works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Great definition, zero frizz, touchably soft hair</li>
            <li>and I get tons of compliments on the full, healthy look.  </li>
            <li>I use this gel as part of the CG method for my 4C hair and it is hands down, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and they look fine, but I prefer to wash n</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this with light weight product underneath it.</li>
            <li>Makes my kinky hair feel smooth like butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great 2nd,</li>
            <li>for because it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is very versatile, you can leave your hair in spirals or scrunch it for a more textured look.  </li>

            <li>once it gets on your hair it turns watery (in a good way), the smell does not linger which I personally wish it did.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of odd, but a nice gel.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super flaky.</li>
            <li>Works very well as a light weight conditioner.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite products every invented for natural hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been successful with the twist outs and other ways to manipulate my 2 years of new growth.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind frizz, and this defines my curls really well!</li>
            <li>I really like this product in my hair!</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that has delivered PHENOMENAL results.</li>
            <li>For my hair, I most definitely need to use as instructed.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have found this curling gel first because I would have never bought anything else.  </li>
            <li>So glad I finally tried it!</li>
            <li>It also absorbed easily with no flaking or white build-up</li>
            <li>and they are unique compared to what is used in most traditional natural hair care products.</li>
            <li>It does not play nicely with other products.</li>
            <li>i also would refresh with my favorite oil like avocado and mist my hair with water just because my hair is supper dry</li>
            <li>This product really re-texturized my hair and made it super soft.  </li>
            <li>This curl maker really helps define my curls.  </li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients</li>
            <li>I like that they have explored alternative ingredients that are very moisturizing for the hair.</li>
            <li>You can find this at Target and Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really make my curls curler</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I put to much product in my hair or what happened.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have for any 4c who wants a real wash and go.  </li>
            <li>I dpnt really recommend it</li>
            <li>It does not have much hold, but I can find a hundred products that provide hold.  </li>
            <li>It elongates my curls a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Wonderful small but too heavy for my curls.</li>
            <li>and i like a certain look for other just as is fine and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I usually like a little more hold from my curl products, but I&#x27;d sacrifice a little of the hold for incredible look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get more than 2 - 3 days worth of a style, but I have a hard time keeping my hands out of my hair!  </li>
            <li>I am just commenting to let everyone know that this product contains the new formula, as there is no glycerin and wheat protein.</li>
            <li>I have read elsewhere that this is a new formulation</li>
            <li>This takes my hair to a new level.  </li>
            <li>Makes my natural curls pop!</li>
            <li>I really like the entire line and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a life long customer ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight with a medium hold, I have 3b/3c coarse and mid back length hair.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m not used to it feeling so soft</li>
            <li>The price was high and the results low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Natural girl and have tried over 25 different products for Natural hair</li>
            <li>I usually use products with a strong hold and last about 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s much better options out there that cost less than half what this product cost.</li>
            <li>, perhaps that is why some older reviewers had such a different experience with it?</li>
            <li>--I use it on very wet hair that is full of conditioner from a different product line and haven&#x27;t had any of the issues some other people have described.</li>
            <li>My hair is totally white and when I got a perm recently (first one In years) it seemed as dry as dead pasture grass.&lt;br /&gt;After putting this on my wet hair and really working it through; it was such a surprize</li>

            <li> If I didn&#x27;t mind my clothes being wet, I&#x27;d let it completely air dry, but I need some of the water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t get hard but works wonders with a hard brush and water.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry, cause white flakes all over yuck .</li>
            <li> Not only was my hair frizzy, but it was bone desert DRY!</li>
            <li> have MAJOR shrinkage, but on day one if I use the dryer, my elongated, weighted down coils are AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It Helps my curls to stay in place all day long.</li>
            <li> when my hair dried it seemed so soft</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be trying other products from there line.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely was not soft hair as my hair usually is.  </li>
            <li> while my hair is sopping wet.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me on semi-wet hair, I must apply on WET hair</li>
            <li> i use this alone on wet hair in sections I apply so</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way for defining my 3c curls.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way,</li>
            <li> - shiny, well defined coils - even the other part of Mother Africa in the back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not satisfied please a lot of white stuff in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> so if one product doesn&#x27;t work you should try some of the other products from their line just to see.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I have 4B/4C hair - 4B around my edges and 4C from crown down to the bottom row which is 4B.  </li>
            <li> Might try again with just a little of the product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I mean so dry that my hair literally started to break!</li>
            <li> It was so sticky and heavy, and did nothing for my 3:/ curls.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Probably a bit heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually I shop at sally because they allow you to return hair products if you didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they&#x27;re storing it over there</li>
            <li> When it dries, it leaves my hair full of flakes and gives horrible, uneven curl definition.</li>
            <li> batch I got from Amazon was too thick for the pump though.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, this product will either live out the rest of its life sitting on my shelf, or at the bottom of the nearest dumpster. :(</li>
            <li> I tried the new formula of this product &amp; it was terrible!</li>
            <li> I bought this product it made my hair so hard I was afraid to put my hands in my hair</li>
            <li> Made my hair STICKY and left a bad residue on my hair, will not purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but my cousin assured me I&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li> Disappointment...</li>
            <li> This product flakes which I dislike but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> A product this expensive shouldn&#x27;t be this horrible.</li>
            <li> It is something I would hate to be without.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Each time it was so terrible, I ended up washing it out of my hair.</li>

            <li> I am just commenting to let everyone know that this product contains the new formula, as there is no glycerin and wheat protein. There is also the addition of seaweed which is supposed to be good for hair growth. I can&#x27;t wait to try out this product :)</li>
            <li> The best product for natural hair that I have used!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair curl on contact.  No sticky, flaky residue.  Nice shine.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way for defining my 3c curls. But be warned, as this does not actually eliminate my frizz. But I don&#x27;t mind frizz, and this defines my curls really well! Highly recommended. I use this in conjunction with my kinky curly knot today leave in conditioner. Works very well as a light weight conditioner. I would recommend using this with light weight product underneath it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product in my hair! I was told it would be great, and I agree!</li>
            <li> Made my hair STICKY and left a bad residue on my hair, will not purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful small but too heavy for my curls.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but my cousin assured me I&#x27;d like it.  I have 4B/4C hair - 4B around my edges and 4C from crown down to the bottom row which is 4B.  Sometimes my 4C hair seems like 4G!  I haven&#x27;t been successful with the twist outs and other ways to manipulate my 2 years of new growth.  So I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;wash &#x27;n go&amp;#34; girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another line&#x27;s leave-in then add Almond Jai at my roots and top with use the Curl Maker B4 I get out the shower while my hair is sopping wet. When I get out, I use my Afro Master to comb through, de-tangle and distribute the product through my hair.  Then I finger comb and massage my hair.  Give a good shake and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes to stop the dripping.  Sounds like a lot, but the most time is the 15 min under the dryer.  If I didn&#x27;t mind my clothes being wet, I&#x27;d let it completely air dry, but I need some of the water out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result - shiny, well defined coils - even the other part of Mother Africa in the back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another gel (that didn&#x27;t work well in my hair by itself) with the Camille Rose Curl Love Milk and water for days 2-4.  I could go longer, but my hair frizzes and I don&#x27;t like it frizzy - although I see others wear it that way and they look fine, but I prefer to wash n go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have MAJOR shrinkage, but on day one if I use the dryer, my elongated, weighted down coils are AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product in May and I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle, so I&#x27;m going through it faster than some, but it&#x27;s either this or back to the creamy crack!</li>
            <li> Definition! Amazing hold! I found my go to product for any style!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural hair gel.  Everything it promises to do on the label, it does!  This is the only product on the market I would ever spend $20+ for because it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Best curl maker! This curl maker really helps define my curls.  I also noticed it works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent, several of my friends loved my hair. They will purchase the product too.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product. It was so sticky and heavy, and did nothing for my 3:/ curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Keeps my hair defined and shiny with no frizz at all! I&#x27;m a Natural girl and have tried over 25 different products for Natural hair and this is the only one that has delivered PHENOMENAL results. I&#x27;m a life long customer ;)</li>
            <li> Makes my kinky hair feel smooth like butter.</li>
            <li> Great curls, but leaves my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> For my hair, I most definitely need to use as instructed. Does not work for me on semi-wet hair, I must apply on WET hair then it works just like it supposed to</li>
            <li> Not satisfied please a lot of white stuff in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my curls nice. Only problem is that the product is so sticky. I don&#x27;t like to put it in my hands. But, it&#x27;s a great curly girl product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It Helps my curls to stay in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of odd, but a nice gel. I probably will not buy another after finishing this bottle, but it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I&#x27;ve only been using for a week but can feel my hair retaining moisture from use. Good stuff and I&#x27;ll buy again. I&#x27;m in the process of growing out chemically relaxed/texturized hair so finding something with moisture that helps the curls come back is key. I still have to do some scrunching but hair is looking MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I LUV this product.  My hair is totally white and when I got a perm recently (first one In years) it seemed as dry as dead pasture grass.&lt;br /&gt;After putting this on my wet hair and really working it through; it was such a surprize when my hair dried it seemed so soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It is something I would hate to be without.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. A staple in my stock pile.</li>
            <li> Best Product ever! Gel works great on 4a/4b/4c hair. It left my hair moist with no flakes. I really like the entire line and highly recommend it. My hair was without frizz with great curl definition. I really like the ingredients and they are unique compared to what is used in most traditional natural hair care products. I like that they have explored alternative ingredients that are very moisturizing for the hair. I have struggled with dryness with my hair for the longest and nothing seemed to hold the moisture especially in the winter months. I think this brand has something for everyone so if one product doesn&#x27;t work you should try some of the other products from their line just to see. But this product seemed to work and I will definitely be trying other products from there line. You can find this at Target and Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make my curls curler</li>
            <li> i like product have tried to get Camille fresher no results</li>
            <li> I love how this helps to define and hold my curls without the crunch.</li>
            <li> Disappointment...My hair was dry. Usually I shop at sally because they allow you to return hair products if you didn&#x27;t like them. The price was high and the results low. My daughter&#x27;s and I tried it and we all have different hair types/textures. It causes dandruff as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product it made my hair so hard I was afraid to put my hands in my hair I thought my hair was going to break, so I immediately wash it out.  I don&#x27;t know if I put to much product in my hair or what happened.  It definitely was not soft hair as my hair usually is.  Might try again with just a little of the product in my hair.</li>
            <li> lovely in hair , loved it  made hair feel.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it seems. Over priced. Makes your hair super flaky. No curl definition. You&#x27;re better off using Eco-styler gel. Did I mention the pump didn&#x27;t work???. Never again.</li>
            <li> I use this gel as part of the CG method for my 4C hair and it is hands down, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my hair moisturized and shiny. I have never had such a soft yet defined wash and go--I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my coils yet the style has lasted for 6 days with minimal frizz.  It also absorbed easily with no flaking or white build-up--I use it on very wet hair that is full of conditioner from a different product line and haven&#x27;t had any of the issues some other people have described. I have read elsewhere that this is a new formulation, perhaps that is why some older reviewers had such a different experience with it? I have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Use it mostly now in place of edge control. I love how it doesn&#x27;t get hard but works wonders with a hard brush and water. However, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a day in my hair.</li>
            <li> The curl definition and softness is unmatched.  This is a must have for any 4c who wants a real wash and go.  It is very versatile, you can leave your hair in spirals or scrunch it for a more textured look.  Wish I would have found this curling gel first because I would have never bought anything else.  I love the fact there is no residue or build up.  A little goes a long way,</li>
            <li> loved it! curl definition was great!</li>
            <li> I tried the new formula of this product &amp; it was terrible! It does not play nicely with other products. It basically coagulates in my hair if there is ANYTHING else in it like leave-in conditioner. So, I can only use it if my hair is completely naked. When it dries, it leaves my hair full of flakes and gives horrible, uneven curl definition. I gave it a chance multiple times using various amounts of the product each time to see if it made a difference. It didn&#x27;t. Each time it was so terrible, I ended up washing it out of my hair. A product this expensive shouldn&#x27;t be this horrible. I would not recommend this product to anyone. There&#x27;s much better options out there that cost less than half what this product cost.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful with other Camille Rose products. Makes my natural curls pop!</li>
            <li> I have 4A/B hair.  This takes my hair to a new level.  My curls come out looking well defined.  I&#x27;m totally in love.  I do use it with a leave in creme conditioner - the curl love moisture milk.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Worth the purchase. This product lasted me about 3 months. It&#x27;s light weight with a medium hold, I have 3b/3c coarse and mid back length hair. I usually use products with a strong hold and last about 5-7 days. This product has a medium hold and last me about 3-4 good days. After that it starts to get frizzy and my hair starts to lose moisture. As I stated I use this every 3-4 for about 3 months so in my opinion this product is worth buying, it is of good quality and you get a good quantity. once it gets on your hair it turns watery (in a good way), the smell does not linger which I personally wish it did. This product flakes which I dislike but not too bad. Dries very quickly which I love. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it!  I love the feel of it on my hair, lots of moisture on my hair.  Awesome products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it alone an in conjunction with the Curl Love leave-in.  This product really re-texturized my hair and made it super soft.  I usually like a little more hold from my curl products, but I&#x27;d sacrifice a little of the hold for incredible look and feel.  I don&#x27;t get more than 2 - 3 days worth of a style, but I have a hard time keeping my hands out of my hair!  I&amp;#34;m not used to it feeling so soft and I get tons of compliments on the full, healthy look.  Curly hair products are so hit or miss for us naturals, but this was a hit for me!  So glad I finally tried it!</li>
            <li> Flaky. I dont know what amount to use. I dpnt really recommend it but it might work for others. To each is own.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry, cause white flakes all over yuck . I had to wash my hair in a public  rest room sink.</li>
            <li> my holy gail for the summer it holds with out making your hair feeling crispy no flakes my type 4 i have all type for coils on my head i use this alone on wet hair in sections I apply so my result can be constant throughout my head i also would refresh with my favorite oil like avocado and mist my hair with water just because my hair is supper dry and i like a certain look for other just as is fine and the newer version i have yet to try because summer hasn&#x27;t some yet but it looks like i cant skip my extra oil because it added but this is my go to for braids out twist outs and texture afro looks i rake it though my hair and use a diffuser i love this this is one of my favorite products every invented for natural hair i love camille rose its is pure honest and results beyond comparison and the price value my natural hair never has to rob my wallet love is what this is lol</li>
            <li> This is brilliant for getting rid of the nastiest frizz, and it never gets gooey or causes my hair to tangle.  It does not have much hold, but I can find a hundred products that provide hold.  Not so with products that actually reign in my frizz.  This gel is perfect for the driest of dry days to the most humid.  A little goes a long way!  It&#x27;s a great 2nd, 3rd day refresher as well.</li>
            <li> Made my hair crunchy and greasy but will give it another try - also the pump does not work...</li>
            <li> Perfect, all time favorite gel. Great definition, zero frizz, touchably soft hair, multi day hold. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batch I got from Amazon was too thick for the pump though. I had to add water. Not sure how they&#x27;re storing it over there but I&#x27;ll go back to buying in-store only</li>
            <li> Ok.  Probably a bit heavy for my hair.  It elongates my curls a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. Not only was my hair frizzy, but it was bone desert DRY! I mean so dry that my hair literally started to break! To sum it up, this product will either live out the rest of its life sitting on my shelf, or at the bottom of the nearest dumpster. :(</li>
