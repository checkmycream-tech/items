            <li>i can make it myself better but its good for washing your hands.</li>

            <li>It goes on like smeary and feels kind of exfoliating, then it dries all...</li>
            <li>but im sure it was good stuff</li>
            <li>Also, my makeup goes on very smoothly after the mask.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>He asked us to order more for him and we did.</li>
            <li>Not that great, really didn&#x27;t do anything for my face</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brand though.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find this on line as I had run out after bringing it back from India.  </li>
            <li>I use this product more as a spot treatment on any pimples that come up</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I watched Dr. Oz and found out about this product.</li>
            <li>I use this neem mask every weekend, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin lovely and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you could see that it had squirted out the top and someone had resealed it.</li>
            <li>Great find thanks to dr.oz</li>
            <li>Neem was no miracle acne treatment, but smell clean and worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>It appeared as though someone had made a mask out of a neem powdered mask (available in most Indian grocery stores) and then filled it in this tube.</li>
            <li>This cleans and leaves your skin feel fresh, clean and smooth!!</li>
            <li>I want to finish a tube first using as directed before I can give an honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>and my skin is just clearing up so quickly!</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, but I sometimes replace it with that cheap Aztec healing clay mask (which you already have</li>
            <li>This may be a good product EXCEPT for the fact that the listing on Amazon does not include the parabens clearly stated on the label.</li>
            <li>People in India have been using neem for many centuries, being aware of its benefits.</li>
            <li>...because it leaves my face amazingly clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but I prefer to use it as a full face mask.</li>
            <li>I have used different kinds but this is really good</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, you just have to get used to the neem smell if you don&#x27;t know what it smells like.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>please be aware that this product is not typical mud mask, its more like a scrub mask and its okay in my opinion nothing to rave about</li>
            <li>Better than many more expensive products; simply the best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference with the very first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for such a low price and easy to put on too.</li>
            <li>This mask visibly reduces appearance of pores, smells great, and is shipped direct from India in a cute little box.  </li>
            <li>will be great for me this winter for my skin dries out a lot , but for now a bit to heavy</li>
            <li>The redness in my sensitive skin used to hang on for months, but seems to mostly fade in just a week with this product.  </li>
            <li>this face cream really works it removes the oils and makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li>I recommend this for everyone (i personally have dry skin and super sensitive and this is doing great)!.</li>
            <li>I dont think it would be as effective for dry skin</li>
            <li>The Purifying neem pack was delivered very fast, the quality is good, same like i bought it in India, but the tube is only 1/3 full</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because the fragrance is quite strong and has a more masculine tone to it.</li>
            <li>have been using this for years, could not get hold of it earlier, makes ur skin clean, i donot know if wud make it blemish free.</li>
            <li>There was barely enough product for more than 5 applications and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my skin smooth and soft after washing it off</li>
            <li>The mask is refreshing and deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>I notice an immediate difference when I use it, makes my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>This was first brought to my attention  by Dr. Oz....</li>
            <li>The actual product is okay, but that&#x27;s unacceptable</li>
            <li>Washing it off leaves my skin absolutely radiant!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone it not too drying!!</li>
            <li>(well, they all claim that, don&#x27;t they?), but it really does!</li>
            <li>After the first two weeks, people at work were commenting on my skin.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a cure for acne, but it helps it for sure.</li>
            <li>nice, cooling and refreshing to my skin, just as I expected came well packaged and overall</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Neem while traveling in India.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this little 50g tube has lasted 6 months for me!</li>
            <li>My pimples did dry up a good bit after just one use without overdying my entire face.</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem to be good, natural and healthy but the size of the product is so small that possibly only two to three uses will be all that one can get out of this size tube.</li>
            <li>This was very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Clay mask really purfies the skin</li>
            <li>It came within days when I wasn&#x27;t even expecting the delivery to be this fast.</li>
            <li>My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>My sister in law really likes it, so there&#x27;s that to be said for it.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped heal my blemished skin.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the ingredient list more carefully, but I didn&#x27;t think Himalaya would put parabens in a product.</li>
            <li>I use this face mask a few times a week when I&#x27;m stressed(which comes out on my face as a breakout) and this clears it up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I love using Neem masks, but this little bottle didn&#x27;t have much in it!</li>
            <li>2 stars is for the small amount of product which i got which was nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s Amazon that should get the low rating for lack of full disclosure.</li>
            <li>The product was fine, as expected.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Some tingling is normal -</li>
            <li>I have oily to normal skin and this mask helps soak up the gunk without drying my face out.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with combination skin.caused tingling sensation which normally doesn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li>It does not dry the skin and you see results from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and look, however it does burn a little once you can get past that youll love it, it tightens face and keeps acne away</li>
            <li>Was listed as NEW, not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The container was not sealed, so there is no way to tell if this is a brand new product.  </li>
            <li>Very rejuvenating to your skin making it soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Be careful when removing the mask and make sure to properly rinse to remove all the product.</li>
            <li>It was interesting, not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li>It was worth how funny I looked while it dried on my skin.</li>
            <li>Feels good, but need to use it in the shower, because it&#x27;s messy  and dark.</li>
            <li>The product was a nice mask but the bottle was half empty when delivered.</li>
            <li>but it helped to clear my face up</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you are sensitive to smells or prone to migraines.</li>
            <li>So far, he has no complaints about the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with monthly acne around my jaw line.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product really works.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after scrubbing and cleaning with it.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to someone who is looking to clear skin in a natural way or use ayurvedic medicine.</li>
            <li>OLD AGE LINES ARE CREEPING IN.</li>
            <li>Good for acne proem skin, very smoothing, gives a cold and relaxed feeling after application on face.</li>
            <li>No other product gives me the clear skin like this one.</li>
            <li>The neem really helps clear out my pores but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t burn unless I use too much or leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li>This product really works fast, after a few times using it I can see the difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that this is a very small container, dries out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have adult acne, this product in combination with eating or drinking antioxidant food products such as teas often, you will put your acne in check like I did.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was getting a bottle that was already used since there was barely any product in it.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works because his acne is gone.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>Lovely dark green color scares anyone peeking in your windows.  </li>
            <li>I usually apply the mask in the morning right before taking a shower and my skin feels extremely soft after.</li>
            <li>I use other neem products and really like them.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out, but it does not seem to be doing anything for my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin and tend to get dry and flaky skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer (</li>
            <li>and I used the whole little bottle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> After the first two weeks, people at work were commenting on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily a cure for acne, but it helps it for sure.</li>
            <li> nice, cooling and refreshing to my skin, just as I expected came well packaged and overall</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Neem while traveling in India.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this little 50g tube has lasted 6 months for me!</li>
            <li> My pimples did dry up a good bit after just one use without overdying my entire face.</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem to be good, natural and healthy but the size of the product is so small that possibly only two to three uses will be all that one can get out of this size tube.</li>
            <li> This was very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Clay mask really purfies the skin</li>
            <li> It came within days when I wasn&#x27;t even expecting the delivery to be this fast.</li>
            <li> My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li> My sister in law really likes it, so there&#x27;s that to be said for it.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped heal my blemished skin.  </li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredient list more carefully, but I didn&#x27;t think Himalaya would put parabens in a product.</li>
            <li> I use this face mask a few times a week when I&#x27;m stressed(which comes out on my face as a breakout) and this clears it up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I love using Neem masks, but this little bottle didn&#x27;t have much in it!</li>
            <li> 2 stars is for the small amount of product which i got which was nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s Amazon that should get the low rating for lack of full disclosure.</li>
            <li> The product was fine, as expected.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Some tingling is normal -</li>
            <li> I have oily to normal skin and this mask helps soak up the gunk without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with combination skin.caused tingling sensation which normally doesn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li> It does not dry the skin and you see results from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and look, however it does burn a little once you can get past that youll love it, it tightens face and keeps acne away</li>
            <li> Was listed as NEW, not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container was not sealed, so there is no way to tell if this is a brand new product.  </li>
            <li> Very rejuvenating to your skin making it soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Be careful when removing the mask and make sure to properly rinse to remove all the product.</li>
            <li> It was interesting, not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It was worth how funny I looked while it dried on my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels good, but need to use it in the shower, because it&#x27;s messy  and dark.</li>
            <li> The product was a nice mask but the bottle was half empty when delivered.</li>
            <li> but it helped to clear my face up</li>
            <li> I do not recommend if you are sensitive to smells or prone to migraines.</li>
            <li> So far, he has no complaints about the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with monthly acne around my jaw line.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product really works.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after scrubbing and cleaning with it.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to someone who is looking to clear skin in a natural way or use ayurvedic medicine.</li>
            <li> OLD AGE LINES ARE CREEPING IN.</li>
            <li> Good for acne proem skin, very smoothing, gives a cold and relaxed feeling after application on face.</li>
            <li> No other product gives me the clear skin like this one.</li>
            <li> The neem really helps clear out my pores but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t burn unless I use too much or leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> This product really works fast, after a few times using it I can see the difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that this is a very small container, dries out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have adult acne, this product in combination with eating or drinking antioxidant food products such as teas often, you will put your acne in check like I did.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was getting a bottle that was already used since there was barely any product in it.</li>
            <li> Apparently it works because his acne is gone.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> Lovely dark green color scares anyone peeking in your windows.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply the mask in the morning right before taking a shower and my skin feels extremely soft after.</li>
            <li> I use other neem products and really like them.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out, but it does not seem to be doing anything for my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin and tend to get dry and flaky skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer (</li>
            <li> and I used the whole little bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to use pharmacy(ex Walgreens) products to treat acne (which usually contain benzoyl peroxide), but with little success.</li>
            <li> I does have a strange smell</li>
            <li> This is not for dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> it really upsets me when i buy something off your site and it turns out to where it no good</li>
            <li> and they are usually visibly smaller and less red the next day.</li>
            <li> But the tube was almost empty when i got it.</li>
            <li> not what i expected.</li>
            <li> very loose and yucky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not what I expected as dependable.</li>
            <li> and I can actually see my pores expanded through the dried clay.</li>
            <li> When it dries you literally see round tiny spots of oil emerging.</li>
            <li> the reason i give it 3 stars is the tube is small not standard mask size about size of a sample or tube of hand lotion</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when I received it and it was dated with 2012 on it..</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;m not the only one who has complained of receiving less than 1/2 of this product in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Use every other day and has helped with oil control!</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly, but was very disappointed when I opened the package and discovered the tube barely even contained 1/3 of the amount of product.  </li>
            <li> The cost should be a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Also it goes on green (like the cap) but dries a little blue-greenish.</li>
            <li> was to harsh on my face</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that delivery was a bit slow!</li>
            <li> It is dark, thick, and earthy and applies on my face well.</li>
            <li> It helps heal my acne without making my face feel raw or my skin peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will stick to using this mask twice a week ( not more than that).</li>
            <li> As for a decrease in acne there has been a small decline in my numbe of outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and is gritty, but I did like to use it here and there.</li>
            <li> I use it no more than once a week.</li>
            <li> My face felt refreshed afterwards and the small zits I had from pms were gone.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure of them anymore.</li>
            <li> I used this once and had to throw it away because the smell was so strong and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Very small tube.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from them for awhile and have never been disappointed by them cutting corners and using inferior ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I used this face mask when I lived overseas and was sad to see that stores in the States didn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> Felt uncomfortable in using.</li>
            <li> When I read the blurb on neem before I ordered the mask, I was skeptical that neem leaves skin glowing</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on weird</li>
            <li> well weird too.</li>
            <li> I started using neem oil at night about a month ago, and it pulls out the impurities like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about anything Neem and Himalayan for a fact.</li>
            <li> It look like poop and smell bad</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> She has really, really bad rosacia, and uses the Neem Face Wash which she loves and this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who takes pictures of products when they arrive??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ordered anything again from this seller.. disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> it looks nasty</li>
            <li> worst of both worlds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seemed like the package was open. Disappointed. Would not recommend our buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon for me to see any visible changes. I want to finish a tube first using as directed before I can give an honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> will be great for me this winter for my skin dries out a lot , but for now a bit to heavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it , don&#x27;t smell good it looks nasty i would not recommend  this to no one . It look like poop and smell bad</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t much different from the face wash - I will only order the Purifying Face wash in the future.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mask. The consistency is lumpy and the smell is overpowering. It appeared as though someone had made a mask out of a neem powdered mask (available in most Indian grocery stores) and then filled it in this tube. There was barely enough product for more than 5 applications and it did nothing for me. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and am really happy with the results. I used to use pharmacy(ex Walgreens) products to treat acne (which usually contain benzoyl peroxide), but with little success. The benzoyl peroxide overdries my skin (skin starts flaking off) without getting rid of the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Neem Facepack as an acne medication and facial mask. It does not dry the skin and you see results from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I used this once and had to throw it away because the smell was so strong and disgusting. I do not recommend if you are sensitive to smells or prone to migraines.</li>
            <li> I use this face mask a few times a week when I&#x27;m stressed(which comes out on my face as a breakout) and this clears it up nicely.  The neem really helps clear out my pores but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> please be aware that this product is not typical mud mask, its more like a scrub mask and its okay in my opinion nothing to rave about but it leaves my skin smooth and soft after washing it off</li>
            <li> Very small tube.  The ingredients seem to be good, natural and healthy but the size of the product is so small that possibly only two to three uses will be all that one can get out of this size tube. Too bad</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to help with his acne.  So far, he has no complaints about the product.  I will say his skin is looking much better with the products I have found for him here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> they send you products that are out dated why do you keep letting them sell stuff on you site it really upsets me when i buy something off your site and it turns out to where it no good and then i have to pay extra shipping cost to send it back so i end up keeping it and throwing it away</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this again and would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The product was fine, as expected. But the tube was almost empty when i got it. Felt like it was used before. I tried emailing him but he was asking me to give pictures of the product as soon as i opened it from the box. Which i didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;Who takes pictures of products when they arrive??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ordered anything again from this seller.. disappointed. 2 stars is for the small amount of product which i got which was nice.</li>
            <li> This mask is good for combination to oily skin. It is particularly good for acne prone skin. The mask is refreshing and deep cleansing. My pimples did dry up a good bit after just one use without overdying my entire face. It does control the production of oil in my T zone area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to using this mask twice a week ( not more than that). I dont think it would be as effective for dry skin</li>
            <li> i love the smell and look, however it does burn a little once you can get past that youll love it, it tightens face and keeps acne away</li>
            <li> i liked the feel and smell but it broke my face out could not continue use was to harsh on my face</li>
            <li> Good. Clay mask really purfies the skin the reason i give it 3 stars is the tube is small not standard mask size about size of a sample or tube of hand lotion</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a week but I do like it.  I use other neem products and really like them.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I decided to give this mask a try and I love it. I usually apply the mask in the morning right before taking a shower and my skin feels extremely soft after. Also, my makeup goes on very smoothly after the mask. Be careful when removing the mask and make sure to properly rinse to remove all the product.</li>
            <li> This product really works fast, after a few times using it I can see the difference on my skin. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I found out about neem products on a Dr. Oz show. I&#x27;m an adult with monthly acne around my jaw line. I&#x27;m told that it&#x27;s hormonal. This pack smells good, it feels, good and it worked for me. It&#x27;s a tad pricey but I was willing to try it. I put it on my face immediately when I wake up and keep it on while I brush my teeth. If you have adult acne, this product in combination with eating or drinking antioxidant food products such as teas often, you will put your acne in check like I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and I like it so far. I notice an immediate difference when I use it, makes my skin soft &amp; smooth. As for a decrease in acne there has been a small decline in my numbe of outbreaks. Not a miracle cure but I definitely like it.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product really works. I love using Neem masks, but this little bottle didn&#x27;t have much in it! I felt like I was getting a bottle that was already used since there was barely any product in it. I only got to use it a handful of times before I ran out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it for cleaning my face. My skin feels soft after scrubbing and cleaning with it. People in India have been using neem for many centuries, being aware of its benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne. It helps to tighten pores, exfoliate and cleans.</li>
            <li> We got this for my wife&#x27;s nephew that was having acne problems. He asked us to order more for him and we did. When he asked the third time I said it was time that he ordered it for himself. Apparently it works because his acne is gone.</li>
            <li> have been using this for years, could not get hold of it earlier, makes ur skin clean, i donot know if wud make it blemish free. i dont even think any products do that , but year it cleans the skin in and out</li>
            <li> Not that great, really didn&#x27;t do anything for my face and I used the whole little bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and is gritty, but I did like to use it here and there. It was interesting, not sure if I would buy again. I absolutely love this brand though. I have been using Himalaya neem and tumeric face wash for three years now and don&#x27;t use anything else on my face, I swear by it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing itself. While I personally come from Indian culture and I have always heard about this product, I never used it. But, after using it today I couldn&#x27;t stop from writing the review. It&#x27;s a great product for such a low price and easy to put on too. Also, the seller is really great! It came within days when I wasn&#x27;t even expecting the delivery to be this fast. I recommend this for everyone (i personally have dry skin and super sensitive and this is doing great)!.</li>
            <li> This was first brought to my attention  by Dr. Oz....I love this product.  My skin has really cleared up.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this on line as I had run out after bringing it back from India.  great for cleaning up problem skin, purifies and cleans pores without drying.  Lovely dark green color scares anyone peeking in your windows.  Delivered very fast.  Only problem is that this is a very small container, dries out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The Best Smelling, Feeling Face Pack on the Market!</li>
            <li> I used this face mask when I lived overseas and was sad to see that stores in the States didn&#x27;t carry it. Then looking for it on Amazon crossed my mind. I have somewhat sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t burn unless I use too much or leave it on for too long. Some tingling is normal - I think it may have eucalyptus in the ingredients. I have oily to normal skin and this mask helps soak up the gunk without drying my face out. I use it no more than once a week. I does have a strange smell but it isn&#x27;t enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> not what i expected. very loose and yucky. i can make it myself better but its good for washing your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this because I was looking for a good clay face mask to use on my skin. I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin and tend to get dry and flaky skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer (worst of both worlds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I really love how this stuff smells! That&#x27;s probably the neem and tumeric working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually visibly reduces acne redness after one use. It works well as a spot treatment but I prefer to use it as a full face mask. Surprisingly this little 50g tube has lasted 6 months for me! I use it about once a week. It helps heal my acne without making my face feel raw or my skin peel.</li>
            <li> The product was a nice mask but the bottle was half empty when delivered.</li>
            <li> The Purifying neem pack was delivered very fast, the quality is good, same like i bought it in India, but the tube is only 1/3 full - i think it explains the low price.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have very oily acne prone skin. I use this product more as a spot treatment on any pimples that come up and they are usually visibly smaller and less red the next day. With this, I also use the himalaya neem and tumeric face wash and my skin is just clearing up so quickly! At night, I just apply this on whatever blemish I may have and leave it on over night then wash it off in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product before but the company worked out the problem and did so speedily and without further cost to me. I&#x27;m happy with their service and handling of the problem.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I ordered it after seeing it on Dr. Oz! So amazing! Use every other day and has helped with oil control! Only complaint is that delivery was a bit slow!</li>
            <li> Great on my face and I love the smell of this product.  I am so glad that I watched Dr. Oz and found out about this product.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when I received it and it was dated with 2012 on it.. Not happy. The actual product is okay, but that&#x27;s unacceptable</li>
            <li> Had been opened and 1/3 product gushed. Felt uncomfortable in using. Disappointed. Was listed as NEW, not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected as dependable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now - almost every day. I saw on Dr. Oz that for my skin type, I should use this every day. So far, I have not seen any results. It does not dry my skin out, but it does not seem to be doing anything for my acne. I will keep using until the tube is done and see if it does anything and if I should re-order.</li>
            <li> Neem was no miracle acne treatment, but smell clean and worked pretty good. If you don&#x27;t mind mud masks try it out.</li>
            <li> No other product gives me the clear skin like this one. It is dark, thick, and earthy and applies on my face well. In 10-15 mins its hardened and I can actually see my pores expanded through the dried clay. Washing it off leaves my skin absolutely radiant!</li>
            <li> Did not like this product!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.  The cost should be a little cheaper though. I Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This cleans and leaves your skin feel fresh, clean and smooth!! I highly recommend for anyone it not too drying!!</li>
            <li> My sister in law really likes it, so there&#x27;s that to be said for it.  She has really, really bad rosacia, and uses the Neem Face Wash which she loves and this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly, but was very disappointed when I opened the package and discovered the tube barely even contained 1/3 of the amount of product.  The container was not sealed, so there is no way to tell if this is a brand new product.  Nothing had leaked out in the packaging - I think it had been mailed out like this.  I noticed that I&#x27;m not the only one who has complained of receiving less than 1/2 of this product in the tube.  I would think twice before ordering anything else from this seller.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of scrub for one tube.  It&#x27;s OK, but nothing great.  Feels good, but need to use it in the shower, because it&#x27;s messy  and dark.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far but I really liked it. My face felt refreshed afterwards and the small zits I had from pms were gone.</li>
            <li> ...because it leaves my face amazingly clean and refreshed. I started using neem oil at night about a month ago, and it pulls out the impurities like crazy. (Be prepared for a lot of zits popping up!) I use this neem mask every weekend, and I love it. The combo of the oil and mask is just remarkable. When I read the blurb on neem before I ordered the mask, I was skeptical that neem leaves skin glowing (well, they all claim that, don&#x27;t they?), but it really does! After the first two weeks, people at work were commenting on my skin. And I&#x27;m 60! Wish I&#x27;d known about neem in my 20s. And it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of high-end products that I had been using. So glad I found this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about anything Neem and Himalayan for a fact. They work.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Good for acne proem skin, very smoothing, gives a cold and relaxed feeling after application on face.</li>
            <li> This is the best if you have oily skin at all! Neem is a wonderful product. This is not for dry skin. This was very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I highley recommend it to everyone!  Very rejuvenating to your skin making it soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the neem face wash. The smell is not bad, you just have to get used to the neem smell if you don&#x27;t know what it smells like. I only gave it 4 stars because the tube was, in my opinion, underfilled. Maybe it was just over the 1/2 tube mark. but it helped to clear my face up and I would recommend it to someone who is looking to clear skin in a natural way or use ayurvedic medicine.</li>
            <li> This mask visibly reduces appearance of pores, smells great, and is shipped direct from India in a cute little box.  Better than many more expensive products; simply the best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it successfully removes blackheads and excess great amazingly. When it dries you literally see round tiny spots of oil emerging. Leaves the skin lovely and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, there was only about 1/3 of the product in the tube and you could see that it had squirted out the top and someone had resealed it. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Works good on sun damaged skin. Great mud mask. Smells good and feels good on your face. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son whose been struggling with his skin. He loves it. He notices the difference in his face when he hasn&#x27;t used it as well. Great find thanks to dr.oz</li>
            <li> this face cream really works it removes the oils and makes my face feel clean I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> This product has really helped heal my blemished skin.  The redness in my sensitive skin used to hang on for months, but seems to mostly fade in just a week with this product.  I use it two times a week and it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.  I&#x27;d say this is a very good product and I will continue to use it.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because the fragrance is quite strong and has a more masculine tone to it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Not necessarily a cure for acne, but it helps it for sure. I use it once a week, but I sometimes replace it with that cheap Aztec healing clay mask (which you already have, I KNOW you bought it). It goes on weird but it dries... well weird too. It goes on like smeary and feels kind of exfoliating, then it dries all... idk, spotty. Not spotty. Dotty. It looks like there are a bunch of tiny dots all over when it dries. Also it goes on green (like the cap) but dries a little blue-greenish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to use this now there was no plastic seal on it and it seems like someone&#x27;s been using it because the bottle is almost empty.&lt;br /&gt;what the hell.</li>
            <li> nice, cooling and refreshing to my skin, just as I expected came well packaged and overall loved the pricing! I have used different kinds but this is really good</li>
            <li> Dries up your skin ! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with combination skin.caused tingling sensation which normally doesn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredient list more carefully, but I didn&#x27;t think Himalaya would put parabens in a product. I have used other products from them for awhile and have never been disappointed by them cutting corners and using inferior ingredients.  Now I&#x27;m not sure of them anymore. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> OLD AGE LINES ARE CREEPING IN. IT WORKS BEST FOR ME AFTER WASHING MY FACE WITH HOT WATER.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference with the very first use. My skin just looked healthier. It was worth how funny I looked while it dried on my skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This may be a good product EXCEPT for the fact that the listing on Amazon does not include the parabens clearly stated on the label. Parabens are preservatives that have recently been under fire for a variety of health concerns.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s Amazon that should get the low rating for lack of full disclosure.</li>
            <li> miss placed it but im sure it was good stuff</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Neem while traveling in India.  It totally cleaned up my face, helped tighten my pores and has now become a weekly staple of my face care regimin.</li>
