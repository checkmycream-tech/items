            <li>My eyebrows are growing in quite nicely.</li>
            <li>but after seeing how effective the eyelash conditioner was, I tried this out</li>
            <li>I honestly thought this wouldn&#x27;t work for men, but it makes sense as hair follicles are hair follicles</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I’m certainly a happy customer!</li>
            <li>and my husband loves the new me and keeps telling me how great I look!</li>
            <li>It has a great peppermint smell to it and is really quick to apply and get on with</li>
            <li>I’ve seen lots of these products on the market, but this one by Imax is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident and handsome, manly because of my darker eyebrows!</li>
            <li>One of the best features of this product, and is a turn on for most young people (like ourselves)</li>
            <li>and he is finally pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I experienced irritation for a while when first using I Max.</li>
            <li>Within days, my brows appeared fuller and more defined.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using it twice a day, I’m noticing more brow definition.</li>
            <li>I feel more handsome and happier and think I look better which the darker brow on my light skin!</li>
            <li>i did not buy more of the conditioner</li>
            <li>Gifted this product to my girlfriend</li>
            <li>(like the hair on his head) were getting more sparse</li>
            <li>that I have a bit more time (and money) on my hands</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more permanent to help fill out my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I feel much more confident now and have never been happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others that worked better and will revert to them when this is used up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll make sure to update you guys.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to no avail and today I am hooked.      </li>
            <li>So I bought it immediately when it arrived it smelt nice like peppermint gum, so that was cool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t honestly have a great expectation of the product because of its relatively cheap price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>and I see pretty good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy that it&#x27;s worked as quickly as it has-</li>
            <li>I think my wife is beautiful exactly how she is, but if she wants to use these types of products so that she feels more confident about herself, then I have no problem with her doing so.</li>
            <li>I noticed her eyebrows were looking a lot more full and healthy.</li>
            <li>There was good communication and fast service.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much fuller my eyebrows would look, but I really love the result!</li>
            <li>This brow conditioner goes on really easily.</li>
            <li>The application is easy too.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and saw results very quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not used to using things like this, but the application was really easy</li>
            <li>But then my friend started to use this product by I Max to increase the body in her eyebrows and it REALLY changed the frame of her face and brought out her beauty even more, which got me thinking what it could do for me!</li>
            <li>But then my friend started to use this product by I Max to increase the body in her eyebrows and it REALLY changed the frame of her face and brought out her beauty even more, which got me thinking what it could do for me!</li>
            <li>’s been a huge relief to look like myself again.</li>
            <li>You can just smooth it on your eyebrow area and let it sit all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>He felt a light tingling and itchy sensation for about 30 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li>Please try if you want a thicker, filled in brow.</li>
            <li>As a mother of 3, I really neglected myself and honestly didn&#x27;t have the time to think about treating myself or looking after myself in anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels great to be back to myself and rediscovering my confidence!</li>
            <li>I feel completely comfortable looking anyone in the eye now.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after I saw my wife get a great result from eyelash conditioner of the same company.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to use, just apply the brush across your brow every morning, or night, and you’ll see results in no time.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t honestly have a great expectation of the product for its relatively low price, but we were pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I feel much better about myself now thanks to my Brows!</li>
            <li>A lot of the girls at her work are raving about how good her eyebrows look, and slowly, but surely, they seem to be catching on to wanting to try this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe even some before and after pics as I made sure to take one before i put on my first serum.</li>
            <li>She was using eyelash conditioner of the same company and getting a good result every day.</li>
            <li>It has a smell but not a bad one.</li>
            <li>This product has worked really well for me and my brows look really luscious and sexy now!</li>
            <li>No one really thinks about eyebrows being an important feature to highlight the face, but taking care of them can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty.</li>
            <li>I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty.</li>
            <li>It works to quickly thicken and strengthen the existing hairs.</li>
            <li>This is an overall great product that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The color is basically clear and is very light in texture.</li>
            <li>but that itself is useful info, so i&#x27;m sharing.  </li>
            <li>We will continue to use it and probably every now and again apply it as a top up, but I am surprised at how well it worked to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and youre hearing this from the girl with the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li>so just put that out of your mind right now.</li>
            <li>My brows definitely looked more noticeable and full.</li>
            <li>i am so in love with this product and this brand in general.</li>
            <li>I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this.</li>
            <li>I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this.</li>
            <li>it works very, very well.</li>
            <li>I felt pretty embarrassed to go out with my eyebrows in the state they were in.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would actually.</li>
            <li>and so she asked me if I would be interested in this product.</li>
            <li>He resisted using it at first, thinking it was too feminine</li>
            <li>, I wanted to make sure that I get back on track with my appearance.</li>
            <li>Middle Eastern and look much better with thicker eyebrows</li>
            <li>My brows have always been pretty patchy</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have become so thin and this made me look not too good!</li>
            <li>After a month and half of using the eye brow conditioner my eyebrows started to become so much more thicker!</li>
            <li>He didn’t know how to do it at first and just scrubbed the metal brush on his brows; I told him to apply the liquid serum and gently rub it in with his finger.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much change in the first 3 weeks, but it was a couple of weeks after that when I started to see that a change was happening.</li>
            <li>Also, my eyebrows are so soft and full of color.</li>
            <li>Those used to be fine when I was a younger man, but age had really affected this!</li>
            <li>They are much thicker than they were before I started</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are so much thicker and conditioned now.</li>
            <li>She saw her eyelashes grow much thicker and longer within just a month</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think about it too much</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing is happening.  </li>
            <li>brow hairs are multiplying haha</li>
            <li>type, and a very observant cousin said &amp;</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stronger and fuller my brows looks now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I had to agree she looked much</li>
            <li>and I had to agree she looked much</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much result yet</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t believe it would really work for me.</li>
            <li>After receiving this product, I started to use it straight away.</li>
            <li>Your eyebrows shape your entire face, and are really important when wanting to get that evening, or every day look.</li>
            <li>Three weeks later, and now I CAN tell that they look fuller and more lush</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, in less than a month it&#x27;s already made my brows thicker and longer!</li>
            <li>They started to look like normal eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Not only does it work well and have natural ingredients, it also boasts a pleasant smell (as compared to other cosmetics she uses).</li>
            <li>My fiancé has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick or very defined and</li>
            <li>My skin is also pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>My brother has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick but became thinner and shorter as he got older .</li>
            <li>Havent seen much results as of so far.</li>
            <li>This serum is nice and wet goes on feeling the same, not dried out at all.</li>
            <li>It is such an easy task that takes only moments out of your day and promises to give you those thicker longer fuller eyebrows that we all want.</li>
            <li>In only a short time, I can tell a huge difference in the way my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li>but it got thinner naturally as I grew older.</li>
            <li>My main concern was skin irritation because my skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend I Max Brows Conditioner for all of those (like me) who are looking for a way to improve the fullness and thickness of their natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Face skin is very sensitive in all area...</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t like to use it at first, thinking it was only for women</li>
            <li>and I saw unexpected results!</li>
            <li>After the first month of use, my eyebrows were still practically non-existent, but there was some tiny hint of a hair or two budding.</li>
            <li>only used it to support her really, but unexpectedly I started to get results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the results..</li>
            <li>but I would like to have a fuller, natural arc, which is what I aiming to achieve with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nearly May 1st.  </li>
            <li>My brows appear fuller and still look natural, which is what I was going for.</li>
            <li>Nothing so far.  </li>
            <li>these days, is that it’s made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 different brow products; this one and Ardell did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I used to fill in my patchy brow line with a pencil, however that would sometimes smudge and just didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good but not excellent.</li>
            <li>This is not a “get eyebrows quick” product but I am convinced with consistent, everyday use, that it will help me to enhance and maximize them (which is my personal goal).</li>
            <li>My brow hairs became thinner and shorter as I got older to a point where my friends were advising me different types of treatments and products.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it’s high quality, because my eyebrows are finally thickening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had ordered two tubes as previous reviews had mentioned they had seen new growth after the first tube and had turned around and ordered a second.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>any more (the stuff that gets sold on Amazon and a few retailers is either old inventory which has usually lost its efficacy, or it&#x27;s counterfeit -- got that info directly from Librow).</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to try I Max because her brows are naturally thin, and she has always wanted thicker, more luscious eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so well I think I&#x27;m going to continue to use it for as long as possible so that they remain thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hard like brush that u use for scrub ur toe...</li>
            <li>see some minimal new growth, but that is with me using it when I happen to remember.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the I Max Brow Conditioner to see if it would have any effect on my fine, thin eyebrows.</li>

            <li> But then my friend started to use this product by I Max to increase the body in her eyebrows and it REALLY changed the frame of her face and brought out her beauty even more, which got me thinking what it could do for me!</li>

            <li> ’s been a huge relief to look like myself again.</li>
            <li> You can just smooth it on your eyebrow area and let it sit all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> He felt a light tingling and itchy sensation for about 30 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> Please try if you want a thicker, filled in brow.</li>
            <li> As a mother of 3, I really neglected myself and honestly didn&#x27;t have the time to think about treating myself or looking after myself in anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great to be back to myself and rediscovering my confidence!</li>
            <li> I feel completely comfortable looking anyone in the eye now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I saw my wife get a great result from eyelash conditioner of the same company.</li>
            <li> Its super easy to use, just apply the brush across your brow every morning, or night, and you’ll see results in no time.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t honestly have a great expectation of the product for its relatively low price, but we were pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I feel much better about myself now thanks to my Brows!</li>
            <li> A lot of the girls at her work are raving about how good her eyebrows look, and slowly, but surely, they seem to be catching on to wanting to try this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe even some before and after pics as I made sure to take one before i put on my first serum.</li>
            <li> She was using eyelash conditioner of the same company and getting a good result every day.</li>
            <li> It has a smell but not a bad one.</li>
            <li> This product has worked really well for me and my brows look really luscious and sexy now!</li>
            <li> No one really thinks about eyebrows being an important feature to highlight the face, but taking care of them can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty.</li>
            <li> I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty.</li>
            <li> It works to quickly thicken and strengthen the existing hairs.</li>
            <li> This is an overall great product that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The color is basically clear and is very light in texture.</li>
            <li> but that itself is useful info, so i&#x27;m sharing.  </li>
            <li> We will continue to use it and probably every now and again apply it as a top up, but I am surprised at how well it worked to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and youre hearing this from the girl with the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li> so just put that out of your mind right now.</li>
            <li> My brows definitely looked more noticeable and full.</li>
            <li> i am so in love with this product and this brand in general.</li>
            <li> I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this.</li>
            <li> I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this.</li>
            <li> it works very, very well.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty embarrassed to go out with my eyebrows in the state they were in.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would actually.</li>
            <li> and so she asked me if I would be interested in this product.</li>
            <li> He resisted using it at first, thinking it was too feminine</li>
            <li> , I wanted to make sure that I get back on track with my appearance.</li>
            <li> Middle Eastern and look much better with thicker eyebrows</li>
            <li> My brows have always been pretty patchy</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have become so thin and this made me look not too good!</li>
            <li> After a month and half of using the eye brow conditioner my eyebrows started to become so much more thicker!</li>
            <li> He didn’t know how to do it at first and just scrubbed the metal brush on his brows; I told him to apply the liquid serum and gently rub it in with his finger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much change in the first 3 weeks, but it was a couple of weeks after that when I started to see that a change was happening.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyebrows are so soft and full of color.</li>
            <li> Those used to be fine when I was a younger man, but age had really affected this!</li>
            <li> They are much thicker than they were before I started</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so much thicker and conditioned now.</li>
            <li> She saw her eyelashes grow much thicker and longer within just a month</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think about it too much</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing is happening.  </li>
            <li> brow hairs are multiplying haha</li>
            <li> type, and a very observant cousin said &amp;</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stronger and fuller my brows looks now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I had to agree she looked much</li>
            <li> and I had to agree she looked much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much result yet</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t believe it would really work for me.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I started to use it straight away.</li>
            <li> Your eyebrows shape your entire face, and are really important when wanting to get that evening, or every day look.</li>
            <li> Three weeks later, and now I CAN tell that they look fuller and more lush</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, in less than a month it&#x27;s already made my brows thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> They started to look like normal eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Not only does it work well and have natural ingredients, it also boasts a pleasant smell (as compared to other cosmetics she uses).</li>
            <li> My fiancé has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick or very defined and</li>
            <li> My skin is also pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> My brother has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick but became thinner and shorter as he got older .</li>
            <li> Havent seen much results as of so far.</li>
            <li> This serum is nice and wet goes on feeling the same, not dried out at all.</li>
            <li> It is such an easy task that takes only moments out of your day and promises to give you those thicker longer fuller eyebrows that we all want.</li>
            <li> In only a short time, I can tell a huge difference in the way my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li> but it got thinner naturally as I grew older.</li>
            <li> My main concern was skin irritation because my skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> I highly recommend I Max Brows Conditioner for all of those (like me) who are looking for a way to improve the fullness and thickness of their natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Face skin is very sensitive in all area...</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t like to use it at first, thinking it was only for women</li>
            <li> and I saw unexpected results!</li>
            <li> After the first month of use, my eyebrows were still practically non-existent, but there was some tiny hint of a hair or two budding.</li>
            <li> only used it to support her really, but unexpectedly I started to get results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the results..</li>
            <li> but I would like to have a fuller, natural arc, which is what I aiming to achieve with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly May 1st.  </li>
            <li> My brows appear fuller and still look natural, which is what I was going for.</li>
            <li> Nothing so far.  </li>
            <li> these days, is that it’s made from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 different brow products; this one and Ardell did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I used to fill in my patchy brow line with a pencil, however that would sometimes smudge and just didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good but not excellent.</li>
            <li> This is not a “get eyebrows quick” product but I am convinced with consistent, everyday use, that it will help me to enhance and maximize them (which is my personal goal).</li>
            <li> My brow hairs became thinner and shorter as I got older to a point where my friends were advising me different types of treatments and products.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it’s high quality, because my eyebrows are finally thickening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had ordered two tubes as previous reviews had mentioned they had seen new growth after the first tube and had turned around and ordered a second.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> any more (the stuff that gets sold on Amazon and a few retailers is either old inventory which has usually lost its efficacy, or it&#x27;s counterfeit -- got that info directly from Librow).</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try I Max because her brows are naturally thin, and she has always wanted thicker, more luscious eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so well I think I&#x27;m going to continue to use it for as long as possible so that they remain thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hard like brush that u use for scrub ur toe...</li>
            <li> see some minimal new growth, but that is with me using it when I happen to remember.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the I Max Brow Conditioner to see if it would have any effect on my fine, thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I took a look at the ingredients and saw that it’s packed with peptides, extracts, and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The thing is, for the past year, its really started to bother me because my confidence is so low.</li>
            <li> He said he felt a tingling feeling for about 15 minutes after applying, but that was the only minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for only a few days so far</li>
            <li> I have a horrible cowlick right in the middle of my left eyebrow and read that by conditioning them, I would be able to teach the hair to grow in the proper direction.</li>
            <li> After years and years of plucking and over bleaching my eyebrows they went from sisters to long distance cousins!</li>
            <li> I know it’s probably quite strange for a man to buy something like this, but I didn&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll keep at it until the thing is dry - and</li>
            <li> After another 1/2 month or less, I was about to give up hope, but decided to wait until the second tube ran out.</li>
            <li> I have always had an insecurity about my lack of eyebrows, but never really say anything about it because I am a guy</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had extremely thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My brows seem darker but they are not much thicker.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see what the next few weeks brings</li>
            <li> Instead of other drastic measures, I decided to search for a cheaper solution on Amazon, where I found this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved it the other day</li>
            <li> small linear forms above my eyes.</li>
            <li> I expected this to work just as well as the eyelash conditioner worked for my wife!</li>
            <li> Apparently, my eye brows weren&#x27;t as thick as they used to be either</li>
            <li> It has made me so self conscious that I have always had a very hard time looking people in the eye.</li>
            <li> not sure how long you need to use it after your eyebrows finish growing in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and fuller now and reminds me of how my eyebrows looked 10 years ago and helps my look overall (at least my wife says so).</li>
            <li> As of yesterday, there was so little improvement that I was certain it had failed.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would make to the company is not to place a barcode sticker across the back of box; it makes it difficult to read about product</li>
            <li> The less dense parts of the beginning of my brows are filling in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks now and its crazy how much my eyebrows have thickened!</li>
            <li> When I used it, it was a little bit tingly like a tickle, but that feeling was gone after like 20-30 mins and it didn&#x27;t hurt or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a little over a month</li>
            <li> using the brow conditioner my eyebrows were sort of patchy with areas of hair missing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help fill in missing patches in my brow line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After asking her a few questions, I decided to order it myself.</li>
            <li> I bought one eyelash conditioner from Amazon for my wife a few months ago and she has been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this product just yet.</li>
            <li> It had literally been just about my children for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and noticed a change sooner than I thought!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with making a choice between these two decisions.</li>
            <li> I do not mean to give a negative feedback, I just somehow disappointed.</li>
            <li> really -  lately people are giving me compliments -</li>
            <li> It works slowly, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I had thick eyebrows growing up</li>
            <li> This product promises thick and darker brows</li>
            <li> and I feel left out because I just don’t think they will take me seriously because of how I look, as silly as it sounds!</li>
            <li> If you’re a man with thin or patchy eyebrows and you want to change that, or if you simply want your eyebrows to grow in thicker and fuller than they are, don’t be afraid to use this product.</li>
            <li> I mean, which is worse?</li>
            <li> (tough lesson learned).</li>
            <li> They were so damaged and thin looking.</li>
            <li> It is totally useless for me.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid to do this as well.</li>
            <li> I don’t feel like I look scary anymore!</li>
            <li> please change the brush it hurt so bad...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it bad, it just didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Gives me bad skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I was sick of my lack of eyebrows bothering me and wanted to do something about it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brow conditioner goes on really easily. It smells pleasant like spearmint but the smell will go away soon after it is applied. The color is basically clear and is very light in texture. You can just smooth it on your eyebrow area and let it sit all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the brow conditioner my eyebrows were sort of patchy with areas of hair missing. I felt pretty embarrassed to go out with my eyebrows in the state they were in. I&#x27;ve heard of people shaving or plucking out their eyebrows and just going the penciled in route but I was afraid to do this as well. I had a hard time with making a choice between these two decisions. I mean, which is worse? The patchy look or the drawn on cartoon look? I couldn&#x27;t decide so I decided to do nothing until I did some research and that&#x27;s when I found then purchased this product. I felt I would try it and if it didn&#x27;t work I might do the cartoon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results.. it works very, very well. Better than I thought it would actually. My eyebrows are growing in quite nicely. They are much thicker than they were before I started so I know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long you need to use it after your eyebrows finish growing in but because it conditions the hair follicles so well I think I&#x27;m going to continue to use it for as long as possible so that they remain thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> I’ve been searching for something to help fill in my patchy eyebrows, and I’ve finally found it with I Max Brows Conditioner. Within days, my brows appeared fuller and more defined. I even stopped filling in my brows with pencil, because I didn’t need it any longer! I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this. And the price was definitely affordable. I highly recommend this product, I’m certainly a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have put my eyebrows through everything. I have plucked, waxed, shaved, and even threaded them. They were so damaged and thin looking. So when I heard about this eyebrow conditioner, I wanted to give it a try. Wow! This stuff is amazing. My eyebrows are so much thicker and conditioned now. In only a short time, I can tell a huge difference in the way my eyebrows look. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!! My brother has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick but became thinner and shorter as he got older . So I got this for him and the eyelash conditioner for myself. He didn&#x27;t like to use it at first, thinking it was only for women but he finally gave a try and stick to applying it diligently every day. He felt a light tingling and itchy sensation for about 30 minutes after applying. Three weeks later, and everyone could tell that they look darker and lusher. He didn&#x27;t honestly have a great expectation of the product for its relatively low price, but we were pleasantly surprised by the results. After about 4 weeks, his  brows started to grow thicker and and after about 6 weeks, they were darker and fuller. He is so happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this product just yet. I had ordered two tubes as previous reviews had mentioned they had seen new growth after the first tube and had turned around and ordered a second.&lt;br /&gt;I see some minimal new growth, but that is with me using it when I happen to remember. I&#x27;m pretty happy that it&#x27;s worked as quickly as it has- hopefully it continues.</li>
            <li> It works slowly, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the I Max Brow Conditioner to see if it would have any effect on my fine, thin eyebrows. After about a week of using it twice a day, I’m noticing more brow definition. I traditionally don’t try to darken my brows with pencil but I would like to have a fuller, natural arc, which is what I aiming to achieve with this conditioner. This is not a “get eyebrows quick” product but I am convinced with consistent, everyday use, that it will help me to enhance and maximize them (which is my personal goal). I highly recommend I Max Brows Conditioner for all of those (like me) who are looking for a way to improve the fullness and thickness of their natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have always had an insecurity about my lack of eyebrows, but never really say anything about it because I am a guy and we aren&#x27;t supposed to be bothered about that kind of stuff! The thing is, for the past year, its really started to bother me because my confidence is so low. My friends are always talking to girls and I feel left out because I just don’t think they will take me seriously because of how I look, as silly as it sounds! My sister uses this thing she bought on Amazon to make her eyelashes look thicker and she said I should try it on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was looking online to buy what she uses, I actually came across this one, which is exclusively for eyebrows! So I bought it immediately when it arrived it smelt nice like peppermint gum, so that was cool. When I used it, it was a little bit tingly like a tickle, but that feeling was gone after like 20-30 mins and it didn&#x27;t hurt or anything. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks now and its crazy how much my eyebrows have thickened! I don’t feel like I look scary anymore! I feel more handsome and happier and think I look better which the darker brow on my light skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this brow conditioner after giving my wife the eyelash conditioner from I-Max about two months ago. She saw her eyelashes grow much thicker and longer within just a month and so she asked me if I would be interested in this product. I had thick eyebrows growing up but it got thinner naturally as I grew older. I didn&#x27;t really think about it too much but after seeing how effective the eyelash conditioner was, I tried this out and it&#x27;s definitely helping. It&#x27;s thicker and fuller now and reminds me of how my eyebrows looked 10 years ago and helps my look overall (at least my wife says so). Great product, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it and applied it for about two weeks.  absolutely nothing is happening.  but that itself is useful info, so i&#x27;m sharing.  i&#x27;ll keep at it until the thing is dry - and if something happens, i&#x27;ll edit this review HERE&#x27;S THE EDIT;  it&#x27;s nearly May 1st.  i did not buy more of the conditioner - thought i&#x27;d just give it time.  brow hairs are multiplying haha really -  lately people are giving me compliments - the &amp;#34;you look good&amp;#34; type, and a very observant cousin said &amp;#34;your brows have never looked better&amp;#34;.  fact is, i now have brows.</li>
            <li> If you’re a man with thin or patchy eyebrows and you want to change that, or if you simply want your eyebrows to grow in thicker and fuller than they are, don’t be afraid to use this product. I know there are stigmas against men using makeup and eyeliner and stuff, but this is totally different so just put that out of your mind right now. It’s a growth enhancer, and it works. Thicker, fuller, darker eyebrows have been my experience. And don’t let anybody tell you that you shouldn&#x27;t be worrying about your eyebrows. If they’re something that cause you insecurity and you want to try changing them I say go for it!</li>
            <li> Gifted this product to my girlfriend and she LOVED IT!!  Her eyebrows look fuller and I get the credit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My brow hairs became thinner and shorter as I got older to a point where my friends were advising me different types of treatments and products. Instead of other drastic measures, I decided to search for a cheaper solution on Amazon, where I found this product. I didn&#x27;t honestly have a great expectation of the product because of its relatively cheap price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. After about 3 weeks, my brows started to grow thicker and and after about 6 weeks, they were darker and fuller. I feel much better about myself now thanks to my Brows!</li>
            <li> My fiancé has been using this product now because his eyebrows were not thick or very defined and (like the hair on his head) were getting more sparse (I couldn’t tell but he swears he could). So I got this for him and the eyelash conditioner for myself. He resisted using it at first, thinking it was too feminine but I finally got him to give in and stick to applying it every day. He didn’t know how to do it at first and just scrubbed the metal brush on his brows; I told him to apply the liquid serum and gently rub it in with his finger. He said he felt a tingling feeling for about 15 minutes after applying, but that was the only minor annoyance. Three weeks later, and now I CAN tell that they look fuller and more lush and he is finally pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a week and my eyebrows are already staring to filling in and get thicker. This product is absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Not helpful. Seemed my brows became thinner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with hopes to increase brow thickness-and it does as promised. My brows appear fuller and still look natural, which is what I was going for. The application is easy too. It works just as an eyelash brush would, only for the brow. I used the product for a couple weeks and already see results. Please try if you want a thicker, filled in brow. Also, as a bonus, the company included a free face cream sample!! The only suggestion I would make to the company is not to place a barcode sticker across the back of box; it makes it difficult to read about product</li>
            <li> Nothing so far.  Have been using it for one month.  Will keep on applying it with hopeful persistence.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try I Max because her brows are naturally thin, and she has always wanted thicker, more luscious eyebrows. One of the best features of this product, and is a turn on for most young people (like ourselves) these days, is that it’s made from all natural ingredients. After a month of her using it I noticed her eyebrows were looking a lot more full and healthy. Not only does it work well and have natural ingredients, it also boasts a pleasant smell (as compared to other cosmetics she uses). The I Max comes in a nicely sealed bottle with a good brush to apply the conditioner. A lot of the girls at her work are raving about how good her eyebrows look, and slowly, but surely, they seem to be catching on to wanting to try this product. I think my wife is beautiful exactly how she is, but if she wants to use these types of products so that she feels more confident about herself, then I have no problem with her doing so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see the result yet but I want to share this feeling to the company that produce this I MAX Brows... The brush that came with.... It&#x27;s super hard like brush that u use for scrub ur toe...&lt;br /&gt;Omg please change the brush it hurt so bad... Face skin is very sensitive in all area... And u have to use this brush on ur brows....  It&#x27;s hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipping was delayed too.</li>
            <li> After 5 months, I&#x27;ve seen no improvement whatsoever. I&#x27;ve tried 5 different brow products; this one and Ardell did absolutely nothing. The best was Librow which is sadly not sold in the USA any more (the stuff that gets sold on Amazon and a few retailers is either old inventory which has usually lost its efficacy, or it&#x27;s counterfeit -- got that info directly from Librow). I experienced irritation for a while when first using I Max. Irritation eventually stopped, but the product made no discernible difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and really loved it! As a mother of 3, I really neglected myself and honestly didn&#x27;t have the time to think about treating myself or looking after myself in anyway. It had literally been just about my children for the past 10 years. I don’t regret this, but I have definitely noticed myself letting go of my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have a bit more time (and money) on my hands, I wanted to make sure that I get back on track with my appearance. This product has worked really well for me and my brows look really luscious and sexy now! I wasn&#x27;t sure how much fuller my eyebrows would look, but I really love the result! It has a great peppermint smell to it and is really quick to apply and get on with my day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great to be back to myself and rediscovering my confidence! Feels great to feel good again and my husband loves the new me and keeps telling me how great I look! A really wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I actually brought this for my girl friend as she was complaining about her thinning eyebrows, but when it arrived she refused to use it unless I gave it a try. Apparently, my eye brows weren&#x27;t as thick as they used to be either so I needed to use it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it to support her really, but unexpectedly I started to get results! I honestly thought this wouldn&#x27;t work for men, but it makes sense as hair follicles are hair follicles and it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are a man or woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in our 9th week of using this and both of us have seen a massive difference in the appearance of our eye brows. We will continue to use it and probably every now and again apply it as a top up, but I am surprised at how well it worked to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good and I saw unexpected results!</li>
            <li> Awesome .This product is absolutely great. I haven’t seen any other product work as quick and effectively as this. And the price was definitely affordable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not saying it bad, it just didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help fill in missing patches in my brow line. I used to fill in my patchy brow line with a pencil, however that would sometimes smudge and just didn&#x27;t look natural. I was looking for something more permanent to help fill out my eyebrows. I tried this product and saw results very quickly. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stronger and fuller my brows looks now. I feel much more confident now and have never been happier. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Faithfully used this product on my eyebrows for two months with NO results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty. But then my friend started to use this product by I Max to increase the body in her eyebrows and it REALLY changed the frame of her face and brought out her beauty even more, which got me thinking what it could do for me! She started to get a lot of compliments and I had to agree she looked much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never really worried about my eyebrows and was quite confident in my own skin and my beauty. But then my friend started to use this product by I Max to increase the body in her eyebrows and it REALLY changed the frame of her face and brought out her beauty even more, which got me thinking what it could do for me! She started to get a lot of compliments and I had to agree she looked much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After asking her a few questions, I decided to order it myself. My main concern was skin irritation because my skin is really sensitive and I didn&#x27;t want to use anything that would harm my skin. But my friend said that she didn&#x27;t experience any skin problems. I used it for a few weeks and noticed a change sooner than I thought! My brows definitely looked more noticeable and full. I was really happy with the result and I will be re-ordering this again! Loved it!</li>
            <li> As described. There was good communication and fast service. I haven&#x27;t seen much result yet but perhaps it is too soon.</li>
            <li> This product did not work. I used it as the directions stated with no results. Do not waste your money purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> My whole life I have had extremely thin eyebrows. It has made me so self conscious that I have always had a very hard time looking people in the eye. One day my best friend gave me the best present ever! She gave me I Max Eye Brow Conditioner! After a month and half of using the eye brow conditioner my eyebrows started to become so much more thicker! They started to look like normal eyebrows! It is AMAZING! I am so grateful for this product. I would recommend this to any one. It has given me the self confidence I have always wanted. I feel completely comfortable looking anyone in the eye now. Great product!</li>
            <li> After years and years of plucking and over bleaching my eyebrows they went from sisters to long distance cousins! I tried everything to grow them back. I searched thru amazon for a good eyebrow growth product and I found this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a little over a month and I see pretty good results. The less dense parts of the beginning of my brows are filling in. Plus the smell isn&#x27;t offensive. I will continue to use I Max until I get my desired thickness! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!!!! I have a horrible cowlick right in the middle of my left eyebrow and read that by conditioning them, I would be able to teach the hair to grow in the proper direction. I have been using these for only a few days so far and my eyebrow is staying in place! Also, my eyebrows are so soft and full of color. Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It works to quickly thicken and strengthen the existing hairs. And within a week of two I started to see hair growth in areas I didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;re possible. The only reason I gave it a four star is because I think I ran out before I was predicted to....</li>
            <li> My brows seem darker but they are not much thicker. Still patchy. I&#x27;ve used others that worked better and will revert to them when this is used up.</li>
            <li> It is totally useless for me. I could not see any changes after applying it 2 times a day for 7 weeks. I do not mean to give a negative feedback, I just somehow disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! i am so in love with this product and this brand in general. I recieved it the other day and I havent seen any difference YET but my eye brows arent falling out anymore when i scrub my face with my exfoliant which was starting to become a concerning problem. It is such an easy task that takes only moments out of your day and promises to give you those thicker longer fuller eyebrows that we all want. I made the mistake of over plucking since I was a teen and i think that deffinetly took an toll on how my eyebrows look now. This serum is nice and wet goes on feeling the same, not dried out at all. It has a smell but not a bad one. There is absolutley no irritation around then area or anywhere on my face and youre hearing this from the girl with the most sensitive skin in the world. LOL. I cant wait to see what the next few weeks brings and I&#x27;ll make sure to update you guys. Maybe even some before and after pics as I made sure to take one before i put on my first serum. I have total faith in this product as the others have worked wonders so I cant wait to have longer fuller brows that I can shape in that sexy look ive always wanted! Thaaaaank you I MAX!!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have become so thin and this made me look not too good! Those used to be fine when I was a younger man, but age had really affected this! I came to know this product through my wife. She was using eyelash conditioner of the same company and getting a good result every day. I started using it one week later but I didn&#x27;t believe it would really work for me. ㅠut to my surprise this actually started working after about a month!! My eyebrows started to get thicker, darker and fuller! I feel a lot more confident and handsome, manly because of my darker eyebrows! It works for me and I am happy.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!  IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!    After the first month of use, my eyebrows were still practically non-existent, but there was some tiny hint of a hair or two budding. The eyebrow fairy told me to order a second tube, which I did. After another 1/2 month or less, I was about to give up hope, but decided to wait until the second tube ran out. As of yesterday, there was so little improvement that I was certain it had failed. HOWEVER, when I glanced in the mirror this morning, I noticed what was reminiscent of eyebrows in my former life. I double checked, then triple-checked. Yup. Something was blossoming. The test was when I walked away from the mirror and then looked at it from afar, and I saw....small linear forms above my eyes. Eyebrows, I think they are called. I can&#x27;t believe it. They&#x27;re back!  I have tried so many products to no avail and today I am hooked.      And now, what does I Max Brows have for thinning hair?</li>
            <li> Recently I over plucked my eyebrows and have been in a panic. I’m Middle Eastern and look much better with thicker eyebrows (tough lesson learned). I figured a brow conditioner might speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so glad I bought this one! I took a look at the ingredients and saw that it’s packed with peptides, extracts, and other natural ingredients. I can tell that it’s high quality, because my eyebrows are finally thickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a huge relief to look like myself again. No one really thinks about eyebrows being an important feature to highlight the face, but taking care of them can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, in less than a month it&#x27;s already made my brows thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> Good but not excellent.</li>
            <li> Gives me bad skin irritation. I threw it away after using it twice. Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I saw my wife get a great result from eyelash conditioner of the same company. I bought one eyelash conditioner from Amazon for my wife a few months ago and she has been using it everyday. I expected this to work just as well as the eyelash conditioner worked for my wife! I know it’s probably quite strange for a man to buy something like this, but I didn&#x27;t care! I was sick of my lack of eyebrows bothering me and wanted to do something about it. My self-confidence was very low and I reached a point where I knew I had to start sorting things out.  After receiving this product, I started to use it straight away. I didn&#x27;t notice much change in the first 3 weeks, but it was a couple of weeks after that when I started to see that a change was happening. I am not used to using things like this, but the application was really easy and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, which is great. This product promises thick and darker brows and it ticked both of those boxes! Bravo!</li>
            <li> The Imax brow conditioner is the best eyebrow treatment I’ve ever used. Its super easy to use, just apply the brush across your brow every morning, or night, and you’ll see results in no time. My brows have always been pretty patchy and I’ve been filling them in as part of my makeup routine for years. I’ve seen lots of these products on the market, but this one by Imax is by far the best. Your eyebrows shape your entire face, and are really important when wanting to get that evening, or every day look. My skin is also pretty sensitive and I had no irritation at all from the serum. This is an overall great product that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Havent seen much results as of so far.</li>
