            <li>cheap and great product.</li>
            <li>I use this to do Wash and Go&#x27;s and its amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>so my own skin can address the problem and get rid of the blemish.  </li>
            <li>This order came with each of the six bottles I ordered sealed in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, after getting too much sun, and it works great!</li>
            <li>though not as effective as butters for me.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I do like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest.  </li>
            <li>tried it just so that I could give an honest review of how it treats my skin even when I found out the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t get expose my skin to the sun too frequently, I can&#x27;t say how good it is for sunburns, but I suspect it is excellent for that use as well.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Now that his hand is healed I use this product as my night leg cream and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its an awesome moisturizer, that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I have made my own sealer that works great as a styler and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very light gel.</li>
            <li>Very light weight</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off not buying it.</li>
            <li>I read an article how dairy food can cause acnes because of the antibotics that are injected in the cows to product more milk.</li>
            <li>My skin would look radiant and healthy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put a top coat on and lay under the fan so it cools my sunburn off.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to find it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF;  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is my favorite aloe.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>This product not only keeps my scalp moist but it ads a wonderful shine that I was looking for that</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many toxic chemicals in this bottle, I don&#x27;t know where they had room for the aloe.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, worth the money and overall a great product!!</li>
            <li>I hope its function of repairing my skin from sun burn is gonna be such perfect as well.</li>
            <li>And there is nothing better for a sunburn than aloe.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff for everything...</li>
            <li>He claimed that for the price, nothing was better.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera has been used for many years to heal damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Aloe is a wonderful topical anti-inflammatory.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any more hold on my hair than when i style just using conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>That is ok but labeling it as</li>
            <li>I love love love this product</li>
            <li>Love this products its got</li>
            <li>so many beneficial beauty uses..definitely a product I buy again and again ..</li>
            <li>So many uses for this product.</li>
            <li>as well i love this gel</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>but besides that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair all the time because it feels very clean on my hair</li>
            <li>The best treatment I have found for minor burns from the sun or cooking &amp; baking, etc.</li>
            <li>and my skin seems more smooth.</li>
            <li>No strange smells and does the job good!</li>
            <li>This is very refreshing on skin after a good cleanse or just during the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would also make a good hand lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t do that very well.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera gel along with the other oils I purchased have made the perfect hair pudding.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, rub it on face and other parts of body, clears up any skin problems.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that most commercially-available aloe gels are full of alcohol, glycerin, and/or dyes.</li>
            <li>When I bought it I honestly thought it was pure aloe vera gel and nothing else.</li>
            <li>great as a hair styling gel in addition to traditional use for sun burns.  </li>
            <li>So I bought some coconut oil and this on Amazon and now I wash my hair (sulfate/paraben free shampoo, of course.</li>
            <li>It is also a great daily moisturizer, and will not make your skin break out.</li>
            <li>I like to use it when I want a light gel.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it daily.</li>
            <li>I mix it with coconut oil and smooth it on my face at night.  </li>
            <li>Despite the ingredients it feels non-greasy when it dries and the excess on my hands, I just smooth into my hairline.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this and found the price reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth after I wipe on my arm.</li>
            <li>I found this product readily available and use it as an after shower application for my body.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve recently found that it&#x27;s a great way to prevent my reoccurring acne too.</li>
            <li>people confirmed this as being deceptive.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, cheap quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my face feels irritated I smooth some of this on</li>
            <li>Great product for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>In an effort to use more natural products, I decided to create my own shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this just has the natural good properties of Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>Two very distinct things.</li>
            <li>A clean, fragrance free gel.  </li>
            <li>Mixed with organic shea butter in the palm of my hand, this made for a great quick moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>With most products, the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li>Great for acne, after shaving, if you get  a minor burn or sunburn.</li>
            <li>Most of the others list water as their first ingredient and/or have alcohol in them (ouch on sunburn).</li>
            <li>Clean and nourishing.</li>
            <li>I keep hearing over and over from friends and family how great aloe vera is for skin irritation, dry skin, and sun burns.</li>
            <li>I did a test to see if it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Dyes are fairly harmless, but alcohol is counter-productive as it further dries the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, effective, and protects your skin.  </li>
            <li>Just use a third of a dime sized amount and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>im sure i can find some elsewhere for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>Great to be able to find this on the internet as it is hard to find  in a store.  </li>
            <li>the freshly cut leaves better for burns and to help heal skin, but the plant has its drawbacks, too, primarily the fact that when you cut off a leaf, it&#x27;s going to take time for a new one to grow.  </li>
            <li>The anitbotics are like pregnant hormones, so when you eat dairy food, your body thinks you&#x27;re pregnant and cause your hormones to go out of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ran out quickly</li>
            <li>Amazon must change the title of the product so that quick shoppers are not deceived.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased since he could not find locally.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to check online for it sooner, Fruit of the earth seems to be the only one on the market that is unscented, very pleased.</li>
            <li>I used it on my burn from a very hot pizza that flipped over my hand and got cheese and sauce stucked to my hand.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective and does not cause my skin to break out - I use it after waxing and it&#x27;s cheaper than the usual post-axing products sold, and as effective</li>
            <li>use it to calm irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that it is worth buying</li>
            <li>Aloe gel is the best ingredient to thin your lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and can be used for many things.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s only good for the most minor of burns, what&#x27;s the point in using it?</li>
            <li>good, not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Better to buy other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it works right away.</li>
            <li>The main thing about this product is that it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>This was our favorite, and we have reordered a few more bottles.  </li>
            <li>(Not really, most of them make great products, I just like that I&#x27;m totally using just these products and my hair is even better than before).</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Great bargain and hard to find at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>What exactly did we think it was, 80% gel and 20% cupcakes?</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed is aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>I remember the first time I bought aloe gel</li>
            <li>The fresh aloe gel isn&#x27;t really like a gel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling on a hot day, and boy, it feels like heaven putting this stuff on your feet at night.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I want to stay natural and chemical free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they did that to make people think it&#x27;s only aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I wish I had purchased it a bit earlier in the healing process to see if it helped reduce scarring, but I&#x27;m pleased with the value.</li>
            <li>sorry I cant give this more stars and I know its a good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a welcome humectant for natural african american hair.</li>
            <li>lets you see exactly how much you have</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast so you need not worry about reapplying it often .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking proper and healthy skin care.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use this with my FaceMaster as conductive solution, and I&#x27;ve used it in the past when my dog had some type of allergic reaction to the grass, it made her more comfortable.</li>
            <li>quite easily, this product clears it all up and protects it from further problems.</li>
            <li>It mixes well with pure coconut oil and glycerine.  </li>
            <li>So you want an aloe gel that is pure aloe.</li>
            <li>, after I finish this bottle I will probably try another brand that is 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>I am certain he will like it</li>
            <li>its helped my fine wrinkled around my eyes especially</li>
            <li>For moisturizing (esp in place of lotion in hot, humid weather), for soothing sunburns, for helping cuts and scrapes heal, I highly recommend this Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li>I have re-purchased it since then, only because the bottle is huge and I never use it up before it starts getting cloudy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it really close to your eyes, and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This gel is very cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use this every night as a mask and wash it off with St. Ives Apricot Scrub (oil free only).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>Aloe vera gel is very soothing on sunburn, rashes, insect bites, and after shaving.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper there.</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;ve really bought is 100% Gel as opposed to liquid..</li>
            <li>Real ALOE doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, and it really is the closest you&#x27;ll get to whacking a leaf off a living plant (which I also have, but don&#x27;t like to mangle).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing this product is not as gentle as it looks.</li>
            <li>product is non scented and very soothing.</li>
            <li>shipping was very efficient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years after getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li>That was when aloe gel was the hot new thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more like extremely watery mucous.  </li>
            <li>I only use it for first aid, because straight up, the fresh aloe makes my skin feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no nasty stickiness just like other gels</li>
            <li>it never fails and I&#x27;m going on my 3rd bottle,actually I&#x27;m about to order another one right now</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it directly on my face which seems to calm down the occasional redness, and of course it&#x27;s great for scentless rough patches on knees and elbows as well...</li>
            <li>has relieved dryness, has softened earwax and sharpened my hearing, which was within normal range anyway.  </li>
            <li>i have to figure out what to use to cleanse my hair that fits in with my new rules)</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>I use this product, in all of my beauty needs, however I love shopping at amazon, you can get this product same size same thing at walmart for only $4.00.</li>
            <li>and i love the slick look.</li>
            <li>It definitely prevents peeling and instantly soothes the burn quickly.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this 5 years ago at my local Wal-Mart, I thought it WAS pure 100%, and I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredient deck.</li>
            <li>guess I could just blow it off and figure it&#x27;s because everyone reacts differently, but what bothers me is that this is marketed as being 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, unscented, and dries without being sticky.</li>
            <li>I specifically bought this AVG for use in hair recipes for my naturally curly 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it soft and it never flakes.</li>
            <li>If looking for a fully natural product, you might consider something like this instead:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJGABA4?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid&#x3D;A2NEC4VHO7GMA8</li>
            <li>This is (nearly) that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use as a hair gel for my natural 4a-c hair as a gel for hold.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it develops rashes and sores,</li>
            <li>ye old house.  </li>
            <li>I always read reviews about this product not being natural but</li>
            <li>After reading the comments here I do realize they probably need to add those other chemicals to keep it fresh while sitting on store shelves.</li>
            <li>I bought it particularly to use as a facial mask to keep my acne at bay and it works well</li>
            <li>It was nothing major, but I wanted to know what was up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, oil free, natural and a little goes a long!</li>
            <li>I only purchase natural aloe (the green stuff is full of chemicals)</li>
            <li>I noticed right away no more development of new pimples or cysts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and use it on my skin hair and daily beauty routine ...</li>
            <li>On rare occasions when the rain stops and that giant yellow thing comes out from behind the clouds, pretty much everyone in Seattle goes from translucent blue skin to lobster-colored sunburn in the space of about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>And it can get messy, and you have to use it fresh.  </li>
            <li>yes, they could theoretically come in handy every few decades, but by the time you need them, you will have misplaced them.</li>
            <li>This label was designed, like other aloe formulas that I&#x27;ve seen, to make the customer think it was pure aloe.</li>
            <li>The only other aloe vera gel I&#x27;ll buy is Walgreen&#x27;s house brand because it also lists aloe vera as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using aloe vera gel for years, and until recently it was not difficult to find versions that were just aloe vera gel without colors or other ingredients that made her skin break out.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels and is very soothing on sunburned or irritated skin</li>
            <li>Using this gel a few times a day has really helped get the skin back closer to normal.</li>
            <li>With aloe listed as the first ingredient by weight, no added colour (why do some manufacturers think they need to add green to their aloe products?), no added scent, this 12-ounce container also is a convenient size.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and worth the money</li>
            <li>The aloe vera may be pure but a little to acrid for my skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> cheap and great product.</li>
            <li> I use this to do Wash and Go&#x27;s and its amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> so my own skin can address the problem and get rid of the blemish.  </li>
            <li> This order came with each of the six bottles I ordered sealed in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, after getting too much sun, and it works great!</li>
            <li> though not as effective as butters for me.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I do like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.  </li>
            <li> tried it just so that I could give an honest review of how it treats my skin even when I found out the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t get expose my skin to the sun too frequently, I can&#x27;t say how good it is for sunburns, but I suspect it is excellent for that use as well.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Now that his hand is healed I use this product as my night leg cream and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its an awesome moisturizer, that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I have made my own sealer that works great as a styler and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very light gel.</li>
            <li> Very light weight</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off not buying it.</li>
            <li> I read an article how dairy food can cause acnes because of the antibotics that are injected in the cows to product more milk.</li>
            <li> My skin would look radiant and healthy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put a top coat on and lay under the fan so it cools my sunburn off.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to find it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF;  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is my favorite aloe.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> This product not only keeps my scalp moist but it ads a wonderful shine that I was looking for that</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many toxic chemicals in this bottle, I don&#x27;t know where they had room for the aloe.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, worth the money and overall a great product!!</li>
            <li> I hope its function of repairing my skin from sun burn is gonna be such perfect as well.</li>
            <li> And there is nothing better for a sunburn than aloe.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff for everything...</li>
            <li> He claimed that for the price, nothing was better.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera has been used for many years to heal damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Aloe is a wonderful topical anti-inflammatory.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any more hold on my hair than when i style just using conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> That is ok but labeling it as</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
            <li> Love this products its got</li>
            <li> so many beneficial beauty uses..definitely a product I buy again and again ..</li>
            <li> So many uses for this product.</li>
            <li> as well i love this gel</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> but besides that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hair all the time because it feels very clean on my hair</li>
            <li> The best treatment I have found for minor burns from the sun or cooking &amp; baking, etc.</li>
            <li> and my skin seems more smooth.</li>
            <li> No strange smells and does the job good!</li>
            <li> This is very refreshing on skin after a good cleanse or just during the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would also make a good hand lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t do that very well.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera gel along with the other oils I purchased have made the perfect hair pudding.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, rub it on face and other parts of body, clears up any skin problems.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that most commercially-available aloe gels are full of alcohol, glycerin, and/or dyes.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I honestly thought it was pure aloe vera gel and nothing else.</li>
            <li> great as a hair styling gel in addition to traditional use for sun burns.  </li>
            <li> So I bought some coconut oil and this on Amazon and now I wash my hair (sulfate/paraben free shampoo, of course.</li>
            <li> It is also a great daily moisturizer, and will not make your skin break out.</li>
            <li> I like to use it when I want a light gel.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil and smooth it on my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Despite the ingredients it feels non-greasy when it dries and the excess on my hands, I just smooth into my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this and found the price reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth after I wipe on my arm.</li>
            <li> I found this product readily available and use it as an after shower application for my body.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve recently found that it&#x27;s a great way to prevent my reoccurring acne too.</li>
            <li> people confirmed this as being deceptive.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, cheap quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my face feels irritated I smooth some of this on</li>
            <li> Great product for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> In an effort to use more natural products, I decided to create my own shampoo.  </li>
            <li> this just has the natural good properties of Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> Two very distinct things.</li>
            <li> A clean, fragrance free gel.  </li>
            <li> Mixed with organic shea butter in the palm of my hand, this made for a great quick moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> With most products, the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li> Great for acne, after shaving, if you get  a minor burn or sunburn.</li>
            <li> Most of the others list water as their first ingredient and/or have alcohol in them (ouch on sunburn).</li>
            <li> Clean and nourishing.</li>
            <li> I keep hearing over and over from friends and family how great aloe vera is for skin irritation, dry skin, and sun burns.</li>
            <li> I did a test to see if it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Dyes are fairly harmless, but alcohol is counter-productive as it further dries the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, effective, and protects your skin.  </li>
            <li> Just use a third of a dime sized amount and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> im sure i can find some elsewhere for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> Great to be able to find this on the internet as it is hard to find  in a store.  </li>
            <li> the freshly cut leaves better for burns and to help heal skin, but the plant has its drawbacks, too, primarily the fact that when you cut off a leaf, it&#x27;s going to take time for a new one to grow.  </li>
            <li> The anitbotics are like pregnant hormones, so when you eat dairy food, your body thinks you&#x27;re pregnant and cause your hormones to go out of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ran out quickly</li>
            <li> Amazon must change the title of the product so that quick shoppers are not deceived.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased since he could not find locally.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to check online for it sooner, Fruit of the earth seems to be the only one on the market that is unscented, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used it on my burn from a very hot pizza that flipped over my hand and got cheese and sauce stucked to my hand.</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective and does not cause my skin to break out - I use it after waxing and it&#x27;s cheaper than the usual post-axing products sold, and as effective</li>
            <li> use it to calm irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that it is worth buying</li>
            <li> Aloe gel is the best ingredient to thin your lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and can be used for many things.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s only good for the most minor of burns, what&#x27;s the point in using it?</li>
            <li> good, not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Better to buy other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it works right away.</li>
            <li> The main thing about this product is that it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> This was our favorite, and we have reordered a few more bottles.  </li>
            <li> (Not really, most of them make great products, I just like that I&#x27;m totally using just these products and my hair is even better than before).</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and hard to find at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> What exactly did we think it was, 80% gel and 20% cupcakes?</li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed is aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> I remember the first time I bought aloe gel</li>
            <li> The fresh aloe gel isn&#x27;t really like a gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling on a hot day, and boy, it feels like heaven putting this stuff on your feet at night.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I want to stay natural and chemical free.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure they did that to make people think it&#x27;s only aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased it a bit earlier in the healing process to see if it helped reduce scarring, but I&#x27;m pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> sorry I cant give this more stars and I know its a good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a welcome humectant for natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> lets you see exactly how much you have</li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast so you need not worry about reapplying it often .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking proper and healthy skin care.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this with my FaceMaster as conductive solution, and I&#x27;ve used it in the past when my dog had some type of allergic reaction to the grass, it made her more comfortable.</li>
            <li> quite easily, this product clears it all up and protects it from further problems.</li>
            <li> It mixes well with pure coconut oil and glycerine.  </li>
            <li> So you want an aloe gel that is pure aloe.</li>
            <li> , after I finish this bottle I will probably try another brand that is 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> I am certain he will like it</li>
            <li> its helped my fine wrinkled around my eyes especially</li>
            <li> For moisturizing (esp in place of lotion in hot, humid weather), for soothing sunburns, for helping cuts and scrapes heal, I highly recommend this Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> I have re-purchased it since then, only because the bottle is huge and I never use it up before it starts getting cloudy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it really close to your eyes, and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This gel is very cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every night as a mask and wash it off with St. Ives Apricot Scrub (oil free only).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera gel is very soothing on sunburn, rashes, insect bites, and after shaving.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper there.</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;ve really bought is 100% Gel as opposed to liquid..</li>
            <li> Real ALOE doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, and it really is the closest you&#x27;ll get to whacking a leaf off a living plant (which I also have, but don&#x27;t like to mangle).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing this product is not as gentle as it looks.</li>
            <li> product is non scented and very soothing.</li>
            <li> shipping was very efficient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years after getting too much sun.  </li>
            <li> That was when aloe gel was the hot new thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more like extremely watery mucous.  </li>
            <li> I only use it for first aid, because straight up, the fresh aloe makes my skin feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no nasty stickiness just like other gels</li>
            <li> it never fails and I&#x27;m going on my 3rd bottle,actually I&#x27;m about to order another one right now</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it directly on my face which seems to calm down the occasional redness, and of course it&#x27;s great for scentless rough patches on knees and elbows as well...</li>
            <li> has relieved dryness, has softened earwax and sharpened my hearing, which was within normal range anyway.  </li>
            <li> i have to figure out what to use to cleanse my hair that fits in with my new rules)</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I use this product, in all of my beauty needs, however I love shopping at amazon, you can get this product same size same thing at walmart for only $4.00.</li>
            <li> and i love the slick look.</li>
            <li> It definitely prevents peeling and instantly soothes the burn quickly.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this 5 years ago at my local Wal-Mart, I thought it WAS pure 100%, and I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredient deck.</li>
            <li> guess I could just blow it off and figure it&#x27;s because everyone reacts differently, but what bothers me is that this is marketed as being 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, unscented, and dries without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this AVG for use in hair recipes for my naturally curly 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it soft and it never flakes.</li>
            <li> If looking for a fully natural product, you might consider something like this instead:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJGABA4?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid&#x3D;A2NEC4VHO7GMA8</li>
            <li> This is (nearly) that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a hair gel for my natural 4a-c hair as a gel for hold.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it develops rashes and sores,</li>
            <li> ye old house.  </li>
            <li> I always read reviews about this product not being natural but</li>
            <li> After reading the comments here I do realize they probably need to add those other chemicals to keep it fresh while sitting on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I bought it particularly to use as a facial mask to keep my acne at bay and it works well</li>
            <li> It was nothing major, but I wanted to know what was up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper, oil free, natural and a little goes a long!</li>
            <li> I only purchase natural aloe (the green stuff is full of chemicals)</li>
            <li> I noticed right away no more development of new pimples or cysts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and use it on my skin hair and daily beauty routine ...</li>
            <li> On rare occasions when the rain stops and that giant yellow thing comes out from behind the clouds, pretty much everyone in Seattle goes from translucent blue skin to lobster-colored sunburn in the space of about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> And it can get messy, and you have to use it fresh.  </li>
            <li> yes, they could theoretically come in handy every few decades, but by the time you need them, you will have misplaced them.</li>
            <li> This label was designed, like other aloe formulas that I&#x27;ve seen, to make the customer think it was pure aloe.</li>
            <li> The only other aloe vera gel I&#x27;ll buy is Walgreen&#x27;s house brand because it also lists aloe vera as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using aloe vera gel for years, and until recently it was not difficult to find versions that were just aloe vera gel without colors or other ingredients that made her skin break out.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels and is very soothing on sunburned or irritated skin</li>
            <li> Using this gel a few times a day has really helped get the skin back closer to normal.</li>
            <li> With aloe listed as the first ingredient by weight, no added colour (why do some manufacturers think they need to add green to their aloe products?), no added scent, this 12-ounce container also is a convenient size.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and worth the money</li>
            <li> The aloe vera may be pure but a little to acrid for my skin</li>
            <li> Said it was natural but has other ingredients</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain all the extra artificial additives many others put in,  </li>
            <li> Without going into graphic detail, the wound was beginning to develop into a dry scar.</li>
            <li> A teeny, teeny, tiny dab the size of a small pin-head rubbed gently and carefully into each of my ears on occasion</li>
            <li> We have had a hard time finding pure Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li> I noticed when I used it near my eyes, they burned a little.  </li>
            <li> A little scent, but seems like it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li> The 100% is carefully placed next to the word Gel.</li>
            <li> I put this everyday after I wash my face and helps with removing my old acne</li>
            <li> She uses it daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin the way other brands do.</li>
            <li> This makes my makeup last a bit longer than with other primers, as I am oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This size bottle has lasted me a very long time I bought it almost two summers ago and the bottle still isn&#x27;t finished...</li>
            <li> If I get dry skin patches on my arms or legs--just dry skin--this clears that up immediately.  </li>
            <li> No obnoxious perfume smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> As a result my scalp gets really dry.</li>
            <li> It soothes and aids in healing dry chapped skin.</li>
            <li> I have a patch of dry skin.(something like a sunburned)</li>
            <li> I use vitamin e oil from CoCo Care that I ordered off Amazon to help with the peeling and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is not the product for you if you have dry skin to start with.</li>
            <li> THEN I decided, I&#x27;m going to try and use only things that I can eat in my hair (because I read a post on naturallycurly.com about the active ingredients in hair products and was like, Dude, I could just get those things..)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Fruit of the Earth tries to deceive, you need to read the labels on all products.</li>
            <li> Read the label carefully.  </li>
            <li> Everything was just as I expected, no surprises.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and other areas that simply need just a little assistance.  </li>
            <li> I decided a little while ago that I&#x27;d stop using hair products with sulfates, parabens, silicones, and harsh chemicals in general.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product over almost every other aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> As usual with aloe it goes on sticky then instantly dries.  </li>
            <li> It might help with sunburns, I&#x27;m not sure since I never put it only on one side of me to see if I healed faster.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviews is slightly misleading.</li>
            <li> I like this brand because it doesn&#x27;t use potentially irritating preservatives and the clear bottle</li>
            <li> fade scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> ALL the other ingrediants TOGETHER comprise less than 0.5% of the contents, so they can round it to 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when my skin is irritated with any chemical it subdues the burning and redness within half an hour.</li>
            <li> and then I use half a small spoon of coconut oil and the other half with this aloe vera and my hair</li>
            <li> I mix a little in my palm with some coconut oil and rub it all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little sticky when you apply it, however.  </li>
            <li> An elderly friend tried that and began to hear well again after having trouble hearing.  </li>
            <li> this product is not for sensitive skin and the gel is weird.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday after the beach and to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks on my face for my acne and acne scars, as well as redness from having acne.  </li>
            <li> Cooling &amp; takes pain away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel to slick down my edges because i wear my hair in a bun a lot</li>
            <li> It seemed like it might have helped a little bit on one small burn, but it feels like a chemical burn when I put it on a burn</li>
            <li> I usually put some on then after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my son who uses as a hair conditioner in small amounts.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the toxins and chemicals, then why not just go to your local Walgreens and get a bottle of &#x27;fake aloe&#x27; for $3.    </li>
            <li> When I use this product on my face though I notice that it makes my eyes water and burn really badly, I&#x27;m not sure what it is in this product</li>
            <li> I usually use Aloe for sunburn</li>
            <li> You will want to thin it down.</li>
            <li> And my hair never feels hard using this gel</li>
            <li> I can hardly feel it on my skin.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little bit worse.    </li>
            <li> Both burns appeared 1st degree, though the worse one did eventually bleed a little.  </li>
            <li> Using coconut oil and cocoa butter makes thick butter type lotion.</li>
            <li> If you know what I mean, but you dont</li>
            <li> And glycerin is irritating on raw sunburn.</li>
            <li> I believe this is what is irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> After spending a whole day in pool my husband had real bad sunburns</li>
            <li> 100% Aloe is hard to find and impossible to pour.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for over twenty years but for some reason the stores in my area haven&#x27;t been carrying it in recent years and was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> Except for how expensive those types of products are.....  </li>
            <li> It actually made it worst.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong to keep a bottle of this in your house.</li>
            <li> It contains no alcohol or artificial color or perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in my fridge to keep it cold.</li>
            <li> I am appalled that this product is so expensive on this shopping page.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> but like me some of us are allergic:(</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use I&#x27;m sad to say as it gave me terrible rash.</li>
            <li> of which is dangerously toxic!</li>
            <li> This product serves as a base for the shampoo recipe I chose.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a doctor, so the following is not medical advice but just my observations.  People comment that my face doesn&#x27;t have wrinkles, and I am in my 60s.  I attribute this to using Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera gel [with no alcohol in it] on my facial skin daily, alone or under make-up.  If I get dry skin patches on my arms or legs--just dry skin--this clears that up immediately.  [However, if you have fungus patches, this is not helpful for that, I don&#x27;t think.]  If I have pain in a joint--very seldom--this stuff applied topically cools it off so I get a good sleep.  It has no alcohol in it, so it doesn&#x27;t harm skin, and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores at all.  It has no color--it is clear--so doesn&#x27;t leave any tint of color on skin.  If I  get a blemish, this helps heal it by moisturizing my skin in a non-greasy way so my own skin can address the problem and get rid of the blemish.  Don&#x27;t use it really close to your eyes, and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  I have used it carefully every now and then even on the areas around my eyes and eyelids without any problems, but it should NOT be used directly around the eyes or in them.  It will sting, and it says on the bottle not to use it in or around your eyes.  A teeny, teeny, tiny dab the size of a small pin-head rubbed gently and carefully into each of my ears on occasion has relieved dryness, has softened earwax and sharpened my hearing, which was within normal range anyway.  An elderly friend tried that and began to hear well again after having trouble hearing.  Don&#x27;t know if that will work for others, but just reporting what he told me.  Try it.  I think you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do. This order came with each of the six bottles I ordered sealed in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li> use in cobination with lotion  used twice a day and did not peel  would recomend this to any one with sunburn</li>
            <li> I use aloe vera fairly often....especially good for burns and sunburn</li>
            <li> Not 100% aloe. 100% gel rather. ...What exactly did we think it was, 80% gel and 20% cupcakes? This label was designed, like other aloe formulas that I&#x27;ve seen, to make the customer think it was pure aloe. It isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re better off not buying it.</li>
            <li> This gel is very cooling on the skin. I mix it with aromatherapy oils for itch relief on myself and my dogs.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my son who uses as a hair conditioner in small amounts.  He is very pleased since he could not find locally.  Thank you</li>
            <li> A clean, fragrance free gel.  great as a hair styling gel in addition to traditional use for sun burns.  great to have around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I noticed a big improvement in my skin. The red marks are fading and no pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do want to mention that I did a test on myself before I start using this product. I read an article how dairy food can cause acnes because of the antibotics that are injected in the cows to product more milk. The anitbotics are like pregnant hormones, so when you eat dairy food, your body thinks you&#x27;re pregnant and cause your hormones to go out of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did a test to see if it&#x27;s true. I had no dairy food for 2 weeks and what a difference I saw in my face. I noticed right away no more development of new pimples or cysts. Then I decided to go back to dairy food again. I started breaking out again. From then on, I cut out dairy food and I haven&#x27;t had another pimple again. But I had another problem. The scars and red marks are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is when I found FOTE from T-tapp website. Once I started using this product, I noticed the red marks fading immediately and my skin seems more smooth. I use this every night as a mask and wash it off with St. Ives Apricot Scrub (oil free only). My skin would look radiant and healthy in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to help the red marks and scars on your face but do try testing yourself to see if dairy food is also another problem that is causing your acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, after getting too much sun, and it works great! I usually put some on then after a few minutes I&#x27;ll put a top coat on and lay under the fan so it cools my sunburn off. It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this AVG for use in hair recipes for my naturally curly 3c/4a hair.  Mixed with organic shea butter in the palm of my hand, this made for a great quick moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve also used it directly on my face which seems to calm down the occasional redness, and of course it&#x27;s great for scentless rough patches on knees and elbows as well... though not as effective as butters for me.  This is a staple product, IMO.  Kind of hard to go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it as a hair gel for my curly girl hair. No obnoxious perfume smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Walmart used to carry it and we would buy 6 bottles at a time. They have stopped carrying it and I am so glad to find it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This gel was recommended to me to apply following radiation treatments and was sold at the hospital pharmacy.  It contains no alcohol or artificial color or perfumes.  The first ingredient listed is aloe vera gel.  This gel helped my skin heal from the effects of radiation.  This is a wonderful product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ran out quickly but I love it! I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I decided a little while ago that I&#x27;d stop using hair products with sulfates, parabens, silicones, and harsh chemicals in general. That worked out well for my curly hair: it was curling very nicely, everything looked awesome. Except for how expensive those types of products are.....  THEN I decided, I&#x27;m going to try and use only things that I can eat in my hair (because I read a post on naturallycurly.com about the active ingredients in hair products and was like, Dude, I could just get those things..)  So I bought some coconut oil and this on Amazon and now I wash my hair (sulfate/paraben free shampoo, of course. i have to figure out what to use to cleanse my hair that fits in with my new rules) and then I use half a small spoon of coconut oil and the other half with this aloe vera and my hair looks freaking awesome.   Like better than when I was using those expensive organic products (for example: Jessicul products, DevaCurl, Alaffia Beautiful Curls).   Take that hair product companies!! (Not really, most of them make great products, I just like that I&#x27;m totally using just these products and my hair is even better than before).</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF;  NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLERGIC TO THIS;  CAN USE ON BURNS, AS HAIR GEL, ETC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I use this product in my hair. It makes my hair super soft and manageable. I absolutely love it and will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair when I need a very light hold , it works wonderfully... Very light gel. And my hair never feels hard using this gel</li>
            <li> Fruit of the Earth has been around for, hmm, maybe 30 years?  I remember the first time I bought aloe gel it was Fruit of the Earth.  That was when aloe gel was the hot new thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an aloe vera plant, too.  It&#x27;s been growing about 20 years.  Honestly, I do like the freshly cut leaves better for burns and to help heal skin, but the plant has its drawbacks, too, primarily the fact that when you cut off a leaf, it&#x27;s going to take time for a new one to grow.  And it can get messy, and you have to use it fresh.  The fresh aloe gel isn&#x27;t really like a gel.  It&#x27;s really more like extremely watery mucous.  I only use it for first aid, because straight up, the fresh aloe makes my skin feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did some research on the ingredients after I&#x27;ve used this for a while.  I noticed when I used it near my eyes, they burned a little.  It was nothing major, but I wanted to know what was up.  Besides aloe vera, this product contains, pH adjustor, thickeners, stabilizers, preservative (tocopherol), and anti-microbials.  I&#x27;ve no intention of writing a thesis, but my research revealed that several ingredients may irritate the eyes.  These types of ingredients are required for a uniform product with some shelf life, and protection from yeasty beasties.  So don&#x27;t put it around your eyes, OK?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to calm irritated skin.  It&#x27;s cooling on a hot day, and boy, it feels like heaven putting this stuff on your feet at night.  I use it to help wounds heal faster, and as an after shave/after epilation.  Sometimes I just put it on because I feel like using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I do have the eye irritation that I have to work around, I recommend this.  I researched a lot of aloe vera gels on Amazon, and this is the best formulation I could find, bar none.  Please note this is not a food grade aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> Wonderful gel. Clean and nourishing. Works great in home made moisturizer. I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking proper and healthy skin care.</li>
            <li> I get alot of burns at work, and I heard that Aloe Vera helps.  It seemed like it might have helped a little bit on one small burn, but it feels like a chemical burn when I put it on a burn that&#x27;s a little bit worse.    Both burns appeared 1st degree, though the worse one did eventually bleed a little.  (The second one had a blister, which came off before I put the aloe vera on.    If it&#x27;s only good for the most minor of burns, what&#x27;s the point in using it?</li>
            <li> Said it was natural but has other ingredients</li>
            <li> I prefer this product over almost every other aloe vera gel. Look at the ingredient list. With most products, the first ingredient is water. The only other aloe vera gel I&#x27;ll buy is Walgreen&#x27;s house brand because it also lists aloe vera as the first ingredient. Aloe vera gel is very soothing on sunburn, rashes, insect bites, and after shaving. It is also a great daily moisturizer, and will not make your skin break out. I have oily skin and use this even on my face.</li>
            <li> This works great on my hair. I like to use it when I want a light gel. Keeps it soft and it never flakes. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it daily. Only reason I got from Amazon was because Walmart was sold out. Much cheaper there. Go to Walmart instead.    Otherwise, this is my favorite aloe. It&#x27;s clear, unscented, and dries without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 3 year now. It&#x27;s a great product. I apply it to my hair all the time because it feels very clean on my hair and there&#x27;s no nasty stickiness just like other gels and I get the look that I always want. I also use it to moisturize my face sometimes and use it for sunburns and rashes. It works so well!</li>
            <li> Best Aloe product Ever purchased!  No stinging.  Soothing.  Keeps skin soft and smooth.  Will buy again...</li>
            <li> My wife has been using aloe vera gel for years, and until recently it was not difficult to find versions that were just aloe vera gel without colors or other ingredients that made her skin break out. She had used Fruit of the Earth before and was happy when I found I could buy it from Amazon. She uses it daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin the way other brands do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aloe vera. What more is there to say? No strange smells and does the job good!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but the labeling is misleading in my opinion so I will point it out here.  It says 100% gel.  But this may lead you (me) to believe it is 100% Aloe Gel, which it is not. :-(  If looking for a fully natural product, you might consider something like this instead:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJGABA4?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid&#x3D;A2NEC4VHO7GMA8</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a day. As a result my scalp gets really dry. This product not only keeps my scalp moist but it ads a wonderful shine that I was looking for that I can&#x27;t find elsewhere...I have purchased before and will continue to use this product as my only skin care product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.  When I purchased this 5 years ago at my local Wal-Mart, I thought it WAS pure 100%, and I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredient deck. I don&#x27;t think Fruit of the Earth tries to deceive, you need to read the labels on all products. I use this with my FaceMaster as conductive solution, and I&#x27;ve used it in the past when my dog had some type of allergic reaction to the grass, it made her more comfortable. I have re-purchased it since then, only because the bottle is huge and I never use it up before it starts getting cloudy.</li>
            <li> If you care about your health, then don&#x27;t buy this product.   There&#x27;s so many toxic chemicals in this bottle, I don&#x27;t know where they had room for the aloe.   Read the label carefully.  It READS,  100% GEL AND NOT 100% ALOE VERA.  See the deception ?   The 100% is carefully placed next to the word Gel. What you&#x27;ve really bought is 100% Gel as opposed to liquid..etc.        If you google each of the chemicals listed in the ingredients, you will find that they are toxins.    If you don&#x27;t mind the toxins and chemicals, then why not just go to your local Walgreens and get a bottle of &#x27;fake aloe&#x27; for $3.    If you put it on a skin rash or irritation, it burns.   Real ALOE doesn&#x27;t burn.  Check it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product! I mix it with just about everything to give moisture to my concoctions.  It mixes well with pure coconut oil and glycerine.  Its an awesome moisturizer, that I highly recommend.  I mix it with coconut oil and smooth it on my face at night.  Despite the ingredients it feels non-greasy when it dries and the excess on my hands, I just smooth into my hairline.  It&#x27;s a welcome humectant for natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent for burns of any kind including sun burns.  Aloe is good for promoting healing.</li>
            <li> I like the product but you can get this for 2 dollars at Walmart!</li>
            <li> I use it every day for several purposes. It&#x27;s a good size, worth the money and overall a great product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that delivers the needed soothing effect.  A plus for our family is not having to deal with colors and scents of similar products on the market.  We have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> This product is a great primer. It&#x27;s cheaper, oil free, natural and a little goes a long! This makes my makeup last a bit longer than with other primers, as I am oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera for over twenty years but for some reason the stores in my area haven&#x27;t been carrying it in recent years and was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to check online for it sooner, Fruit of the earth seems to be the only one on the market that is unscented, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great to be able to find this on the internet as it is hard to find  in a store.  Very soothing. Great for acne, after shaving, if you get  a minor burn or sunburn. We like it a lot!!</li>
            <li> Anything that says 100% Aloe Vera I Love!</li>
            <li> Contains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Gel&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;DMDM Hydantoin&lt;br /&gt;Diazolidinyl Urea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Plus stabilizers and preservatives (not listed in ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Aloe</li>
            <li> Fruit Of The Earth Fruit Of The Earth 100 % Aloe Vera Gel worked for my oily acne prone skin. I used&lt;br /&gt;the aloe vera on my face twice a day and it cleared my acne up. I would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;anyone dealing with acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li> Everything was just as I expected, no surprises.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get purer than 100%. I&#x27;m thrilled with this and found the price reasonable. I mix a little in my palm with some coconut oil and rub it all over. I also mix some with my hair gel. I&#x27;ll buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought it particularly to use as a facial mask to keep my acne at bay and it works well</li>
            <li> Always good stuff to use on skin cuts and irritations and sun burn.</li>
            <li> Always good to have. Need it on hand all the time.  good stuff.  What else can I say about a good thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth after I wipe on my arm. It&#x27;s totally not sticky! I can hardly feel it on my skin. I hope its function of repairing my skin from sun burn is gonna be such perfect as well.</li>
            <li> this product is not for sensitive skin and the gel is weird. I used it once and threw it away. i will not reorder or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Product uses Formaldehyde releasing agents (DMDM Hydantoin &amp; Diazolidinyl Urea) as preservatives.  Not only is the product not 100% Aloe Vera, it is also carcinogenic.  Product should not be used for any type of health reason, but may be used to help rejuvenate skin on a dissected frog or cadaver.</li>
            <li> people in south florida should all have one of these in their medicine cabinet. essential for sun damage relief.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product in order to diminish the scars i had from hip replacement surgery and i am very pleased and amazed that this product has worked n such a short time. i would recommend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  The aloe vera gel along with the other oils I purchased have made the perfect hair pudding.  I love the way my hair feels and the results of my twist set!!!</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle. On rare occasions when the rain stops and that giant yellow thing comes out from behind the clouds, pretty much everyone in Seattle goes from translucent blue skin to lobster-colored sunburn in the space of about 15 minutes. I&#x27;m no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying sunscreen in Seattle makes no sense. It&#x27;d be like buying snowshoes in the Sahara Desert -- yes, they could theoretically come in handy every few decades, but by the time you need them, you will have misplaced them. Same with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when we get sun, we get burned. And there is nothing better for a sunburn than aloe. The problem is that most commercially-available aloe gels are full of alcohol, glycerin, and/or dyes. Dyes are fairly harmless, but alcohol is counter-productive as it further dries the skin. And glycerin is irritating on raw sunburn. So you want an aloe gel that is pure aloe. This is (nearly) that. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> cheap and great product. no complaints</li>
            <li> Use it everyday after the beach and to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Great bargain and hard to find at Walgreens. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff for everything...moisturizer, boo-boo aid, sunburn. You can use it ANYWHERE you can reach (skin or tissue).</li>
            <li> With aloe listed as the first ingredient by weight, no added colour (why do some manufacturers think they need to add green to their aloe products?), no added scent, this 12-ounce container also is a convenient size. For moisturizing (esp in place of lotion in hot, humid weather), for soothing sunburns, for helping cuts and scrapes heal, I highly recommend this Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel. Nice attractive packaging and appealing brand name, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT 100% Aloe Vera. The bottle says 100% Gel....How sneaky of them...&lt;br /&gt;I realized this after getting home.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Gel, Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl, Acetate, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl UREA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it just so that I could give an honest review of how it treats my skin even when I found out the ingredients. Well, it&#x27;s drying. My skin was not moisturized from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not willing to try it again. I&#x27;m just going to take it back and buy 100% Aloe Vera Gel from another company and also buy a $4 Aloe Vera Plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this works for you, that&#x27;s good. But if you&#x27;re someone expecting 100% Aloe, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. It&#x27;s just 100% Gel. Whatever that means.</li>
            <li> The item did meet my expectations.  In an effort to use more natural products, I decided to create my own shampoo.  This product serves as a base for the shampoo recipe I chose.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Wal-Mart and thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts on it, on here.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks on my face for my acne and acne scars, as well as redness from having acne.  I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of a difference, but I still have been breaking out.  When I use this product on my face though I notice that it makes my eyes water and burn really badly, I&#x27;m not sure what it is in this product making my eyes do this, but I have to sit in front of a fan and close my eyes for a about a minute or two for it to stop.  I have also noticed that this isn&#x27;t actually 100% aloe vera gel, after I finish this bottle I will probably try another brand that is 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice price, works well.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it is worth buying</li>
            <li> Very good deal.  Very light weight and this is good since I use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> it helps wounds heal and I would purchase this item again ,I use this Item again and again when I need it.</li>
            <li> I started using Aloe Vera lotion after a visit to a dermatologist. He claimed that for the price, nothing was better. Aloe Vera has been used for many years to heal damaged skin. I found this product readily available and use it as an after shower application for my body. It soothes and aids in healing dry chapped skin. Though I don&#x27;t get expose my skin to the sun too frequently, I can&#x27;t say how good it is for sunburns, but I suspect it is excellent for that use as well.</li>
            <li> The main thing about this product is that it is alcohol free. This was recommended to me by my oncologist to limit the effects of radiation. So far, it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> 100% Aloe is hard to find and impossible to pour.  I knew that going in</li>
            <li> One of the other reviews is slightly misleading. On the front it says Aloe Vera 100% Gel, on the back it says \\&quot;100% Aloe Vera Gel\\&quot; - it&#x27;s just presentation, not misleading. ALL the other ingrediants TOGETHER comprise less than 0.5% of the contents, so they can round it to 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, and it really is the closest you&#x27;ll get to whacking a leaf off a living plant (which I also have, but don&#x27;t like to mangle). Most of the others list water as their first ingredient and/or have alcohol in them (ouch on sunburn).</li>
            <li> This is the best non-prescription product I&#x27;ve ever found for rosacea.</li>
            <li> Aloe is a wonderful topical anti-inflammatory.  I like this brand because it doesn&#x27;t use potentially irritating preservatives and the clear bottle lets you see exactly how much you have, so you know when to reorder.  I keep mine in the fridge both to extend freshness and to make it extra-soothing when applied.</li>
            <li> I have been making my lotion. I want to stay natural and chemical free. Aloe gel is the best ingredient to thin your lotion. Using coconut oil and cocoa butter makes thick butter type lotion. You will want to thin it down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better.  Great for babies, kids, and parents alike.  With one lotion, no need to buy multiple brands.  It&#x27;s natural, effective, and protects your skin.  As usual with aloe it goes on sticky then instantly dries.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I use this to do Wash and Go&#x27;s and its amazing. It helped my hair with friz, and it promoted some hair growth. I also use it for acne.</li>
            <li> We ordered several brands of Aloe vera gels.  This was our favorite, and we have reordered a few more bottles.  It doesn&#x27;t contain all the extra artificial additives many others put in,  this just has the natural good properties of Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective and does not cause my skin to break out - I use it after waxing and it&#x27;s cheaper than the usual post-axing products sold, and as effective</li>
            <li> sorry I cant give this more stars and I know its a good product but like me some of us are allergic:( Couldn&#x27;t use I&#x27;m sad to say as it gave me terrible rash.</li>
            <li> The gel was very good. I used it on my burn from a very hot pizza that flipped over my hand and got cheese and sauce stucked to my hand.</li>
            <li> A Tanwan show recommended this, so I bought it.  The aloe vera may be pure but a little to acrid for my skin</li>
            <li> Like it very much. Helps me.</li>
            <li> The best treatment I have found for minor burns from the sun or cooking &amp; baking, etc. Cooling &amp; takes pain away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a hair gel for my natural 4a-c hair as a gel for hold. It doesn&#x27;t have any more hold on my hair than when i style just using conditioner. Luckily, I have made my own sealer that works great as a styler and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally; they all had alcohol and/or fragrance.  Love this.  A little goes a long way and worth the money</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  We use it on our faces.  It has cleared up my teens acne, as well as my roseacea.  Haven&#x27;t used it on sunburns or anything yet, but plan to keep it around just in case.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to use as a fetal Doppler gel and it does the job. My husband likes to use iron his hair. It&#x27;s a good multipurpose product.</li>
            <li> I keep hearing over and over from friends and family how great aloe vera is for skin irritation, dry skin, and sun burns. I know I&#x27;m in the minority here but I don&#x27;t find it to moisturize at all, just leave a coating on my skin. It might help with sunburns, I&#x27;m not sure since I never put it only on one side of me to see if I healed faster. But my biggest problem is for something that is supposed to be so soothing to skin it stings when I put it on and even being inches from my eyes it makes my eyes burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I could just blow it off and figure it&#x27;s because everyone reacts differently, but what bothers me is that this is marketed as being 100% pure aloe vera gel. I believe this is what is irritating my skin. When I bought it I honestly thought it was pure aloe vera gel and nothing else. After reading the comments here I do realize they probably need to add those other chemicals to keep it fresh while sitting on store shelves. That is ok but labeling it as \\&quot;100% gel\\&quot; and \\&quot;pure\\&quot; is misleading and I&#x27;m sure they did that to make people think it&#x27;s only aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I only purchase natural aloe (the green stuff is full of chemicals) and this one is great.  I usually use Aloe for sunburn but I&#x27;ve recently found that it&#x27;s a great way to prevent my reoccurring acne too.</li>
            <li> Ingredients include... Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some of which is dangerously toxic! BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> What a terrific way to shop!  Thank you for making life easier!</li>
            <li> I use this as a pre-shave gel for my wet-dry electric shaver. I had hoped it would also make a good hand lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t do that very well.</li>
            <li> I figured that this would be an awesome product to have. It&#x27;s all natural and can be used for many things. It&#x27;s great for the skin, and hair.</li>
            <li> I put this everyday after I wash my face and helps with removing my old acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Also when my skin is irritated with any chemical it subdues the burning and redness within half an hour.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, rub it on face and other parts of body, clears up any skin problems.  I have sensitive skin and it develops rashes and sores, quite easily, this product clears it all up and protects it from further problems.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for my face bc I have a patch of dry skin.(something like a sunburned) It actually made it worst. I have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m guessing this product is not as gentle as it looks. I don&#x27;t think its some moistuzer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping this in stock @ ye old house.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I use it for my hair and other areas that simply need just a little assistance.  If you know what I mean, but you dont</li>
            <li> I always read reviews about this product not being natural but either way it&#x27;s a very good product. This size bottle has lasted me a very long time I bought it almost two summers ago and the bottle still isn&#x27;t finished... It has help aide the healing process with several of my scars, and I even use it on my face from time to time. Yes it dries my face out and makes it peel a lot but it eventually evens my skin tone fade scars and dark spots. I use vitamin e oil from CoCo Care that I ordered off Amazon to help with the peeling and dry skin. Great combo,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is very refreshing on skin after a good cleanse or just during the middle of the day.A little goes a long way. Just use a third of a dime sized amount and you&#x27;re good.👍</li>
            <li> i only gave this product a 4 star based on the bottle cap. i wish it were a pump versus the squeeze and pour type. product is non scented and very soothing. non sticky once it dries. shipping was very efficient</li>
            <li> We have had a hard time finding pure Aloe Vera Gel so it was a great thing to find it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for body and hair!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time not only for sunburned skin, but daily use too.  It&#x27;s just a little sticky when you apply it, however.  A little scent, but seems like it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li> I use this product, in all of my beauty needs, however I love shopping at amazon, you can get this product same size same thing at walmart for only $4.00. and you do not pay shipping and handleing!! I am appalled that this product is so expensive on this shopping page. Please shoppers if you can get the same product cheaper at your local stores! just trying to save ya&#x27;ll money!</li>
            <li> The title of the product says 100% Aloe Vera Gel whereas the bottle says 100 Gel. Two very distinct things. I almost bought it but then thought of looking for reviews before buying and good thing people confirmed this as being deceptive. Amazon must change the title of the product so that quick shoppers are not deceived.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel to speed up the healing of a deepish cut on a knuckle. Without going into graphic detail, the wound was beginning to develop into a dry scar. Using this gel a few times a day has really helped get the skin back closer to normal. I wish I had purchased it a bit earlier in the healing process to see if it helped reduce scarring, but I&#x27;m pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> After spending a whole day in pool my husband had real bad sunburns so I ordered this and was really happy with the product. This provided relief for his itchy, peeling sunburnt skin. It dries pretty fast so you need not worry about reapplying it often . Now that his hand is healed I use this product as my night leg cream and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product for any uses for aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;I use it especially for my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is a terrific cleanser for my face as well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product and I use it in my curly hair(3a/3b) as a locker to keep my hair moisturizer...it never fails and I&#x27;m going on my 3rd bottle,actually I&#x27;m about to order another one right now lol</li>
            <li> Love this products its got so many beneficial beauty uses..definitely a product I buy again and again ..I&#x27;m 36 years old and use it on my skin hair and daily beauty routine ...its helped my fine wrinkled around my eyes especially</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son&#x27;s burns.. I am certain he will like it</li>
            <li> Cheap price, cheap quality.&lt;br /&gt;Not good, not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Better to buy other product.&lt;br /&gt;Never buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;If there were no returning fee, I would return.</li>
            <li> This is not the product for you if you have dry skin to start with. The palms of my hands started to crack after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years after getting too much sun.  It definitely prevents peeling and instantly soothes the burn quickly.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera gel. What&#x27;s not to like. So many uses for this product. You just can&#x27;t go wrong to keep a bottle of this in your house. When my face feels irritated I smooth some of this on and it works right away. I keep it in my fridge to keep it cold. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Came as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be included in every postpartum vaginal/natural delivery momma&#x27;s gift bag!</li>
            <li> I purchased this gel to slick down my edges because i wear my hair in a bun a lot and i love the slick look. when i received the product i found myself using it for not just my hair. I used it for my skin from time to time as well i love this gel it doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels and is very soothing on sunburned or irritated skin i even use it when in shaping my eyebrows with my eyebrow razor. I love this product but i will unfortunately not purchase it from amazon its too pricey for the size of the bottle although i still have a small amount left im sure i can find some elsewhere for a much cheaper price but besides that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Great product for multiple uses.</li>
