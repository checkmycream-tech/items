    <ol>
            <li>and this is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>So happy to have a replacement!  </li>
            <li>Love this brush!!!</li>
            <li>I used to have a brush with a combination of nylon quills and bristle and it did a great job.  </li>
            <li>great buy.  </li>
            <li>this brush is so so great i carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for making my hair shiny and keeping oil from accumulating on my scalp.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a great deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>This brush is really great -</li>
            <li>It is a very nice brush.  </li>
            <li>And that is a good reason to buy these as they are great brushes.</li>
            <li>Love this brush and the price is wonderful too.</li>
            <li>Brush is good quality and does its job.</li>
            <li>The size is good, the bristles are good, my problem is with the nylon quills.  </li>
            <li>This brush is good.</li>
            <li>but, it does a good job nonetheless.</li>
            <li>It just feels so good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the $120+ ones</li>
            <li>I bought another one and it is still the excellent quality of the original.  </li>
            <li>Nothing exceptional that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li>it is almost perfect, but not quite going through my hair adequately.</li>
            <li>Great brush...met expectations and more.</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>My daughters love it too!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Hair brushing has gone from something that had to be endured (often with frowns or even tears) to something that is much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Amazing quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if some sort of cleaning tool were included with the brush.</li>
            <li>I used to own a nylon/boar bristle brush from another brand that costs $100+</li>
            <li>I own another brush from this brand that doesn&#x27;t have the nylon bristles</li>
            <li>Puts a nice shine in it as well.</li>
            <li>the combination of natural bristles and the nylon ones is perfect.</li>
            <li>They are longer than the bristles (as they should be) but are just strands of nylon that have been cut straight across the end, which means that they are surprisingly scratchy!  </li>
            <li>and she told me that while she loved hers, she wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail price for it and to try this Denman.  </li>
            <li>(a nylon brush would be better for that task).  </li>
            <li>However, I do wish it were heavier in weight for more styling control.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford the Mason Pearson brand brushes, these are your next best bet.</li>
            <li>They work and many beauticians use these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the brush and love what it does for my hair</li>
            <li>This brush is ok.</li>
            <li>One issue is it does cause static to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>The natural bristles are healthy for your hair, while the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; loosen the tangles and give your scalp a great massage.</li>
            <li>Brush is easy to clean and the large size is great to brush hair with the fewest number of strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUt among natural bristle brushes, this is a great, affordable product.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair--- but very full.</li>
            <li>The boar bristles do feel like they help distribute natural oils a bit, but it takes so many strokes that I end up with static!</li>
            <li>So now I brush with the Conair to remove the tangles, and follow up with the Denman to smooth the hair.  </li>
            <li>but my dog used it as a chew toy, and I thought I could replace it cheaply with this one.</li>
            <li>So now, I brush my hair with another brush to get the tangles out and use this to smooth the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, especially for people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li>was using a cheap brush for over a year and damaged my hair doing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean - the air hole is on the tip of the brush, so is easy to cover when washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the Mason Pearson brush, so I don&#x27;t have much basis of comparison, but for me this brush is just okay.  </li>
            <li>They also have too much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; meaning the brush doesn&#x27;t go through all my hair just the top layer.  </li>
            <li>For the unruly thick hair this is the perfect brush without pulling on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have very kinky natural hair and after a good hair treatment I also enlist the help of the Denman brush for a smooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and product was as described.</li>
            <li>The main reason I love this brush is bc</li>
            <li>well they are, not rough but just perfect to smooth down the edges.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job getting through my long hair, but my nylon Conair does it better.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it, and the nylon bristles really struggle to get through.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even seen her smile while brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>The boar bristles seem to distribute the natural oils your scalp produces more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to find the right brush for me.</li>
            <li>This is the Denman all right.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for my sister and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>and this is soft on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Natural bristle makes a huge difference in your hair, smooths flyaways and distributes oils.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural bristle brush, no compromise however, this doesn&#x27;t fit the exact bill.</li>
            <li>First the pros:  </li>
            <li>I finally just wrote my favorite hair stylist in the world</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it barely makes it through.  </li>
            <li>but I wish the small issues could be fixed to make it great.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered the large.</li>
            <li>If you have some product on your hands, it&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this brush is wonderful for untangling.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favoritest brush I&#x27;ve ever had in my life</li>
            <li>I have not had it for much longer than a month and the plastic bristles are bent.  </li>
            <li>i wasnt expecting this brush to be so much like the mason pierson brush that is 115 times the cost.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair brush.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know much about hair brushes</li>
            <li>I believe this would be good for someone who does not have thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a very nice brush, it appears to be well made and the materials used look basically the same as the more expensive brush.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this brush for a finishing effect after straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and it really works well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well on its way to repair using the Denman Large Natural Bristle Cushion Brush.</li>
            <li>I generally use a different brush to get through any tangles and then use this to smooth out any frizz.</li>
            <li>Within a year of normal use, though, the handle began to crack from the brush body.</li>
            <li>I use a brush comb/cleaner thing to clean it under running water, otherwise it would be hard to get fully clean.</li>
            <li>well, it is a nice looking brush, and very well constructed, but it isn&#x27;t meant for people with very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Natural Bristles are the way to go!  </li>
            <li>have long (below shoulder/mid back-ish) fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted an all natural bristle brush for oil distribution (and trying to limit plastic consumption) and I was surprised when I received this brush - there is one longer nylon quill in each bristle group.</li>
            <li>I like the scratchy nylon bristles, but I&#x27;ve never had a sensitive scalp, so I could see how it might bother some</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worse than most of the very cheap brushes I have bought at drug stores in the past.  </li>
            <li>love it ,little different than mason pierson but close enough and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li>Really helps with thin hair and hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My hands aren&#x27;t huge, but the handle is just small enough</li>
            <li>I imagine it would really pull at wet tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was pretty excited about this brush.  </li>
            <li>It loses some boar bristles every time I clean it.</li>
            <li>This brush has nylon bristles which extend beyond the length of the shorter natural bristles in the brush, and the nylon bristles are rather &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; (the ends haven&#x27;t been rounded, they&#x27;re sharp) but my niece with her sensitive head has no complaints.</li>
            <li>This brush is made well and does a good job of untangling my hair, but it is difficult to use for anything other than simply brushing -- I can&#x27;t do any styling with it, not even to pull my hair into a ponytail</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff enough to handle the thickness of my hair but never uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>What a difference - while the medium is firm and can make it thorough my hair, the large does not.</li>

            <li> Not exactly what I wanted, but I think I probably prefer it over an all natural bristle brush for thoroughness.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, medium thickness hair that falls past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly (medium curls) hair</li>
            <li> I have used this brush as part of my lengthy detangling process after a shower and also on dry hair without the fuzz/staticness like some other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love using it on my toddler&#x27;s hair, so I was disappointed that this brush just doesn&#x27;t measure up for me.</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles are sharp, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and visibly scratched my face and ear.  </li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair and have never thought of myself as having a sensitive scalp, but the nylon bristles in this brush scratched my head in an uncomfortable way.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for at least 10 years and it finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken off completely, but I suspect it will soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to distribute the oils in my long, thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that takes some time to brush thoroughly</li>
            <li> I just grip the back of the brush when my hand gets tired.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> wish the handle weren&#x27;t so small.</li>
            <li> Handle is small.  </li>
            <li> It does tame some of the frizz in my hair, but I have fairly thick hair</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to get all the way through</li>
            <li> I feel it adds at least a day to my hair styles.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, wavy hair and, although this brush does bring out the shine, it doesn&#x27;t reach the underneath layers unless I section out my hair before brushing it.</li>
            <li> So while my hair used to get kinda nasty on day 2, looking oily just at the scalp, I feel this brush just pulls the oils through my hair adding shine and body instead of sitting right at my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> can you get addicted to brushing your hair?</li>
            <li> I am not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to brushing my hair out after a shower with de tangling creme, seriously orgasmic!</li>
            <li> I like Denman brushes a lot, but I am disappointed to have to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my niece, who has tangly hair and was having an awful time using her mother&#x27;s brush to comb those tangles out in the morning.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Brush is good quality and does its job. Buy it if you need it and use it for its life time. Nothing exceptional that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I have a very sensitive scalp and it really works well for me. My daughters love it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the Mason Pearson brush, so I don&#x27;t have much basis of comparison, but for me this brush is just okay.  I have fine hair but a lot of it, and the nylon bristles really struggle to get through.  The boar bristles do feel like they help distribute natural oils a bit, but it takes so many strokes that I end up with static!</li>
            <li> well, it is a nice looking brush, and very well constructed, but it isn&#x27;t meant for people with very thick hair.  it is almost perfect, but not quite going through my hair adequately.</li>
            <li> I used to have a brush with a combination of nylon quills and bristle and it did a great job.  But eventually it broke and I couldn&#x27;t find one to replace it until now.  Needless to say, I was pretty excited about this brush.  The size is good, the bristles are good, my problem is with the nylon quills.  They are longer than the bristles (as they should be) but are just strands of nylon that have been cut straight across the end, which means that they are surprisingly scratchy!  Couldn&#x27;t they have rounded the ends?  For the price, I think so.  It does an ok job getting through my long hair, but my nylon Conair does it better.  So now I brush with the Conair to remove the tangles, and follow up with the Denman to smooth the hair.  On the plus side, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean - the air hole is on the tip of the brush, so is easy to cover when washing.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favoritest brush I&#x27;ve ever had in my life and I would definitely buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium some time ago. It&#x27;s been great for my long, fine hair. But it&#x27;s a bit too small. So, I ordered the large. What a difference - while the medium is firm and can make it thorough my hair, the large does not. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is but it&#x27;s now relegated to the cat as her brush.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that takes some time to brush thoroughly and this is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s stiff enough to handle the thickness of my hair but never uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This brush is made well and does a good job of untangling my hair, but it is difficult to use for anything other than simply brushing -- I can&#x27;t do any styling with it, not even to pull my hair into a ponytail (a nylon brush would be better for that task).  It would be nice if some sort of cleaning tool were included with the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is good. I was expecting a larger paddle and for it to be heavier but, it does a good job nonetheless. I have fine, color treated hair--- but very full. This brush tames it well and improves the texture. However, I do wish it were heavier in weight for more styling control.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant in buying a brush online, because couldn&#x27;t test if bristle were sturdy or not. well they are, not rough but just perfect to smooth down the edges.</li>
            <li> can you get addicted to brushing your hair? I think I have. It just feels so good on my scalp. the combination of natural bristles and the nylon ones is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, wavy hair and, although this brush does bring out the shine, it doesn&#x27;t reach the underneath layers unless I section out my hair before brushing it. I mainly use this brush for a finishing effect after straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the $120+ ones</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair and have never thought of myself as having a sensitive scalp, but the nylon bristles in this brush scratched my head in an uncomfortable way. I used to own a nylon/boar bristle brush from another brand that costs $100+ but my dog used it as a chew toy, and I thought I could replace it cheaply with this one. The nylon bristles on this brush are much longer than the boar bristles compared to the other brush, and they are also cut sharply across, where the tips of the nylon bristles on the more expensive brand look like they are rounded off. Otherwise this is a very nice brush, it appears to be well made and the materials used look basically the same as the more expensive brush. I own another brush from this brand that doesn&#x27;t have the nylon bristles and I love using it on my toddler&#x27;s hair, so I was disappointed that this brush just doesn&#x27;t measure up for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush. It hurt when I would try to use it. The nylon tips scratch my head. I have fine long hair. I&#x27;m still trying to find the right brush for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a cheaper alternative to a Mason Pearson.  I am not happy with it at all.  I have not had it for much longer than a month and the plastic bristles are bent.  I have fine hair and it barely makes it through.  It&#x27;s worse than most of the very cheap brushes I have bought at drug stores in the past.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> great buy.  i wasnt expecting this brush to be so much like the mason pierson brush that is 115 times the cost. this brush is so so great i carry it everywhere. only after havivg it a week my hair feels softer.</li>
            <li> love it ,little different than mason pierson but close enough and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my sister and she likes it very much. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering one for myself.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair brush. I have straight, medium thickness hair that falls past my shoulders. This brush is great for making my hair shiny and keeping oil from accumulating on my scalp. I wanted an all natural bristle brush for oil distribution (and trying to limit plastic consumption) and I was surprised when I received this brush - there is one longer nylon quill in each bristle group. I did not see this mentioned anywhere in the description. Not exactly what I wanted, but I think I probably prefer it over an all natural bristle brush for thoroughness.  If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural bristle brush, no compromise however, this doesn&#x27;t fit the exact bill. BUt among natural bristle brushes, this is a great, affordable product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  Natural Bristles are the way to go!  sent one to my mother who also loves hers</li>
            <li> I had one of these for at least 10 years and it finally wore out.  I used it every day.  I bought another one and it is still the excellent quality of the original.  Amazing quality for the price.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford the Mason Pearson brand brushes, these are your next best bet. If you have never owned a Mason Pearson brush, you would probably swear by these simply because they are $100 cheaper!! And that is a good reason to buy these as they are great brushes. They work and many beauticians use these.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this brush is wonderful for untangling. Love this brush and the price is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Works well with my curly hair. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> It is alright. I feel like it frizzes my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the Denman all right. Holds up to use, and I&#x27;ve not seen signs of any shedding. I like the scratchy nylon bristles, but I&#x27;ve never had a sensitive scalp, so I could see how it might bother some tenderheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the handle weren&#x27;t so small. My hands aren&#x27;t huge, but the handle is just small enough that I get a hand cramp if I try to use it. I just grip the back of the brush when my hand gets tired. If the handle were bigger, five stars.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my niece, who has tangly hair and was having an awful time using her mother&#x27;s brush to comb those tangles out in the morning.  Hair brushing has gone from something that had to be endured (often with frowns or even tears) to something that is much more pleasant.  I&#x27;ve even seen her smile while brushing her hair.  This brush has nylon bristles which extend beyond the length of the shorter natural bristles in the brush, and the nylon bristles are rather &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; (the ends haven&#x27;t been rounded, they&#x27;re sharp) but my niece with her sensitive head has no complaints.</li>
            <li> First the pros:  Natural bristle makes a huge difference in your hair, smooths flyaways and distributes oils.  Brush is easy to clean and the large size is great to brush hair with the fewest number of strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some problems:&lt;br /&gt;- The nylon bristles are sharp, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and visibly scratched my face and ear.  They also have too much &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; meaning the brush doesn&#x27;t go through all my hair just the top layer.  So now, I brush my hair with another brush to get the tangles out and use this to smooth the top.&lt;br /&gt;- Handle is small.  If you have some product on your hands, it&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on the brush.  I&#x27;ve dropped mine a couple of times (I guess I can add that it didn&#x27;t break, as a pro).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the brush and love what it does for my hair but I wish the small issues could be fixed to make it great.</li>
            <li> Had one of these years ago and lost it while on a trip.  So happy to have a replacement!  These brushes are a great deal for the money.  The natural bristles are healthy for your hair, while the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; loosen the tangles and give your scalp a great massage.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok. It does tame some of the frizz in my hair, but I have fairly thick hair and I find it hard to get all the way through and it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out. I generally use a different brush to get through any tangles and then use this to smooth out any frizz.</li>
            <li> This brush is really great - I have long, curly (medium curls) hair and this is soft on my fine hair. I&#x27;m definitely a Denman fan. I have noticed a couple of the bristles have come out. I have used this brush as part of my lengthy detangling process after a shower and also on dry hair without the fuzz/staticness like some other brushes.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and product was as described.</li>
            <li> I believe this would be good for someone who does not have thick, wavy hair.  I do use it, sparingly.  One issue is it does cause static to my hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know much about hair brushes so I looked at the reviews on Amazon.  This brush looked like what I needed so I bought it.  It is a very nice brush.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I had my eyes on the Mason Pearson god of all hairbrushes for a loooong time.  I finally just wrote my favorite hair stylist in the world and she told me that while she loved hers, she wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail price for it and to try this Denman.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (below shoulder/mid back-ish) fine blonde hair.  The main reason I love this brush is bc I feel it adds at least a day to my hair styles.  The boar bristles seem to distribute the natural oils your scalp produces more evenly.  So while my hair used to get kinda nasty on day 2, looking oily just at the scalp, I feel this brush just pulls the oils through my hair adding shine and body instead of sitting right at my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do NOT use or recommend using this brush as a &amp;#34;straight out of the shower/detangling&amp;#34; brush.  I use this in the morning, night or mid day to refresh my hair style.  I imagine it would really pull at wet tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to distribute the oils in my long, thick, slightly wavy hair. It works well and doesn&#x27;t break my hair. Doesn&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp all the time, but the nylon bristles reach further than boar bristles would alone. I use a brush comb/cleaner thing to clean it under running water, otherwise it would be hard to get fully clean. It loses some boar bristles every time I clean it. Within a year of normal use, though, the handle began to crack from the brush body. It hasn&#x27;t broken off completely, but I suspect it will soon. I like Denman brushes a lot, but I am disappointed to have to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Great brush...met expectations and more. Really helps with thin hair and hair that tangles easily. Puts a nice shine in it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, especially for people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> For the unruly thick hair this is the perfect brush without pulling on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have very kinky natural hair and after a good hair treatment I also enlist the help of the Denman brush for a smooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;This is all the brush you&#x27;ll ever ever need.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! I look forward to brushing my hair out after a shower with de tangling creme, seriously orgasmic! Get it.</li>
            <li> Well it was buying this or buying the over 100 dollar brush from Mason Pierce.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has virtually revitalized my breaking hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cheap brush for over a year and damaged my hair doing so.&lt;br /&gt;It is well on its way to repair using the Denman Large Natural Bristle Cushion Brush.</li>
