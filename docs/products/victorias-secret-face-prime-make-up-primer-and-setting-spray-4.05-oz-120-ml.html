            <li>I had better looking results when I wasn&#x27;t using a primer/setting spray smh.</li>
            <li>Been wanting to try a primer and setter, so glad I did.</li>
            <li>, there were too many ways to address this situation in a more polite way.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to be sure I tried this many times for an accurate review.</li>
            <li>Since it is a primer to, it seems to really set a good foundation for makeup.</li>
            <li>It has no scent at all, and the spray bottle mister is really really fine, so you aren&#x27;t spraying globs of it on your face.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking flawless all day and somehow makes my face produce less oil</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference between wearing it and not wearing it...</li>
            <li>It feels really light, and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>it was fast and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It makes my make-up last all day, sweat-proof, waterproof, and it gives a nice glow!</li>
            <li>I am loving this spray so far!</li>
            <li>I literally just bought this for $15 a bottle and u lowered it right after I bought it!?</li>
            <li>It has been really hot where I live, lots of yard work, lots of sweating, and still my makeup seems to stay SO much better than if I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>It seems to really glue the makeup on!!</li>
            <li>Victoria&#x27;s Secret face primer is the best primer my makeup stay all day...</li>
            <li>and I really liked it, but you only get about 1.5 ounces and are paying about $13+shipping for it.</li>
            <li>only thing that would have made this product THAT much better, would have been free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work because it was so reasonable!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>know ive been missing out on something good to enhance my makeup.</li>
            <li>If anyone could sugest other primer/setting sprays please could yu kindly tell me.</li>
            <li>Also it came 3 days earlier than expected, I was happily suprised!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main problem was that it caused me to have cystic acne!</li>
            <li>Goes on light but definitely holds everything in place.</li>
            <li>I put my lipstick in the morning and it still was on when I was ready for bed that night.</li>
            <li>I really cant wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>nd just don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really hold my makeup at all nd</li>
            <li>They all were skeptical but by the end of the night they were coming up to me telling me how much they loved that their make-up stayed in place!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I got it down.</li>
            <li>Like how much nd how far away I should squirt it</li>
            <li>And, had they asked nicely, I would have removed my negative feedback.</li>
            <li>I love it seriously dont use anything else</li>
            <li>I have never seen this in Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores or websites, so I am glad I found it</li>
            <li>Ill try and remember to update on if i liked it or</li>
            <li>But I do use it a couple times a month when I am going out on a weekend or have something to do socially.</li>
            <li>I ran out of it and went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to buy more, well they didn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>This Victoria&#x27;s Secret spray has a lot more product in it, and seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This really really helps keep it on, and it gives your face a little dewey look without looking overly oily.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I wanted this to work because it was so reasonable! But, it didn&#x27;t. The main problem was that it caused me to have cystic acne! It also made you feel like you were spraying hairspray on your face. I guess I will just have to stick with Urban Decay Up All Night....</li>
            <li> I love it seriously dont use anything else but this now</li>
            <li> I literally just bought this for $15 a bottle and u lowered it right after I bought it!? Its not even that good. Its sticky and leaves my skin feeling nasty!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item at a Victoria&#x27;s Secret store on a whim. I used it as the directions state: spray it on before applying make-up, let it dry, apply make-up and spray again and let dry. This stuff is like gold to me! It works SO well! I ran out of it and went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to buy more, well they didn&#x27;t have it. So thankfully I found it online, it&#x27;s double the price, but I will pay for this stuff. I don&#x27;t use it every day, I would think I might clog up my pores if I did. But I do use it a couple times a month when I am going out on a weekend or have something to do socially. It makes my make-up last all day, sweat-proof, waterproof, and it gives a nice glow! I don&#x27;t know how many compliments I get when I use this stuff. I recently had my sister&#x27;s wedding reception and I asked some of the girls if they wanted to try it. They all were skeptical but by the end of the night they were coming up to me telling me how much they loved that their make-up stayed in place! And I only sprayed it on after, not before applying make-up. One girl even got water splashed on her face and another was crying and the make-up didn&#x27;t budge. I went to a beauty store to try and find a replica of this stuff which is a primer and setting spray in one, and let me tell you that you will have a hard time trying to find one like this. You could spend triple the money on two separate things when this has it all in one. I hope they never stop making this because I don&#x27;t know what I would do.</li>
            <li> I try so manny primer nothing work my makeup was gone after a couple of hours.. Victoria&#x27;s Secret face primer is the best primer my makeup stay all day...I recommended</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this one deserves it. After spending actually wasting money on primers I finally found one that works!! It keeps my makeup on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I use it before and after makeup and still use a setting powder after. Very happy with this, will definitelybe using this forever.</li>
            <li> Love this it helps keep my makeup where it belongs&amp;#34; on my face&amp;#34; love that my makeup doesn&#x27;t run or get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> fresh, light n gives a wonderful glow.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, leaves a dewy finish w/o it being over powering and w/o leaving your face lookingoily and drenched in oil. Spray one or two sprays onto your face once you finish your makeup and throughout the day your makeup lasts and no need for touch ups...great item..packaged very well from the seller another plus!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t see much difference between wearing it and not wearing it... I&#x27;m not really sure what I was expecting. However, it does have a nice texture, really light, and it seems to keep my makeup good a bit longer..&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try other products, though, since this one is not particularly unexpensive either.</li>
            <li> I am loving this spray so far! I put moisturizer on, spray on this product (dry it a little with my blow dryer), apply makeup, and then spray again! It seems to really glue the makeup on!! It has been really hot where I live, lots of yard work, lots of sweating, and still my makeup seems to stay SO much better than if I don&#x27;t use it! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but my undereye concealer that I do wear seems to always slip and melt off! This really really helps keep it on, and it gives your face a little dewey look without looking overly oily. Since it is a primer to, it seems to really set a good foundation for makeup. Helps with pore size, and creating a flawless finish. I have never seen this in Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores or websites, so I am glad I found it here!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it&#x27;s a primer AND setting spray! It has no scent at all, and the spray bottle mister is really really fine, so you aren&#x27;t spraying globs of it on your face. It feels really light, and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. Also it came 3 days earlier than expected, I was happily suprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For how much you get at 4 ounces, it&#x27;s a great price! Other products are more expensive for less product (about 1.5-2 ounces). I have tried Model in a Bottle and I really liked it, but you only get about 1.5 ounces and are paying about $13+shipping for it. This Victoria&#x27;s Secret spray has a lot more product in it, and seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would have made this product THAT much better, would have been free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never stop making this product!! I am really happy with the product, will continue to use and purchase.. please consider doing free shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and definitely recommend it. It keeps my skin looking flawless all day and somehow makes my face produce less oil so I never need to touch up with powder throughout the day. Love!</li>
            <li> Works great. Goes on light but definitely holds everything in place. Not sticky feeling. I&#x27;m glad I found this product. Had tried another brand but liked this one much better!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was hesitant, but it actually worked I sprayed it on my face before applying makeup and after the makeup was done and I can say my makeup went no where I love it. Some ppl complain that it gave them acne uhm no you still have to continue a skin regiment before using this! Its for the makeup not the skin itself.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my makeup on  longer. As a receptionist, I need to look presentable at all times. I just can&#x27;t leave the desk to look at my makeup and there are always people around,  and I am not going to fix my makeup in front of people. This was VS prime spray worked perfect. I love it. The delivered time was great too and I got a good price going through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I put my lipstick in the morning and it still was on when I was ready for bed that night.</li>
            <li> Ive never used a primer or setting spray before and know ive been missing out on something good to enhance my makeup. I went with this one cus of all the good reviews. Very pleased with shipping it was fast and packaged nicely. I got it with in 2 days after ordering and 1 week earlier than the estimated time frame. I really cant wait to try it out. Hope its as amazing as all these reviews are saying. Ill try and remember to update on if i liked it or what when ive used it :).  UPDATE: I almost forgot to update lol but I wanted to be sure I tried this many times for an accurate review. Now here goes... I&#x27;ve tried this product several times with different foundations, powders etc. nd just don&#x27;t really care for it. Didn&#x27;t really hold my makeup at all nd made my eyelids sticky along with making some of my makeup around my eyes blot up. Yuck! I had better looking results when I wasn&#x27;t using a primer/setting spray smh. I&#x27;m still hoping I&#x27;m just using it wrong since I haven&#x27;t used a primer or setter but I&#x27;m sure I got it down. Like how much nd how far away I should squirt it but maybe its not for me :(. Changed it from 5 to 3 stars nd not 1 because its not the products fault it didn&#x27;t work for me the ingredients just weren&#x27;t for my skin. Not everything will be for everyone but I was hoping this would be. If anyone could sugest other primer/setting sprays please could yu kindly tell me. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Been wanting to try a primer and setter, so glad I did. keeps makeup in place in over 100 degrees weather</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I noticed when recieving the product that the still-attached price tag said $12, when I paid $16. When I submitted my review of the seller&#x27;s preformance, I got an extremely rude email back demanding that I &amp;#34;REMOVE MY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK&amp;#34; (which, last time I brushed up on my internet etiquette, typing in capslock was still considered to be yelling) and return my purchase if I was &amp;#34;unhappy paying for a product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying from this seller again, there were too many ways to address this situation in a more polite way. And, had they asked nicely, I would have removed my negative feedback.</li>
