            <li> sexy in a bottle. Smells very musky but not powdery, it is not overpowering or too strong either. Always receive compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, love this item, I bought everything in the line. This scent was discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works, and if it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon I would never have known about this fragrance. The price is about what Bath &amp; Body Works would charge, and it was worth the price. It&#x27;s a lovely scent, and everyone around me notices, I get plenty of compliments when I wear it. I also love that no one can get it unless they know where to go and what to look for. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I GET SO MANY COMPLEMENTS ON MY PERFUME, I FIRST PURCHASED THIS FROM BATH AND BODY WORKS FOR $30.00. I LOVE THIS PURFUME SO WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON FOR $20.00 I DIDN&#x27;T HESITATE. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents from Bath and Body Works. Smells just like their lotion of the same scent.  I order this all of the time.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL SMELL LOVE IT SO MUCH,THE SELL IS GREAT PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT I HAVE ON IT LAST ALL DAY .</li>
            <li> This is a light, lovely but lasting fragrance. Several scents fade when I wear; this does not.&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase and price was great</li>
            <li> This is nice fresh, clean scent. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price and comes packed with great care. The only thing I would point out is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;s a nice spray for an out of the shower type, but not so much for a night on the town. I still love it!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased. Lovely smell.</li>
            <li> Love this smell! Got my sister-in-law hooked when she stayed at our house last year. This is perfect in the gift box we&#x27;re sending for Xmas this year.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance.. And it is affordable!&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell.Not too overpowering..Very sexy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>

            <li> Maybe the other reviewer got a bad batch, but I&#x27;ve finished my first bottle and there was NO alcohol odor whatsoever in mine.  Fragrance is not sickly sweet or too overpowering.  Obviously perfumes are a very personal choice, but this one is a first that both my husband and I like.  I still catch the aroma even at night after wearing it all day.  It&#x27;s my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li> This perfume, not as well known as the top brands moves ahead of them all with it&#x27;s exciting smooth fragrance. By far the best value and perfect gifts!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I get stopped all the time, women want to know what I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s a soft, clean smell, not over powering at all. I love, love LOVE this perfume. Oh and the bonus??...it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, than at the store!</li>
            <li> Smells good, the bottle looks nice and the price was affordable. I like it overall and I think it makes a good buy.</li>
            <li> This potion is like GOLD to me. I have been wearing this since I was 18...for over 10 years and I get an abundance of compliments on my scent. There are sooo many fragrances and perfumes to tickle your fancy, but the thing about it is finding a scent that works with your body chemistry. This is the only perfume I wear. It is my signature scent. If you like notes of lavendar, white jasmine and a soft musk, your nose will be pleasantly surprised with this beautiful fragrance!</li>
            <li> I got it through online purchase and would like it to buy again. Whether it is a party wear or active time you can use this fragrance. Very light and keeps you in good spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and you will not regret.</li>
            <li> Fragrance isn&#x27;t what I remember and doesn&#x27;t last long.  Used to last all evening not so now.  Don&#x27;t think this is an authentic Bath and Body Works Product.</li>
