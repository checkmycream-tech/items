            <li>My son is a fussy eater and very very skinny.</li>
            <li>Although it states it is for kids, I am an adult and it worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the ingredients, I decided there were too many chemicals including fd&amp;c #6 yellow.</li>

            <li> bought this vitamin for my 4 year old after he lost his appetite.</li>
            <li> My son (3 year old) is picky eater when I bought this supplement, he can&#x27;t stop eating...</li>
            <li> My son nearly threw up because of the taste.</li>

            <li> i will keep buying for her until her appetite naturally opens up</li>
            <li> It has increased my two year old&#x27;s appetite.</li>
            <li> Any little thing he puts in his mouth ,makes him full.</li>
            <li> but that’s the only thing new</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a little fast, wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its a coincidence or its working already but his eating has really improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving this to my 2 year old for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this, my daughter has been taking it about a week, no significant change, if your looking for the american version, it smells like Polyvisol vitamin that you can get at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the syrup came in a larger bottle, because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it would.</li>
            <li> If you already have a picky eater that doesn&#x27;t like to try new foods then you will have a hard time getting them to take this.</li>
            <li> In fact, what I saw were little bumps all over his back</li>
            <li> My 29 month old grandson at times, loses his appetite.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t make a comment on if the product is effective, the kids hate the taste, so won&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> very less quantity for big price</li>
            <li> Other ingredients include propylene glycol, sorbitol,methlyparaben and propylparaben.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if it’s related though</li>
            <li> Although he is thriving and active he is still under weight for his age.</li>
            <li> and he would like to be at least 65 by his next</li>
            <li> and we seem to struggle less getting him to eat.</li>
            <li> igive 3 stars cuz the bottle is too small for the prize but other than that</li>
            <li> he asks for it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Was waste of our money.</li>
            <li> I lost so much weight when I became ill, and the medicine I was prescribed was making my appetite worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helped my granddaughter</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my son is small and is not putting on weight.</li>
            <li> It increased my appetite slightly, but not remarkably.</li>
            <li> I started this a while ago and this has seemed to increase his appetite and he is getting less sick often.</li>
            <li> this product is terrible , as soon as my child took this he started to vomit, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone , waste of money !!!</li>
            <li> The taste was awful..</li>
            <li> You already have a issue with getting your child to eat and then add a god awful medication that doesn&#x27;t work to the mix.</li>
            <li> I tasted it myself and it was awful.</li>
            <li> Taste awful.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible</li>
            <li> Does not work bought this for my picky son it tasted horrible</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even take it how do you expect kids to take this when it tastes awful</li>

            <li> Komilon Tonic arrived on time and well packaged. I love love this tonic it works like magic! My 29 month old grandson at times, loses his appetite.  I immediately, give him 1 teaspoon of  Komilon daily and within the next following  2 or 3 days his appetite has greatly returned with vigor! Thank You for this great product!</li>
            <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li> Awesome, affordable and really works .. bought it for my 93 year old abuela, because she wasn&#x27;t eating and it worked right away ..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work at all and she finish 4 bottles</li>
            <li> my son love the taste and more important thing about this product, my son eat well vegetables, meat and lot of healthy foods.</li>
            <li> I took this supplement for about three weeks. It increased my appetite slightly, but not remarkably. I gained about 7 pounds within the three weeks. The taste is pleasant, but I have to drink water after taking it. My only complaint is that I wish the syrup came in a larger bottle, because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it would. However, it did do what I wanted it to do which was to increase my appetite. So I would recommend it to someone who isn&#x27;t that determined to gain a considerable amount of weight in a month, but if you&#x27;re looking to stimulate your appetite remarkably, I recommend another supplement.</li>
            <li> I saw this truck one day on the highway and took it as a sign to try it because my toddler is a picky eater. I bought this for her to try to open up her appetite and she loves it and I think it helps.. I just have to keep up with the consistency of 3 times a day..</li>
            <li> My son is a fussy eater and very very skinny. Although he is thriving and active he is still under weight for his age. I started this a while ago and this has seemed to increase his appetite and he is getting less sick often. Great for fussy eaters.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this, my daughter has been taking it about a week, no significant change, if your looking for the american version, it smells like Polyvisol vitamin that you can get at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I took 2 bottles of this syrup for my son. I gave him regularly ... I did not find it effective at all. Not even an iota improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is not FDA approved and made in another country.  My husband was upset that I purchased it.  Not sure if it helped my granddaughter but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> igive 3 stars cuz the bottle is too small for the prize but other than that it realy worked for my son</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for our kid!!</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s!  My son was hungry but still refused to eat. And eventually ate. Hope he continues to eat. Thanks again</li>
            <li> this product did not do what it stated in the description. The taste was awful..however I was able to get my child pass that ( added to teaspoons of flavored juice). My child appetie did not increase at all. i would not recommend this product. You already have a issue with getting your child to eat and then add a god awful medication that doesn&#x27;t work to the mix. ;(</li>
            <li> This really works!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this vitamin for my 4 year old after he lost his appetite. Two days after he start taking it he was eating twice as much.</li>
            <li> Love it and my son started eating after</li>
            <li> My son (3 year old) is picky eater when I bought this supplement, he can&#x27;t stop eating... This is helpful...</li>
            <li> Do nothing for my son two bottles and nothing</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference with my child have an increase in appetite.  I&#x27;ll continue to give it to him.</li>
            <li> My daughter did not like the taste of it. I would have to mix it with food or her drink so she would not notice and even then she would notice that it tasted different</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t make a comment on if the product is effective, the kids hate the taste, so won&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you if this works. My son nearly threw up because of the taste. I tasted it myself and it was awful. If you already have a picky eater that doesn&#x27;t like to try new foods then you will have a hard time getting them to take this. My son is 7 and would have had to take two teaspoons twice a day. Not a chance! After reading some of the ingredients, I decided there were too many chemicals including fd&amp;c #6 yellow. We try not to buy foods with food dyes. Other ingredients include propylene glycol, sorbitol,methlyparaben and propylparaben.</li>
            <li> Taste awful. Did not work its purpose.</li>
            <li> 4 year old loves the taste....he asks for it everyday.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in his appetitie.  In fact, what I saw were little bumps all over his back (looks like prickle heats?) so I stopped giving him the tonic. I’m not sure if it’s related though but that’s the only thing new I gave him.</li>
            <li> This product is definately increasing my 12 yr daughter&#x27;s appetite. Wish it was sold in a bigger bottle 8oz syrup would be great if they have it for sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving this to my 2 year old for about a week and a half. Not sure if its a coincidence or its working already but his eating has really improved. It smells terrible so I mix it in his favorite drink. The bottle goes a little fast, wish it came in bigger bottles. Already ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> my daughters appetite has improved since taking this. i will keep buying for her until her appetite naturally opens up</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my baby. Wanted my money for nothing</li>
            <li> Dony buy . It does nothing at all. Ordered it for wife thinking she will feel much hungry now but dint happen. Save your money. Also it gets over so soon - A week. very less quantity for big price</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my son is small and is not putting on weight. He takes his dose okay and we seem to struggle less getting him to eat. I would not call this a miracle fix but it seems better than doing nothing.</li>
            <li> Product good worked for my kids.</li>
            <li> It has increased my two year old&#x27;s appetite. I&#x27;m very happy with it. She has gained some weight too. I&#x27;ve ordered two more and it came pretty fast, thanks.</li>
            <li> This vitamins are really good . My son don&#x27;t eat much . Any little thing he puts in his mouth ,makes him full. So I try to give him Komilon for a week , and for my big surprise he was asking for food :) he is being taking that for a month know and he gain 4 pounds , that makes me so happy and very confident on this vitamins :) really works .....</li>
            <li> this product is terrible , as soon as my child took this he started to vomit, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone , waste of money !!!</li>
            <li> This did not help with my child&#x27;s appetite.  I bought it because he is ADHD and he medicine prevents him from eating.</li>
            <li> Does not work bought this for my picky son it tasted horrible I wouldn&#x27;t even take it how do you expect kids to take this when it tastes awful</li>
            <li> yes this works, and it sure enhanced my appetite. I lost so much weight when I became ill, and the medicine I was prescribed was making my appetite worse. When I began taking this stimulant, my appetite improved tremendously the next day. Although it states it is for kids, I am an adult and it worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> This really helps stimulate my 9 year old&#x27;s appetite.  He has always been a fickle eater, he stays at 62 lbs. and he would like to be at least 65 by his next birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only able to give it to him once per day versus 3 times, but I am sure his appetite would really be where I think it should be at. This stimulant does work!</li>
            <li> The real deal here.  If it smells awful then it works..</li>
            <li> Was waste of our money. This product didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve noticed when my son started working out again, he gained his appetite back. Before that, I had to remind him to eat.</li>
