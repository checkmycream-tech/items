    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I generally am very happy with Eucerin products, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my super-sensitive</li>
            <li>BTW, Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li>and yet you get superb protection against the sun.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the best thing for me.</li>
            <li>best complimented with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy wonderful moisturizer in an easy-to-use format.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re talking a great deal of pain (that goes on for months!)</li>
            <li>and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>so prob not the best for the summer since I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my skin oily or if that&#x27;s just the sweat-either</li>
            <li>Eucerin works great a moisturizer as well as a sun screen!</li>
            <li>Best of all, its inexpensive!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful face lotion that has an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li>Also the bottle size fits perfectly into my skin care organizer.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon pricing was wonderful, and I now have two containers for almost the price</li>
            <li>&gt; Not overpriced and is an excellent price for what you receive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Excellent face/neck  lotion--good coverage and sunscreen coverage.</li>
            <li>Cost is very good as well!</li>
            <li>I thought &#x27;GREAT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>Wonderful moisturizing qualities that also have the benefit of sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be getting a wonderful moisturizer I could use before applying my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has SPF which is wonderful for preventing sun damage and isn&#x27;t too heavy/oily on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best sun screens I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Excellent face lotion!</li>
            <li>Very good product with great price!</li>
            <li>, the lotion is very good.</li>
            <li>price for two bottles was very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>The pricing on this is very good too.</li>
            <li>- she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I&#x27;ve found out now for good reason!</li>
            <li>My sister loaned me this lotion, and I loved it!</li>
            <li>Good price for two bottles!</li>
            <li>The product is excellent and it was shipped in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Addie</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good price, and for some reason I find the bottle very attractive.</li>
            <li>, very glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>Great cream.</li>
            <li>It does provide great protection from the sun however.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal for what you get.   </li>
            <li>It works great together.</li>
            <li>To boot, it also does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>(Its the face, not the lotion, lol.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>but I learned a great deal from that.</li>
            <li>So great gift.</li>
            <li>It feels great under makeup, has no perfume-y odor, and is a great price point.</li>
            <li>It is great that it comes in SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>The twin pack came at a great price, too.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the SPF 30, but that was about it.</li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive moisturizer for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great over my serum and under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, provides great protection.</li>
            <li>Great UVa/UVB protection.</li>
            <li>Happy with the Eucerin product.</li>
            <li>However, for the price and the additional SPF, it&#x27;s a great value</li>
            <li>Great mositurizer with sunblock.</li>
            <li>Great for summer protection even without make up.  </li>
            <li>Great value for your money.  </li>
            <li>But for drier areas, works great.</li>
            <li>It is great for the day as it doesn&#x27;t block your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>mineral based, great non-waterproof lotion.</li>
            <li>The SPF is great, too.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Works great in daylight, not so good in evening, as flash photography leads to funky looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the pump feature, it gives the perfect dosage.</li>
            <li>Im really happy with this product, I would buy again!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect, feels more like lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is very good for anyone who has no allergy problems.</li>
            <li>Good stuff to keep the suns rays from damaging your skin, because it is spf 30</li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I have tried zinc type face sun protection on my face, I believe this works as good considering the price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good moisturizing sun protection product and because this was made by Eucerin</li>
            <li>I needed a face lotion with good SPF to protect my skin under my makeup.</li>
            <li>This got good reviews</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I also recommend you invest in a good hat.</li>
            <li>if you are fair-skinned, it looks good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Good price on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Good for guys and girls who don&#x27;t wear make-up...</li>
            <li>I think I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my beloved Aveeno.</li>
            <li>Good moisterizer for a resonable price.</li>
            <li>I have found that using Eucerin Face Lotion, SPF 30  gives me good protection.  </li>
            <li>to use with no lid&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer with good sun protection</li>
            <li>have eczema, fair skin, and am trying to get rid of acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good sun protection as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily like some sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>The Eucerin is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t have any of the retinoids that CeraVe has.  </li>
            <li>I had another Eucerin Moisterizer that I loved</li>
            <li>good on my skin</li>
            <li>I think it is good for men and those women who do not like unscented.</li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Smells good and works like SPF30 sunscreen, but has the added benefit of a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a try and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good consistency too - not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This is a really good moisturizer with SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Nice light-weight cream, smoothes on very nice.</li>
            <li>San Diego Hat Company has some stylish and beautiful broad-brimmed ones that block UV rays.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and arrived in excellent condition!  </li>
            <li>and that is very, very important!</li>
            <li>VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product expecting it to be a phenomenal moisturizer as Eucerin is known to have great lotions/moisturizers for body.</li>
            <li>I use it every day for well over a year and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and SPF 30, good combination.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Still love the Eucerin body cremes, but will NEVER use this again!</li>
            <li>She gets many compliments!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap and definitely a great product.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find it available through Amazon</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>but my face still looks kind of shiny when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy</li>
            <li>What is so nice is that there is a choice of a 6 months frequency.   </li>
            <li>It kind of peels up or something.</li>
            <li>I did not feel that it is a nice moisturizer, either.  </li>
            <li>just which ingredient I am allergic to, but am conducting my own &#x27;patch&#x27; test.  </li>
            <li>So disappointed--really liked the idea of SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I even find that it makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Thanks Eucerin for another wonderful product!</li>
            <li>It will probably not be cost effective to return it, so I may just have to toss it, and find something else.</li>
            <li>For a 1/5 of the price of a bottle of Shiseido, it moisturizes better, gives me more of a glow, and is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found this  very moisturizing sunscreen to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>This 30 spf moisturizer is perfect for the summer, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ll probably use it year-round.</li>
            <li>All in one product: very cost and time effective with great results!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer does have a handy dispenser, but it takes a lot of work to get the lotion worked into your skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and this has been great and is totally nongreasy!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great value and offers great</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great as the moisturizer leaves the face and body feeling good!</li>
            <li>Creamy, smooth has not too toxic ingredients, and it Felt good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is suitable for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Of the 5 samples I tried, Eucerin was the best by far.</li>
            <li>This is a great Sunscreen that goes on easy, its light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily film.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this for years &amp; honestly I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>And, the best part, it is economical, which is seldom true of any kind of cosmetic, especially if it is any good!</li>
            <li>Very light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>It feels very light and has no smell.  </li>
            <li>this two pack arrived quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>This seems to provide good sun protection, doesn&#x27;t show, soaks in fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.</li>
            <li>I even have some cheap dollar cocoa butter lotion that works better!</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to find a large supply at such a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>The sun coverage is great for this very fair red-head and so gentle and never stings my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, it was Halloween!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Many of my friends recommended this for me.</li>
            <li>Finally you cannot beat this awesome price.</li>
            <li>On top of that the moisturizer was non-existent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>This is an okay sunscreen.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my face looks more healthy, smoother and blooming.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love and trust all</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it under makeup as a sun screen.  </li>
            <li>I wear Bareminerals makeup on top of this product and swear by this lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband needed this while he was having facial cancer treatments and it has been so wonderful we keep using it.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a shot, and am ultimately glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used to use Oil of Olay, but Eucerin seems more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>If you require something that looks more like makeup without the hassle of makeup I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and I haven&#x27;t burned yet!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to layer more goop on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product &amp; like using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love them both.- Non-greasing</li>
            <li>This face moisturizer is my and my SO&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>and like it better.</li>
            <li>However, I love it.  </li>
            <li>, i like the cost, and i am glad for the spf 30</li>
            <li>one in most CA drug stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are nicer feeling sunscreens with more moisture out there, but this one does the trick and is god for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 12 years; it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>For the money, Coppertone Sport is a much better product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed that my skin is softer and more luminous.</li>
            <li>Love all eucerin products.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin is one of my favorite brands of lotions.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS,GREAT MOISTURIZER.WHEN</li>
            <li>Even around the eye area, I&#x27;m able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both, and come to the conclusion that I like the CeraVe better.</li>
            <li>I have been tried a lot of different sunscreen, this one works great!</li>
            <li>Did nothing but cover, I need more protection than that.</li>
            <li>I am hooked,really glad I bought the twin pack</li>
            <li>my favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I kept thinking maybe it would get better.</li>
            <li>Better off w/some dime store body lotion than this.</li>
            <li>My favorite SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It nice and smooth and not oily.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Eucerin SPF 30 Facial Sunscreen Lotion is the best sunscreen - I’ve used it since February 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I cannot use most mosturizers/lotions on my face because they make me brake out, not this one.</li>
            <li>It is Eucerin, so you are confident in the product, but it doesn&#x27;t work long-term (skipping or forgetting days).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m scared to think that many people who don&#x27;t know what these ingredients are are unknowingly using them, thinking they are protecting their skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, I am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, but just know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice light lotion without avobenzone.  </li>
            <li>Love how it also contains SPF.</li>
            <li>Many women</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any SPF30 lighter than this Eucerin but for, say, a work day I won&#x27;t need that protection and will opt for the lighter and more breathable Olay.</li>
            <li>I switched brands and found one that works better than this.</li>
            <li>Gentle moisturizer and very effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li>Nice and light and easy to apply but still leaves skin feeling moisturised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 and have normal skin (oily in t zone) and it works great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the white color of the zinc not rubbing in all the way either, because I have fair skin and to me it just kind of gives it a peachy-blushy look that I kind of dig.  </li>
            <li>Are you aware that when they remove skin cancer they take a fair chunk of flesh from below the skin, too?</li>
            <li>This is a nice lightweight sunscreen that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you are prone to acne and have dry skin, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely texture and is easy to spread onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>The relatively high SPF (for a face moisturizer) is great for blocking harmful UVA and UVB rays, and it is fragrance-free, non-greasy, and great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got seriously sensitive skin and most facial moisturizers cause me to break out in the hives, but this product is so great and incredibly moisturizing that I can&#x27;t stop recommending it to everyone</li>
            <li>Even more importantly, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer.</li>
            <li>This wonderful product glides onto the skin and soaks in quickly, leaving a nice matte finish in less than one minute.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>However it does sweat off easily</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, nor greasy or sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is inexpensive and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best facial lotion, but for the price it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>We both love the product very much, great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Has a strong synthetic sunblock oil</li>
            <li>Problem is, they all seem to have a strong chemical \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product, the packaging isn&#x27;t so great, alot of product came out when I barely squeezed it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and for how cheap it is-its def worth it!</li>
            <li>so my skin will last beautifully another 30 years.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>It is not scented, is light and easily applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a pretty light, but it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you can rub in,</li>
            <li>It works fine under some primer and makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expiration dates are more than adequate.</li>
            <li>and I have them handy where I can get to them easy and fast.</li>
            <li>While the texture of this product is a bit more like sunscreen than lotion, it is still very light and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very light and contains the right ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is odorless, greaseless, effective, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Great for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, absorbs well, with light rubbing.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Eucerin SPF 30 lotion in a 2 pack with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on light, HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works great as sunscreen and daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free is also a plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t stink, feel greasy, and you can put it on every day to avoid looking like a leather glove by the time you&#x27;re 50.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as an inexpensive, daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Your foundation will NOT go on smoothly after applying this.</li>
            <li>Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn&#x27;t really have an effect on it either way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s getting such great reviews.</li>
            <li>It is light which I like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eucerin: Great for lizard people, lasts forever, just the best everyday facial moisturizer on the market</li>
            <li>and you have to smooth it in.</li>
            <li>I have the Eucerin 15 body lotion which works great for daily wear on my arms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li>However, this lotion does go on smooth but it doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;soak in&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and Amazon sells it for a great price compared to drugstores.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been very great about using sunscreen everyday but since using this</li>
            <li>Works great for my combo skin and although it does seem a bit grease initially, skin soaks it in within 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful pump applicator gives, with one pump, just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 30SPF, lightweight, fragrance free, for sensitive skin and with all the good reviews I chose this face lotion.</li>
            <li>The most notable pro is fact that the SPF 30 does its job very well: 2 days of snowboarding, and no raccoon-face whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This product is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it is non-comedogenic, it protects from sun, and is supposed to be good for those with sensitive</li>
            <li>My face feels good, moustirized and remains clear of pimples.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good</li>
            <li>Used just a pea-size amount &amp; it sat right on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is a very light lotion and doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.</li>
            <li>First product with sunscreen that I can confidently put on my face without breaking out or tearing up.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than a year after my dermatologist recommended an SPF 30 or higher product.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer all year long.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t want to rub in as easily as most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and, although this product is not the one I had originally wanted, I am finding it effective.  </li>
            <li>I apply it to a clean face before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and soaks in quickly, and hasn&#x27;t melted into my eyes and caused stinging.  </li>
            <li>I started using this based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>Based on the moisturizers and sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried from the dermatologist and from our own shopping, it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s oil-free, has a good SPF, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking as shiny as a new pair of shiny leather shoes.</li>
            <li>I have to spend quite a while really rubbing this into my skin to make sure it is properly absorbed or else I will look like a mime!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this product.  </li>
            <li>They are great for sensitive skin or normal skin.  </li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good.</li>
            <li>My skin gets fairly oily throughout the day but this will last throughout the day unless wiped/washed off.</li>
            <li>When having a garage sale recently, I thought I did a good job staying under an umbrella.</li>
            <li>There is only one good news: it does not make my face shiny.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and safe shipping.</li>
            <li>When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily.</li>
            <li>So good for DAILY use.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a fair amount of protection without giving your face a ghastly/ whitish tint; you can wear it daily without it appearing dead-obvious that you&#x27;re wearing sunblock.</li>
            <li>It has done a good job overall as moisturizer</li>
            <li>Probably a good sunscreen except it has way too much white pigment.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and easily mixes with my makeup for more sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>It leaves a little bit of a tacky finish but honestly it makes a pretty good primer for makeup</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lotion for protecting yourself from the sun.</li>
            <li>Eucerin IS a great line and has helped my skin in other problems-</li>
            <li>Great price..would recommend  beats all other retail prices out there non greasy also,,  no fragrance to bother you...</li>
            <li>So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures</li>
            <li>I am very fair and am sensitive to sunscreen lotions (especially around the eyes).</li>
            <li>I love that I was able to subscribe and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out, because I cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and greaseless.</li>
            <li>Clinique SUPER CITY BLOCK SPF 40 1.4oz / 40ml]].</li>
            <li>It is super stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive cremes and lotions trying to get the best product for me.</li>
            <li>This face lotion feels greaseless and quickly absorbs on my skin.</li>
            <li>sometimes have mild acne that always appears to improve when using this lotion.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer for well over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Based on the many positive reviews for the Eucerin lotion, I bought it, and I&#x27;ve been pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I&#x27;m not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin nicely, without fragrance and doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and sting as many other sunblocks do.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 bottles of this product, it is great for your face, it don&#x27;t cake up, like most sunblocks do, and it last for 24 hours, of course I don&#x27;t go in the water, so it last me a lot longer, will buy again,</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, blends in quickly and easily and so far after trying many expensive face sunblocks Eucerin works the best.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel very light at first, but dried to a good consistency.</li>
            <li>Slightly greasy but otherwise a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin so needed a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>As a 49-year-old man, the fact that this lotion is unscented and non-greasy makes it easy to use every day, and the fact that it also provides sun protection is very helpful too.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion i use in my face!1 love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li>True to the label, this is good all-around moisturizer and daily skin protection lotion.</li>
            <li>But, since it flakes up like some straight sunscreens, I&#x27;m assuming that the product is made primarily of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is ill-suited for heavy sweaters (our husbands), but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Great product and a generous portion, one bottle lasted me through a two month summer trip to Europe using it everyday.</li>
            <li>It also leaves kind of a shiny white layer on your face.</li>
            <li>It did turn my skin purple, but it eventually absorbed.  </li>
            <li>look that elementary schoolers sport.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it five stars if it was made with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It does go on a bit oily at first, but quickly blends into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and burn easily  </li>
            <li>The good news is I have no rash or other effects from this--but I will be looking for another replacement.</li>
            <li>mom was right</li>
            <li>apply it right out of the shower-</li>
            <li>It rubs right in to the skin with no problems.</li>
            <li>to look right when I wear this</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount</li>
            <li>and I feel like this was the right choice.</li>
            <li>I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this to me this year for a general protection from the sun for face and neck, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>Lastly it is supposed to be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>works really well as an effective daily screen</li>
            <li>this is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With combination, acne prone, sensitive and easily irritated skin, using sunscreen has been a battlefield for me.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for sensitive skin and my Dermatologist recommended it at least  20 yrs.</li>
            <li>I was forced to buy it when Eucerin Q10 spf 15 lotion (which I loved) wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>I like it very much because it is unscented.</li>
            <li>The little plastic cap is good quality  </li>
            <li>It is light and, yes you do have to gentle massage the cream in to avoid a light white film.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of that before I purchased this.</li>
            <li>, i love Eucerin the facility that i worked at only used Eucerin for the patients there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products with an SPF.</li>
            <li>I only wear powder, but it does not like a coat of powder on top.</li>
            <li>The same way if I want to apply some foundation on top.</li>
            <li>so I am willing to put up with the shiny appearance of the cream.</li>
            <li>You need to really rub it in though!</li>
            <li>pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li>It gets pretty flaky in the winter time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years now and it always leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously, I used Olay, but couldn&#x27;t find a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use some eye cream first then this</li>
            <li>Overall not my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I know people with acne are often told to make sure they are getting enough zinc in the diet.</li>
            <li>doctor recommends spf 30 or higher.  </li>
            <li>I take hot showers</li>
            <li>And let&#x27;s not forget that acne treatments (retinoid creams, accutane, benzoyl peroxide) make your skin way more likely to burn</li>
            <li>It was hot out, but I felt like I had sunscreen on.  </li>
            <li>my son loves this stuff - has a spf 30, most only have 15</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is super light, effective, and doesn&#x27;t cause any trouble for my sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, does not irritate, moisturizes, and it got high mark from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Also, my sensitive acne-prone skin has never broken out from it which is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>It is water resistant and last the entire day, even in the bright</li>
            <li>Of course, if you put too much on, you will be able to see it because the face will be white!</li>
            <li>Well, I have never broken out more in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for daily use as a facial sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually getting ready to purchase more.</li>
            <li>It does leave some white residues but it is not a big problem for me as I have fair skin.     </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Aloe vera which I love so much.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have mild Rosacea</li>
            <li>Another (minor) con is that though it&#x27;s fragrance-free, I personally find the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as the Target-Olay-knock-off</li>
            <li>The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn&#x27;t have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes.</li>
            <li>Switched from Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF15 and Ultra Calming SPF15 to this Eucerin product based on cost.</li>
            <li>If you need this for bare faced days, then it may be adequate but for a daily moisturizer underneath concealer or even very light makeup, it&#x27;s awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps, doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap cologne, isn&#x27;t sticky and is provided by radiology centers to people undergoing radiation treatment, so I feel it&#x27;s probably among the best available---and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li>--I get a light film on my face, plus streaks of white that only move around my face when I try to rub them in better.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need.</li>
            <li>It contains zinc oxide and titanium oxide, two of the most important ingredients in even the most expensive sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>but if you can get past that it&#x27;s supposed to be good for you.</li>
            <li>For the price paid, you are better off buying a decent drug store moisturizer and apply a non-greasy sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue and flake up on your face.  </li>
            <li>A quick lookup of one of the new ingredients, ensulizole, revealed that this is another one of those dreaded chemical sunscreens, which, according to the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, is &amp;#34;known to produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight, leading to damage of DNA.</li>
            <li>I use it after applying Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion and I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues since :).</li>
            <li>My skin is more dry than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>better on dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product -- recommended by my dermatologist and the price on Amazon beats the local drug stores hands down.</li>
            <li>Finally I found the right product for my skin specially for my face.</li>
            <li>B0032AMW1A San Diego Women&#x27;s Ultrabraid X Large Brim Hat]]</li>
            <li>I have to say that my rating is based purely on the fact that I discovered after using the product for a couple of months that I am allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>If it moisturizes at all, I certainly can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>Saw the positive reviews for this one (and the reasonable price) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and as I wanted a good daily moisturizer that had sun protection in it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  </li>
            <li>Obviously it appears fine for some people.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product light, protects skin from the sun the only downfall is that it leaves yours skin looking a little white</li>
            <li>I have in between light and medium skin tone, so on summer, I get really dark specially my face</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or smelly, only lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It also felt very chalky on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smooth enough to wear under any foundation, and no scent to bother you.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s basically just a really watery sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I was getting too much sun driving home from work but, not anymore.</li>
            <li>really started looking at ingredient labels.</li>
            <li>whatever..it&#x27;s just gotten to be too much of a hassle</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but too much mosture would lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>It blends into skin much faster than any sunscreen I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What is so fantastic about this facial lotion?  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to try it and see, but it really IS dermatologist recommended.  </li>
            <li>Skin cancer is real.</li>
            <li>I like this, but not as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturizing that much, but it does protect my face even at the pool.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my whole face, and that lead to acne.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the sun protection creams do not moisturise very well but that can&#x27;t be said for this cream.</li>
            <li>I usually mix it in with some foundation in a darker shade than I would normally wear and it does a great job of moisturizing and protecting my 40+ year old skin.  </li>
            <li>It works and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>With the Eucerin name I thought this lotion would be really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I wanted sunscreen, I could have purchased some at Walmart for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>You can visibly scrape off lotion if you use too much, so it does not absorb as well as the Aveeno product I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle to sensative skin and protects against harmful sunlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable, too.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>This works really well as sunscreen &amp; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a reasonably priced SPF 30 zinc oxide based sunscreen for quite a while.</li>
            <li>that does whatever it wants, you NEED to try this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I even order on my subscribe and save option since I use it so much.</li>
            <li>If it helps, I am a light skinned Asian.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a moisturizer which I will say this is closer to that</li>
            <li>Her skin looks so much</li>
            <li>It really smells like sunscreen as a warning.</li>
            <li>It has been gentle on my skin and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues however sometimes I look like I forgot to blend it.</li>
            <li>I really try to work it into my skin, but it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li>This product has been recommended by my dermatologist and is effective for everyday application as a skin&lt;br /&gt;cancer</li>
            <li>I have tried so many daily moisturizers with SPF, and even the ones for sensitive skin irritated the skin around my eyes (an area that needs a lot of sun protection).  </li>
            <li>Lesson learned from trying to save a few bucks versus aveeno, a far superior product.</li>
            <li>It diffuses light very well so it appears a glow vs a chalky grey.</li>
            <li>I use it maybe twice a day and a single bottle is still going strong after 6 months.</li>
            <li>As I naturally have a fairly dark tan, this is very noticeable, and it also shows up very easily in pictures.  </li>
            <li>Much to my enjoyment, they must have reformulated it because it now goes on clear, exactly like normal face lotion.</li>
            <li>Make sure to not use too much at once otherwise it&#x27;ll be a mess.</li>
            <li>most have SPF 15, which is not adequate for sun protection.</li>
            <li>Plus it is modestly priced and usually available at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding it at my local stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Amazon has it!</li>
            <li>The sunblock absorbs quickly and stays on after moderate sweating.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re lucky enough to survive it.</li>
            <li>I have left the house so many times not knowing that there is glob of white lotion on my face or on my hairline.  </li>
            <li>Decent moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have great staying-power when you&#x27;re exercising/ sweating, however, it&#x27;s not advertised as a sport-sunblock</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good product, especially for price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;ll sting a tiny bit but only if&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily; I can see how it might leave a whitish cast on those with darker skin, but I&#x27;m pretty pale, so this doesn&#x27;t affect me.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have whiteheads in the area between my eyebrows and a little bit on my chin, and I break out more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a topical retinoid called tazorac, which is like retin-A only stronger, and that stuff keeps my face pretty pink and sensitive to most products, so I may be a different case then most.  </li>
            <li>shiny(i can deal with the shine),white and with little pills if you rub to many time.</li>
            <li>It works well, does its job, washes off easily at night, and isn&#x27;t sticky like some of those other sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>Good face lotion, but be prepared, it&#x27;s kind of thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I really like this face lotion because it didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and provides spf 30.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin towards the sun, this protects and mosturizes my face very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and offers SPF 30.</li>
            <li>light moisturizer &amp; not very greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I like it, but I was surprised by how much rubbing and rubbing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product off-and-on for a few months now, especially on hot, sunny days.  </li>
            <li>It feels like you are putting on normal sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It does, but that&#x27;s not a negative and you shouldn&#x27;t rub it in to eliminate the film for it</li>
            <li>This is because of the high iron content of the water where I live.  </li>
            <li>I just went to get a new supply and it seems they have stopped carrying it at 2 well known chains in my area: CVS and Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li>Its not sold where I currently live</li>
            <li>Good under makeup- Hard to find in my rural area</li>
            <li>I started using this lotion in 2008 but switched to different well-known brands in 2012 that were readily available locally.</li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We use this every day in sunny Southern California and like it very much.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>Leaves your bread and face pretty white, unless you spend a lot of time working it in.</li>
            <li>Other brands do not have the same SPF or are much more</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a face lotion that won&#x27;t break the bank, burn your sensitive skin and that is lightweight, this is the lotion for you!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t wear it when it is hot outside.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it can leave you looking white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it helps with dryness so much, but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>nongreasy, no pimples, doesn&#x27;t hurt on skin that has been using retinol products, cheap enough to slather on kids bodies and my arms too, doesn&#x27;t take too long to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I really have given this one a shot for a long time because I actually really like the way it looks and feels on my skin..</li>
            <li>And if it gets too hot your sweat will take it with and you will sweat white instead of clear.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have very sensitive combination skin that breaks out due to hormones, even at 38 ys old,  but at least I know that I don&#x27;t have to deal with more sun damage on top of whats already going on.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is fine, moisturizing and non-scented but it rubs off in little balls as soon as I put on makeup primer or anything else on my face.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is still available at Walgreens, WalMart and thru Amazon among other outlets.</li>
            <li>I fine that the pilling is remedied by often shaking the bottle well and by cleaning out the dispenser tube if it&#x27;s not used for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent the last 20 years going twice a year to the dermatologist and I am a melanoma survivor and most recently just had MOH&#x27;s surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from my nose (I&#x27;m 39 years old!)</li>
            <li>There is a clear appreciation from those of us who need this product as a PROTECTIVE element rather than a cosmetic fix.</li>
            <li>so soft..</li>
            <li>However in the summer in South Carolina, which is like nine months of the year, I wind up sweating most of it off, so that sucks..</li>
            <li>I used it twice on the same day, and unfortunately it gave me the same chalky-white face look that many people complain about in many sunblocks.</li>
            <li>and it made there skin baby soft but the zinc oxide in this face product leaves my face looking</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking sorta young.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, it has never offended my particularly sensitive skin, and it contains sunscreen</li>
            <li>One pump is enough for my whole face and neck and product lasts me for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace another product to which I developed a sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin along with rosacea.  </li>
            <li>It works well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on face and absorbs very well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I maybe switching to Olay Complete or</li>
            <li>I would suggest this for anyone who wants a lightweight sunscreen for daily use.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different face moisturizers and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The reason I used is because my mom&#x27;s doctor prescribed this lotion for her sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it since then.  </li>
            <li>NEVER waste a penny on this one.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, plus have sun photosensitivity.</li>
            <li>so I guess I can&#x27;t be surprised there.</li>
            <li>her age do not look as young.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much and it stays white</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen no moisturizing benefits so far.</li>
            <li>As a comparator though product has a noticeably heavier feel than something like [[ASIN:B001F51TBI Olay Complete</li>
            <li>and they only need like 2 drops to do her whole face.</li>
            <li>takes 1 - 2 minutes of intense rubbing to get all the white coating from your face.</li>
            <li>also I think they changed their formula recently too because this new bottle has been making me break out pretty severely, and it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve changed in my routine..</li>
            <li>More importantly, because this stuff sorted out my lizard skin, i&#x27;m way less likely to pick my face, and therefore way less likely to introduce bacteria to screw up my clear-ish skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, but only Eucerin delivers both the moisturinzing and sunscreen that I, as a blonde, do most definately need.</li>
            <li>Living in Florida, SPF is a huge part of my daily routine and every other SPF lotion I tried in 2012 caused breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist for sunscreen due to my cancer on my face, it says unscented, but the smell is too much for me on my face all day so really don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I must admit when I first purchased this product I was a little skeptical because most Eucerin products I have got have been way too rich for my skin even when it claims to be lightweight .  </li>
            <li>I find myself using a small amount, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it only takes a small amount to cover the face and body.  </li>
            <li>This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism).</li>
            <li>I literally have tried EVERY daily high SPF moisturizer on the market (Vanicream, Olay, Neutrogena.. etc.)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t rub it on right, you&#x27;ll notice long white streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>A full pump of product may be a bit too much for a single application, so start with a half pump and go from there.  </li>
            <li>At first reaction this lotion felt like normal sunscreen and even had that slight sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>I use Retin A which removes dead cells and can dry the skin especially at first.  </li>
            <li>I also have tried different brand foundations that normally won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li>It feels just right on my combination, acne-prone skin - not oily but enough to make my skin not feel and look dry.</li>
            <li>I am family-history-of-melanoma pale and need a daily moisturizer with more than the standard SPF 15.</li>
            <li>right before I&#x27;m going to leave the house to realize I almost left the house with a big white clump in my eyebrow, or on my chin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, has no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts--a small miracle since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Will leave you looking ashy or dusty if your skin has anything resembling a tan or deep complexion and that is due to the titanium dioxide and the zinc that are in this product that give you the great UV protection.</li>
            <li>I know they did something because the dispenser on this new bottle works differently too</li>
            <li>I live in FL and need the spf on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This lotion is lightweight, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin radiant, protected from the Sun and provides a great base for my makeup!</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes and protects the skin, stops itching and dry skin</li>
            <li>I use this cream every day as a day cream because it is light on my delicate skin but offers moisture and UVA / UVB  protection.</li>
            <li>it had been dry and flaky from the Ohio winter weather, and then it got super dry and sunburnt in California.</li>
            <li>Only downside is if you use to much it makes your face white for a bit.</li>
            <li>I have to really work when I use it so that I don&#x27;t go outside w/GIANT WHITE BLOTCHES all over my face from where the lotion didn&#x27;t absorb!</li>
            <li>Secondly, my skin did not have that soft, refreshed, dewy young look like w/</li>
            <li>so it really depends on whether I need the extra protection relative to the tendency to feel heavy/hotter.</li>
            <li>Most face lotions and creams make my face burn, or are simply too thick and oily.</li>
            <li>,it is light,has a very barely there fragrance and works the way it should.</li>
            <li>All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf15]].  </li>
            <li>being said, it does take a little bit to massage it into your skin to get rid of the strong white pigment, but when you do you&#x27;ll be greeted with a product that not only moistures well but also protects.  </li>
            <li>To make it completely sunproof and long lasting, I use ColorScience sunbloc powder (colorless All Clear, which you can get on the internet) over it and know I am completely protected for an entire day of normal indoor/outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>I made the classic mistake of \\&quot;the fancier and more expensive the better\\&quot; when I was a dedicated Aveeno user.</li>
            <li>: The general consensus is that this product will not cause you to break out; it has not caused me to break out (unlike Olay &#x27;s moisturizer).</li>
            <li>My skin has suddenly become sensitive and I am allergic to sunscreen I used for years.</li>
            <li>do use this product under my Bare Mineral&#x27;s Matte foundation powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product, ESPECIALLY for all my sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li>Or, could be that their skin was wet from a shower when they put it on, in which case, it won&#x27;t rub in very well.  </li>
            <li>I meant to purchase the Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 SPF15.</li>
            <li>It does have an opaque white appearance though, so if it&#x27;s not massaged in completely,  it&#x27;ll be noticeable.</li>
            <li>this meets the bare minimum rating</li>
            <li>Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I&#x27;ve seen here or anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>but if I am not careful i get sunscreen streaks on my face.</li>
            <li>The price was acceptable and with fast shipping I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband always uses at less than 2/3 the price retail.  </li>
            <li>I so wanted to like this product, especially because of the potential benefits this product supposedly offers as purported by the company from providing 24-hour moisturizing effects to an oil free and non-comedogenic sunblock that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and break my face out with pimples to UVA and UVB protection with at least 30 SPF.  </li>
            <li>The secret is that white film which actually looks attractive if you put a dusting of Colorscience or any regular translucent powder, plus a little powder blush over it.</li>
            <li>I wear it every day since I live in the dry state of Arizona.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for daily use even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>That one&#x27;s really a matter of personal preference, though, and it&#x27;s certainly not anything revolting at that.</li>
            <li>The price is kind of high, but I usually can find it on Amazon for a few dollars less than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why there is a slight white cast when it is first applied.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with a light moisturizer still not good.</li>
            <li>Recently I try this SPF30 with no regrets.  </li>
            <li>Also, it feels more like a sunscreen than a facial moisturizer -- I noticed that my skin tends to still feel a little dry when I use it, as opposed to some other face</li>
            <li>The down side is that the product not only leaves white residues like other reviewers have mentioned but also flakes on the face, which is a huge no no.  </li>
            <li>(smile lines, above my lip) as well as just plain white patches.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, land of extremely low humidity, lots of sun and wind, so dry skin is ever present.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it might have been stress-induced, but I have had way more stressful times in my life and never broke out as badly as when I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on dryer, doesn&#x27;t get sweated off, and costs about half as much.  </li>
            <li>Everything negative reviews mentioned is true: oily texture without moisture, white residue that stays all day and caking all over the face.</li>
            <li>It is not a real problem, but I don&#x27;t especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it .</li>
            <li>Eucerin is a very heavy white lotion, so it takes awhile to work it into your skin, but the results are worth the time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how many months, but it seems like it lasts at least half a year or so per bottle.</li>
            <li>There is a slight white residue leftover if you apply too much, which is why I am only rating 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The SPF 30 performs very well, even in sunny conditions above what would be a typical daily exposure (including skiing and beach days).  </li>
            <li>Product goes on fine and is non irritating but has an oily sheen and leaves my face looking like I&#x27;ve applied white foundation.  </li>
            <li>One little squirt is enough to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li>I recently broke out due to a new face primer I started using.</li>
            <li>and the bad had begun to outweigh the good</li>
            <li>people suggest trying to rub it in really well, but it burns so bad when I put it on  and rubbing it in burns even more.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I generally am very happy with Eucerin products, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my super-sensitive</li>
            <li> BTW, Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> and yet you get superb protection against the sun.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the best thing for me.</li>
            <li> best complimented with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy wonderful moisturizer in an easy-to-use format.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking a great deal of pain (that goes on for months!)</li>
            <li> and this is perfect!</li>
            <li> so prob not the best for the summer since I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my skin oily or if that&#x27;s just the sweat-either</li>
            <li> Eucerin works great a moisturizer as well as a sun screen!</li>
            <li> Best of all, its inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face lotion that has an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li> Also the bottle size fits perfectly into my skin care organizer.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon pricing was wonderful, and I now have two containers for almost the price</li>
            <li> &gt; Not overpriced and is an excellent price for what you receive.</li>

            <li> Cost is very good as well!</li>
            <li> I thought &#x27;GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizing qualities that also have the benefit of sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting a wonderful moisturizer I could use before applying my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has SPF which is wonderful for preventing sun damage and isn&#x27;t too heavy/oily on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sun screens I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Excellent face lotion!</li>
            <li> Very good product with great price!</li>
            <li> , the lotion is very good.</li>

            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> The pricing on this is very good too.</li>
            <li> - she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I&#x27;ve found out now for good reason!</li>
            <li> My sister loaned me this lotion, and I loved it!</li>
            <li> Good price for two bottles!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and it was shipped in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Addie</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good price, and for some reason I find the bottle very attractive.</li>
            <li> , very glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Great value.  </li>
            <li> Great cream.</li>
            <li> It does provide great protection from the sun however.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for what you get.   </li>
            <li> It works great together.</li>
            <li> To boot, it also does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> (Its the face, not the lotion, lol.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> but I learned a great deal from that.</li>
            <li> So great gift.</li>
            <li> It feels great under makeup, has no perfume-y odor, and is a great price point.</li>
            <li> It is great that it comes in SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> The twin pack came at a great price, too.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the SPF 30, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive moisturizer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great over my serum and under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, provides great protection.</li>
            <li> Great UVa/UVB protection.</li>
            <li> Happy with the Eucerin product.</li>
            <li> However, for the price and the additional SPF, it&#x27;s a great value</li>
            <li> Great mositurizer with sunblock.</li>
            <li> Great for summer protection even without make up.  </li>
            <li> Great value for your money.  </li>
            <li> But for drier areas, works great.</li>
            <li> It is great for the day as it doesn&#x27;t block your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> mineral based, great non-waterproof lotion.</li>
            <li> The SPF is great, too.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Works great in daylight, not so good in evening, as flash photography leads to funky looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the pump feature, it gives the perfect dosage.</li>
            <li> Im really happy with this product, I would buy again!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect, feels more like lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is very good for anyone who has no allergy problems.</li>
            <li> Good stuff to keep the suns rays from damaging your skin, because it is spf 30</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I have tried zinc type face sun protection on my face, I believe this works as good considering the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good moisturizing sun protection product and because this was made by Eucerin</li>
            <li> I needed a face lotion with good SPF to protect my skin under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This got good reviews</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I also recommend you invest in a good hat.</li>
            <li> if you are fair-skinned, it looks good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Good price on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Good for guys and girls who don&#x27;t wear make-up...</li>
            <li> I think I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my beloved Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Good moisterizer for a resonable price.</li>
            <li> I have found that using Eucerin Face Lotion, SPF 30  gives me good protection.  </li>
            <li> to use with no lid&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer with good sun protection</li>
            <li> have eczema, fair skin, and am trying to get rid of acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good sun protection as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily like some sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t have any of the retinoids that CeraVe has.  </li>
            <li> I had another Eucerin Moisterizer that I loved</li>
            <li> good on my skin</li>
            <li> I think it is good for men and those women who do not like unscented.</li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works like SPF30 sunscreen, but has the added benefit of a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a try and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good consistency too - not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is a really good moisturizer with SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Nice light-weight cream, smoothes on very nice.</li>
            <li> San Diego Hat Company has some stylish and beautiful broad-brimmed ones that block UV rays.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and arrived in excellent condition!  </li>
            <li> and that is very, very important!</li>
            <li> VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting it to be a phenomenal moisturizer as Eucerin is known to have great lotions/moisturizers for body.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for well over a year and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and SPF 30, good combination.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li> Still love the Eucerin body cremes, but will NEVER use this again!</li>
            <li> She gets many compliments!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap and definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find it available through Amazon</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> but my face still looks kind of shiny when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy</li>
            <li> What is so nice is that there is a choice of a 6 months frequency.   </li>
            <li> It kind of peels up or something.</li>
            <li> I did not feel that it is a nice moisturizer, either.  </li>
            <li> just which ingredient I am allergic to, but am conducting my own &#x27;patch&#x27; test.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed--really liked the idea of SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I even find that it makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Thanks Eucerin for another wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It will probably not be cost effective to return it, so I may just have to toss it, and find something else.</li>
            <li> For a 1/5 of the price of a bottle of Shiseido, it moisturizes better, gives me more of a glow, and is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found this  very moisturizing sunscreen to be perfect.  </li>
            <li> This 30 spf moisturizer is perfect for the summer, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ll probably use it year-round.</li>
            <li> All in one product: very cost and time effective with great results!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does have a handy dispenser, but it takes a lot of work to get the lotion worked into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and this has been great and is totally nongreasy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great value and offers great</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great as the moisturizer leaves the face and body feeling good!</li>
            <li> Creamy, smooth has not too toxic ingredients, and it Felt good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is suitable for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Of the 5 samples I tried, Eucerin was the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is a great Sunscreen that goes on easy, its light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily film.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for years &amp; honestly I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> And, the best part, it is economical, which is seldom true of any kind of cosmetic, especially if it is any good!</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> It feels very light and has no smell.  </li>
            <li> this two pack arrived quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> This seems to provide good sun protection, doesn&#x27;t show, soaks in fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.</li>
            <li> I even have some cheap dollar cocoa butter lotion that works better!</li>
            <li> so I was very happy to find a large supply at such a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> The sun coverage is great for this very fair red-head and so gentle and never stings my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, it was Halloween!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Many of my friends recommended this for me.</li>
            <li> Finally you cannot beat this awesome price.</li>
            <li> On top of that the moisturizer was non-existent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> This is an okay sunscreen.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, my face looks more healthy, smoother and blooming.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love and trust all</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it under makeup as a sun screen.  </li>
            <li> I wear Bareminerals makeup on top of this product and swear by this lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband needed this while he was having facial cancer treatments and it has been so wonderful we keep using it.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a shot, and am ultimately glad I did.</li>
            <li> I used to use Oil of Olay, but Eucerin seems more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> If you require something that looks more like makeup without the hassle of makeup I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Overall, great product and I haven&#x27;t burned yet!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to layer more goop on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product &amp; like using it on my face.  </li>
            <li> Love them both.- Non-greasing</li>
            <li> This face moisturizer is my and my SO&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> and like it better.</li>
            <li> However, I love it.  </li>
            <li> , i like the cost, and i am glad for the spf 30</li>
            <li> one in most CA drug stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are nicer feeling sunscreens with more moisture out there, but this one does the trick and is god for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 12 years; it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> For the money, Coppertone Sport is a much better product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed that my skin is softer and more luminous.</li>
            <li> Love all eucerin products.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin is one of my favorite brands of lotions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS,GREAT MOISTURIZER.WHEN</li>
            <li> Even around the eye area, I&#x27;m able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both, and come to the conclusion that I like the CeraVe better.</li>
            <li> I have been tried a lot of different sunscreen, this one works great!</li>
            <li> Did nothing but cover, I need more protection than that.</li>
            <li> I am hooked,really glad I bought the twin pack</li>
            <li> my favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking maybe it would get better.</li>
            <li> Better off w/some dime store body lotion than this.</li>
            <li> My favorite SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It nice and smooth and not oily.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Eucerin SPF 30 Facial Sunscreen Lotion is the best sunscreen - I’ve used it since February 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I cannot use most mosturizers/lotions on my face because they make me brake out, not this one.</li>
            <li> It is Eucerin, so you are confident in the product, but it doesn&#x27;t work long-term (skipping or forgetting days).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m scared to think that many people who don&#x27;t know what these ingredients are are unknowingly using them, thinking they are protecting their skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, I am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, but just know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice light lotion without avobenzone.  </li>
            <li> Love how it also contains SPF.</li>
            <li> Many women</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any SPF30 lighter than this Eucerin but for, say, a work day I won&#x27;t need that protection and will opt for the lighter and more breathable Olay.</li>
            <li> I switched brands and found one that works better than this.</li>
            <li> Gentle moisturizer and very effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li> Nice and light and easy to apply but still leaves skin feeling moisturised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have normal skin (oily in t zone) and it works great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the white color of the zinc not rubbing in all the way either, because I have fair skin and to me it just kind of gives it a peachy-blushy look that I kind of dig.  </li>
            <li> Are you aware that when they remove skin cancer they take a fair chunk of flesh from below the skin, too?</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight sunscreen that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you are prone to acne and have dry skin, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely texture and is easy to spread onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> The relatively high SPF (for a face moisturizer) is great for blocking harmful UVA and UVB rays, and it is fragrance-free, non-greasy, and great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got seriously sensitive skin and most facial moisturizers cause me to break out in the hives, but this product is so great and incredibly moisturizing that I can&#x27;t stop recommending it to everyone</li>
            <li> Even more importantly, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product glides onto the skin and soaks in quickly, leaving a nice matte finish in less than one minute.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> However it does sweat off easily</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, nor greasy or sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is inexpensive and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best facial lotion, but for the price it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> We both love the product very much, great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Has a strong synthetic sunblock oil</li>
            <li> Problem is, they all seem to have a strong chemical \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product, the packaging isn&#x27;t so great, alot of product came out when I barely squeezed it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and for how cheap it is-its def worth it!</li>
            <li> so my skin will last beautifully another 30 years.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> It is not scented, is light and easily applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a pretty light, but it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you can rub in,</li>
            <li> It works fine under some primer and makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expiration dates are more than adequate.</li>
            <li> and I have them handy where I can get to them easy and fast.</li>
            <li> While the texture of this product is a bit more like sunscreen than lotion, it is still very light and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is very light and contains the right ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is odorless, greaseless, effective, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Great for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, absorbs well, with light rubbing.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Eucerin SPF 30 lotion in a 2 pack with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on light, HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works great as sunscreen and daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance free is also a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t stink, feel greasy, and you can put it on every day to avoid looking like a leather glove by the time you&#x27;re 50.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as an inexpensive, daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Your foundation will NOT go on smoothly after applying this.</li>
            <li> Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn&#x27;t really have an effect on it either way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s getting such great reviews.</li>
            <li> It is light which I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eucerin: Great for lizard people, lasts forever, just the best everyday facial moisturizer on the market</li>
            <li> and you have to smooth it in.</li>
            <li> I have the Eucerin 15 body lotion which works great for daily wear on my arms, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> However, this lotion does go on smooth but it doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;soak in&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and Amazon sells it for a great price compared to drugstores.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been very great about using sunscreen everyday but since using this</li>
            <li> Works great for my combo skin and although it does seem a bit grease initially, skin soaks it in within 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful pump applicator gives, with one pump, just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 30SPF, lightweight, fragrance free, for sensitive skin and with all the good reviews I chose this face lotion.</li>
            <li> The most notable pro is fact that the SPF 30 does its job very well: 2 days of snowboarding, and no raccoon-face whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it is non-comedogenic, it protects from sun, and is supposed to be good for those with sensitive</li>
            <li> My face feels good, moustirized and remains clear of pimples.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good</li>
            <li> Used just a pea-size amount &amp; it sat right on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is a very light lotion and doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.</li>
            <li> First product with sunscreen that I can confidently put on my face without breaking out or tearing up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than a year after my dermatologist recommended an SPF 30 or higher product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer all year long.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t want to rub in as easily as most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and, although this product is not the one I had originally wanted, I am finding it effective.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to a clean face before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and soaks in quickly, and hasn&#x27;t melted into my eyes and caused stinging.  </li>
            <li> I started using this based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> Based on the moisturizers and sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried from the dermatologist and from our own shopping, it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s oil-free, has a good SPF, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking as shiny as a new pair of shiny leather shoes.</li>
            <li> I have to spend quite a while really rubbing this into my skin to make sure it is properly absorbed or else I will look like a mime!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this product.  </li>
            <li> They are great for sensitive skin or normal skin.  </li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good.</li>
            <li> My skin gets fairly oily throughout the day but this will last throughout the day unless wiped/washed off.</li>
            <li> When having a garage sale recently, I thought I did a good job staying under an umbrella.</li>
            <li> There is only one good news: it does not make my face shiny.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and safe shipping.</li>
            <li> When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily.</li>
            <li> So good for DAILY use.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a fair amount of protection without giving your face a ghastly/ whitish tint; you can wear it daily without it appearing dead-obvious that you&#x27;re wearing sunblock.</li>
            <li> It has done a good job overall as moisturizer</li>
            <li> Probably a good sunscreen except it has way too much white pigment.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and easily mixes with my makeup for more sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little bit of a tacky finish but honestly it makes a pretty good primer for makeup</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lotion for protecting yourself from the sun.</li>
            <li> Eucerin IS a great line and has helped my skin in other problems-</li>
            <li> Great price..would recommend  beats all other retail prices out there non greasy also,,  no fragrance to bother you...</li>
            <li> So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures</li>
            <li> I am very fair and am sensitive to sunscreen lotions (especially around the eyes).</li>
            <li> I love that I was able to subscribe and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out, because I cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and greaseless.</li>
            <li> Clinique SUPER CITY BLOCK SPF 40 1.4oz / 40ml]].</li>
            <li> It is super stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive cremes and lotions trying to get the best product for me.</li>
            <li> This face lotion feels greaseless and quickly absorbs on my skin.</li>
            <li> sometimes have mild acne that always appears to improve when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer for well over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Based on the many positive reviews for the Eucerin lotion, I bought it, and I&#x27;ve been pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I&#x27;m not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin nicely, without fragrance and doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and sting as many other sunblocks do.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 bottles of this product, it is great for your face, it don&#x27;t cake up, like most sunblocks do, and it last for 24 hours, of course I don&#x27;t go in the water, so it last me a lot longer, will buy again,</li>
            <li> It has a light scent, blends in quickly and easily and so far after trying many expensive face sunblocks Eucerin works the best.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel very light at first, but dried to a good consistency.</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy but otherwise a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin so needed a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> As a 49-year-old man, the fact that this lotion is unscented and non-greasy makes it easy to use every day, and the fact that it also provides sun protection is very helpful too.  </li>
            <li> This is the only lotion i use in my face!1 love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li> True to the label, this is good all-around moisturizer and daily skin protection lotion.</li>
            <li> But, since it flakes up like some straight sunscreens, I&#x27;m assuming that the product is made primarily of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is ill-suited for heavy sweaters (our husbands), but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Great product and a generous portion, one bottle lasted me through a two month summer trip to Europe using it everyday.</li>
            <li> It also leaves kind of a shiny white layer on your face.</li>
            <li> It did turn my skin purple, but it eventually absorbed.  </li>
            <li> look that elementary schoolers sport.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it was made with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It does go on a bit oily at first, but quickly blends into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and burn easily  </li>
            <li> The good news is I have no rash or other effects from this--but I will be looking for another replacement.</li>
            <li> mom was right</li>
            <li> apply it right out of the shower-</li>
            <li> It rubs right in to the skin with no problems.</li>
            <li> to look right when I wear this</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount</li>
            <li> and I feel like this was the right choice.</li>
            <li> I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me this year for a general protection from the sun for face and neck, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Lastly it is supposed to be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> works really well as an effective daily screen</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With combination, acne prone, sensitive and easily irritated skin, using sunscreen has been a battlefield for me.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for sensitive skin and my Dermatologist recommended it at least  20 yrs.</li>
            <li> I was forced to buy it when Eucerin Q10 spf 15 lotion (which I loved) wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because it is unscented.</li>
            <li> The little plastic cap is good quality  </li>
            <li> It is light and, yes you do have to gentle massage the cream in to avoid a light white film.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of that before I purchased this.</li>
            <li> , i love Eucerin the facility that i worked at only used Eucerin for the patients there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products with an SPF.</li>
            <li> I only wear powder, but it does not like a coat of powder on top.</li>
            <li> The same way if I want to apply some foundation on top.</li>
            <li> so I am willing to put up with the shiny appearance of the cream.</li>
            <li> You need to really rub it in though!</li>
            <li> pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li> It gets pretty flaky in the winter time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years now and it always leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously, I used Olay, but couldn&#x27;t find a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use some eye cream first then this</li>
            <li> Overall not my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I know people with acne are often told to make sure they are getting enough zinc in the diet.</li>
            <li> doctor recommends spf 30 or higher.  </li>
            <li> I take hot showers</li>
            <li> And let&#x27;s not forget that acne treatments (retinoid creams, accutane, benzoyl peroxide) make your skin way more likely to burn</li>
            <li> It was hot out, but I felt like I had sunscreen on.  </li>
            <li> my son loves this stuff - has a spf 30, most only have 15</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is super light, effective, and doesn&#x27;t cause any trouble for my sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, does not irritate, moisturizes, and it got high mark from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Also, my sensitive acne-prone skin has never broken out from it which is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> It is water resistant and last the entire day, even in the bright</li>
            <li> Of course, if you put too much on, you will be able to see it because the face will be white!</li>
            <li> Well, I have never broken out more in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for daily use as a facial sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually getting ready to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It does leave some white residues but it is not a big problem for me as I have fair skin.     </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Aloe vera which I love so much.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have mild Rosacea</li>
            <li> Another (minor) con is that though it&#x27;s fragrance-free, I personally find the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as the Target-Olay-knock-off</li>
            <li> The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn&#x27;t have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes.</li>
            <li> Switched from Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF15 and Ultra Calming SPF15 to this Eucerin product based on cost.</li>
            <li> If you need this for bare faced days, then it may be adequate but for a daily moisturizer underneath concealer or even very light makeup, it&#x27;s awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps, doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap cologne, isn&#x27;t sticky and is provided by radiology centers to people undergoing radiation treatment, so I feel it&#x27;s probably among the best available---and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> --I get a light film on my face, plus streaks of white that only move around my face when I try to rub them in better.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need.</li>
            <li> It contains zinc oxide and titanium oxide, two of the most important ingredients in even the most expensive sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> but if you can get past that it&#x27;s supposed to be good for you.</li>
            <li> For the price paid, you are better off buying a decent drug store moisturizer and apply a non-greasy sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue and flake up on your face.  </li>
            <li> A quick lookup of one of the new ingredients, ensulizole, revealed that this is another one of those dreaded chemical sunscreens, which, according to the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, is &amp;#34;known to produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight, leading to damage of DNA.</li>
            <li> I use it after applying Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion and I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues since :).</li>
            <li> My skin is more dry than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> better on dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product -- recommended by my dermatologist and the price on Amazon beats the local drug stores hands down.</li>
            <li> Finally I found the right product for my skin specially for my face.</li>
            <li> B0032AMW1A San Diego Women&#x27;s Ultrabraid X Large Brim Hat]]</li>
            <li> I have to say that my rating is based purely on the fact that I discovered after using the product for a couple of months that I am allergic to it.  </li>
            <li> If it moisturizes at all, I certainly can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> Saw the positive reviews for this one (and the reasonable price) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and as I wanted a good daily moisturizer that had sun protection in it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  </li>
            <li> Obviously it appears fine for some people.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product light, protects skin from the sun the only downfall is that it leaves yours skin looking a little white</li>
            <li> I have in between light and medium skin tone, so on summer, I get really dark specially my face</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or smelly, only lightly scented.</li>
            <li> It also felt very chalky on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Smooth enough to wear under any foundation, and no scent to bother you.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s basically just a really watery sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was getting too much sun driving home from work but, not anymore.</li>
            <li> really started looking at ingredient labels.</li>
            <li> whatever..it&#x27;s just gotten to be too much of a hassle</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but too much mosture would lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> It blends into skin much faster than any sunscreen I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is so fantastic about this facial lotion?  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to try it and see, but it really IS dermatologist recommended.  </li>
            <li> Skin cancer is real.</li>
            <li> I like this, but not as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturizing that much, but it does protect my face even at the pool.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my whole face, and that lead to acne.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the sun protection creams do not moisturise very well but that can&#x27;t be said for this cream.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it in with some foundation in a darker shade than I would normally wear and it does a great job of moisturizing and protecting my 40+ year old skin.  </li>
            <li> It works and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> With the Eucerin name I thought this lotion would be really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I wanted sunscreen, I could have purchased some at Walmart for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> You can visibly scrape off lotion if you use too much, so it does not absorb as well as the Aveeno product I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle to sensative skin and protects against harmful sunlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable, too.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> This works really well as sunscreen &amp; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced SPF 30 zinc oxide based sunscreen for quite a while.</li>
            <li> that does whatever it wants, you NEED to try this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I even order on my subscribe and save option since I use it so much.</li>
            <li> If it helps, I am a light skinned Asian.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a moisturizer which I will say this is closer to that</li>
            <li> Her skin looks so much</li>
            <li> It really smells like sunscreen as a warning.</li>
            <li> It has been gentle on my skin and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues however sometimes I look like I forgot to blend it.</li>
            <li> I really try to work it into my skin, but it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> This product has been recommended by my dermatologist and is effective for everyday application as a skin&lt;br /&gt;cancer</li>
            <li> I have tried so many daily moisturizers with SPF, and even the ones for sensitive skin irritated the skin around my eyes (an area that needs a lot of sun protection).  </li>
            <li> Lesson learned from trying to save a few bucks versus aveeno, a far superior product.</li>
            <li> It diffuses light very well so it appears a glow vs a chalky grey.</li>
            <li> I use it maybe twice a day and a single bottle is still going strong after 6 months.</li>
            <li> As I naturally have a fairly dark tan, this is very noticeable, and it also shows up very easily in pictures.  </li>
            <li> Much to my enjoyment, they must have reformulated it because it now goes on clear, exactly like normal face lotion.</li>
            <li> Make sure to not use too much at once otherwise it&#x27;ll be a mess.</li>
            <li> most have SPF 15, which is not adequate for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Plus it is modestly priced and usually available at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding it at my local stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> The sunblock absorbs quickly and stays on after moderate sweating.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re lucky enough to survive it.</li>
            <li> I have left the house so many times not knowing that there is glob of white lotion on my face or on my hairline.  </li>
            <li> Decent moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have great staying-power when you&#x27;re exercising/ sweating, however, it&#x27;s not advertised as a sport-sunblock</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good product, especially for price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;ll sting a tiny bit but only if&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily; I can see how it might leave a whitish cast on those with darker skin, but I&#x27;m pretty pale, so this doesn&#x27;t affect me.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have whiteheads in the area between my eyebrows and a little bit on my chin, and I break out more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a topical retinoid called tazorac, which is like retin-A only stronger, and that stuff keeps my face pretty pink and sensitive to most products, so I may be a different case then most.  </li>
            <li> shiny(i can deal with the shine),white and with little pills if you rub to many time.</li>
            <li> It works well, does its job, washes off easily at night, and isn&#x27;t sticky like some of those other sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> Good face lotion, but be prepared, it&#x27;s kind of thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion because it didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and provides spf 30.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin towards the sun, this protects and mosturizes my face very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and offers SPF 30.</li>
            <li> light moisturizer &amp; not very greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I was surprised by how much rubbing and rubbing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off-and-on for a few months now, especially on hot, sunny days.  </li>
            <li> It feels like you are putting on normal sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It does, but that&#x27;s not a negative and you shouldn&#x27;t rub it in to eliminate the film for it</li>
            <li> This is because of the high iron content of the water where I live.  </li>
            <li> I just went to get a new supply and it seems they have stopped carrying it at 2 well known chains in my area: CVS and Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li> Its not sold where I currently live</li>
            <li> Good under makeup- Hard to find in my rural area</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion in 2008 but switched to different well-known brands in 2012 that were readily available locally.</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We use this every day in sunny Southern California and like it very much.</li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves your bread and face pretty white, unless you spend a lot of time working it in.</li>
            <li> Other brands do not have the same SPF or are much more</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a face lotion that won&#x27;t break the bank, burn your sensitive skin and that is lightweight, this is the lotion for you!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t wear it when it is hot outside.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it can leave you looking white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it helps with dryness so much, but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> nongreasy, no pimples, doesn&#x27;t hurt on skin that has been using retinol products, cheap enough to slather on kids bodies and my arms too, doesn&#x27;t take too long to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I really have given this one a shot for a long time because I actually really like the way it looks and feels on my skin..</li>
            <li> And if it gets too hot your sweat will take it with and you will sweat white instead of clear.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have very sensitive combination skin that breaks out due to hormones, even at 38 ys old,  but at least I know that I don&#x27;t have to deal with more sun damage on top of whats already going on.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is fine, moisturizing and non-scented but it rubs off in little balls as soon as I put on makeup primer or anything else on my face.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is still available at Walgreens, WalMart and thru Amazon among other outlets.</li>
            <li> I fine that the pilling is remedied by often shaking the bottle well and by cleaning out the dispenser tube if it&#x27;s not used for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent the last 20 years going twice a year to the dermatologist and I am a melanoma survivor and most recently just had MOH&#x27;s surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from my nose (I&#x27;m 39 years old!)</li>
            <li> There is a clear appreciation from those of us who need this product as a PROTECTIVE element rather than a cosmetic fix.</li>
            <li> so soft..</li>
            <li> However in the summer in South Carolina, which is like nine months of the year, I wind up sweating most of it off, so that sucks..</li>
            <li> I used it twice on the same day, and unfortunately it gave me the same chalky-white face look that many people complain about in many sunblocks.</li>
            <li> and it made there skin baby soft but the zinc oxide in this face product leaves my face looking</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking sorta young.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, it has never offended my particularly sensitive skin, and it contains sunscreen</li>
            <li> One pump is enough for my whole face and neck and product lasts me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace another product to which I developed a sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin along with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It works well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on face and absorbs very well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I maybe switching to Olay Complete or</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for anyone who wants a lightweight sunscreen for daily use.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different face moisturizers and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The reason I used is because my mom&#x27;s doctor prescribed this lotion for her sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it since then.  </li>
            <li> NEVER waste a penny on this one.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, plus have sun photosensitivity.</li>
            <li> so I guess I can&#x27;t be surprised there.</li>
            <li> her age do not look as young.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much and it stays white</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no moisturizing benefits so far.</li>
            <li> As a comparator though product has a noticeably heavier feel than something like [[ASIN:B001F51TBI Olay Complete</li>
            <li> and they only need like 2 drops to do her whole face.</li>
            <li> takes 1 - 2 minutes of intense rubbing to get all the white coating from your face.</li>
            <li> also I think they changed their formula recently too because this new bottle has been making me break out pretty severely, and it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve changed in my routine..</li>
            <li> More importantly, because this stuff sorted out my lizard skin, i&#x27;m way less likely to pick my face, and therefore way less likely to introduce bacteria to screw up my clear-ish skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but only Eucerin delivers both the moisturinzing and sunscreen that I, as a blonde, do most definately need.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, SPF is a huge part of my daily routine and every other SPF lotion I tried in 2012 caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for sunscreen due to my cancer on my face, it says unscented, but the smell is too much for me on my face all day so really don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I must admit when I first purchased this product I was a little skeptical because most Eucerin products I have got have been way too rich for my skin even when it claims to be lightweight .  </li>
            <li> I find myself using a small amount, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it only takes a small amount to cover the face and body.  </li>
            <li> This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism).</li>
            <li> I literally have tried EVERY daily high SPF moisturizer on the market (Vanicream, Olay, Neutrogena.. etc.)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rub it on right, you&#x27;ll notice long white streaks on your face.</li>
            <li> A full pump of product may be a bit too much for a single application, so start with a half pump and go from there.  </li>
            <li> At first reaction this lotion felt like normal sunscreen and even had that slight sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> I use Retin A which removes dead cells and can dry the skin especially at first.  </li>
            <li> I also have tried different brand foundations that normally won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> It feels just right on my combination, acne-prone skin - not oily but enough to make my skin not feel and look dry.</li>
            <li> I am family-history-of-melanoma pale and need a daily moisturizer with more than the standard SPF 15.</li>
            <li> right before I&#x27;m going to leave the house to realize I almost left the house with a big white clump in my eyebrow, or on my chin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, has no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts--a small miracle since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Will leave you looking ashy or dusty if your skin has anything resembling a tan or deep complexion and that is due to the titanium dioxide and the zinc that are in this product that give you the great UV protection.</li>
            <li> I know they did something because the dispenser on this new bottle works differently too</li>
            <li> I live in FL and need the spf on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lightweight, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin radiant, protected from the Sun and provides a great base for my makeup!</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes and protects the skin, stops itching and dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this cream every day as a day cream because it is light on my delicate skin but offers moisture and UVA / UVB  protection.</li>
            <li> it had been dry and flaky from the Ohio winter weather, and then it got super dry and sunburnt in California.</li>
            <li> Only downside is if you use to much it makes your face white for a bit.</li>
            <li> I have to really work when I use it so that I don&#x27;t go outside w/GIANT WHITE BLOTCHES all over my face from where the lotion didn&#x27;t absorb!</li>
            <li> Secondly, my skin did not have that soft, refreshed, dewy young look like w/</li>
            <li> so it really depends on whether I need the extra protection relative to the tendency to feel heavy/hotter.</li>
            <li> Most face lotions and creams make my face burn, or are simply too thick and oily.</li>
            <li> ,it is light,has a very barely there fragrance and works the way it should.</li>
            <li> All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf15]].  </li>
            <li> being said, it does take a little bit to massage it into your skin to get rid of the strong white pigment, but when you do you&#x27;ll be greeted with a product that not only moistures well but also protects.  </li>
            <li> To make it completely sunproof and long lasting, I use ColorScience sunbloc powder (colorless All Clear, which you can get on the internet) over it and know I am completely protected for an entire day of normal indoor/outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> I made the classic mistake of \\&quot;the fancier and more expensive the better\\&quot; when I was a dedicated Aveeno user.</li>
            <li> : The general consensus is that this product will not cause you to break out; it has not caused me to break out (unlike Olay &#x27;s moisturizer).</li>
            <li> My skin has suddenly become sensitive and I am allergic to sunscreen I used for years.</li>
            <li> do use this product under my Bare Mineral&#x27;s Matte foundation powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this product, ESPECIALLY for all my sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> Or, could be that their skin was wet from a shower when they put it on, in which case, it won&#x27;t rub in very well.  </li>
            <li> I meant to purchase the Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 SPF15.</li>
            <li> It does have an opaque white appearance though, so if it&#x27;s not massaged in completely,  it&#x27;ll be noticeable.</li>
            <li> this meets the bare minimum rating</li>
            <li> Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I&#x27;ve seen here or anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> but if I am not careful i get sunscreen streaks on my face.</li>
            <li> The price was acceptable and with fast shipping I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband always uses at less than 2/3 the price retail.  </li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this product, especially because of the potential benefits this product supposedly offers as purported by the company from providing 24-hour moisturizing effects to an oil free and non-comedogenic sunblock that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and break my face out with pimples to UVA and UVB protection with at least 30 SPF.  </li>
            <li> The secret is that white film which actually looks attractive if you put a dusting of Colorscience or any regular translucent powder, plus a little powder blush over it.</li>
            <li> I wear it every day since I live in the dry state of Arizona.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for daily use even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> That one&#x27;s really a matter of personal preference, though, and it&#x27;s certainly not anything revolting at that.</li>
            <li> The price is kind of high, but I usually can find it on Amazon for a few dollars less than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why there is a slight white cast when it is first applied.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with a light moisturizer still not good.</li>
            <li> Recently I try this SPF30 with no regrets.  </li>
            <li> Also, it feels more like a sunscreen than a facial moisturizer -- I noticed that my skin tends to still feel a little dry when I use it, as opposed to some other face</li>
            <li> The down side is that the product not only leaves white residues like other reviewers have mentioned but also flakes on the face, which is a huge no no.  </li>
            <li> (smile lines, above my lip) as well as just plain white patches.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, land of extremely low humidity, lots of sun and wind, so dry skin is ever present.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it might have been stress-induced, but I have had way more stressful times in my life and never broke out as badly as when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on dryer, doesn&#x27;t get sweated off, and costs about half as much.  </li>
            <li> Everything negative reviews mentioned is true: oily texture without moisture, white residue that stays all day and caking all over the face.</li>
            <li> It is not a real problem, but I don&#x27;t especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it .</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a very heavy white lotion, so it takes awhile to work it into your skin, but the results are worth the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how many months, but it seems like it lasts at least half a year or so per bottle.</li>
            <li> There is a slight white residue leftover if you apply too much, which is why I am only rating 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The SPF 30 performs very well, even in sunny conditions above what would be a typical daily exposure (including skiing and beach days).  </li>
            <li> Product goes on fine and is non irritating but has an oily sheen and leaves my face looking like I&#x27;ve applied white foundation.  </li>
            <li> One little squirt is enough to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li> I recently broke out due to a new face primer I started using.</li>
            <li> and the bad had begun to outweigh the good</li>
            <li> people suggest trying to rub it in really well, but it burns so bad when I put it on  and rubbing it in burns even more.</li>
            <li> I had used a previous version of this a few years ago and it was the typical white, but I felt white was better than ruined clothes</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a face lotion that I could use on my slightly oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick, leaving a white tint to your skin</li>
            <li> , it went through his back,  I rubbed eucerin on his back and within a few days, his skin was soft and the burned red skin was gone  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old son also protests less than having traditional sunscreen applied for his outdoor activities as well.</li>
            <li> I have oily t zone and cheeks, and dry every where else this stuff left a white film on my face</li>
            <li> I have tried blending the areas, but the product tends to flake and &amp;#34;pill,&amp;#34; so I am not sure how much of it is even remaining.</li>
            <li> Long story short ..</li>
            <li> only problem I have is that the zinc oxide tends to whiten as it dries, and it does not completely absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The white cast has never bothered me as long as my skin is protected and NOT GREASY!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and need to wear a sunblock everyday.</li>
            <li> This means that it leaves your face with a slightly whitish cast, even when you try to rub it in completely.  </li>
            <li> I will keep my mostly used bottle on hand, but I&#x27;m afraid to say that I will be trying to unload the second one on someone else.</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry after I use it and it makes your skin look white.</li>
            <li> Use it after I apply my regular moisturizer because I have dry skin and no flaking.</li>
            <li> Needed basic sun protection and moisturization, for middle aged, oily ethnic skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle label recently changed, as the label used to be pink and now is yellow.  </li>
            <li> They are very difficult to find in stores- most zinc oxide based sunscreens in the local drug store are only SPF 15.</li>
            <li> sunscreen may be a bit light for winter if you live in a very dry house/very cold climate.  </li>
            <li> &quot; read&#x3D; literally GLITTER!)It leaves my skin soft without being oily and never feels tight or greasy after using.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, Eucerin SPF 30 met the criteria of not having the bad chemical active ingredients.</li>
            <li> My face was really dry when I put this sunblock/moisturizer on my face and hours later my face was still dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reaction (acne or otherwise) and leaves skin nicely moisturized and protected for sunlight.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin african American</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on white, but you rub it in until it sinks in...</li>
            <li> My scalp was burned, but my face was unaffected.</li>
            <li> Provides sun protection all day long.  </li>
            <li> The plus side is that it has a long shelf life before it expires.  </li>
            <li> The next morning there was a big improvement, the size had gone down almost completly, and they didn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> (odor is more or less neutral), and doesn&#x27;t flake/pill on the skin so that it&#x27;s difficult to put on make-up over it.</li>
            <li> Leaves whitish cast to face, due to titanium and zinc oxide, physical sunblock.  </li>
            <li> bought 2 bottles and haven&#x27;t even used 1/4 of one due to the fact that  it leaves my face looking ghostly white!  </li>
            <li> I put it on automatic order but every time it&#x27;s due it says out of stock/ will you ever get this back?</li>
            <li> I hope it stays on shelves for a long time!</li>
            <li> This Eucerin spf30 face lotion doesn&#x27;t give me a white face like other reviews.  </li>
            <li> now!(Well, I did switch to other products, then came back)</li>
            <li> Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product did not moisturize at all.  </li>
            <li> For the winter months, I would suggest layering this with another moisturizer if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> (I have combination skin, but a predominant portion of my face is dry).  </li>
            <li> keeps my face from getting dry and provides uv protection.</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes my skin feels just as dry as it did before I used this.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> this burned my skin and caused dry flaky patches.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, such product should have never passed the development and certainly not marketed under the name of Eucerin!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is white, so it will make you look somewhat pale.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product when you need a slightly stronger SPF than other facial moisturizers, but don&#x27;t want to use a full-blown regular sunscreen on your face.  </li>
            <li> All the topical treatments dry my skin out to flake off like a gosh dang lizard lady - and this is one of the very few things that works on gross flaky skin.</li>
            <li> For MUCH less money, I get double the SPF (unheard of to find a 30 spf face moisturizer at this price!!)</li>
            <li> in my 20s it has become less oily (in comparison to my teen</li>
            <li> I had previously (but which was only SPF 15).  </li>
            <li> Slight white color, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, it was less oily than the non-comedogenic one I was using before, but after trying this product, I&#x27;m going back to my oily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am as white as humans can get without being an albino, and I like the slight whitening as it seems to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay moisturizers for years, and was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find my most recent fave (an SPF 30 formula) in stores or online.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry face</li>
            <li> After i applied this product to my face,my face look like the dead men walking and fell dry after only an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li> I have to supplement this lotion with another type of thicker, tinted moisturizer such as the Mary Kay tinted moisturizer to make it a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make me look like a Mime it rolled up in little balls when I tried to apply makeup over it.  </li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The SPF does work as expected, but I would not order this product again.  </li>
            <li> and fewer breakouts because of the minimal additives (fragrances/skin \\&quot;brighteners\\</li>
            <li> this has been my everyday Sun screen for years and it is a must have for me, I can recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> so that is not much of an issue.</li>
            <li> anything above SPF 15 is either expensive or just regular, old sunblock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recieved sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the white layer it leaves after application, dissappers after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little greasy though if it&#x27;s not completely dry, but you can usually avoid that by sitting in front of a fan for ten or fifteen minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> This UVB protector may have the potential to cause cancer.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m so disappointed that they have changed this previously wonderful product to include chemicals that are bad for our skin health.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it is chalky and takes some doing to absorb...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to try other Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> Other than the thinness issue, which you have to get used to as you gradually use it</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this anymore because I can&#x27;t use any other skin products before and after it.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, lightweight, does not feel tacky, uses titanium and zinc oxide, which block rays that are not blocked by other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other SPF.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers say its chalky</li>
            <li> Saves lots of time messing about with other potions and lotions and saves my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had some burning with other lotions but this one has not had these issues</li>
            <li> Secondly, like many reviewers have mentioned, it leaves a terrible white cast on your face.</li>
            <li> --- it has never cracked on me like some other bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has also lasted me for waaaaay longer than i expected!</li>
            <li> not sure I want to wear it on a daily basis although you would probably get used to it.</li>
            <li> They use mineral active ingredients: zinc oxide and titanium oxide.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily but honestly only an issue on hot, muggy days.</li>
            <li> I think the other people got an old or poorly made batch.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so much less \\&quot;sunscreen-ey\\&quot; than other brands.  </li>
            <li> Even then, it leaves a sort of dull white cast over skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> and it takes at least ten minutes to fuller soak in.</li>
            <li> Also my powdered makeup would show up in dark patches from sticking to it.</li>
            <li> It is the only sunscreen lately that doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different moisturizers and have found that Eucerin&#x27;s is the least agitating for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed this because I am getting dark blotches on my face.</li>
            <li> After the second was removed, my dermatologist gave me a handful of sunscreen samples and said to pick one of at least SPF 30 and use it every day; rain or shine.</li>
            <li> only complaint is I wish they made 3oz bottles</li>
            <li> I wish it came in SPF 15, instead of 30, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Its whitish only if you apply a thick layer.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and stays white for hours on my face.  </li>
            <li> So I scaled down to just my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I mean treatment such as moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elinor</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t interact with my clarins uv sunscreen &amp; form little balls like with other suncreens can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too flat or dull to use well under make-up also.</li>
            <li> I think my skin just reacted badly to the lotion&#x27;s particular combination of ingredients, and from what I&#x27;ve read in the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> &#x3D; causes odd skin tone in flash photography, smells like sunblock</li>
            <li> it feels slightly too liquidy/thin upon application. .</li>
            <li> This product can be applied to your face in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lotion/cream on my face every day for the last 16 or 17 years and have never had such a difficult time blending face cream/lotion.  </li>
            <li> I mix it half and half with my fair-to-light Aveno radiance tinted lotion and don&#x27;t need foundation or face powder after it.  </li>
            <li> I have to begin protecting from the sun, as I previously didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, but I don&#x27;t mess around with my skin and have used this for almost 10 years (there used to be a 15 spf version too)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin and doesn&#x27;t break my already tight budget.</li>
            <li> The whiteness goes away after a little bit</li>
            <li> It works well, has little odor, but feels heavier than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I will stick to my cetaphil face lotion even though it is a little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> When I applied it on my face it did burn a little</li>
            <li> Thirdly, this is NOT moisturizing in the least!</li>
            <li> and I swear that I am still getting a little burnt.  </li>
            <li> this moisturizer can make my skin look/feel a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few over-the-counter moisterizers with SPF 30.....</li>
            <li> I wear my makeup base over it with no problems, and that was important.</li>
            <li> I know that happens with sunscreens that contain zinc and/or titanium dioxide, but this product left a worse residue than others.  </li>
            <li> I thought my skin was moisturized and protected, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on</li>
            <li> A few things I didn&#x27;t like is when I use it after washing my face, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of moisture packed into it.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I decided I needed to step up my sun protection and went with this lotion- Eucerin Everyday Protection SPF 30.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just this product- \\&quot;Everyday Protection\\</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for everyday wear</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Everyday Protection causes no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> There are a few things about this lotion that work:  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this seems to moisturize well without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I kept it for 2 years because I do not like to waste things, so</li>
            <li> We will continue using this for our everyday skincare needs.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my make-up.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of argan oil in with it.  </li>
            <li> No, I will not recommend this product to family &amp; friends; neither will I waste my money purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, Does the job of protecting and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for waterbased activities or heavy duty sports activities.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to apply with wet hands so it isn&#x27;t so thick and &amp;#34;sunscreen-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> An annoying part of using sunblock is you either have to purchase the tinted ones (which get on white clothes) or the white ones and deal with looking a shade paler than you actually are.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday; I like it.</li>
            <li> I wear this on my face everyday</li>
            <li> However, after a few uses I finally got used to how thin it is.</li>
            <li> FInd it a bit heavy on the face, but am learning to use much less than my past products.  </li>
            <li> Another reason I was skeptical was because I have never actually seen this product in the store by the other SPF face lotions.  </li>
            <li> so I end up looking pale.</li>
            <li> This product left a bad white residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, streaks, and leaves a thin white residue no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Just sort of a dull finish that felt a little pasty.</li>
            <li> (Although BEWARE: Eucerin&#x27;s similarly packaged body lotion with SPF 15 is NOT broad spectrum - BAD EUCERIN!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes very little cream</li>
            <li> It is a little on the white side and needs some rubbing since I believe it&#x27;s physical base sunscreen.</li>
            <li> But since I started using this product, no more problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eucerin Everyday Moisturizer for 10 years and NOTHING beats it!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Q10 w/o the spf and wanted to try the one with spf</li>
            <li> It has a tendency to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin, even when using small portions.  </li>
            <li> Although I was careful to avoid the areas around my eyes, I also found it to be irritating to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried all the usual drugstore suspects.</li>
            <li> so I usually purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and keep going back to this.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy and streaks when I sweat.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> Hard o describe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> This product is extremely hard to blend.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find sunscreen without avobenzone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and hard to blend in</li>
            <li> Recently, after a winter trip to California, my skin acted crazy-</li>
            <li> -tiny pimples- like crazy.</li>
            <li> and so I am afraid I might not get enough sun protection.   </li>
            <li> For the negative reviews .. I just can&#x27;t understand them??</li>
            <li> I always wanted to use sunscreen to protect my skin but it only made me breakout like crazy....</li>
            <li> But -- at least for me -- it caused acne wherever I used it.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE RUB IT IN AND LET IT SIT FOR A LEAST 10MIN BEFORE YOU APPLY YOUR MAKEUP OR PRIMER.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews mention that this lotion whitens the face and that it pills when rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick and moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful,no thick pasty feel-</li>
            <li> So not a problem for some serious protection.</li>
            <li> I had serious acne with cysts and had to take accutane although I found proactive worked</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type or stubbley facial hair, but this leaves an awful white residue.</li>
            <li> After having some bad luck with moisturizing sunblocks that made me breakout (Aveeno), I started using this a couple years ago and have not used anything since for daily sunblock.</li>
            <li> Buying this face lotion was not a good idea.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when after a few minutes in the sun this summer, the lotion started running down my face with my sweat.  </li>
            <li> First off, this smells TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> this is a sunscreen not some weak moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Before with my previous routine, the worst my skin would get would be a singular big pimple.</li>
            <li> I have used Kimberley Sayer moisturiser for oily skin for years but it is quite expensive and hard to get.  </li>
            <li> If I use the Eucerin SPF 30 lotion alone it is way too thin.</li>
            <li> So if you do not mind a thin lotion as a moisturizer then this product is for you.   </li>
            <li> Not attractive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was the least expensive moisturizer with sunscreen at the drugstore on the plus side.</li>
            <li> It seems to get worse throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and I am extremely disappointed that it hAs been out of stock.</li>
            <li> sadly it doesn&#x27;t work ..</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Walgreens for the expensive price of around $13</li>
            <li> I did discover people&#x27;s perception that zinc oxide was the culprit for the distasteful white-face look.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t thrown the receipt away I would have carried this horrible stuff back to Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how expensive this is there.</li>
            <li> You can look at it as an expensive sunscreen instead of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , I might be weird</li>
            <li> a bit expensive..</li>
            <li> All that could go wrong with a cream is in this bottle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on purchasing this product, because for years, I used Shiseido because it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I hate thick smelly creams that smell like you have been to the pool.</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst cream I&#x27;ve ever applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I am not saying face lotions should smell like strawberries or roses, but this stuff really stinks.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be too unhappy about it.</li>
            <li> moisturizer- sorry Eucerin!    </li>
            <li> If you have lame genetic acne (like me!)</li>
            <li> pills really bad if you rub your face - ICK!&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Too bad the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make a tinted version.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often frustrated when selecting moisturizers...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have to wear sunscreen which I hate to do, you might as well have one that works.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get rid of the stains once they are on your shirt/face cloth/ pillow case!  </li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> This is awful stuff.  </li>
            <li> My husband was taking Radiation for his esphogus cancer and was burned terribly.  </li>
            <li> Derms always recommend Cetaphil at the bargain end for skin like mine, and that even gave me a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion says it is non greasy but that isn&#x27;t true. It goes on pretty thick, leaving a white tint to your skin and it takes at least ten minutes to fuller soak in. Also my powdered makeup would show up in dark patches from sticking to it. Lastly it is supposed to be good for sensitive skin but it made me breakout every time I used it.</li>
            <li> My skin has suddenly become sensitive and I am allergic to sunscreen I used for years. This is the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave me looking I&#x27;ve got chemical burns. I love that I was able to subscribe and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out, because I cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few over-the-counter moisterizers with SPF 30.....most have SPF 15, which is not adequate for sun protection. Having had melonoma, I&#x27;m a no-sun nut and have used this product daily for years on my face and body.  It is odorless, greaseless, effective, and reasonably priced.  What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this product as it only takes a small amount to cover the face and body.  Of course, if you put too much on, you will be able to see it because the face will be white! Overall, this product is great as the moisturizer leaves the face and body feeling good!</li>
            <li> Good stuff to keep the suns rays from damaging your skin, because it is spf 30 it is thicker so you need to rub it in well or you will see white.</li>
            <li> Nice and light and easy to apply but still leaves skin feeling moisturised.  Added bonus is the sunscreen, also works well under foundation.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me this year for a general protection from the sun for face and neck, and I just love it. It is not greasy or smelly, only lightly scented. Absorbs into your skin very quickly. I wear my makeup base over it with no problems, and that was important. Btw, my dermatologist stated that if you have sun damage splotches on your skin, it will stay there if you don&#x27;t put spf protective products on. If you will use a product like this Eucerin, the sun damage will fade. It doesn&#x27;t bleach the spots, but it keeps the sun from continuing to darken them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight sunscreen that absorbs quickly.  Great for daily use.  No noticeable scent or color.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product left a bad white residue on my skin.  I know that happens with sunscreens that contain zinc and/or titanium dioxide, but this product left a worse residue than others.  It also felt very chalky on my skin.  I have dry skin and this product did not moisturize at all.  The SPF does work as expected, but I would not order this product again.  I generally am very happy with Eucerin products, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> I used it on me, my daughter, and my toddler grandson with no problems. Smooth enough to wear under any foundation, and no scent to bother you. Wonderful pump applicator gives, with one pump, just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li> Needed basic sun protection and moisturization, for middle aged, oily ethnic skin.  This has noticible suntan lotion scent, but goes away.  Not greasy, absorbs well, with light rubbing.  Leaves whitish cast to face, due to titanium and zinc oxide, physical sunblock.  Works great in daylight, not so good in evening, as flash photography leads to funky looking skin.  (I look lavendar in some nighttime shots - it&#x27;s ok, it was Halloween!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &#x3D; nongreasy, no pimples, doesn&#x27;t hurt on skin that has been using retinol products, cheap enough to slather on kids bodies and my arms too, doesn&#x27;t take too long to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons &#x3D; causes odd skin tone in flash photography, smells like sunblock</li>
            <li> I made the classic mistake of \\&quot;the fancier and more expensive the better\\&quot; when I was a dedicated Aveeno user. I thought my skin was moisturized and protected, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on until I gave this a shot! For MUCH less money, I get double the SPF (unheard of to find a 30 spf face moisturizer at this price!!) and fewer breakouts because of the minimal additives (fragrances/skin \\&quot;brighteners\\&quot; read&#x3D; literally GLITTER!)It leaves my skin soft without being oily and never feels tight or greasy after using. Now, I can slather this stuff on in the morning without wondering if I&#x27;m truly protecting myself from the sun and before bed without worrying about gross pimples popping up overnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom was right - she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I&#x27;ve found out now for good reason! I hope they never stop making this stuff. It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin and doesn&#x27;t break my already tight budget.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product and am amazed at how well the moisture is maintained till night!  It is light and, yes you do have to gentle massage the cream in to avoid a light white film.  This is no problem.  I use Retin A which removes dead cells and can dry the skin especially at first.  This is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that moisturizes and holds all day.  Great value.  Great cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion because it didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and provides spf 30. A few things I didn&#x27;t like is when I use it after washing my face, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of moisture packed into it. It also leaves kind of a shiny white layer on your face. The whiteness goes away after a little bit but my face still looks kind of shiny when I use this lotion. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lotion for protecting yourself from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the posters who said this product made them break out. My skin was an oilier combination type (i.e., oily in T zone) as a teenager and in my 20s it has become less oily (in comparison to my teen years- it&#x27;s still oily!). I have used Clearasil Face Wash and Oil of Olay since my teens. Recently, after a winter trip to California, my skin acted crazy- it had been dry and flaky from the Ohio winter weather, and then it got super dry and sunburnt in California. Therefore, I decided I needed to step up my sun protection and went with this lotion- Eucerin Everyday Protection SPF 30.    Well, I have never broken out more in my entire life. At first I thought it might have been stress-induced, but I have had way more stressful times in my life and never broke out as badly as when I started using this product. Before with my previous routine, the worst my skin would get would be a singular big pimple. Now, I have whiteheads in the area between my eyebrows and a little bit on my chin, and I break out more. I think my skin just reacted badly to the lotion&#x27;s particular combination of ingredients, and from what I&#x27;ve read in the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the only one. I&#x27;m going back to Oil of Olay for my daily facial moisturizer- sorry Eucerin!    Eucerin IS a great line and has helped my skin in other problems- it&#x27;s just this product- \\&quot;Everyday Protection\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve had issues with.</li>
            <li> This is so affordable that I use it as body lotion. It doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reaction (acne or otherwise) and leaves skin nicely moisturized and protected for sunlight. It&#x27;s really cheap and definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with normal to dry skin.  However, I have oily skin with enlarged pores, so this was actually too moisturizing for me and made skin extra oily.  It does provide great protection from the sun however.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  Was recommended to me by doctor when I was having skin problems.  Had purchased at local pharmacy; but, they no longer carried it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Many of my friends recommended this for me. sadly it doesn&#x27;t work .. It made me break out -tiny pimples- like crazy. I came to the point that any product with sunscreen on it will have the same problem on my skin!</li>
            <li> Good, but it&#x27;s basically just a really watery sunscreen. Make sure to not use too much at once otherwise it&#x27;ll be a mess.</li>
            <li> Reconmended by my doctor. Nice light-weight cream, smoothes on very nice. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosecia. I can tell a differnce in the SPF...I was getting too much sun driving home from work but, not anymore. Now I&#x27;m going to try other Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> After reading the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s report on sunscreens:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really started looking at ingredient labels. Surprisingly, Eucerin SPF 30 met the criteria of not having the bad chemical active ingredients. They use mineral active ingredients: zinc oxide and titanium oxide. That&#x27;s why there is a slight white cast when it is first applied. For me it takes about 5+ minutes for the creme to absorb and the white to fade away. So not a problem for some serious protection. I have white, ruddy skin and that may be a factor in it working for me. One has to experiment to see what works for you. Plus it is modestly priced and usually available at the local drug store. HOWEVER! I just went to get a new supply and it seems they have stopped carrying it at 2 well known chains in my area: CVS and Rite-Aid.  Apparently it is still available at Walgreens, WalMart and thru Amazon among other outlets. Thank goodness for that... this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I really have given this one a shot for a long time because I actually really like the way it looks and feels on my skin..so soft..It&#x27;s tricky though..I&#x27;m on a topical retinoid called tazorac, which is like retin-A only stronger, and that stuff keeps my face pretty pink and sensitive to most products, so I may be a different case then most.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the white color of the zinc not rubbing in all the way either, because I have fair skin and to me it just kind of gives it a peachy-blushy look that I kind of dig.  The consistency is a little greasy though if it&#x27;s not completely dry, but you can usually avoid that by sitting in front of a fan for ten or fifteen minutes after applying. However in the summer in South Carolina, which is like nine months of the year, I wind up sweating most of it off, so that sucks..also I think they changed their formula recently too because this new bottle has been making me break out pretty severely, and it&#x27;s the only thing that I&#x27;ve changed in my routine..I know they did something because the dispenser on this new bottle works differently too..whatever..it&#x27;s just gotten to be too much of a hassle and the bad had begun to outweigh the good so I&#x27;m gonna try neutrogena for a while and see how that goes..don&#x27;t let all of my complaining about the Eucerin stop you from trying it though..it&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve tried on my super-sensitive skin!..I&#x27;m just looking for perfection!</li>
            <li> PRO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Titanium and zinc oxide sunblock. Good protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice creamy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a strong synthetic sunblock oil scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pump bottle. PRO if you like pump bottles. CON if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Eucerin SPF 30 lotion in a 2 pack with free shipping. This is a recurring order. You have a choice to select continuous shipment with a timeframe of one month, three months, or six months. It is a great deal for what you get.   The reason I couldn&#x27;t give five stars is because although the lotion is SPF 30 it feels slightly too liquidy/thin upon application. . However, after a few uses I finally got used to how thin it is. I have to supplement this lotion with another type of thicker, tinted moisturizer such as the Mary Kay tinted moisturizer to make it a little thicker. If I use the Eucerin SPF 30 lotion alone it is way too thin. It feels like I don&#x27;t have enough coverage and so I am afraid I might not get enough sun protection.   Other than the thinness issue, which you have to get used to as you gradually use it, the lotion is very good. After the application it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin way too oily. Overall the product is good. It seems to protect and moisturize my face well throughout the entire day.   So if you do not mind a thin lotion as a moisturizer then this product is for you.   The recurring mailing is also a plus. You can choose your frequency so you will never have to worry about running out of the supply or having to reorder yourself. What is so nice is that there is a choice of a 6 months frequency.   Finally you cannot beat this awesome price. You lock in the price for the 2 bottles and there is no shipping carves either. What a deal!!!</li>
            <li> Who are these people giving this product 4 and 5 stars?! Are they spokespeople or employees of the company? I bought this product from Walgreens for the expensive price of around $13 (around the same price for two of these here on Amazon). I used it twice on the same day, and unfortunately it gave me the same chalky-white face look that many people complain about in many sunblocks. I did discover people&#x27;s perception that zinc oxide was the culprit for the distasteful white-face look. I wasn&#x27;t aware of that before I purchased this. On top of that the moisturizer was non-existent. My face was really dry when I put this sunblock/moisturizer on my face and hours later my face was still dry. I so wanted to like this product, especially because of the potential benefits this product supposedly offers as purported by the company from providing 24-hour moisturizing effects to an oil free and non-comedogenic sunblock that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and break my face out with pimples to UVA and UVB protection with at least 30 SPF.  I want all of these features in my sunblock, but the white residue this sunblock leaves is so undesirable.</li>
            <li> This works! SPF 30 protects my face well. I like to go riding this is used on my face and neck. No irritation on my skin. My skin gets fairly oily throughout the day but this will last throughout the day unless wiped/washed off. I have tried zinc type face sun protection on my face, I believe this works as good considering the price. BTW, Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on light, HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 bottles and haven&#x27;t even used 1/4 of one due to the fact that  it leaves my face looking ghostly white!  It makes me look like I&#x27;m going for that deathly gray look for a Halloween party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are better products out there. Probably Cetaphil or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont&#x27; buy this</li>
            <li> works really well as an effective daily screen</li>
            <li> This is the only SPF face lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I perspire.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is an okay sunscreen. I wish it would be thinner in cosistency. It&#x27;s on the thicker side and also leaves a white cast on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and greaseless. Not too heavy for everyday wear and yet you get superb protection against the sun. It&#x27;s quality and inexpensive. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great Sunscreen that goes on easy, its light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily film. I use it everyday with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> This is awful stuff.  Not only did it make me look like a Mime it rolled up in little balls when I tried to apply makeup over it.  Heaven forbid if you sweat, it stings your eyes too.  If I hadn&#x27;t thrown the receipt away I would have carried this horrible stuff back to Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I wish i had read these reviews before i bought this product.I was looking for a good moisturizing sun protection product and because this was made by Eucerin i bought it, i love Eucerin the facility that i worked at only used Eucerin for the patients there and it made there skin baby soft but the zinc oxide in this face product leaves my face looking shiny(i can deal with the shine),white and with little pills if you rub to many time.I tried mixing it with a light moisturizer still not good.If someone has a suggestion to make it work please share.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products with an SPF. Finally I found the right product for my skin specially for my face. I have in between light and medium skin tone, so on summer, I get really dark specially my face and I hated it. But since I started using this product, no more problems. I use it at day time and night time also before I go to bed. When I wake up in the morning, my face looks more healthy, smoother and blooming. I really recommend this product. Doesn&#x27;t give you acne and that&#x27;s the best thing for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eucerin Everyday Moisturizer for 10 years and NOTHING beats it! I literally have tried EVERY daily high SPF moisturizer on the market (Vanicream, Olay, Neutrogena.. etc.) This product is a lifesaver to us who have skin cancer issues. I have spent the last 20 years going twice a year to the dermatologist and I am a melanoma survivor and most recently just had MOH&#x27;s surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from my nose (I&#x27;m 39 years old!) and haven&#x27;t been in the sun since I was a child. Long story short .. this is the ONLY product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my fair sensitive skin. The white cast has never bothered me as long as my skin is protected and NOT GREASY! For the negative reviews .. I just can&#x27;t understand them?? There is a clear appreciation from those of us who need this product as a PROTECTIVE element rather than a cosmetic fix.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to acne and have dry skin, this product is perfect. I have dry skin so needed a good moisturizer but too much mosture would lead to breakouts. I had serious acne with cysts and had to take accutane although I found proactive worked best complimented with this moisturizer. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> With combination, acne prone, sensitive and easily irritated skin, using sunscreen has been a battlefield for me. I always wanted to use sunscreen to protect my skin but it only made me breakout like crazy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN THIS PRODUCT CHANGED IT ALL. First product with sunscreen that I can confidently put on my face without breaking out or tearing up. It&#x27;s gentle. Very gentle. I love the pump feature, it gives the perfect dosage. Yes, when you put it on, it has a whitish hue but it&#x27;s gone in like 20 seconds. It is non-comedogenic so it does not clog pores. It blends into skin much faster than any sunscreen I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I love and trust all Eucerin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this product under my Bare Mineral&#x27;s Matte foundation powder. It works great together. No pore clogging on this face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, ESPECIALLY for all my sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for daily use as a facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard warnings for all sunscreens with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide apply, IE wash it off after exposure to sun, don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off-and-on for a few months now, especially on hot, sunny days.  The relatively high SPF (for a face moisturizer) is great for blocking harmful UVA and UVB rays, and it is fragrance-free, non-greasy, and great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that the zinc oxide tends to whiten as it dries, and it does not completely absorb into the skin.  This means that it leaves your face with a slightly whitish cast, even when you try to rub it in completely.  As I naturally have a fairly dark tan, this is very noticeable, and it also shows up very easily in pictures.  Also, it feels more like a sunscreen than a facial moisturizer -- I noticed that my skin tends to still feel a little dry when I use it, as opposed to some other face lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product when you need a slightly stronger SPF than other facial moisturizers, but don&#x27;t want to use a full-blown regular sunscreen on your face.  The downsides of the product, however, make it a bit of a hassle for daily use.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it under makeup as a sun screen.  It is the ONLY facial sunscreen I have found that does not leave a greasy look after you apply makeup.  I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding it at my local stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub in that well and it&#x27;s not just because of the zinc. It kind of peels up or something. Hard o describe. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to work, but would wear it in the yard. You can&#x27;t put makeup over it well. I only wear powder, but it does not like a coat of powder on top.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. Living in FL, sun protection is a must.  Eucerin Everyday Protection causes no breakouts.  I wear Bareminerals makeup on top of this product and swear by this lotion.</li>
            <li> Product goes on fine and is non irritating but has an oily sheen and leaves my face looking like I&#x27;ve applied white foundation.  Not attractive.  At all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial moisturizer with sunscreen that does not contain oxybenzone.  Specifically I wanted something that contained either zinc or titanium, and this Eucerin does.  It did turn my skin purple, but it eventually absorbed.  Initially, i was expecting it to be like Eucerin&#x27;s lotions - thick and difficult to rub in, but I was happy to learn that it is not.  I&#x27;m actually getting ready to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 30SPF, lightweight, fragrance free, for sensitive skin and with all the good reviews I chose this face lotion. I don&#x27;t know what people are saying when they say it&#x27;s not greasy. If you don&#x27;t rub it on right, you&#x27;ll notice long white streaks on your face. Basically you have to even out all the whiteness. After putting on the lotion I lose a shade of color so I end up looking pale. Unfortuantely this product didn&#x27;t work out for me so now this is my night time facial cream.</li>
            <li> The most notable pro is fact that the SPF 30 does its job very well: 2 days of snowboarding, and no raccoon-face whatsoever. To boot, it also does a great job of moisturizing.  The pump works well, although I don&#x27;t know how it performs when you&#x27;re running out: one of the cons is that it&#x27;s too big for carrying on to a flight... TSA stole mine from me.  Another (minor) con is that though it&#x27;s fragrance-free, I personally find the smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as the Target-Olay-knock-off I had previously (but which was only SPF 15).  That one&#x27;s really a matter of personal preference, though, and it&#x27;s certainly not anything revolting at that.</li>
            <li> My husband needed this while he was having facial cancer treatments and it has been so wonderful we keep using it.  Non-greasy wonderful moisturizer in an easy-to-use format.</li>
            <li> I did not like it because it left white residue on my face and neck. Plus, my face broke out when I applied it. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> After i applied this product to my face,my face look like the dead men walking and fell dry after only an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;Zero star for Eucerin .</li>
            <li> I needed a face lotion with good SPF to protect my skin under my makeup. This got good reviews so I gave it a shot, and am ultimately glad I did. At first reaction this lotion felt like normal sunscreen and even had that slight sunscreen smell. It didn&#x27;t feel very light at first, but dried to a good consistency. I apply it to a clean face before putting on makeup. Although I wouldn&#x27;t wear this to bed, I&#x27;d definitely use it on a daily basis in the morning. Good product.</li>
            <li> I think the other people got an old or poorly made batch.  What is so fantastic about this facial lotion?  1. Its not greasy or shiny, unless your skin is prone to being greasy and shiny. (Its the face, not the lotion, lol.)  2. Yes, it goes on white, but you rub it in until it sinks in... I don&#x27;t think those complaining about the whiteness had rubbed it in.  Or, could be that their skin was wet from a shower when they put it on, in which case, it won&#x27;t rub in very well.  2. The smell is so much less \\&quot;sunscreen-ey\\&quot; than other brands.  3. My make-up doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;ball\\&quot; or blob up over it.  I don&#x27;t know about it making faces breaking out, however. You&#x27;ll have to try it and see, but it really IS dermatologist recommended.  Personally, I have very sensitive combination skin that breaks out due to hormones, even at 38 ys old,  but at least I know that I don&#x27;t have to deal with more sun damage on top of whats already going on.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I used to use Oil of Olay, but Eucerin seems more moisturizing.  Plus I like that it is a pump bottle instead of a squeeze bottle.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I get lots of sun protection.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than a year after my dermatologist recommended an SPF 30 or higher product. When having a garage sale recently, I thought I did a good job staying under an umbrella. My scalp was burned, but my face was unaffected. Also, used some on my legs while wearing shorts for a bicycle ride. Again, protected me well.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and streaks when I sweat.  I meant to purchase the Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 SPF15. What a mistake!  It came in a quantity of 3 and my husband doesn&#x27;t even want to use it!</li>
            <li> First of all, it is a very light lotion and doesn&#x27;t cause breakout. It does leave some white residues but it is not a big problem for me as I have fair skin.     I won&#x27;t use this anymore because I can&#x27;t use any other skin products before and after it. I have tried couple of serum and facial creams before applying it and it peels off. The same way if I want to apply some foundation on top. My foundation will peel. I also have tried different brand foundations that normally won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> this has been my everyday Sun screen for years and it is a must have for me, I can recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> The sunblock absorbs quickly and stays on after moderate sweating. It moisturizes my skin nicely, without fragrance and doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and sting as many other sunblocks do. I&#x27;m happy with it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product glides onto the skin and soaks in quickly, leaving a nice matte finish in less than one minute. It can be worn alone or under makeup (or even just a dusting of powder.) I have a tendency towards oily skin and this does not cause me to break out or make my face shine during the day. What it does is protect the skin- and that is very, very important! A friend of mine was diagnosed with skin cancer a year ago- survived it, thank God- but I learned a great deal from that. Are you aware that when they remove skin cancer they take a fair chunk of flesh from below the skin, too? We&#x27;re talking a great deal of pain (that goes on for months!), bleeding, bandages, and scars- if you&#x27;re lucky enough to survive it. This product can be applied to your face in less than a minute. (Cover your ears and neck too, while you&#x27;re at it.) It works well, does its job, washes off easily at night, and isn&#x27;t sticky like some of those other sunscreen products. If you require something that looks more like makeup without the hassle of makeup I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B00411L61Q Clinique SUPER CITY BLOCK SPF 40 1.4oz / 40ml]]. I also recommend you invest in a good hat. San Diego Hat Company has some stylish and beautiful broad-brimmed ones that block UV rays. See [[ASIN:B0032AMW1A San Diego Women&#x27;s Ultrabraid X Large Brim Hat]] for example. Please, whatever your age, start taking care of your skin now. Skin cancer is real. Just a couple of minutes daily could add years to your life!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to something in the mainstream sunscreens, but find I can use this without problems.  I use it daily on my face and neck and hand and anywhere else I need sun protection.  It works great as sunscreen and daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day. It&#x27;s one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Slight white color, but if you are fair-skinned, it looks good. I have never had a sunburn using this product. I keep one at home, one in my car, and another in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I am family-history-of-melanoma pale and need a daily moisturizer with more than the standard SPF 15. Problem is, they all seem to have a strong chemical \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell. Saw the positive reviews for this one (and the reasonable price) and decided to give it a try.  VERY pleased. Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t smell bad (odor is more or less neutral), and doesn&#x27;t flake/pill on the skin so that it&#x27;s difficult to put on make-up over it. Also like the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is another Christmas gift for friends in Thailand.  I cant believe how expensive this is there. So great gift.</li>
            <li> I use Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion morning and night.  One little squirt is enough to cover your whole face.  It is super stuff.  Keeps me looking sorta young.</li>
            <li> I like to use SPF30 during the summer months and this moisturizer fits the bill.  It feels great under makeup, has no perfume-y odor, and is a great price point. It is no frills,but does the job!  For the winter months, I would suggest layering this with another moisturizer if you have dry skin.  Overall, great product and I haven&#x27;t burned yet!</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of work to get this lotion to rub into your skin.  It feels like you are putting on normal sunscreen.  Leaves your bread and face pretty white, unless you spend a lot of time working it in.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, lightweight, does not feel tacky, uses titanium and zinc oxide, which block rays that are not blocked by other sunscreens. Very nice.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and it was shipped in good time.&lt;br /&gt;Addie</li>
            <li> There are a few things about this lotion that work:  It is non-greasy, it has never offended my particularly sensitive skin, and it contains sunscreen so I don&#x27;t have to layer more goop on my face.  However, I have found that it never, ever rubs in well--I get a light film on my face, plus streaks of white that only move around my face when I try to rub them in better.  Also, my face doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized after using it (I have combination skin, but a predominant portion of my face is dry).  I will keep my mostly used bottle on hand, but I&#x27;m afraid to say that I will be trying to unload the second one on someone else.</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy.  Provides sun protection all day long.  I use it as part of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product &amp; like using it on my face.  When I use it on my hands, however, they end up feeling a touch sticky.  I thought it was a good price, and for some reason I find the bottle very attractive.</li>
            <li> I like this, but not as much as I had hoped.  It works well, has little odor, but feels heavier than I would like.  Not bad for the price.  I use it on days when I am not putting make-up on.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so I need a moisturizer with spf in it and this is perfect! I have oily skin and this seems to moisturize well without being too heavy. However it does sweat off easily so prob not the best for the summer since I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my skin oily or if that&#x27;s just the sweat-either way I love this moisturizer and for how cheap it is-its def worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the morning.  It feels very light and has no smell.  Good price on amazon.  I like the pump design.  One pump is enough for my whole face and neck and product lasts me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from one of my girlfriends and took the plunge.  It leaves your skin rather supple and dewy.  Only downside is if you use to much it makes your face white for a bit.</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy but otherwise a great product.  I have super sensitive skin and burn easily  so I am willing to put up with the shiny appearance of the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white lotion that feels a bit greasy and needs to be rubbed in a lot since it&#x27;s so white.  Good for guys and girls who don&#x27;t wear make-up...</li>
            <li> Leaves a white haze, and has a perfume odor that lingers for hours. It is quite thick and moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> Eucerin works great a moisturizer as well as a sun screen! I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product light, protects skin from the sun the only downfall is that it leaves yours skin looking a little white</li>
            <li> I am very fair and am sensitive to sunscreen lotions (especially around the eyes). I&#x27;ve tried many expensive cremes and lotions trying to get the best product for me. My sister loaned me this lotion, and I loved it! Absorbs quickly, does not irritate, moisturizes, and it got high mark from my dermatologist. Best of all, its inexpensive! I load up on this.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 years.  The plus side is that it has a long shelf life before it expires.  The down side is that the product not only leaves white residues like other reviewers have mentioned but also flakes on the face, which is a huge no no.  It&#x27;s really cheaply made.  For the price paid, you are better off buying a decent drug store moisturizer and apply a non-greasy sunblock that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue and flake up on your face.  In terms of sun protection, I didn&#x27;t do any comparison experiment, so I can&#x27;t comment on it.  But, since it flakes up like some straight sunscreens, I&#x27;m assuming that the product is made primarily of sunscreen.  I did not feel that it is a nice moisturizer, either.  You can look at it as an expensive sunscreen instead of a moisturizer.  I kept it for 2 years because I do not like to waste things, so I just wipe/pat off the white flakes with my fingers and endure the problem until it&#x27;s bottom up.  In my opinion, such product should have never passed the development and certainly not marketed under the name of Eucerin!  I would not buy this item again!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face lotion that has an SPF of 30.  It is wonderful for sensitive skin and my Dermatologist recommended it at least  20 yrs. ago and I have used it all these years.  My skin is very sensitive and I have mild Rosacea and I am now 64 and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that my rating is based purely on the fact that I discovered after using the product for a couple of months that I am allergic to it.  I haven&#x27;t found out yet just which ingredient I am allergic to, but am conducting my own &#x27;patch&#x27; test.  I&#x27;m sure the product is very good for anyone who has no allergy problems.</li>
            <li> I am not allegic to this product.  I use this and the Eucerin hand lotion daily-  Love them both.- Non-greasing</li>
            <li> This is 30 spf cream so it will work as an overall sunscreen. It contains zinc oxide and titanium oxide, two of the most important ingredients in even the most expensive sunscreen products. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer all year long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product -- recommended by my dermatologist and the price on Amazon beats the local drug stores hands down.</li>
            <li> Creamy, smooth has not too toxic ingredients, and it Felt good on the skin. You need to really rub it in though!</li>
            <li> This face moisturizer is my and my SO&#x27;s favorite. Based on the moisturizers and sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried from the dermatologist and from our own shopping, it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s oil-free, has a good SPF, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking as shiny as a new pair of shiny leather shoes. We will continue using this for our everyday skincare needs.</li>
            <li> I use Eucerin hand cream every night before I go to bed.  Recently I try this SPF30 with no regrets.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other SPF.  This one is enough.</li>
            <li> This product is good for sensitive skin.  I have used it for years.  It is great that it comes in SPF 30.  It is non-greasy and unscented.  It does the job keeping my skin protected from the sun too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace another product to which I developed a sensitivity. The good news is I have no rash or other effects from this--but I will be looking for another replacement. Don&#x27;t know if it is an issue of water/sweat or skin roughness, but I find white streaking and areas on my face that collect white residue (smile lines, above my lip) as well as just plain white patches. I have tried blending the areas, but the product tends to flake and &amp;#34;pill,&amp;#34; so I am not sure how much of it is even remaining. So disappointed--really liked the idea of SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I was using Olay but could not find it so ordered this and like it better. Other reviewers say its chalky but i think they are not rubbing it in sufficiently. Its whitish only if you apply a thick layer. It diffuses light very well so it appears a glow vs a chalky grey. I have gotton compliments on my otherwise constantly problem acne and blemished skin.</li>
            <li> I must admit when I first purchased this product I was a little skeptical because most Eucerin products I have got have been way too rich for my skin even when it claims to be lightweight .  Another reason I was skeptical was because I have never actually seen this product in the store by the other SPF face lotions.  However, I love it.  It is very lightweight and a little goes a long way.  Also the bottle size fits perfectly into my skin care organizer.  I think I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my beloved Aveeno.</li>
            <li> While the texture of this product is a bit more like sunscreen than lotion, it is still very light and very moisturizing. I use it after applying Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion and I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues since :).</li>
            <li> this two pack arrived quickly and in good shape.  item is as described.  when i applied the lotion i could see the white residue/film that others mentioned but it disappears in under a minute.  i like how it applies, i like the cost, and i am glad for the spf 30, the 15 levels just don&#x27;t seem to do enough for me.</li>
            <li> As a 49-year-old man, the fact that this lotion is unscented and non-greasy makes it easy to use every day, and the fact that it also provides sun protection is very helpful too.  My 11 year old son also protests less than having traditional sunscreen applied for his outdoor activities as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely get this if you&#x27;re into the &#x27;my mom didn&#x27;t want to take the time to rub in my sunscreen at the pool&#x27; look that elementary schoolers sport. Or if you want to be temporarily blinded.</li>
            <li> This product has been recommended by my dermatologist and is effective for everyday application as a skin&lt;br /&gt;cancer preventative.  The Amazon pricing was wonderful, and I now have two containers for almost the price&lt;br /&gt;of one in most CA drug stores.</li>
            <li> pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  It&#x27;s her favorite and she uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Q10 w/o the spf and wanted to try the one with spf because I&#x27;m starting retin-A but they didn&#x27;t sell it.. so I decided to give this one a try. I have pretty dry skin. It gets pretty flaky in the winter time so I need something that will moisturize deeply. This face moisturizer penetrates my skin to where it isn&#x27;t flaky anymore yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy/oily. I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day. I&#x27;m also prone to ocassional break outs and haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so I like this product a lot. Fragrance free is also a plus.</li>
            <li> My aunts in Thailand asked for this as a daily moisturizer.  They said it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. We have purchased it again for them.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 bottles of this product, it is great for your face, it don&#x27;t cake up, like most sunblocks do, and it last for 24 hours, of course I don&#x27;t go in the water, so it last me a lot longer, will buy again,</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years but recently have had difficulty finding it. It is not scented, is light and easily applied. Other brands do not have the same SPF or are much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The price for two bottles was very good. Expiration dates are more than adequate.</li>
            <li> Good moisterizer for a resonable price. I have sensitive skin towards the sun, this protects and mosturizes my face very well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use this everyday and I am extremely disappointed that it hAs been out of stock. I put it on automatic order but every time it&#x27;s due it says out of stock/ will you ever get this back?</li>
            <li> My husband was taking Radiation for his esphogus cancer and was burned terribly.  Even tho they gave him radiation on the front part of his chest, it went through his back,  I rubbed eucerin on his back and within a few days, his skin was soft and the burned red skin was gone  I will use nothing but  Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin along with rosacea.  I have found that using Eucerin Face Lotion, SPF 30  gives me good protection.  I rely on Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> dermatologist recommended this to me. It&#x27;s suited my needs and I would definitely recommend it and I will be buying it again. Not greasy, pretty-much scentless/odorless, and it works.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use anymore (and I have tried them all!)  I use it at night and again in the morning under make-up or alone.  I recommend it to everyone - it does not clog pores - in fact it helps refine them, and includes sun screen SPF 30.  And, the best part, it is economical, which is seldom true of any kind of cosmetic, especially if it is any good!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use with no lid&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer with good sun protection&lt;br /&gt;Can be used daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a white residue on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and have been using it daily but after use, it makes my skin white. Hence the 3 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are nicer feeling sunscreens with more moisture out there, but this one does the trick and is god for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for 12 years; it&#x27;s fantastic!  Quick shipment and arrived in excellent condition!  I ordered the set of two.</li>
            <li> I just had chemotherapy on my face (Efudex) and am now required to use a moisturizer and sunscreen. I would like to see a version of the product that is SPF 50+, but the 30 does the trick. I apply it every morning.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is ill-suited for heavy sweaters (our husbands), but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s great.  It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and goes on well under my makeup.  I even find that it makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this product.  I bought it because I wanted something non-greasy to wear day-to-day.  It&#x27;s just as greasy as any sunscreen you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore.  For the money, Coppertone Sport is a much better product.  Goes on dryer, doesn&#x27;t get sweated off, and costs about half as much.  You are basically paying for marketing with Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is non-comedogenic, it protects from sun, and is supposed to be good for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, fair skin, and am trying to get rid of acne. As soon as I put this on my face, it burned, EVERYWHERE. Fumes from it burned my eyes and made them water. It&#x27;s really thick, streaks, and leaves a thin white residue no matter what I do. If it moisturizes at all, I certainly can&#x27;t tell. My skin is more dry than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Some people suggest trying to rub it in really well, but it burns so bad when I put it on  and rubbing it in burns even more. DON&#x27;T BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, it was less oily than the non-comedogenic one I was using before, but after trying this product, I&#x27;m going back to my oily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was recommend to buy this one ,and my wife and me like it after try,not sticky,good enought ,can buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. It doesn&#x27;t moisturizing that much, but it does protect my face even at the pool. It works well with sensitive skin. The twin pack came at a great price, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband always uses at less than 2/3 the price retail.  Thanks for the great deal.  I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion! I have searched far and wide for a face lotion that I could use on my slightly oily, sensitive skin. Most face lotions and creams make my face burn, or are simply too thick and oily. This lotion is lightweight, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin radiant, protected from the Sun and provides a great base for my makeup! I also use it at night by itself. I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed that my skin is softer and more luminous. If you&#x27;re looking for a face lotion that won&#x27;t break the bank, burn your sensitive skin and that is lightweight, this is the lotion for you!</li>
            <li> Two for the price of one. Eucerin is a very heavy white lotion, so it takes awhile to work it into your skin, but the results are worth the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, but I don&#x27;t mess around with my skin and have used this for almost 10 years (there used to be a 15 spf version too) It&#x27;s light, it doesn&#x27;t stink, feel greasy, and you can put it on every day to avoid looking like a leather glove by the time you&#x27;re 50.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I expected.  It has a tendency to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the skin, even when using small portions.  Additionally, the SPF will cause your skin to take on a hazy, white appearance.  Although I was careful to avoid the areas around my eyes, I also found it to be irritating to my eyes.  I was happy with the SPF 30, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive moisturizer for my skin.  I have asian skin and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Lancome to Clinique to Smashbox to NARS - all have not compared to this.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years now and it always leaves my skin soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s great over my serum and under my makeup.  This doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and I actually use this at night as well after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used Eucerin products before.  the specific one I was looking for (but Amazon did not have) was the that says &amp;#34;get the red out.&amp;#34;  I have very sensitive skin and, although this product is not the one I had originally wanted, I am finding it effective.  It does not burn and I am grateful for that.  I still would like to find the Eucerin product I found before for getting rid of the redness, but I have been unsuccessful in drugstore searches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> Love all eucerin products.  They are great for sensitive skin or normal skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Not greasy, provides great protection.</li>
            <li> This product looked, smelled, and felt like all the reviews say.  But -- at least for me -- it caused acne wherever I used it.  I tried it on my whole face, and that lead to acne.  So I scaled down to just my nose and cheeks.  Still, if I happen to push it above my cheekbones, I get acne.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  keeps my face from getting dry and provides uv protection. doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price</li>
            <li> Eucerin is one of my favorite brands of lotions. This face lotion feels greaseless and quickly absorbs on my skin. The added SPF 30 is a needed one for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is the only sunscreen lately that doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout. A little goes a long way, and it is chalky and takes some doing to absorb...better on dry skin. I have very pale skin so that is not much of an issue. It&#x27;s great as an inexpensive, daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used Kimberley Sayer moisturiser for oily skin for years but it is quite expensive and hard to get.  I decided to try Eucerin Daily Protection based on reviews.  I am very pleased.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is suitable for oily skin. A lot of the sun protection creams do not moisturise very well but that can&#x27;t be said for this cream. Doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on face and absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt; Not overpriced and is an excellent price for what you receive.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS,GREAT MOISTURIZER.WHEN YOU PUT IT ON PLEASE RUB IT IN AND LET IT SIT FOR A LEAST 10MIN BEFORE YOU APPLY YOUR MAKEUP OR PRIMER.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to put sunscreen on as a matter of course every morning, and I do. This seems to provide good sun protection, doesn&#x27;t show, soaks in fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.</li>
            <li> We have this set up as a recurring order.  I have always had problem skin with cystic acne flaring up every so often.  I have tried a number of different moisturizers and have found that Eucerin&#x27;s is the least agitating for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does take a little bit to massage it into your skin to get rid of the strong white pigment, but when you do you&#x27;ll be greeted with a product that not only moistures well but also protects.  It&#x27;s a win-win!!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, not greasy and it has SPF30.  Good under makeup- Hard to find in my rural area so I was happy to find it available through Amazon</li>
            <li> This is a great value and offers great protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and I&#x27;m often frustrated when selecting moisturizers... anything above SPF 15 is either expensive or just regular, old sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this! It&#x27;s reasonably priced and offers SPF 30. Even more importantly, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer. (Although BEWARE: Eucerin&#x27;s similarly packaged body lotion with SPF 15 is NOT broad spectrum - BAD EUCERIN!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I used Olay, but couldn&#x27;t find a higher SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin. Derms always recommend Cetaphil at the bargain end for skin like mine, and that even gave me a terrible rash. Even around the eye area, I&#x27;m able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried all the usual drugstore suspects. I hope it stays on shelves for a long time!</li>
            <li> This lotion moisturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It does have an opaque white appearance though, so if it&#x27;s not massaged in completely,  it&#x27;ll be noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin I like it a lot</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do, A    I&#x27;m not sure it helps with dryness so much, but it&#x27;s fine.  I pair it with a moisturizer.    It does however leave a white residue.  I maybe switching to Olay Complete or w/e they recommended on acne.org    Overall 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is prone to break-outs, but this product didn&#x27;t cause me to break out at all.  It rubs in easily; I can see how it might leave a whitish cast on those with darker skin, but I&#x27;m pretty pale, so this doesn&#x27;t affect me.  It&#x27;s got good sun protection as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily like some sunscreens do. I think this will be my daily moisturizer from now on, very glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and stays white for hours on my face.  There is only one good news: it does not make my face shiny. But over all, I don&#x27;t like it. Will go back to Cetaphil</li>
            <li> does improve skin texture</li>
            <li> Excellent face/neck  lotion--good coverage and sunscreen coverage. Cost is very good as well!</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion! I use it everyday under my make-up. It does not make my face greasy. Light weight. Soaks in well.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t have any of the retinoids that CeraVe has.  I&#x27;ve used both, and come to the conclusion that I like the CeraVe better.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily, winter &amp; summer.  I mix a few drops of argan oil in with it.  I&#x27;m 54 and have normal skin (oily in t zone) and it works great. I use under my makeup with no problems. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I usually purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not drying. I like the pump. I find myself using a small amount, and that works just fine. Good price for two bottles!</li>
            <li> Gentle moisturizer and very effective sunscreen.  I hugkt recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I usually mix it in with some foundation in a darker shade than I would normally wear and it does a great job of moisturizing and protecting my 40+ year old skin.  I use some eye cream first then this and that&#x27;s all I need for daytime use.  Saves lots of time messing about with other potions and lotions and saves my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of caution.  It will leave white streaks on your skin and especially around your eyebrows if used alone and not mixed in well.  And if it gets too hot your sweat will take it with and you will sweat white instead of clear.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight moisturizer with SPF 30.  I have had some burning with other lotions but this one has not had these issues</li>
            <li> I bought this after I saw the guy from acne.org using it in a youtube video. It&#x27;s terrible! My skin feels dry after I use it and it makes your skin look white. It smells just like sunscreen AND IT MADE ME BREAK OUT! I will stick to my cetaphil face lotion even though it is a little greasy for me. It still does the job and actually moisturizes my skin unlike the Eucerin one. Hope this helped ya&#x27;ll out!</li>
            <li> Works well. Great UVa/UVB protection. Will leave you looking ashy or dusty if your skin has anything resembling a tan or deep complexion and that is due to the titanium dioxide and the zinc that are in this product that give you the great UV protection.</li>
            <li> I have been tried a lot of different sunscreen, this one works great! It goes on easy, nor greasy or sting my eyes. The reason I only give 4 starts is because the product is only in SPF30.</li>
            <li> No. Did nothing but cover, I need more protection than that. By protection I mean treatment such as moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elinor</li>
            <li> I have issues with getting brown spots on my face caused by hormones and must wear sunscreen.I hate thick smelly creams that smell like you have been to the pool.This product is wonderful,no thick pasty feel-the  lotion absorbs well,it is light,has a very barely there fragrance and works the way it should.I am hooked,really glad I bought the twin pack as I know I have found my daily sunscreen/moisturizer.I wear this under my mineral makeup and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing sunscreen at all.I would suggest this for anyone who wants a lightweight sunscreen for daily use.Thanks Eucerin for another wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting it to be a phenomenal moisturizer as Eucerin is known to have great lotions/moisturizers for body. My skin is starting to change now I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; is getting drier. I thought &#x27;GREAT! Eucerin brand name, suncreen, I ought to be set!\\&quot; NOT! This product just does not cut it for me! First, it doesn&#x27;t want to rub in as easily as most moisturizers. I have to really work when I use it so that I don&#x27;t go outside w/GIANT WHITE BLOTCHES all over my face from where the lotion didn&#x27;t absorb! Even then, it leaves a sort of dull white cast over skin. Secondly, my skin did not have that soft, refreshed, dewy young look like w/my favorite moisturizers. Just sort of a dull finish that felt a little pasty. I will say that it did NOT clog my pores. That&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say about it. It&#x27;s too flat or dull to use well under make-up also. Your foundation will NOT go on smoothly after applying this. Still love the Eucerin body cremes, but will NEVER use this again! Matter of fact, 2 years later, it&#x27;s still sitting on the back of my shelf. I kept thinking maybe it would get better. Huge disappointment. Better off w/some dime store body lotion than this. I even have some cheap dollar cocoa butter lotion that works better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of expensive moisturizers and keep going back to this.  It works and is reasonably priced.  Plus it has sunscreen. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got seriously sensitive skin and most facial moisturizers cause me to break out in the hives, but this product is so great and incredibly moisturizing that I can&#x27;t stop recommending it to everyone</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moist and it soaks in.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when I sweat it comes to the surface.  I will purchase it again I just don&#x27;t wear it when it is hot outside.</li>
            <li> I had another Eucerin Moisterizer that I loved but it has since been discontinued so I thought I would try this one. I&#x27;m not as impressed with this one. It gets chalky clumps often, I catch myself in the mirror right before I&#x27;m going to leave the house to realize I almost left the house with a big white clump in my eyebrow, or on my chin. It&#x27;s actually a pretty light, but it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you can rub in, if you try to rub it in I&#x27;ve found it starts to clump up. Overall not my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  With the Eucerin name I thought this lotion would be really great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;-feels good on my skin&lt;br /&gt;-no break-outs or irritations&lt;br /&gt;-no smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-it pills really bad if you rub your face - ICK!&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for sunscreen due to my cancer on my face, it says unscented, but the smell is too much for me on my face all day so really don&#x27;t use it. Fast shipping and safe shipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite SPF moisturizer.  Its not sold where I currently live so I was very happy to find a large supply at such a great bargain.  Recieved sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizing qualities that also have the benefit of sunscreen protection. It is not oily, but serves as a soothing moisturizer with skin protective qualities.</li>
            <li> not spray still have to rub on</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting a wonderful moisturizer I could use before applying my makeup in the morning. Nope. It&#x27;s just a big bottle of sunscreen. If I wanted sunscreen, I could have purchased some at Walmart for much cheaper. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hallelujah!  I have tried so many daily moisturizers with SPF, and even the ones for sensitive skin irritated the skin around my eyes (an area that needs a lot of sun protection).  A full pump of product may be a bit too much for a single application, so start with a half pump and go from there.  Terrific price for the two-pack.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This product is extremely hard to blend.  I have left the house so many times not knowing that there is glob of white lotion on my face or on my hairline.  I&#x27;ve been using lotion/cream on my face every day for the last 16 or 17 years and have never had such a difficult time blending face cream/lotion.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years with sensitive skin. My go to lotion and never had a problem. Don&#x27;t forget your neck.</li>
            <li> Switched from Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF15 and Ultra Calming SPF15 to this Eucerin product based on cost. Happy with the Eucerin product. You can visibly scrape off lotion if you use too much, so it does not absorb as well as the Aveeno product I&#x27;m used to. However, for the price and the additional SPF, it&#x27;s a great value and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Buying this face lotion was not a good idea. Used just a pea-size amount &amp; it sat right on top of my skin. No moisturizing - just whiteness. No, I will not recommend this product to family &amp; friends; neither will I waste my money purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because it is unscented.I think it is good for men and those women who do not like unscented.Hope it could protect me from the sun.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews mention that this lotion whitens the face and that it pills when rubbed into the skin. I am as white as humans can get without being an albino, and I like the slight whitening as it seems to even out my skin tone. It may not be a product for darker skin. I fine that the pilling is remedied by often shaking the bottle well and by cleaning out the dispenser tube if it&#x27;s not used for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes have mild acne that always appears to improve when using this lotion. Maybe it&#x27;s the zinc? I know people with acne are often told to make sure they are getting enough zinc in the diet. Maybe zinc applied topically helps somehow, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use it before bed as well as in the morning since it appears to improve the condition of my skin whether I am going to be in the sun or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go for more expensive brands, brands with advertising hook words like \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. Those products never worked as well for me as this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a face lotion with SPF that I&#x27;m not allergic to.  It nice and smooth and not oily.  Feels nice and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is inexpensive and easy to dispense. It does go on a bit oily at first, but quickly blends into the skin. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it was made with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great mositurizer with sunblock. Great price..would recommend  beats all other retail prices out there non greasy also,,  no fragrance to bother you...</li>
            <li> Great for summer protection even without make up.  Good for sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and easily mixes with my makeup for more sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> I needed this because I am getting dark blotches on my face. My dermatologist recommended it. If not rubbed in all the way, it does leave a white film on your face.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine, moisturizing and non-scented but it rubs off in little balls as soon as I put on makeup primer or anything else on my face.  It just does not layer well at all.  If you need this for bare faced days, then it may be adequate but for a daily moisturizer underneath concealer or even very light makeup, it&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the least expensive moisturizer with sunscreen at the drugstore on the plus side.</li>
            <li> I recently broke out due to a new face primer I started using. So I bought this product, the packaging isn&#x27;t so great, alot of product came out when I barely squeezed it. When I applied it on my face it did burn a little but I like that feeling, I might be weird but I do. I use a lot of chemical peels so im used to that feeling. The next morning there was a big improvement, the size had gone down almost completly, and they didn&#x27;t hurt anymore. Im really happy with this product, I would buy again!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great value for your money.  I have a very dry face so this helps keep it moisturized.  This isn&#x27;t the best facial lotion, but for the price it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I especially like the SPF30.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for the face... Is to greasy... Don&#x27;t recommend... Just work for the body</li>
            <li> This product is gentle to sensative skin and protects against harmful sunlight. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but only Eucerin delivers both the moisturinzing and sunscreen that I, as a blonde, do most definately need.</li>
            <li> this is a good product. a bit expensive.. doctor recommends spf 30 or higher.  this meets the bare minimum rating</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer. I have used it for quite awhile. The price is kind of high, but I usually can find it on Amazon for a few dollars less than anywhere else. It also lasts awhile too. I don&#x27;t remember how many months, but it seems like it lasts at least half a year or so per bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this under my face powder rather than makeup. I love it. IT&#x27;s amazing and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.,</li>
            <li> Decent moisturizer with SPF 30. Use it after I apply my regular moisturizer because I have dry skin and no flaking. SPF 30 is a must even if you are outside for a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different face moisturizers and so far this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s SPF 30, and lightweight. It absorbs quickly, has no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts--a small miracle since I have very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s very affordable, too. I think I paid a total of only $7 or $8 for two 4 ounce bottles.</li>
            <li> Eucerin SPF 30 Facial Sunscreen Lotion is the best sunscreen - I’ve used it since February 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I have had 2 facial skin cancers removed. After the second was removed, my dermatologist gave me a handful of sunscreen samples and said to pick one of at least SPF 30 and use it every day; rain or shine. Of the 5 samples I tried, Eucerin was the best by far. I use it every day for well over a year and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Aun cuando es un producto destinado al cuidado de la cara, funciona perfecto en hombros y espalda para los dias de playa bajo el sol del caribe.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works like SPF30 sunscreen, but has the added benefit of a skin moisturizer.  Great product and a generous portion, one bottle lasted me through a two month summer trip to Europe using it everyday.</li>
            <li> FInd it a bit heavy on the face, but am learning to use much less than my past products.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Eucerin spf30 face lotion doesn&#x27;t give me a white face like other reviews.  The reason I used is because my mom&#x27;s doctor prescribed this lotion for her sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it since then.  It&#x27;s almost ten years now!(Well, I did switch to other products, then came back) Very good product with great price!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and as I wanted a good daily moisturizer that had sun protection in it as well. So I went out and bought this- what a mistake! First off, this smells TERRIBLE. I am not saying face lotions should smell like strawberries or roses, but this stuff really stinks. Secondly, like many reviewers have mentioned, it leaves a terrible white cast on your face. I have to spend quite a while really rubbing this into my skin to make sure it is properly absorbed or else I will look like a mime! Thirdly, this is NOT moisturizing in the least! After about 20 minutes my skin feels just as dry as it did before I used this. Awful stuff.</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst cream I&#x27;ve ever applied to my face. I was forced to buy it when Eucerin Q10 spf 15 lotion (which I loved) wasn&#x27;t available. Everything negative reviews mentioned is true: oily texture without moisture, white residue that stays all day and caking all over the face. All that could go wrong with a cream is in this bottle. NEVER waste a penny on this one.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer. It&#x27;s light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I&#x27;ve seen here or anywhere else.  It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good (though if you are a vigorous pumper it will look like something... gross and white... got squirted on you). The little plastic cap is good quality  --- it has never cracked on me like some other bottles. Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn&#x27;t really have an effect on it either way. Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I wish they made 3oz bottles so I could take this on a plane.</li>
            <li> light moisturizer &amp; not very greasy at all. doesn&#x27;t interact with my clarins uv sunscreen &amp; form little balls like with other suncreens can.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when after a few minutes in the sun this summer, the lotion started running down my face with my sweat.  As I wiped my brow, I had a white sweat/lotion mixture all over my hand.</li>
            <li> I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  Does not make your face look greasy, and has no scent, so folks cannot even tell I have it on.  When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily. So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  But for drier areas, works great.</li>
            <li> We use this every day in sunny Southern California and like it very much. It is a little on the white side and needs some rubbing since I believe it&#x27;s physical base sunscreen.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion. It protects my skin without clogging my pores. I cannot use most mosturizers/lotions on my face because they make me brake out, not this one. My face feels good, moustirized and remains clear of pimples. Also, the white layer it leaves after application, dissappers after a few minutes. This is the only lotion i use in my face!1 love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Use it everyday, Does the job of protecting and moisturizing. Very satisfied with the purchase. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, plus have sun photosensitivity. I&#x27;ve been using this sunbloc for a number of years as a daily face lotion. To make it completely sunproof and long lasting, I use ColorScience sunbloc powder (colorless All Clear, which you can get on the internet) over it and know I am completely protected for an entire day of normal indoor/outdoor activities. (I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for waterbased activities or heavy duty sports activities.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some reviewers have mentioned that it leaves a white film on their faces. It does, but that&#x27;s not a negative and you shouldn&#x27;t rub it in to eliminate the film for it is the film that protects you from harmful rays. I always get compliments on my complexion and questions about what makes my skin look so translucent and youthful. The secret is that white film which actually looks attractive if you put a dusting of Colorscience or any regular translucent powder, plus a little powder blush over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for years &amp; honestly I am pretty happy with it. It is a little oily but honestly only an issue on hot, muggy days. It leaves a little bit of a tacky finish but honestly it makes a pretty good primer for makeup so I can&#x27;t complain too much. You have to rub well and apply gingerly or you will get whiteface- this is a sunscreen not some weak moisturizer. Overall pretty good product, especially for price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;ll sting a tiny bit but only if&lt;br /&gt;I apply it right out of the shower- I take hot showers so I think my skin sensitivity amps up. But the stinging is temporary and has no physical manifestation so I can&#x27;t be too unhappy about it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white film on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is great for the day as it doesn&#x27;t block your skin.  It is Eucerin, so you are confident in the product, but it doesn&#x27;t work long-term (skipping or forgetting days).  So good for DAILY use.  I like to apply with wet hands so it isn&#x27;t so thick and &amp;#34;sunscreen-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  After a couple of weeks I noticed the redness clearing up.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves a white residue that stays on all day. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s getting such great reviews. Thankfully it was relatively inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li> This works really well as sunscreen &amp; moisturizer.  It has a lovely texture and is easy to spread onto the skin.  I have very fair skin, and this has been great and is totally nongreasy!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It moisturizes. It feels a bit oily but that might just be my skin. It is light which I like. Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need. However, it smells like a sunscreen. Also, It looks and feels like a sunscreen to some extent. It is not a real problem, but I don&#x27;t especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it . I&#x27;ll probably try something different when I&#x27;m done with these two bottles. The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I&#x27;m not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin products for years with my psoriasis and exema, so when i was shopping for a face lotion with 30SPF of course I gave this a try and loved it.  The sun coverage is great for this very fair red-head and so gentle and never stings my sensitive skin.  I mix it half and half with my fair-to-light Aveno radiance tinted lotion and don&#x27;t need foundation or face powder after it.  I&#x27;m 34 and am told I look 24 so I&#x27;ll keep using this product!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced SPF 30 zinc oxide based sunscreen for quite a while. They are very difficult to find in stores- most zinc oxide based sunscreens in the local drug store are only SPF 15. This sunscreen is super light, effective, and doesn&#x27;t cause any trouble for my sensitive and acne-prone skin. It does definitely have a bit of a &#x27;sunscreen smell,&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I will definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: I reordered this product, as I was getting low on my last bottle, and when it arrived, I noticed that it has been reformulated. A quick lookup of one of the new ingredients, ensulizole, revealed that this is another one of those dreaded chemical sunscreens, which, according to the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, is &amp;#34;known to produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight, leading to damage of DNA. This UVB protector may have the potential to cause cancer.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m so disappointed that they have changed this previously wonderful product to include chemicals that are bad for our skin health. It will probably not be cost effective to return it, so I may just have to toss it, and find something else. Waste of money. And I&#x27;m scared to think that many people who don&#x27;t know what these ingredients are are unknowingly using them, thinking they are protecting their skin.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sunscreen, so I have to use sunblock.  An annoying part of using sunblock is you either have to purchase the tinted ones (which get on white clothes) or the white ones and deal with looking a shade paler than you actually are.  I had used a previous version of this a few years ago and it was the typical white, but I felt white was better than ruined clothes so I purchased this again.  Much to my enjoyment, they must have reformulated it because it now goes on clear, exactly like normal face lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer. I wear it every day since I live in the dry state of Arizona. It has SPF which is wonderful for preventing sun damage and isn&#x27;t too heavy/oily on the skin.</li>
            <li> If you have lame genetic acne (like me!) that does whatever it wants, you NEED to try this moisturizer. All the topical treatments dry my skin out to flake off like a gosh dang lizard lady - and this is one of the very few things that works on gross flaky skin. More importantly, because this stuff sorted out my lizard skin, i&#x27;m way less likely to pick my face, and therefore way less likely to introduce bacteria to screw up my clear-ish skin. And let&#x27;s not forget that acne treatments (retinoid creams, accutane, benzoyl peroxide) make your skin way more likely to burn so this SPF is killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also lasted me for waaaaay longer than i expected! I use it maybe twice a day and a single bottle is still going strong after 6 months. It works fine under some primer and makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin: Great for lizard people, lasts forever, just the best everyday facial moisturizer on the market</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and was concerned.  I like zinc oxide so I was not worried about that being in the lotion.  Takes very little cream and you have to smooth it in.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizer. Protects face and neck plus also has spf of 30!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is very light and contains the right ingredients.  Check for it on sale though!</li>
            <li> This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism). Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun. The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn&#x27;t have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality lotion at a great price. It&#x27;s non-comedogenic, so you can put it on your face after a face wash to both moisturize and protect your face from the sun. It&#x27;s a good consistency too - not greasy at all. It rubs right in to the skin with no problems.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on purchasing this product, because for years, I used Shiseido because it worked for me. However, I am glad I made the switch. For a 1/5 of the price of a bottle of Shiseido, it moisturizes better, gives me more of a glow, and is a great sunscreen. (This product contains zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which are the more expensive sunscreen ingredients). I think I will be a returning customer.&lt;br /&gt;Other tips: The general consensus is that this product will not cause you to break out; it has not caused me to break out (unlike Olay &#x27;s moisturizer). A bottle can last around 4-6 months. Be aware that it can leave you looking white. Otherwise, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, land of extremely low humidity, lots of sun and wind, so dry skin is ever present.  This stuff really helps, doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap cologne, isn&#x27;t sticky and is provided by radiology centers to people undergoing radiation treatment, so I feel it&#x27;s probably among the best available---and the price isn&#x27;t bad. I even order on my subscribe and save option since I use it so much.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sun screens I have ever used.  I have been a loyal customer for well over 10 years.  It is water resistant and last the entire day, even in the bright So. California sun.  The cream is zinc oxide based so it doesn&#x27;t sting or smell.  The only downside is that it is white, so it will make you look somewhat pale.  Too bad the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make a tinted version.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lightweight and provides sun protection.  There is a slight white residue leftover if you apply too much, which is why I am only rating 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Good face lotion, but be prepared, it&#x27;s kind of thick and a little goes a long way. Maybe that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for -- I like it, but I was surprised by how much rubbing and rubbing I have to do. I guess that&#x27;s eucerin though. I would recommend this product, but just know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures, I recommend it to all</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews which warned against this product because it burns.  I did not take heed because I felt eucerin was a respected brand name and I didn&#x27;t understand how that would be possible.  Well, it burns!  I don&#x27;t know what it is about the chemical composition of this product, but I felt a burning sensation on my face almost immediately upon application.  Obviously it appears fine for some people.  If it helps, I am a light skinned Asian.  Lesson learned from trying to save a few bucks versus aveeno, a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and need to wear a sunblock everyday. I have the Eucerin 15 body lotion which works great for daily wear on my arms, legs, etc. However, this lotion does go on smooth but it doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;soak in&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve tried it with face lotion, without face lotion, with primer, without primer I just can&#x27;t get my make up to look right when I wear this (I don&#x27;t wear much make up but my foundation is streaky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using this on my neck and chest in the morning and using the shiseido 42 on my face since it layers well.</li>
            <li> I work outside and use sunscreen on my face every day.  This is a nice light lotion without avobenzone.  In my area avobenzone turns any items of clothing it touches orange when that item is washed.  This is because of the high iron content of the water where I live.  It is a total pain!  Almost impossible to get rid of the stains once they are on your shirt/face cloth/ pillow case!  It&#x27;s hard to find sunscreen without avobenzone.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen may be a bit light for winter if you live in a very dry house/very cold climate.  Like the Canadian prairies.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a skin cancer surgeon. Nice texture and SPF 30, good combination. I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years on my face.  The bottle label recently changed, as the label used to be pink and now is yellow.  Have no fear it is the same product.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.  I wish it came in SPF 15, instead of 30, but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and love it! It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing for my sensitive skin. Love how it also contains SPF. I would definitely recommend this product and Amazon sells it for a great price compared to drugstores.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday; I like it. I have been using it for a while, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a moisturizer which I will say this is closer to that than it is an SPF 30 sunscreen but it is still a sunscreen.  It left my face with a white tent and also made my face sweat.  It was hot out, but I felt like I had sunscreen on.  So, my overall opinion is that it works well as a sunscreen and I will use it for that, but not sure I want to wear it on a daily basis although you would probably get used to it.</li>
            <li> After having some bad luck with moisturizing sunblocks that made me breakout (Aveeno), I started using this a couple years ago and have not used anything since for daily sunblock. It gives you a fair amount of protection without giving your face a ghastly/ whitish tint; you can wear it daily without it appearing dead-obvious that you&#x27;re wearing sunblock. Also, my sensitive acne-prone skin has never broken out from it which is a HUGE plus. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have great staying-power when you&#x27;re exercising/ sweating, however, it&#x27;s not advertised as a sport-sunblock so I guess I can&#x27;t be surprised there. Would definitely recommend for daily use even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent face lotion!</li>
            <li> Picked this up after seeing some you tubers reviews on it  and I just threw it in the trash after just three uses. I have oily t zone and cheeks, and dry every where else this stuff left a white film on my face I am a dark skin african American so that just didnt work then i thought i could where it under makeup or at night but it started to clog my pores.normally when I dislike a product I give it to a friend or relative to try but I could not bring myself to let do that, I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so I&#x27;ve found this  very moisturizing sunscreen to be perfect.  It has a light scent, blends in quickly and easily and so far after trying many expensive face sunblocks Eucerin works the best.  I&#x27;d recommend it and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Mom has used this product for numerous years. Her skin looks so much younger- Nourished and cared- Many women her age do not look as young.  She gets many compliments!</li>
            <li> I wear this on my face everyday and I swear that I am still getting a little burnt.  It really smells like sunscreen as a warning.</li>
            <li> my son loves this stuff - has a spf 30, most only have 15</li>
            <li> It has done a good job overall as moisturizer but if I am not careful i get sunscreen streaks on my face. It has been gentle on my skin and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues however sometimes I look like I forgot to blend it.</li>
            <li> this burned my skin and caused dry flaky patches.  going back to Aveeno</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much and it stays white so keep rubbing in.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type or stubbley facial hair, but this leaves an awful white residue. I really try to work it into my skin, but it&#x27;s still there. It seems to get worse throughout the day. There are times when I&#x27;m leaving work and look in the mirror and it looks like I&#x27;m dying. I&#x27;ve seen no moisturizing benefits so far.</li>
            <li> True to the label, this is good all-around moisturizer and daily skin protection lotion. The SPF 30 performs very well, even in sunny conditions above what would be a typical daily exposure (including skiing and beach days).  As a comparator though product has a noticeably heavier feel than something like [[ASIN:B001F51TBI Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf15]].  I haven&#x27;t found any SPF30 lighter than this Eucerin but for, say, a work day I won&#x27;t need that protection and will opt for the lighter and more breathable Olay. They feel equally moisturizing so it really depends on whether I need the extra protection relative to the tendency to feel heavy/hotter.</li>
            <li> Probably a good sunscreen except it has way too much white pigment.  I looked like a Mime!  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It took several minutes of continuous rubbing to get this lotion to absorb into my skin. I never could get the white film/tint to go away until I just washed it off. I switched brands and found one that works better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay moisturizers for years, and was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find my most recent fave (an SPF 30 formula) in stores or online.  Based on the many positive reviews for the Eucerin lotion, I bought it, and I&#x27;ve been pleased so far.  It glides on smoothly and soaks in quickly, and hasn&#x27;t melted into my eyes and caused stinging.  A little also goes a long way.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a really good moisturizer with SPF 30.  The only downside is I have oily skin and this moisturizer can make my skin look/feel a little greasy.  I just use mineral veil to take away the shine and I&#x27;m good to go.  Otherwise its a quality product, IMO.</li>
            <li> I was told to start using SPF 30 so my skin will last beautifully another 30 years. I have to begin protecting from the sun, as I previously didn&#x27;t do that. I had no idea what to get. This came in a double pack with a pump-nozzle. It gives just the right amount and I have them handy where I can get to them easy and fast. Really moisturizes and protects the skin, stops itching and dry skin and I feel like this was the right choice.</li>
            <li> This product has all the ingredients recommended by the recent gov&#x27;t report. If you have to wear sunscreen which I hate to do, you might as well have one that works. The pricing on this is very good too.</li>
            <li> This 30 spf moisturizer is perfect for the summer, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ll probably use it year-round.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this so I bought it. It&#x27;s a bit thick and hard to blend in but if you can get past that it&#x27;s supposed to be good for you. The price was acceptable and with fast shipping I have no real complaints. I live in FL and need the spf on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I started using this based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation and so far I love it! It feels just right on my combination, acne-prone skin - not oily but enough to make my skin not feel and look dry. I haven&#x27;t been very great about using sunscreen everyday but since using this I see a difference.</li>
            <li> i bought this to send along to preschool for the teachers to put on my daughter. it&#x27;s perfect, feels more like lotion and they only need like 2 drops to do her whole face. mineral based, great non-waterproof lotion.</li>
            <li> takes 1 - 2 minutes of intense rubbing to get all the white coating from your face.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every day as a day cream because it is light on my delicate skin but offers moisture and UVA / UVB  protection. All in one product: very cost and time effective with great results!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it moisturizes my skin and protects it against UV rays. SPF 30 is critical in areas where sunlight is prolonged and intensive. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Aloe vera which I love so much.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does have a handy dispenser, but it takes a lot of work to get the lotion worked into your skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion in 2008 but switched to different well-known brands in 2012 that were readily available locally. Living in Florida, SPF is a huge part of my daily routine and every other SPF lotion I tried in 2012 caused breakouts. I finally switched back to this one in the spring of 2013 and not planning on stopping to use it ever again even if that means I need to get it from Amazon every time I run out. Works great for my combo skin and although it does seem a bit grease initially, skin soaks it in within 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it on my neck.  My man uses it on his face.  We both love the product very much, great for daily use.</li>
            <li> I use it every day after washing my face.  It is noncomedogenic, so it won&#x27;t contribute to acne.  It moisturizes without leaving you with a greasy feeling.  The SPF is great, too.  I used it on an outdoors-y vacation and didn&#x27;t get burned at all.</li>
