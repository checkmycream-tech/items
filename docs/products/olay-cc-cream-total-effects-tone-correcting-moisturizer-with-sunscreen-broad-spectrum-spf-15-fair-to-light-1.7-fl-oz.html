    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This moisturizer works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This one was best for moisturizing, and that&#x27;s why I got it.</li>
            <li>Also, the Sephora was rated &#x27;best coverage&#x27; and I was tempted to try that, but I&#x27;ve found that this Olay product is plenty of coverage for me</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I gave this 3 stars because this does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a bit torn because I want it to match my tone perfectly (which it doesn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Omg this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li>it still is perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect, semi-sheer, non-goopy, tinted moisturizer for about 20 years</li>
            <li>It does, however, act as a wonderful primer.  </li>
            <li>The price was the best I found anywhere.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is perfect for minimum make up days!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime with SPF 15 too!</li>
            <li>But this approaching-40-mama-of-2-under-3 enjoys the results and THAT is priceless.</li>
            <li>What a great deal!</li>
            <li>this one is absolutely perfect...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I washed everything off my face as best</li>
            <li>my skin feels and looks better just after a week of using it!!!</li>
            <li>For reference, I have very very fair skin, which is acne prone, and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look great and has the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Wish we could get rid of those things for good!</li>
            <li>The product itself has great list of ingredients abs</li>
            <li>Delivery was just great.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, and the sunscreen doesnt irritate.</li>
            <li>Probably would be great for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great CC Cream.</li>
            <li>I really liked it for its coverage and the way it evened out my skin tone and made my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>This makes you look like you just have naturally great skin for every day use.  </li>
            <li>and it is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Its a perfect mixture of moisturizer and cover up :)</li>
            <li>If this product starts to make your face feel warm, wash it off immediately!</li>
            <li>I have used many brands in my lifetime and find Olay is the best for &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; skin,</li>
            <li>I did some research and heard that Oil of Olay CC cream was better for those with very fair skin</li>
            <li>I ordered the lightest shade which is for really fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>Good price, and does a good job for a CC cream.  </li>
            <li>I read about this in Good Housekeeping when they reviewed CC creams.</li>
            <li>Good combination of coverage plus moisturizer.</li>
            <li>To be fair though, I have used a variety of Olay products for years, so hopefully any benefits would have kicked in by now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m truly delighted with the ease of use and how evenly it covers my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so good, but I wonder why Olay seems to keep changing its products.</li>
            <li>, that being said, the coverage is good.  </li>
            <li>However, it is not for people who have  very light skin at all!</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad that I purchased this cream!</li>
            <li>(like I&#x27;m applying sunscreen, just rub it on!), and my skin looks 100x more even!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin tone so much more even!</li>
            <li>The 15SPF is also great for those of us with fairer skin who easily get sunburn.</li>
            <li>Great foundation for light make up.</li>
            <li>I tried a dozen BB creams to find one I like and really loved L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic BB cream</li>
            <li>Separately I loved these products, but I wanted sunscreen protect more than the BB cream&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized, protected from the sun and evens out my skin tone nicely</li>
            <li>and I really liked them a lot</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I decided to keep the product and use it under makeup as a moisturizer since it boasts so many good benefits.  </li>
            <li>It feels kind of greasy, I didn&#x27;t like it for summer use.</li>
            <li>The 3 stars is for the effective moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li>one is that I honestly could see where this product could work for someone</li>
            <li>The color works great, and the coverage is pretty good for a CC.  </li>
            <li>I love using this, it&#x27;s so smooth and spreads great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I quickly saw a postive change in my complexion (hydrated), and the moisturizer feels weightless on.  </li>
            <li>and it blends in beautifully with no weird smudges or anything.  </li>
            <li>how could a beautiful bottle of swirling lotion cause so much pain?</li>
            <li>I still put moisturizer on first and the Oil of Olay Moisturizing lotion works great with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great even-out product: I quickly and easily put it all over my face</li>
            <li>It give very light coverage which I like.  </li>
            <li>SO glad</li>
            <li>The redness around my mouth and on my chin has almost all  disappeared and many of my acne scars have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li>I generally love Olay products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently tried BB cream from another manufacturer and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love the tint, which evens out skin tone without the look and feel of foundation.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to tell if it&#x27;s actually helping correct my tone, but it makes my skin look wonderful when it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so my skin tone is light &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; with warm undertones.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this helps!:)</li>
            <li>I think the sunscreen works ok too...</li>
            <li>and I like the combination of these better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, have been using it for 4+ years.  </li>
            <li>But why pay more?</li>
            <li>I never ever write reviews but thought I&#x27;d better write this one in case any one had the expectations I had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that the sheer color to this lotion eliminates the need for any foundation for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product recently because I had been hearing about how wonderful these CC creams were.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I would try the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>Between the shiny quality and the lack of coverage, there is no way I could use just the CC cream and feel confident leaving the house.</li>
            <li>but I have literally never received so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have nearly flawless skin I could definitely see using this alone, although it can leave a bit of a shine to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay for many years but products have changed.</li>
            <li>I was perfectly satisfied with delivery and accuracy.  </li>
            <li>I normally love Olay products, so when I was reading about this fantastical cc cream, I did not hesitate to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Its ok for coverage, but didn&#x27;t do anything to improve skin conditions like it claims.</li>
            <li>Olay total effect, Regenerist, and L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect night cream.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using it and replaced it with a Marcelle day cream and have continued using Regenerist and Age Perfect daily without any problems.</li>
            <li>I like most Olay products.</li>
            <li>This one however is just OK.</li>
            <li>It needs to be more matte to blend.</li>
            <li>the color is perfect, finally!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The fair to light color is still a little too orange for me, but if I use one pump of this and one pump of an uncolored or lighter moisturizer it works great!</li>
            <li>I  have found Olay products are perfect for older skin for providing moisture that is very much needed as we age.</li>
            <li>The feel of this cream is BEAUTIFUL, its silky and soft and glides on like no ones business.  </li>
            <li>I am irish and very fair...</li>
            <li>I love the combination of light tint, moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love the light coverage and the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Beautiful light yet complete coverage.</li>
            <li>Great for those of us who like a natural look of no make-up.  </li>
            <li>Im a true addict!</li>
            <li>but when I wore it to work one day and as I perspired and blotted my face, the color would come off easily.</li>
            <li>I am blonde and relatively fair, but with freckles, and i found the Fair to Light to be perfect in the winter, and Light to Medium after I went to the Bahamas and came home with a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li>I gave it a high rating because it smells good</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a moisturizer; it is a darkly tinted sunblock at best.</li>
            <li>I like being able to quickly apply it without doing a moisturizer first, and the texture stays nice all day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that it will improve the quality of my skin and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>The tone blends well with my fair (not pale) skin.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and provides enough coverage to help your skin look smooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so natural and bright.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, it lightly corrects and evens out the skin tone</li>
            <li>At the time, it wasn&#x27;t available for purchase in the US.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would enjoy using this</li>
            <li>And I never leave home before applying this and powder – it feels light on my face and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It covers lightly</li>
            <li>I do enjoy using this product in combination with the BB cream that I have because though the Olay cream is tinted</li>
            <li>, I am glad I had a coupon when I purchased it because I do not feel that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>so this product does not cover quite as much as I like on its own.  </li>
            <li>so got the lightest shade available</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Not foundation good, but better than the average tinted moisturizer or even most of the BB creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the\\&quot;#1 cc cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I heard that oil of olay would be coming out with an accessible CC cream.  </li>
            <li>It comes in 3 shades: Fair to Light, Light to Medium, Medium to Deep.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this \\&quot;new\\&quot; CC cream from Olay</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good sunblock this is it, it is lightly tinted and has enough consistency to correct ones skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is great for those of us with dry skin that can cause foundation to make you look scaly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a good tinted moisturizer that not only does a good job of covering my blemishes and red spots, but also matches my skin tone to make it look like I&#x27;m wearing no make-up.</li>
            <li>I did not read the full ingredient list before purchasing so</li>
            <li>I loved the price at $17.50 and I loved it even more when it came with an instant coupon for another $1 off, making it almost half price.</li>
            <li>I never got lucky with uv moisturizer... cream or anything else, but this one change the way I thought about uv moisturizers.</li>
            <li>A real shame considering how good it looked before the sensitivity developed.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other tinted moisturizers but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you want a light moisturizer that can help correct your tone...ironic because that is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, fair skin, and I found this product really effective for minimal coverage.  </li>
            <li>Perfect combination of moisturizer and light tint, totally balanced to wear under any other makeup without making my face breakout or appear Lily.</li>
            <li>I am 52, fair, freckled, and with the normal amount of fine facial lines.</li>
            <li>Olay products are good, in general, but for someone with dry, flaky, but oily skin that breakouts in blackheads easily, they are to be used lightly.</li>
            <li>but it still turned bright pink in all the areas where the product had been.</li>
            <li>The redness is almost gone, and my skin&#x27;s texture is smooth now so the sheer coverage it gives makes my skin look better without looking like I have &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; on.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, it still looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own that I haven&#x27;t even used my daily moisturizer since I got this product.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cover blemishes or anything, but helps with a nice, final look while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Love my skin&#x27;s natural glow.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser, one pump dispenses just the right amount of product, so there is no waste.</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz was right on this one.</li>
            <li>It seems more like a tinted moisturizer, and since I have acne prone skin as well as discoloration from old acne, I have never been able to use only a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The color is just right, the consistency is not too heavy or light and it leaves a nice illumination without being glittery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair (Scottish skin), and I got the fair/light color, which is maybe one-ish shades slightly darker than my skin, but honestly it goes on sheer enough that I can&#x27;t see a difference once I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>I think maybe its just too warm for my skin tone, so the overall effect is very orange-y.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>I like the CC cream very much.  </li>
            <li>has a loyal new customer!  </li>
            <li>I have had a skin tone problems for most of my teenage years to adulthood.  </li>
            <li>I bought it here on Amazon from the seller Procter &amp; Gamble for exactly $12.50.  </li>
            <li>Exact.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get out much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer, so to be able to skip a step to my morning routine is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since buying this product I have put my old primer away and use this daily because it goes on so smooth and seems to keep my mineral foundation on longer throughout the day for better coverage.  </li>
            <li>It also did not have any more coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>So my first problem with this product is that it burns my face like the dickens.  </li>
            <li>I tried this CC Cream hoping that, as a tinted moisturizer with various skin friendly benefits, it would give a more natural look and hopefully fix some of my skin problems in the process.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It starts off very smooth when applying but becomes quite dry on the skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think my skin looks older, more dull, greasier, and I have even been more prone to breakouts since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it at nearly half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wipe off on my clothes during the day and is easily removed with regular cleanser at night.</li>
            <li>P.S., do yourself a favor and use the entire product line, if you have sensitive, dry skin like mine: I have seen great results in just two months of usage.</li>
            <li>My only complaint with it was that I am very fair skinned, and even the lightest version made me look a bit orange.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it seems to go away and is very mlid.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend CC Cream to anyone wanting to correct their skin tone!</li>
            <li>I feel it gives my face a greasy shine, which I really dislike.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li>It acts as my foundation (although it doesn&#x27;t conceal much).  </li>
            <li>I could stand it about 5 minutes, and then removed with some gentle makeup remover, but the damage was already done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>being that I already have oily skin to begin with that really bothers me.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but like almost all tinted products</li>
            <li>Very damaging to my skin...felt like I had a sunburn all the time.  </li>
            <li>After 2 applications, my face was severly swollen, felts like it was on fire and very itchy.</li>
            <li>There is no visible rash or anything, my skin doesn&#x27;t even really look irritated, but my skin will tingle and burn the whole day while I&#x27;m wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this for the price, but when I got it, I saw that it&#x27;s loaded with parabens - cancer-causing preservatives.</li>
            <li>This is product is an important part of my daily beauty ritual.  </li>
            <li>The article went on to say that in a few months Olay would be releasing their own version of CC cream.  </li>
            <li>#34;you look really good&amp;#34;, which to me is enough of a rave review to make this product worth it!</li>
            <li>I have, on the other hand, always loved oil of olay  beauty fluid and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and I really had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I get a huge rash on my face both times I tried (and I don&#x27;t have that sensitive of skin) but it has 0 tinting/coverage effects and balls up instead of absorbing.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a slightly tinted sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It worked decent as a cc cream</li>
            <li>However, upon using this product, Olay Total Effects 7-in-One is more like Olay Totally Burning my face off 7 ways at once.</li>
            <li>but the shade was so much darker on me than I need, was pretty orange looking on my NC20 neutral porcelain skin....love and use other excellent Olay products but this lightest shade of this won&#x27;t work for me, sadly....</li>
            <li>I wish I had reviewed the \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; more thoroughly before trying this product because apparently it has a higher than normal concentration of the chemical octocrylene which causes a lot of skin irritations.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>That being said, I didn&#x27;t want a heavy concealer since I don&#x27;t need one most of the time, and this product is a new go-to in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>(b) try to look a little more presentable without looking &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as a light, even-out base, but you&#x27;ll need a concealer to hide any real problem areas.</li>
            <li>formula is gentle as I am sensitive</li>
            <li>It really truly does even out my skin tone and make the fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I never use heavy foundation any more.</li>
            <li>but after sitting on my face for a few minutes I noticed my skin tone looked much more even.</li>
            <li>a sensitivity to this product can form over time even if it wasn&#x27;t apparent with the first use.</li>
            <li>so I could see exactly how much is being used and it dispenses every last bit of product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work for me, and I spent a pretty penny on it when it first came out (about $20).  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of using less products to achieve the same look</li>
            <li>I have never found any sort of makeup I can use comfortably on my face until now, even other tinted moisturizers or BB creams.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try a new beauty product, but I wanted something lighter (and easier) for Summer than my heavier concealer, so  </li>
            <li>Fool me twice, shame on me and my newly blotched and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>As such, finding a good foundation is hard-</li>
            <li>I would use Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Facial Sunscreen but the combination of the two products left my skin kinda tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>They are very surprised I use Olay (for years)</li>
            <li>When I picked it up, I noticed that the box was almost the exact same as the moisturizer beside it, except there was a sticker that said</li>
            <li>When I opened up the package, no where on the bottle said CC cream, but was the exact same as the moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li>Last summer I first heard of BB creams and impulse bought Loreal BB cream when I saw it on sale at a drug store.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it does not have the same texture as the BB cream I used.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it, I definitely felt like I was wearing something heavier than just a lotion.</li>
            <li>(Okay, not priceless - I&#x27;ve got college educations to save for - but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s worth the going price!)</li>
            <li>Too dark for light skin tone.</li>
            <li>so even the light BB creams were too dark...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much coverage you could get from this product since over half of the bottle is clear fluid, however i was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often available on amazon at considerably less than what I pay at Walmart.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then do not buy this.</li>
            <li>I just needed a moisturizer that could even it out and have a natural looking effect.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an eighty-year old woman who has been using this product (under it&#x27;s old name, Definity) for a number of years</li>
            <li>It gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>I use this every morning, not heavy and blends well.  </li>
            <li>Really, the only reason its getting 2 stars instead of</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say if your skin is sensitive, bypass this.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different &amp;#34;BB creams&amp;#34; and I think they provide better coverage.</li>
            <li>I ended up on Benadryl for 4 days before my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li>It covers fine lines and the starting of a few age spots.</li>
            <li>I ordered the new CC Cream from Olayl and instead was sent the Total Effects.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product caused my face to turn bright red</li>
            <li>I got this because I am a very busy human being and need multitasking products so I can be done and get on with my life.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and reacts to a lot of different moisturizers, but this did not cause my skin to react!</li>
            <li>While adding moisture to my skin without making it break out (or, and I do break out), it give a sheer coverage which is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised than an Olay product would create such a reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to other BB/CC creams it doesn&#x27;t cover as well, which is discouraging at first.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was me and my addition of other products with it, for</li>
            <li>But its got so many other hard to pronounce chemicals its hard to say for sure.  </li>
            <li>I am very pale with sensitive, freckled skin and mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have super light skin, finding coverage that isn&#x27;t too dark is very hard.</li>
            <li>Works well with Bare Minerals makeup too.</li>
            <li>It felt oily going on and after only an hour my skin felt down right greasy.  </li>
            <li>Item was not perfectly pretty, the cream in the see though container is a little mixed,but works just fine.</li>
            <li>I find it to be heavier than I expected, but when I mix it with plain moisturizer it works fine.</li>
            <li>The semi-sheer quality is important to me because heavier foundations cover my freckles and make me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li>The first few days that I used it, my husband kept saying &amp;</li>
            <li>Once I came out of the haze of having a new baby, I decided to (a) kick my skin care up a notch to deal with wrinkles, dry patches, and red blotches and</li>
            <li>I tried the Garnier BB cream and it was too thick, more like a foundation less of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the fair-light (the lightest option, I believe) and not only does it not match, but it turns my face a little orange if I use too much.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This moisturizer works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This one was best for moisturizing, and that&#x27;s why I got it.</li>
            <li> Also, the Sephora was rated &#x27;best coverage&#x27; and I was tempted to try that, but I&#x27;ve found that this Olay product is plenty of coverage for me</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I gave this 3 stars because this does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a bit torn because I want it to match my tone perfectly (which it doesn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> it still is perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect, semi-sheer, non-goopy, tinted moisturizer for about 20 years</li>
            <li> It does, however, act as a wonderful primer.  </li>
            <li> The price was the best I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for minimum make up days!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for daytime with SPF 15 too!</li>
            <li> But this approaching-40-mama-of-2-under-3 enjoys the results and THAT is priceless.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!</li>
            <li> this one is absolutely perfect...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I washed everything off my face as best</li>
            <li> my skin feels and looks better just after a week of using it!!!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very very fair skin, which is acne prone, and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look great and has the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> Wish we could get rid of those things for good!</li>
            <li> The product itself has great list of ingredients abs</li>
            <li> Delivery was just great.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, and the sunscreen doesnt irritate.</li>
            <li> Probably would be great for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great CC Cream.</li>
            <li> I really liked it for its coverage and the way it evened out my skin tone and made my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> This makes you look like you just have naturally great skin for every day use.  </li>
            <li> and it is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Its a perfect mixture of moisturizer and cover up :)</li>
            <li> If this product starts to make your face feel warm, wash it off immediately!</li>
            <li> I have used many brands in my lifetime and find Olay is the best for &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; skin,</li>
            <li> I did some research and heard that Oil of Olay CC cream was better for those with very fair skin</li>
            <li> I ordered the lightest shade which is for really fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> Good price, and does a good job for a CC cream.  </li>
            <li> I read about this in Good Housekeeping when they reviewed CC creams.</li>
            <li> Good combination of coverage plus moisturizer.</li>
            <li> To be fair though, I have used a variety of Olay products for years, so hopefully any benefits would have kicked in by now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m truly delighted with the ease of use and how evenly it covers my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good, but I wonder why Olay seems to keep changing its products.</li>
            <li> , that being said, the coverage is good.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not for people who have  very light skin at all!</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad that I purchased this cream!</li>
            <li> (like I&#x27;m applying sunscreen, just rub it on!), and my skin looks 100x more even!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin tone so much more even!</li>
            <li> The 15SPF is also great for those of us with fairer skin who easily get sunburn.</li>
            <li> Great foundation for light make up.</li>
            <li> I tried a dozen BB creams to find one I like and really loved L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic BB cream</li>
            <li> Separately I loved these products, but I wanted sunscreen protect more than the BB cream&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized, protected from the sun and evens out my skin tone nicely</li>
            <li> and I really liked them a lot</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I decided to keep the product and use it under makeup as a moisturizer since it boasts so many good benefits.  </li>
            <li> It feels kind of greasy, I didn&#x27;t like it for summer use.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is for the effective moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li> one is that I honestly could see where this product could work for someone</li>
            <li> The color works great, and the coverage is pretty good for a CC.  </li>
            <li> I love using this, it&#x27;s so smooth and spreads great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I quickly saw a postive change in my complexion (hydrated), and the moisturizer feels weightless on.  </li>
            <li> and it blends in beautifully with no weird smudges or anything.  </li>
            <li> how could a beautiful bottle of swirling lotion cause so much pain?</li>
            <li> I still put moisturizer on first and the Oil of Olay Moisturizing lotion works great with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great even-out product: I quickly and easily put it all over my face</li>
            <li> It give very light coverage which I like.  </li>
            <li> SO glad</li>
            <li> The redness around my mouth and on my chin has almost all  disappeared and many of my acne scars have begun to fade.  </li>
            <li> I generally love Olay products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently tried BB cream from another manufacturer and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love the tint, which evens out skin tone without the look and feel of foundation.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if it&#x27;s actually helping correct my tone, but it makes my skin look wonderful when it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so my skin tone is light &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; with warm undertones.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this helps!:)</li>
            <li> I think the sunscreen works ok too...</li>
            <li> and I like the combination of these better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using it for 4+ years.  </li>
            <li> But why pay more?</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews but thought I&#x27;d better write this one in case any one had the expectations I had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say that the sheer color to this lotion eliminates the need for any foundation for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently because I had been hearing about how wonderful these CC creams were.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I would try the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> Between the shiny quality and the lack of coverage, there is no way I could use just the CC cream and feel confident leaving the house.</li>
            <li> but I have literally never received so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have nearly flawless skin I could definitely see using this alone, although it can leave a bit of a shine to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for many years but products have changed.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly satisfied with delivery and accuracy.  </li>
            <li> I normally love Olay products, so when I was reading about this fantastical cc cream, I did not hesitate to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Its ok for coverage, but didn&#x27;t do anything to improve skin conditions like it claims.</li>
            <li> Olay total effect, Regenerist, and L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect night cream.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it and replaced it with a Marcelle day cream and have continued using Regenerist and Age Perfect daily without any problems.</li>
            <li> I like most Olay products.</li>
            <li> This one however is just OK.</li>
            <li> It needs to be more matte to blend.</li>
            <li> the color is perfect, finally!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> The fair to light color is still a little too orange for me, but if I use one pump of this and one pump of an uncolored or lighter moisturizer it works great!</li>
            <li> I  have found Olay products are perfect for older skin for providing moisture that is very much needed as we age.</li>
            <li> The feel of this cream is BEAUTIFUL, its silky and soft and glides on like no ones business.  </li>
            <li> I am irish and very fair...</li>
            <li> I love the combination of light tint, moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love the light coverage and the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful light yet complete coverage.</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who like a natural look of no make-up.  </li>
            <li> Im a true addict!</li>
            <li> but when I wore it to work one day and as I perspired and blotted my face, the color would come off easily.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and relatively fair, but with freckles, and i found the Fair to Light to be perfect in the winter, and Light to Medium after I went to the Bahamas and came home with a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> I gave it a high rating because it smells good</li>
            <li> My skin looks younger and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a moisturizer; it is a darkly tinted sunblock at best.</li>
            <li> I like being able to quickly apply it without doing a moisturizer first, and the texture stays nice all day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that it will improve the quality of my skin and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> The tone blends well with my fair (not pale) skin.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and provides enough coverage to help your skin look smooth.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so natural and bright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, it lightly corrects and evens out the skin tone</li>
            <li> At the time, it wasn&#x27;t available for purchase in the US.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would enjoy using this</li>
            <li> And I never leave home before applying this and powder – it feels light on my face and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It covers lightly</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using this product in combination with the BB cream that I have because though the Olay cream is tinted</li>
            <li> , I am glad I had a coupon when I purchased it because I do not feel that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> so this product does not cover quite as much as I like on its own.  </li>
            <li> so got the lightest shade available</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Not foundation good, but better than the average tinted moisturizer or even most of the BB creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the\\&quot;#1 cc cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I heard that oil of olay would be coming out with an accessible CC cream.  </li>
            <li> It comes in 3 shades: Fair to Light, Light to Medium, Medium to Deep.</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this \\&quot;new\\&quot; CC cream from Olay</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good sunblock this is it, it is lightly tinted and has enough consistency to correct ones skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is great for those of us with dry skin that can cause foundation to make you look scaly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a good tinted moisturizer that not only does a good job of covering my blemishes and red spots, but also matches my skin tone to make it look like I&#x27;m wearing no make-up.</li>
            <li> I did not read the full ingredient list before purchasing so</li>
            <li> I loved the price at $17.50 and I loved it even more when it came with an instant coupon for another $1 off, making it almost half price.</li>
            <li> I never got lucky with uv moisturizer... cream or anything else, but this one change the way I thought about uv moisturizers.</li>
            <li> A real shame considering how good it looked before the sensitivity developed.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tinted moisturizers but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you want a light moisturizer that can help correct your tone...ironic because that is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, fair skin, and I found this product really effective for minimal coverage.  </li>
            <li> Perfect combination of moisturizer and light tint, totally balanced to wear under any other makeup without making my face breakout or appear Lily.</li>
            <li> I am 52, fair, freckled, and with the normal amount of fine facial lines.</li>
            <li> Olay products are good, in general, but for someone with dry, flaky, but oily skin that breakouts in blackheads easily, they are to be used lightly.</li>
            <li> but it still turned bright pink in all the areas where the product had been.</li>
            <li> The redness is almost gone, and my skin&#x27;s texture is smooth now so the sheer coverage it gives makes my skin look better without looking like I have &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; on.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, it still looks fresh.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own that I haven&#x27;t even used my daily moisturizer since I got this product.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cover blemishes or anything, but helps with a nice, final look while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Love my skin&#x27;s natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser, one pump dispenses just the right amount of product, so there is no waste.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz was right on this one.</li>
            <li> It seems more like a tinted moisturizer, and since I have acne prone skin as well as discoloration from old acne, I have never been able to use only a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The color is just right, the consistency is not too heavy or light and it leaves a nice illumination without being glittery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair (Scottish skin), and I got the fair/light color, which is maybe one-ish shades slightly darker than my skin, but honestly it goes on sheer enough that I can&#x27;t see a difference once I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I think maybe its just too warm for my skin tone, so the overall effect is very orange-y.  </li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> I like the CC cream very much.  </li>
            <li> has a loyal new customer!  </li>
            <li> I have had a skin tone problems for most of my teenage years to adulthood.  </li>
            <li> I bought it here on Amazon from the seller Procter &amp; Gamble for exactly $12.50.  </li>
            <li> Exact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get out much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer, so to be able to skip a step to my morning routine is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since buying this product I have put my old primer away and use this daily because it goes on so smooth and seems to keep my mineral foundation on longer throughout the day for better coverage.  </li>
            <li> It also did not have any more coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> So my first problem with this product is that it burns my face like the dickens.  </li>
            <li> I tried this CC Cream hoping that, as a tinted moisturizer with various skin friendly benefits, it would give a more natural look and hopefully fix some of my skin problems in the process.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It starts off very smooth when applying but becomes quite dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think my skin looks older, more dull, greasier, and I have even been more prone to breakouts since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it at nearly half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wipe off on my clothes during the day and is easily removed with regular cleanser at night.</li>
            <li> P.S., do yourself a favor and use the entire product line, if you have sensitive, dry skin like mine: I have seen great results in just two months of usage.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with it was that I am very fair skinned, and even the lightest version made me look a bit orange.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it seems to go away and is very mlid.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend CC Cream to anyone wanting to correct their skin tone!</li>
            <li> I feel it gives my face a greasy shine, which I really dislike.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li> It acts as my foundation (although it doesn&#x27;t conceal much).  </li>
            <li> I could stand it about 5 minutes, and then removed with some gentle makeup remover, but the damage was already done.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> being that I already have oily skin to begin with that really bothers me.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but like almost all tinted products</li>
            <li> Very damaging to my skin...felt like I had a sunburn all the time.  </li>
            <li> After 2 applications, my face was severly swollen, felts like it was on fire and very itchy.</li>
            <li> There is no visible rash or anything, my skin doesn&#x27;t even really look irritated, but my skin will tingle and burn the whole day while I&#x27;m wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this for the price, but when I got it, I saw that it&#x27;s loaded with parabens - cancer-causing preservatives.</li>
            <li> This is product is an important part of my daily beauty ritual.  </li>
            <li> The article went on to say that in a few months Olay would be releasing their own version of CC cream.  </li>
            <li> #34;you look really good&amp;#34;, which to me is enough of a rave review to make this product worth it!</li>
            <li> I have, on the other hand, always loved oil of olay  beauty fluid and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and I really had high expectations.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I get a huge rash on my face both times I tried (and I don&#x27;t have that sensitive of skin) but it has 0 tinting/coverage effects and balls up instead of absorbing.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a slightly tinted sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It worked decent as a cc cream</li>
            <li> However, upon using this product, Olay Total Effects 7-in-One is more like Olay Totally Burning my face off 7 ways at once.</li>
            <li> but the shade was so much darker on me than I need, was pretty orange looking on my NC20 neutral porcelain skin....love and use other excellent Olay products but this lightest shade of this won&#x27;t work for me, sadly....</li>
            <li> I wish I had reviewed the \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; more thoroughly before trying this product because apparently it has a higher than normal concentration of the chemical octocrylene which causes a lot of skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> That being said, I didn&#x27;t want a heavy concealer since I don&#x27;t need one most of the time, and this product is a new go-to in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> (b) try to look a little more presentable without looking &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as a light, even-out base, but you&#x27;ll need a concealer to hide any real problem areas.</li>
            <li> formula is gentle as I am sensitive</li>
            <li> It really truly does even out my skin tone and make the fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I never use heavy foundation any more.</li>
            <li> but after sitting on my face for a few minutes I noticed my skin tone looked much more even.</li>
            <li> a sensitivity to this product can form over time even if it wasn&#x27;t apparent with the first use.</li>
            <li> so I could see exactly how much is being used and it dispenses every last bit of product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work for me, and I spent a pretty penny on it when it first came out (about $20).  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of using less products to achieve the same look</li>
            <li> I have never found any sort of makeup I can use comfortably on my face until now, even other tinted moisturizers or BB creams.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a new beauty product, but I wanted something lighter (and easier) for Summer than my heavier concealer, so  </li>
            <li> Fool me twice, shame on me and my newly blotched and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> As such, finding a good foundation is hard-</li>
            <li> I would use Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Facial Sunscreen but the combination of the two products left my skin kinda tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> They are very surprised I use Olay (for years)</li>
            <li> When I picked it up, I noticed that the box was almost the exact same as the moisturizer beside it, except there was a sticker that said</li>
            <li> When I opened up the package, no where on the bottle said CC cream, but was the exact same as the moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li> Last summer I first heard of BB creams and impulse bought Loreal BB cream when I saw it on sale at a drug store.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it does not have the same texture as the BB cream I used.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it, I definitely felt like I was wearing something heavier than just a lotion.</li>
            <li> (Okay, not priceless - I&#x27;ve got college educations to save for - but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s worth the going price!)</li>
            <li> Too dark for light skin tone.</li>
            <li> so even the light BB creams were too dark...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much coverage you could get from this product since over half of the bottle is clear fluid, however i was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often available on amazon at considerably less than what I pay at Walmart.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I just needed a moisturizer that could even it out and have a natural looking effect.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eighty-year old woman who has been using this product (under it&#x27;s old name, Definity) for a number of years</li>
            <li> It gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> I use this every morning, not heavy and blends well.  </li>
            <li> Really, the only reason its getting 2 stars instead of</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say if your skin is sensitive, bypass this.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different &amp;#34;BB creams&amp;#34; and I think they provide better coverage.</li>
            <li> I ended up on Benadryl for 4 days before my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> It covers fine lines and the starting of a few age spots.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new CC Cream from Olayl and instead was sent the Total Effects.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product caused my face to turn bright red</li>
            <li> I got this because I am a very busy human being and need multitasking products so I can be done and get on with my life.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and reacts to a lot of different moisturizers, but this did not cause my skin to react!</li>
            <li> While adding moisture to my skin without making it break out (or, and I do break out), it give a sheer coverage which is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised than an Olay product would create such a reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other BB/CC creams it doesn&#x27;t cover as well, which is discouraging at first.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was me and my addition of other products with it, for</li>
            <li> But its got so many other hard to pronounce chemicals its hard to say for sure.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale with sensitive, freckled skin and mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have super light skin, finding coverage that isn&#x27;t too dark is very hard.</li>
            <li> Works well with Bare Minerals makeup too.</li>
            <li> It felt oily going on and after only an hour my skin felt down right greasy.  </li>
            <li> Item was not perfectly pretty, the cream in the see though container is a little mixed,but works just fine.</li>
            <li> I find it to be heavier than I expected, but when I mix it with plain moisturizer it works fine.</li>
            <li> The semi-sheer quality is important to me because heavier foundations cover my freckles and make me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The first few days that I used it, my husband kept saying &amp;</li>
            <li> Once I came out of the haze of having a new baby, I decided to (a) kick my skin care up a notch to deal with wrinkles, dry patches, and red blotches and</li>
            <li> I tried the Garnier BB cream and it was too thick, more like a foundation less of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the fair-light (the lightest option, I believe) and not only does it not match, but it turns my face a little orange if I use too much.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of wear it needed a touchup, but I was still fairly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing it several times a week for a month or so, I had an uncomfortable burning sensation on my face that lasted into the next day even after the product was removed.</li>
            <li> Previous to these new creams I only used lotion and no foundation.  </li>
            <li> I blamed my older, plainer products I&#x27;d added to the mix and foolishly tried reapplying this cc cream a few days later (solo).</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have used other Olay products without any problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong and I feel absolutely uncomfortable with that smell.</li>
            <li> As a 70 year old woman I am careful not to use makeup products that gets down in the wrinkles and creases which only magnifies your age.  </li>
            <li> Even with a very light touch I ended up with that dreaded dirty &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I prefer Olay Total Effects 7 Daily Moisturizer for the other stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really liked the creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> As a long time user of BB cream</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction like this with any other face products and I only used a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li> only downside is that you have to be very careful drying your hands after putting it on and drying your face after washing it off, so that you don&#x27;t discolor your towels.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin, so I still need to use moisturizer under it in the winter, but I can tell a difference when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I put covergirl/olay powder over it after I&#x27;ve let it dry a bit.  </li>
            <li> my skin (which is dry skin) gets sooooo oily with this product.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I tried a product called &amp;#34;tinted moisturizer.&amp;#34;  It left my face sticky, shiny, and orange-tinted, even though the coverage was very sheer.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every single day.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a single skin reaction before.</li>
            <li> Only problem is, if you get your skin wet, you get a streak of beige going down your face.</li>
            <li> but I do have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to only use this with a little setting powder over it.</li>
            <li> You have to rub it in for a little longer than a regular moisturizer because of the tinting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s heavier than wearing nothing, obviously) and catch myself looking in the mirror to admire the effect as I tend to my little ones throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The swelling and burn started to subside a couple hours later after applying a little bit of ice to the affected areas.</li>
            <li> I think it is dangerous to sell this OTC without a HUGE warning label.</li>
            <li> This is thin and really covers nothing, almost looks splotchy when I put it on.</li>
            <li> like I had spent a day in the sun without sunscreen and the pain would not go away.</li>
            <li> Not really the products fault, as if it didn&#x27;t have color it wouldn&#x27;t be a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Visually, it blends away the redness and uneven tones.</li>
            <li> I would hate to have seen what would of happened if I had put more on or left it on longer than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I selected the lightest shade possible, as I have a pale complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pale, with red pigment.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint and just enough coverage to hide little flaws.  </li>
            <li> Second, the CC cream provides very little coverage.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Olay&#x27;s CC cream due to the price but</li>
            <li> but it looks like from some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not layer well with other moisturizers but it moisturizes so well on</li>
            <li> Usually, after wearing makeup for 8 hours, my skin starts to itch, but no such effect with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I used it there was absolutely no coverage!</li>
            <li> I have used tinted moisturizers in the past and like them but not enough that I KEPT using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s actually filling my wrinkles</li>
            <li> It did not blend into my skin (due to the titanium oxide), had a smell to it, looked chalky and was greasy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried several creams with sunscreen and never liked any.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use dark circle concealer.  </li>
            <li> After four months I have noticed some improvement in dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> option and tends to be too dark.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Does the &amp;#34;7 total effects&amp;#34; mean that this product contains something that is supposed to improve my skin?</li>
            <li> and I am having LESS break</li>
            <li> as typically we use premium brand products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super concealer or a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> well not a full cover makeup</li>
            <li> This cream goes on like a moisturizer, and stays a little sticky (like moisturizer does) for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> And I am left confused, still.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away, what a waste.</li>
            <li> They all feel heavy and make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I have used this everyday for weeks</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a few bucks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any improvements to my skin as a result.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using it everyday on my face.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I planned on wearing it everyday</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday-</li>
            <li> I recomend this Olay for every person that not happy with your own uv, cream or base.</li>
            <li> It left me wary but I figured it could have been caused by other factors, so</li>
            <li> If you are looking for anything other than minimal tone correction, DO NOT purchase this product, as that is not the intention behind it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping for a moisturizer and sunscreen which would also even out darker patches and small flaws.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in it that caused that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I hoped that with the price and with it being &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; it would match my skin and do everything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend the time it takes to return this small order</li>
            <li> However, it will probably be O.K. past that date.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Olay, this is a horrible product, especially when you take an old failure &amp; put a new label on it.</li>
            <li> Too bad that only feature doesn&#x27;t let me know the other ones the product might have had.</li>
            <li> Threw it out after the first couple of uses (and I HATE wasting product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use foundation now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using it for about a month under makeup every day, I see no positive changes in the quality of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and it is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Or does it mean that it is a product that will solve any skin issues by covering them up?</li>
            <li> This product has the nasty sunblock smell, is thick, dries fast and cakey, is way too dark!</li>
            <li> I think I am even going to order some for my sister who has always hated makeup as much as I have!</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Scent was not pleasant either.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Olay product to cause me an issue :(.</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced any burning or rash.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say it got worse.</li>
            <li> But alas, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My face continued getting hotter and hotter and became painful within minutes (at which point I washed it off) but it left me red as a tomato, like a very bad sunburn,</li>
            <li> everything tends to look bad on one of the other of the patch types on my face.</li>
            <li> I have never reacted this badly to a skin product before, and after reading the reviews I realize this is a common issue.</li>
            <li> but it was extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but Ill stick with Jane Iredale.</li>
            <li> This, unfortunately, does not do those things.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look weird when i sweat either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to try it out  to find this out</li>
            <li> it made me look like i stuck my head in a dorito bag, very unappealing.</li>
            <li> Even when I was afraid I might have over-applied it, it just seemed to melt into my skin leaving no trace of lines.</li>
            <li> My mom got me a very expensive BB cream that had a tint</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad reaction to any skin cream or makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had a really bad sunburn</li>
            <li> You never want the end result of your makeup and skin care routine to be your coworkers asking you if you were sick or dehydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was I sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this olay product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I hate the look of caked on make-up.  </li>
            <li> but I hated that it didn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad case of acne which cause scars on my  cheeks and chin.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t horrible.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I put this cream on, my skin started to hurt terribly.</li>
            <li> I am SO very disappointed with this CC cream!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Five stars.I like this very much.It makes my skin so natural and bright.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping for a moisturizer and sunscreen which would also even out darker patches and small flaws. I find it to be heavier than I expected, but when I mix it with plain moisturizer it works fine. I ordered the lightest shade which is for really fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a new beauty product, but I wanted something lighter (and easier) for Summer than my heavier concealer, so  I went for it. Boy, am I glad that I purchased this cream! I&#x27;m very fair (Scottish skin), and I got the fair/light color, which is maybe one-ish shades slightly darker than my skin, but honestly it goes on sheer enough that I can&#x27;t see a difference once I&#x27;m wearing it. It&#x27;s a great even-out product: I quickly and easily put it all over my face (like I&#x27;m applying sunscreen, just rub it on!), and my skin looks 100x more even! The first few days that I used it, my husband kept saying &amp;#34;you look really good&amp;#34;, which to me is enough of a rave review to make this product worth it! I will say that, if you have a blemish, this cream will not conceal it. It&#x27;s great as a light, even-out base, but you&#x27;ll need a concealer to hide any real problem areas. That being said, I didn&#x27;t want a heavy concealer since I don&#x27;t need one most of the time, and this product is a new go-to in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I tried a dozen BB creams to find one I like and really loved L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Magic BB cream but I hated that it didn&#x27;t have sunscreen in it. I would use Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Facial Sunscreen but the combination of the two products left my skin kinda tacky feeling. Separately I loved these products, but I wanted sunscreen protect more than the BB cream&#x27;s benefits. I tried several creams with sunscreen and never liked any. I was hesitant to try Olay&#x27;s CC cream due to the price but one a whim I sucked it up and bought it and I SO glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other BB/CC creams it doesn&#x27;t cover as well, which is discouraging at first. I kept using it though, and my skin&#x27;s appearance improved drastically. The redness is almost gone, and my skin&#x27;s texture is smooth now so the sheer coverage it gives makes my skin look better without looking like I have &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; on. I hardly ever use foundation now. I tend to only use this with a little setting powder over it.</li>
            <li> The product itself has great list of ingredients abs I was excited to try the\\&quot;#1 cc cream\\&quot; but the shade was so much darker on me than I need, was pretty orange looking on my NC20 neutral porcelain skin....love and use other excellent Olay products but this lightest shade of this won&#x27;t work for me, sadly....</li>
            <li> Item was not perfectly pretty, the cream in the see though container is a little mixed,but works just fine. Delivery was just great.</li>
            <li> I never got lucky with uv moisturizer... cream or anything else, but this one change the way I thought about uv moisturizers. My skin looks younger and beautiful. I recomend this Olay for every person that not happy with your own uv, cream or base.</li>
            <li> Good price, and does a good job for a CC cream.  Only problem is, if you get your skin wet, you get a streak of beige going down your face.</li>
            <li> only use once，bad thing</li>
            <li> This creamy moisturizer is the only one I will use.  It covers fine lines and the starting of a few age spots.</li>
            <li> I am very pale with sensitive, freckled skin and mild rosacea. This moisturizer works great! The fair to light color is still a little too orange for me, but if I use one pump of this and one pump of an uncolored or lighter moisturizer it works great! I prefer Olay Total Effects 7 Daily Moisturizer for the other stuff. I wear it daily. It has evened out my skin tone but not helped with darker freckles or the one age spot I have.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, it lightly corrects and evens out the skin tone and I wear it daily without irritation to my super-sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it seems to go away and is very mlid. I&#x27;ve tried other tinted moisturizers but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I have had a skin tone problems for most of my teenage years to adulthood.  I had a very bad case of acne which cause scars on my  cheeks and chin.  Though now I only get the occasional zit,  I have redness around my mouth and on my chin.  I tried three different brands of BB cream and none of them seemed to have any effect on the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article online about CC cream and how it was a combination of AA and BB cream.  At the time, it wasn&#x27;t available for purchase in the US.  You could buy it on eBay from sellers in China but it was extremely expensive.  The article went on to say that in a few months Olay would be releasing their own version of CC cream.  I waited patiently for it to come to my the Target in my hometown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using it for two to three months and it is AMAZING!  The redness around my mouth and on my chin has almost all  disappeared and many of my acne scars have begun to fade.  This product costs about $22.95 at my local Target.  I bought it here on Amazon from the seller Procter &amp; Gamble for exactly $12.50.  I was thrilled to find it at nearly half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay has a loyal new customer!  I would highly recommend CC Cream to anyone wanting to correct their skin tone!</li>
            <li> I got this because I am a very busy human being and need multitasking products so I can be done and get on with my life. I&#x27;m not so impressed with this product. I feel it gives my face a greasy shine, which I really dislike. And the coverage is very sheer, not enough to put up with the hassle of having cream get all over my stuff, like my phone screen and shirt collars. I thought I would enjoy using this but now I wish I had saved my money.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is gentle as I am sensitive but I have not experienced any burning or rash. And I am left confused, still. Does the &amp;#34;7 total effects&amp;#34; mean that this product contains something that is supposed to improve my skin? Or does it mean that it is a product that will solve any skin issues by covering them up?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product caused my face to turn bright red like I had a sunburn. Not sure what&#x27;s in it that caused that but it looks like from some of the other reviews I&#x27;m not the only one who had this problem.</li>
            <li> I generally love Olay products.  A few years ago, I tried a product called &amp;#34;tinted moisturizer.&amp;#34;  It left my face sticky, shiny, and orange-tinted, even though the coverage was very sheer.  I selected the lightest shade possible, as I have a pale complexion.  Threw it out after the first couple of uses (and I HATE wasting product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently tried BB cream from another manufacturer and LOVE it.  So when I saw CC cream from Olay, I wanted to give it a try.  It showed up looking suspiciously like the tinted moisturizer I had tried, even had the same swirly composition in the tube.  But the label said CC cream, so I gave it a try.  Same. Exact. Product.  Again in the trash.  Sorry Olay, this is a horrible product, especially when you take an old failure &amp; put a new label on it.</li>
            <li> I love using this, it&#x27;s so smooth and spreads great.  Don&#x27;t have to use dark circle concealer.  This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Used this product. Had a severe allergic reaction to the sunscreen in the product. If you have sensitive skin then do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4-5 different BB creams and thought I&#x27;d venture into the CC world. Not only did I get a huge rash on my face both times I tried (and I don&#x27;t have that sensitive of skin) but it has 0 tinting/coverage effects and balls up instead of absorbing. I had to throw away, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I read about this in Good Housekeeping when they reviewed CC creams. This one was best for moisturizing, and that&#x27;s why I got it. I have incredibly dry skin, so I still need to use moisturizer under it in the winter, but I can tell a difference when I use this product. Also, the Sephora was rated &#x27;best coverage&#x27; and I was tempted to try that, but I&#x27;ve found that this Olay product is plenty of coverage for me (I&#x27;m 52).</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, and the sunscreen doesnt irritate. However, it is not for people who have  very light skin at all! it made me look like i stuck my head in a dorito bag, very unappealing.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for everyday use. It starts off very smooth when applying but becomes quite dry on the skin. This is the second oil of olay makeup I&#x27;ve used and both were drying but I do have very dry skin. Probably would be great for someone with oily skin. I have, on the other hand, always loved oil of olay  beauty fluid and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love the tint, which evens out skin tone without the look and feel of foundation. It&#x27;s often available on amazon at considerably less than what I pay at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love the combination of light tint, moisturizer and sunscreen. I never use heavy foundation any more. And I never leave home before applying this and powder – it feels light on my face and lasts all day. Olay can&#x27;t take all the credit (I lucked out in the gene department); but I&#x27;m in my 50s and can pass for 15-20 years younger, and I&#x27;ve been using Olay products since I was about 25.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever found.  Dr. Oz was right on this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay CC Cream ever since I heard about it on Dr. Oz.  It give very light coverage which I like.  I do not even use any powder with it.  By the end of the day, it still looks fresh.  As a 70 year old woman I am careful not to use makeup products that gets down in the wrinkles and creases which only magnifies your age.  Olay CC Cream fills that bill.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long long time.  I have never found any sort of makeup I can use comfortably on my face until now, even other tinted moisturizers or BB creams.  They all feel heavy and make me break out.  I have used this everyday for weeks and I am having LESS break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not layer well with other moisturizers but it moisturizes so well on it&#x27;s own that I haven&#x27;t even used my daily moisturizer since I got this product.  It is too soon to tell if it&#x27;s actually helping correct my tone, but it makes my skin look wonderful when it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.  I think I am even going to order some for my sister who has always hated makeup as much as I have!</li>
            <li> Good combination of coverage plus moisturizer. Works well with Bare Minerals makeup too. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is thin and really covers nothing, almost looks splotchy when I put it on. I was trying to save a few bucks but Ill stick with Jane Iredale. You get what you pay for on this one.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad reaction to any skin cream or makeup on my face. This product immediately made my face burn and tingle. After I washed it off, over an hour later my skin was red and blotchy. Also, I bought the fair/light color and it was a bit too orangey. It&#x27;s too bad because I really liked the creamy consistency.Not sure what exactly is in it that my skin didn&#x27;t like....</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t horrible.  It worked decent as a cc cream but uhg  i smelled like i was going to the beach all the time.  It also was a bit greasy not a product i would ever use again.</li>
            <li> I had a severe reaction to this product. It felt like it burned my skin and when I washed it off it looked like I had a severe sunburn. I do not have sensitive skin and have used other Olay products without any problems. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have the dreaded &#x27;combination skin&#x27; type, oily in some patches and dry/flaky in others. As such, finding a good foundation is hard- everything tends to look bad on one of the other of the patch types on my face. I tried this CC Cream hoping that, as a tinted moisturizer with various skin friendly benefits, it would give a more natural look and hopefully fix some of my skin problems in the process.&lt;br /&gt;My initial application seemed to do nothing- but after sitting on my face for a few minutes I noticed my skin tone looked much more even. After a few hours of wear it needed a touchup, but I was still fairly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing it several times a week for a month or so, I had an uncomfortable burning sensation on my face that lasted into the next day even after the product was removed. It left me wary but I figured it could have been caused by other factors, so I gave it another go a couple weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say it got worse. You never want the end result of your makeup and skin care routine to be your coworkers asking you if you were sick or dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;So it looks like for some skin types, a sensitivity to this product can form over time even if it wasn&#x27;t apparent with the first use. A real shame considering how good it looked before the sensitivity developed.</li>
            <li> I have super light skin, finding coverage that isn&#x27;t too dark is very hard. I&#x27;m going to keep ordering this product over and over again. It makes my skin look great and has the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a good tinted moisturizer that not only does a good job of covering my blemishes and red spots, but also matches my skin tone to make it look like I&#x27;m wearing no make-up. This, unfortunately, does not do those things. Okay, so my skin tone is light &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; with warm undertones. I ordered the fair-light (the lightest option, I believe) and not only does it not match, but it turns my face a little orange if I use too much. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I hoped that with the price and with it being &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; it would match my skin and do everything I hoped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave this 3 stars because this does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin. My skin is very sensitive and reacts to a lot of different moisturizers, but this did not cause my skin to react! Usually, after wearing makeup for 8 hours, my skin starts to itch, but no such effect with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m a bit torn because I want it to match my tone perfectly (which it doesn&#x27;t) but it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to react. I would say if you don&#x27;t have issues with finding the correct shade for your skin, go and order it! But, if you have problems with finding that &amp;#34;perfect product&amp;#34; that matches your tone, don&#x27;t order it. Hopefully this helps!:)</li>
            <li> I use this product every single day.  It acts as my foundation (although it doesn&#x27;t conceal much).  I put covergirl/olay powder over it after I&#x27;ve let it dry a bit.  The tone blends well with my fair (not pale) skin.  I think the sunscreen works ok too...I don&#x27;t get out much!</li>
            <li> This is the second Olay product to cause me an issue :(. I have never had a single skin reaction before. As soon as I put this cream on, my skin started to hurt terribly. I could stand it about 5 minutes, and then removed with some gentle makeup remover, but the damage was already done. My face was red and swollen like I had spent a day in the sun without sunscreen and the pain would not go away. I think it is dangerous to sell this OTC without a HUGE warning label. This definitely is not something everyone can or should use. Ouch!</li>
            <li> This is a great CC Cream. I don&#x27;t use makeup and with the tint in this cream it&#x27;s perfect for me. I use the SKIN79 Diamond Prestige BB Cream under the Olay CC Cream. My mom got me a very expensive BB cream that had a tint and I like the combination of these better. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The color works great, and the coverage is pretty good for a CC.  I like being able to quickly apply it without doing a moisturizer first, and the texture stays nice all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months. It is easy to use, goes on smoothly. I love the dispenser, one pump dispenses just the right amount of product, so there is no waste. It also is see-thru so I could see exactly how much is being used and it dispenses every last bit of product. After four months I have noticed some improvement in dark spots and wrinkles. I love the light coverage and the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new CC Cream from Olayl and instead was sent the Total Effects. I don&#x27;t want to spend the time it takes to return this small order but I&#x27;m very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a slightly tinted sunscreen.  i can&#x27;t wear this around my husband though, he says it makes me smell like I have been smoking, yuck!  To me, it just smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good sunblock this is it, it is lightly tinted and has enough consistency to correct ones skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using it for 4+ years.  While adding moisture to my skin without making it break out (or, and I do break out), it give a sheer coverage which is very natural looking.  I get compliments on my skin (and for me it is an accomplishment) and my girlfriend ask me what I use.  They are very surprised I use Olay (for years) as typically we use premium brand products.  But why pay more?</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is the best! Beautiful light yet complete coverage. It melts into my skin. Doesn&#x27;t look weird when i sweat either. Im a true addict!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non-greasy, and it has SPF. Great foundation for light make up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it! my skin (which is dry skin) gets sooooo oily with this product. Did not like it.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect mixture of moisturizer and cover up :) I love it! I have gone through 3 bottles already</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if I could. I am extremely pale, with red pigment. I just needed a moisturizer that could even it out and have a natural looking effect. Was I sorely disappointed. This product has the nasty sunblock smell, is thick, dries fast and cakey, is way too dark! I could not be more disappointed. This is NOT a moisturizer; it is a darkly tinted sunblock at best. Do not buy this if you want a light moisturizer that can help correct your tone...ironic because that is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I am SO very disappointed with this CC cream! As a long time user of BB cream I was so excited when I heard that oil of olay would be coming out with an accessible CC cream.  When I picked it up, I noticed that the box was almost the exact same as the moisturizer beside it, except there was a sticker that said \\&quot;CC Cream\\&quot; on the box.  When I opened up the package, no where on the bottle said CC cream, but was the exact same as the moisturizer!!  When I used it there was absolutely no coverage! At ALL!  It was 21.99 where I purchased it and I really had high expectations.  I couldn&#x27;t return it because I bought it on vacation in the USA and I&#x27;m from Canada.  I am so disappointed and I feel like I&#x27;ve been tricked!  I will never ever buy a product from Olay after this.  I never ever write reviews but thought I&#x27;d better write this one in case any one had the expectations I had.  Personally, my skin burned after I used it as well and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say that the sheer color to this lotion eliminates the need for any foundation for me. I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer, so to be able to skip a step to my morning routine is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any improvements to my skin as a result. To be fair though, I have used a variety of Olay products for years, so hopefully any benefits would have kicked in by now.</li>
            <li> Be advised, that I am a man using this product, so I may be looking for different results then some women. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now, mostly daily and I do like it. It keeps my skin moisturized, protected from the sun and evens out my skin tone nicely (I have some discoloration from acne when I was younger). You have to rub it in for a little longer than a regular moisturizer because of the tinting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you have to be very careful drying your hands after putting it on and drying your face after washing it off, so that you don&#x27;t discolor your towels. Not really the products fault, as if it didn&#x27;t have color it wouldn&#x27;t be a tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;m guessing that for women already taking off make-up anyway, this is a non-issue but for guys it&#x27;s something to consider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eighty-year old woman who has been using this product (under it&#x27;s old name, Definity) for a number of years and I&#x27;m truly delighted with the ease of use and how evenly it covers my face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much coverage you could get from this product since over half of the bottle is clear fluid, however i was happily surprised.  It does a great job and provides enough coverage to help your skin look smooth.  It won&#x27;t cover blemishes or anything, but helps with a nice, final look while moisturizing.  I still use concealer and foundation when necessary, but like the added benefit of this cream.</li>
            <li> I like the CC cream very much.  It covers lightly so I don&#x27;t have a mask look.  It gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product alot. I found the coverage to be of my liking. It blends well, well not a full cover makeup it still is perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product, for me, needs to be thicker. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as much as I would like. I prefer the Garnier BB cream but it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fair to light&amp;#34; option and tends to be too dark. I do like that this one has SPF and Vitamin C, so I will continue using it when I need extra coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Olay product I&#x27;ve tried (the 1st was an anti-wrinkle) and they both smelled like cigarrettes. It&#x27;s too strong and I feel absolutely uncomfortable with that smell. I put on my leg to try it on and the smell got me stinking in a way I had to take a shower. I can&#x27;t imagine using it everyday on my face. Too bad that only feature doesn&#x27;t let me know the other ones the product might have had.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, fair skin, and I found this product really effective for minimal coverage.  If you are looking for anything other than minimal tone correction, DO NOT purchase this product, as that is not the intention behind it.  It is great for those of us with dry skin that can cause foundation to make you look scaly.  P.S., do yourself a favor and use the entire product line, if you have sensitive, dry skin like mine: I have seen great results in just two months of usage.</li>
            <li> This product contains niacinamide and caused a reaction in me. I did not read the full ingredient list before purchasing so BE WARE if you react to niacin you will react to this product. If you don&#x27;t know what a niacin reaction is, &amp;#34;flames of hell&amp;#34; is the only thing that describes it. If this product starts to make your face feel warm, wash it off immediately! I did not wash it off immediately, thinking perhaps the warming was an effect of some anti-aging ingredient. My face continued getting hotter and hotter and became painful within minutes (at which point I washed it off) but it left me red as a tomato, like a very bad sunburn,</li>
            <li> My face was burning after the third time I tried to wear it. I have extremely sensitive skin. It has a sunscreen, which I don&#x27;t know how necessary that was.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently because I had been hearing about how wonderful these CC creams were.  I had tried the BB creams and I really liked them a lot so I figured I would try the next best thing.  I do not think I would buy this product again because it will make my face appear oily after I have applied it and being that I already have oily skin to begin with that really bothers me.  I do enjoy using this product in combination with the BB cream that I have because though the Olay cream is tinted it does not give a lot of coverage and in combination with my BB cream I do not have to add any additional products.  Overall I like it, I am glad I had a coupon when I purchased it because I do not feel that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of moisturizer and light tint, totally balanced to wear under any other makeup without making my face breakout or appear Lily.</li>
            <li> Last summer I first heard of BB creams and impulse bought Loreal BB cream when I saw it on sale at a drug store.  I really liked it for its coverage and the way it evened out my skin tone and made my skin look flawless. My only complaint with it was that I am very fair skinned, and even the lightest version made me look a bit orange.  I did some research and heard that Oil of Olay CC cream was better for those with very fair skin so I purchased it at Target.  I am very disappointed in the product.  First of all, it does not have the same texture as the BB cream I used. The BB cream had a sand paper-like texture and seemed to just blend into my skin leaving a matte finish.  This CC cream has the same texture as moisturizer, and leaves me shiny and greasy looking after using it. Second, the CC cream provides very little coverage. It seems more like a tinted moisturizer, and since I have acne prone skin as well as discoloration from old acne, I have never been able to use only a tinted moisturizer. Between the shiny quality and the lack of coverage, there is no way I could use just the CC cream and feel confident leaving the house. Nevertheless, I decided to keep the product and use it under makeup as a moisturizer since it boasts so many good benefits.  Unfortunately, after using it for about a month under makeup every day, I see no positive changes in the quality of my skin.  In fact, I think my skin looks older, more dull, greasier, and I have even been more prone to breakouts since I started using this product.  Maybe this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I think I will give what I have left over to my mom, and see if she has better luck, since it was so expensive.  For reference, I have very very fair skin, which is acne prone, and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but like almost all tinted products it&#x27;s just too dark for me. Even with a very light touch I ended up with that dreaded dirty &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; look.Unfortunately, I had to try it out  to find this out so now I have a product I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of using less products to achieve the same look but I did not like how it felt on my skin or how it did not blend in.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect, semi-sheer, non-goopy, tinted moisturizer for about 20 years and I&#x27;ve finally found it in Olay&#x27;s CC cream. I know it sounds like an advertisement but I have literally never received so many compliments on my skin. I am 52, fair, freckled, and with the normal amount of fine facial lines. The semi-sheer quality is important to me because heavier foundations cover my freckles and make me look ridiculous. This cream goes on like a moisturizer, and stays a little sticky (like moisturizer does) for about 15-20 minutes. After that, there is zero transfer to my cell phone - a pet peeve. It immediately blends into, and dare I say it, luminizes my skin. It really truly does even out my skin tone and make the fine lines less noticeable. The fact that it has sunscreen is just a bonus. It comes in 3 shades: Fair to Light, Light to Medium, Medium to Deep. I am blonde and relatively fair, but with freckles, and i found the Fair to Light to be perfect in the winter, and Light to Medium after I went to the Bahamas and came home with a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea so this product does not cover quite as much as I like on its own.  It does, however, act as a wonderful primer.  Since buying this product I have put my old primer away and use this daily because it goes on so smooth and seems to keep my mineral foundation on longer throughout the day for better coverage.  I have pretty light skin so got the lightest shade available and it blends in beautifully with no weird smudges or anything.  If you have nearly flawless skin I could definitely see using this alone, although it can leave a bit of a shine to it.</li>
            <li> Very damaging to my skin...felt like I had a sunburn all the time.  I&#x27;ve used Olay for many years but products have changed.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly satisfied with delivery and accuracy.  I did notice that the sell by date was for only two months away, and I had bought four items.  However, it will probably be O.K. past that date.  The price was the best I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for five years after receiving a sample in th mail. I  have found Olay products are perfect for older skin for providing moisture that is very much needed as we age. I have used many brands in my lifetime and find Olay is the best for &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; skin,</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products and beauty balms and prefer this.  The color is just right, the consistency is not too heavy or light and it leaves a nice illumination without being glittery.  It is not greasy or cause breakouts and does not settle into creases like some heavier products.  I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I normally love Olay products, so when I was reading about this fantastical cc cream, I did not hesitate to purchase it. However, upon using this product, Olay Total Effects 7-in-One is more like Olay Totally Burning my face off 7 ways at once. At first I thought it was me and my addition of other products with it, for how could a beautiful bottle of swirling lotion cause so much pain? I blamed my older, plainer products I&#x27;d added to the mix and foolishly tried reapplying this cc cream a few days later (solo). Fool me twice, shame on me and my newly blotched and itchy skin. I have never reacted this badly to a skin product before, and after reading the reviews I realize this is a common issue.</li>
            <li> Its ok for coverage, but didn&#x27;t do anything to improve skin conditions like it claims. It feels kind of greasy, I didn&#x27;t like it for summer use.</li>
            <li> No coverage what-so-ever. It is watery and oily feeling. I had high hopes for this product and it is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for minimum make up days!  It has a slight tint and just enough coverage to hide little flaws.  I&#x27;ve always been faithful to my Olay products and this is no exception.  Perfect for daytime with SPF 15 too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply too oily for my face.  Olay products are good, in general, but for someone with dry, flaky, but oily skin that breakouts in blackheads easily, they are to be used lightly.</li>
            <li> I had never had an allergic reaction to cosmetics in my life. After 2 applications, my face was severly swollen, felts like it was on fire and very itchy. I ended up on Benadryl for 4 days before my skin went back to normal. I had purchase 3 products: Olay total effect, Regenerist, and L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect night cream. I was very surprised than an Olay product would create such a reaction. I have stopped using it and replaced it with a Marcelle day cream and have continued using Regenerist and Age Perfect daily without any problems.</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who like a natural look of no make-up.  It moisturizes and gives you a smoother skin tone.  I hate the look of caked on make-up.  This makes you look like you just have naturally great skin for every day use.  I still put moisturizer on first and the Oil of Olay Moisturizing lotion works great with it.  The 15SPF is also great for those of us with fairer skin who easily get sunburn.</li>
            <li> As the mother of a toddler and and infant, my facial care and beauty routine is B-A-S-I-C. I have never been one to wear foundation on a regular basis. I have used tinted moisturizers in the past and like them but not enough that I KEPT using them. Once I came out of the haze of having a new baby, I decided to (a) kick my skin care up a notch to deal with wrinkles, dry patches, and red blotches and (b) try to look a little more presentable without looking &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34; I tried the Olay CC Cream and I&#x27;m a believer - my (a) and (b) are fulfilled!  The lotion goes on smooth and even. Even when I was afraid I might have over-applied it, it just seemed to melt into my skin leaving no trace of lines. The first couple of times I used it, I definitely felt like I was wearing something heavier than just a lotion. Visually, it blends away the redness and uneven tones. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s actually filling my wrinkles but it definitely gives my face a smoother appearance while I&#x27;m wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t wipe off on my clothes during the day and is easily removed with regular cleanser at night. I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the weight of it on my skin now (it&#x27;s not heavy but it&#x27;s heavier than wearing nothing, obviously) and catch myself looking in the mirror to admire the effect as I tend to my little ones throughout the day. It&#x27;s not a super concealer or a miracle cream. But this approaching-40-mama-of-2-under-3 enjoys the results and THAT is priceless. (Okay, not priceless - I&#x27;ve got college educations to save for - but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s worth the going price!)</li>
            <li> I have used a few different &amp;#34;BB creams&amp;#34; and I think they provide better coverage. I gave it a high rating because it smells good and I&#x27;m hoping that it will improve the quality of my skin and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> I tried the Garnier BB cream and it was too thick, more like a foundation less of a moisturizer.  I read about the CC cream through beauty websites and thought I would give it a try.  This stuff is great, I quickly saw a postive change in my complexion (hydrated), and the moisturizer feels weightless on.  Previous to these new creams I only used lotion and no foundation.  I think I&#x27;ll be changing my routine-  Youth Code at night and CC cream in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like most Olay products. This one however is just OK. I planned on wearing it everyday but when I wore it to work one day and as I perspired and blotted my face, the color would come off easily. It did not seem to correct my skin tone as I thought it would. The 3 stars is for the effective moisturizing benefit. I will not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this olay product.  It felt oily going on and after only an hour my skin felt down right greasy.  Seemed orangy in color, too.  Scent was not pleasant either.  I will never purchase again and could not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Makes my skin tone so much more even! I wear it everyday- don&#x27;t need any makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Too dark for light skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after hearing about how \\&quot;CC\\&quot; creams are supposed to be the bomb. Yup, it was a bomb. It did not blend into my skin (due to the titanium oxide), had a smell to it, looked chalky and was greasy and shiny. It needs to be more matte to blend. It also did not have any more coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t care for this on my skin. It ended up being thrown out after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I believe I heard of this product on The Talk as well ad in an issue of Allure. Ulta had it on sale for $19 I had a $3.50 Store coupon plus a $2 Manufacturer coupon! What a great deal! So why not give it a try!? So far so good! Love my skin&#x27;s natural glow. It brings out and the even skin tone. Next time I may go a shade darker, but after my skin continues to change I may not. A question for Olay is, was this item always a CC Cream??</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is $30 in store, everywhere I have found it. I loved the price at $17.50 and I loved it even more when it came with an instant coupon for another $1 off, making it almost half price. I could not say no to that! Item arrived as described, packaging all intact and I got exactly what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering ditching makeup and just using tinted moisturizer. This stuff feels so good, but I wonder why Olay seems to keep changing its products. Maybe they just rename them.</li>
            <li> the color is perfect, finally!  I am irish and very fair... so even the light BB creams were too dark... this one is absolutely perfect... my skin feels and looks better just after a week of using it!!! thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning, not heavy and blends well.  I sometimes will mix this with my serum for added benefit.</li>
            <li> So my first problem with this product is that it burns my face like the dickens.  Seriously.  Probably the ascorbic or citric acid in the formula.  But its got so many other hard to pronounce chemicals its hard to say for sure.  There is no visible rash or anything, my skin doesn&#x27;t even really look irritated, but my skin will tingle and burn the whole day while I&#x27;m wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that being said, the coverage is good.  Not foundation good, but better than the average tinted moisturizer or even most of the BB creams I have tried.  But, the color is.. off.  I think maybe its just too warm for my skin tone, so the overall effect is very orange-y.  The feel of this cream is BEAUTIFUL, its silky and soft and glides on like no ones business.  I really wanted this product to work for me, and I spent a pretty penny on it when it first came out (about $20).  But alas, it didn&#x27;t.  Really, the only reason its getting 2 stars instead of one is that I honestly could see where this product could work for someone, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say if your skin is sensitive, bypass this.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this for the price, but when I got it, I saw that it&#x27;s loaded with parabens - cancer-causing preservatives. Wish we could get rid of those things for good!</li>
            <li> This is product is an important part of my daily beauty ritual.  It definitely evens my skin tone. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this \\&quot;new\\&quot; CC cream from Olay and I put it on as soon as I received it. Within 10 minutes of applying this product my face started to heat up. It felt like it was burning from the inside out. I left it on for another 10 minutes before I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I washed everything off my face as best I could but it still turned bright pink in all the areas where the product had been. I looked like I had a really bad sunburn and it hurt like one too. The swelling and burn started to subside a couple hours later after applying a little bit of ice to the affected areas. I wish I had reviewed the \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot; more thoroughly before trying this product because apparently it has a higher than normal concentration of the chemical octocrylene which causes a lot of skin irritations. I have never had a reaction like this with any other face products and I only used a pea-sized amount. I would hate to have seen what would of happened if I had put more on or left it on longer than 20 minutes.  If I could give this product zero stars I would.</li>
