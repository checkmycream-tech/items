            <li>I brought this cologne and I love how it smells&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more do you want from a cologne?</li>
            <li>Very strong though just spray and wiff and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously personal preference, but I really enjoy this scent and find it very attractive.</li>
            <li>For such a name as \\&quot;Ferrari\\&quot; you would think a very good product as the name screams of quality and luxury.</li>
            <li>its own much good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably order again in the future</li>
            <li>/&gt;.I am very picky but it honestly has an alluring scent to it..</li>

            <li>This thing smells good &amp; stays on you until you shower, I don&#x27;t use no other cologne but this one, and it&#x27;s $25</li>
            <li>Quality product unaltered sealed packaging, and unchanged in its original box.</li>
            <li>It just smells clean, musky and exotically spicy.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to find something special for my husband for Xmas.</li>
            <li>The Ferrari Red Perfume is really good perfume for men.</li>
            <li>but as far as i know it smells nice</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and delivery of same</li>
            <li>Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li>Nice and different than my others.</li>

            <li>I received a sample in the mail and fell in love instantly.  </li>
            <li>First time bought this in Italy 13 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a sensational scent for any male or female!</li>
            <li>and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often, as it is really musty, but it works for going out when I am not trying to pick up on girls.</li>
            <li>Ferrari black is better.</li>
            <li>We both love the scent, both for everyday use and for nicer occasions.</li>
            <li>However, I always bought it locally, and this was the first time I bought this online.</li>
            <li>A little strong.</li>
            <li>He was surprised I found it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a nauseatingly strong smell, which can be hard to find.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely nasty.  </li>

            <li> very good product, i didnt have problem, is importar producto for de people. is complement for me in my life</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was impressed with Jaguar Prestige and thought I would give this a whirl. For such a name as \\&quot;Ferrari\\&quot; you would think a very good product as the name screams of quality and luxury. My expectations were let down, and let down in a big way.     The scent is very strong, so one spray will smell up a room. It makes you nauseated after a few minutes. If you are \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; then this stuff will KILL you so heed my warning. I will use the rest to spray my cat box between cleanings since it is a slight improvement of that, albeit not much.</li>
            <li> Product was as described.  Good price point.  I like the smell, don&#x27;t know if you will.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ferrari for Men for over 5 years now--and I&#x27;m a female.  I received a sample in the mail and fell in love instantly.  It&#x27;s not necessarily a male or female scent.  It just smells clean, musky and exotically spicy.  It&#x27;s not a nauseatingly strong smell, which can be hard to find.  I&#x27;ve actually had people stop me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  They&#x27;re usually shocked when they find that it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s fragrance!  It&#x27;s really a sensational scent for any male or female!</li>
            <li> My fiance likes it I wasnt sure if he wanted the red or black one so I got him both.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, refreshing and doesn&#x27;t wear off. Been using it for a couple of years now, and this is an awesome basic cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the sent! Nice and different than my others. I like to change up what i put on. This is a nice change of sent.</li>
            <li> good price and good fragance</li>
            <li> Quality product unaltered sealed packaging, and unchanged in its original box. Maintains scent for over 12 hours and the spray does not stain any clothing. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the Ferrari brand is behind this cologne.  It&#x27;s absolutely nasty.  I sprayed one pump in the bathroom and it was such a strong and BAD stink we had to close the door and turn the fan on immediately.  There&#x27;s a reason why this garbage is 30 bucks - 99% of the money covers the licencing fees; the remaining 1% covers the R&amp;D costs and materials for this stink water.  Oh man, this stuff is bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my step son to go with the Ferrari watch my husband bought him.  It smells great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I love it! I use it all the time, no matter where i am going, or who is going to be with me!</li>
            <li> Very good product, I loved it, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase or store or buy it again in this way. Excellent.</li>
            <li> smells great and good price</li>
            <li> Everybody that noticed it told me how nice I smelled &amp; I like it myself. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne and I love how it smells&lt;br /&gt;.I am very picky but it honestly has an alluring scent to it..It makes me just want to lay right under my boyfriend when he wears it.</li>
            <li> First time bought this in Italy 13 yrs ago. Wanted to find something special for my husband for Xmas. He was surprised I found it. He smells so good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and delivery of same</li>
            <li> Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice, not too strong. However you dont feel it after sometime. Ferrari black is better.</li>
            <li> Smell good while wearing a Puma outfit. If you own a Ferrari then you probably already own this product. Great looking box.</li>
            <li> This item really does smell wonderful.  It is a great size as well. Very strong though just spray and wiff and you will be fine. It lasts.</li>
            <li> It is ok, and the price is right.  I don&#x27;t use it often, as it is really musty, but it works for going out when I am not trying to pick up on girls.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my fiance to replace one he lost. We both love the scent, both for everyday use and for nicer occasions. It&#x27;s obviously personal preference, but I really enjoy this scent and find it very attractive.</li>
            <li> It smells good. A little strong. Where ever you go it will be noted. A few of my friends feel nauseated after using it, but its not an issue with me. It wont recommend recurrent purchases of this scent but it should be purchased once.</li>
            <li> The Ferrari Red Perfume is really good perfume for men. This is the fragrance that I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dad for christmas since he doesnt have any and is into ferrari...  i guess that was a rather stupid idea in the first place considering he wears his torn khaki pants and \\&quot;Rose Bowl\\&quot; sweater everywhere..  but as far as i know it smells nice, i like the cologne, he just likes the box it came in.</li>
            <li> Perfume is one of the best, the delivery was timely I recommend this product with my eyes closed, so we give you five stars.</li>
            <li> Too good fragrance. Have not tried Ferrari&#x27;s other products so cant compare.&lt;br /&gt;On its own much good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably order again in the future</li>
            <li> Beware, it is not for branded watches</li>
            <li> I paid $63 at a mall in Illinois (Gurnee Mills). I like Ferrari cars a lot so I said what the neck, lets give this cologne a try. This thing smells good &amp; stays on you until you shower, I don&#x27;t use no other cologne but this one, and it&#x27;s $25+ on here I put it on my wishlist because the one I have is almost done.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years now. However, I always bought it locally, and this was the first time I bought this online. Can&#x27;t believe the price I paid online was about half of what I used to pay in-store!</li>
            <li> Good product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> What more do you want from a cologne? My husband loves it and I enjoy smelling it on him. A win-win.</li>
            <li> muy bueno, entrega rapida y sin problemas. El producto es uno de los mejores que existen! no hay comparación con ninguno</li>
