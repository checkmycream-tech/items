            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>Amazing clippers!</li>
            <li>The most awesome clippers I have ever owned,</li>
            <li>One of its best features is the sound it makes---hardly any!  </li>
            <li>The guards are a perfect fit for the clippers.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good trimmer, but a cordless one.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted with this electric clipper.</li>
            <li>Cuts so smooth, and holds a great charge!!!</li>
            <li>Oh, one more good point, it comes with a stand for recharging, and this is very handy.  </li>
            <li>It has a powerful lithium powered motor and an excellent adjustable blade.</li>
            <li>I own a salon and this is the BEST full size trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>Putting some kind of grippy cover on it would be a good idea.</li>
            <li>These are great clippers, I have been doing hair for 12 years and so far the best ones I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing gift for my nephew.</li>
            <li>It does not matter what kind of cut you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;ll get it.</li>
            <li>The plastic combs that slide over the blade are nice for a longer clip.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by a friend who also grooms her own dogs.  </li>
            <li>It fits very nicely in my hand and is incredibly light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that stylish, but as the hairline recedes, I don&#x27;t worry a great deal about &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; and certainly enjoy the $20 - $40 savings with each haircut.</li>
            <li>It works relatively well, probably the best of all cordless clippers that I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s still not as good as a corded one.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more for anybody who takes care of their own hair trimmings.</li>
            <li>As a hair professional, these are the best clippers I have purchased in 16 years !</li>
            <li>Very well made-cuts great, nice and even.</li>
            <li>Great first shaver on my journey into beard cultivation.</li>
            <li>It is made in Germany and runs very smooth</li>
            <li>These are top notch.</li>
            <li>The blade is top notch.</li>
            <li>am so glad I bought this cordless clipper in the end over the Osterizer Juice.</li>
            <li>Outlasted many that preceded it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous trimmers and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love cordless clippers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this model (</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it&#x27;s lithium Ion</li>
            <li>I feel like it could have been more convenient, maybe?</li>
            <li>very happy with the decision - ergonomically shaped, battery seems to last forever between use.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The end result just looks better.</li>
            <li>I am actually pleased and surprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quieter a trimmer, the better dogs tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>That may not seem like a nuisance, but when I&#x27;m grooming, the quicker I&#x27;m done, the better for both the dog and I.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>He was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>This are great clippers I really recommend this to anybody</li>
            <li>second and most important feature is it&#x27;s performance which is excellent.  </li>
            <li>The new lithium model is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a similar Wahl product and was equally happy with it, but after using it for many years, on many dogs, I wore it out, :)  </li>
            <li>These are easily the lightest, most powerful clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time researching to find the best clipper I could.</li>
            <li>but it really saves a good 10-15 mins each time</li>
            <li>, very nice lady took my address and sent out a new blade (with the plastic) free of charge - the item was at my doorstep (in Hawaii) within a week.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and lightweight .</li>
            <li>After having Norelco and Panasonic pro models this is hands down the best trimmer out there.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine product both engineered and assembled in Germany --</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>It is Made in Germany and the charger it comes with works on international voltage 110V-220V 50/60Hz (stamped on the charger), which is great; you&#x27;d just need a plug adaptor.</li>
            <li>I have owned several high end cordless hair trimmers over the years and this product ranks with the best.</li>
            <li>I use air spray (like for electronics) to clean out the horse hair every 15 minutes or so, so it will keep going.</li>
            <li>These are probably great clippers for the not so busy stylist but not for high volume haircut stores</li>
            <li>The surface looks great, but it makes it somewhat harder to grip.  </li>
            <li>After 3 hair cuts, battery life still shows a full charge.</li>
            <li>It holds its charge for 2 hours and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used these clippers several times and love them!</li>
            <li>The only negatives are the high price and the guards could be slightly more rounded on the edges to make it more comfortable when using.</li>
            <li>Powerful and work well.</li>
            <li>Honestly, can&#x27;t think of any; true test is to see how long it lasts  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and these make it a breeze with no cord, being lightweight and low vibration.</li>
            <li>It has a looooong lasting Lithium Ion batter and cuts nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li>but this one proves you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Light weight, quiet, easy to change the guards.</li>
            <li>Quiet, light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Super cool styling and very quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper is quiet, easy to clean, and oil.</li>
            <li>As the saying goes &#x27;only rich people can afford themselves to buy cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it goes thru my hair like a hot knife thru butter.</li>
            <li>Silent &amp; Used by professionals!&lt;br /&gt;Better then most of the brands that i already used like philips or braun.</li>
            <li>German engineering on this model is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first pair as a groomer</li>
            <li>Then I read a bit the manual and realized the top needs to be opened and oiled regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a few trimmers and this one is by far the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Confident I won&#x27;t need to replace them for a long time</li>
            <li>When I have to put it down in order to use another grooming tool, it remains upright in its charger, handy to grab and continues to charge itself...</li>
            <li>The portability and light weight while very robust construction is also a major improvement.</li>
            <li>Wala, the oil kicked it back to its full might and smoothness!</li>
            <li>I figure this Wahl will pay for itself in less than a year, while I have the opportunity to use a well-designed and effective tool.</li>
            <li>With the trimmer set to 1/2&amp;#34; or so, I set a mirror I can see from our shower stall and can get a pretty decent haircut while all the hair drops on the shower floor.</li>
            <li>The motor hums along powerfully, smoothly and quietly.</li>
            <li>Fast recharge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the animal clipper sold which appears to be identical.</li>
            <li>Anything that saves time and motion is appreciated.</li>
            <li>Besides, the lithium battery lasts much, much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the last dozen years, resolving that once the spot on the back of my head was exposed, I didn&#x27;t need to attempt to hide my hair loss through longer length hair.</li>
            <li>Very Powerful  - Very quiet  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the larger bottle of professional oil(3310-230) for $3 as this fine piece of German engineering requires frequent oil touch ups, like most clippers.  </li>
            <li>- Much faster to cut my hair than any other trimmer (much fewer second passes)  - A \\&quot;real\\&quot; stainless steel head that doesn&#x27;t rust at all  - Much easier to clean  - No need for cord; very powerful Lithium Ion battery  </li>
            <li>Most clippers have a large length adjuster on the side, this one has a length adjuster too, but its smaller and located at the back of the blade.</li>
            <li>The main clipper I looked at was one my barber uses called the Osterizer Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and if he couldn&#x27;t hear it (which it&#x27;s super quiet)</li>
            <li>After searching for a replacement trimmer for my older, worn-out cordless trimmer, I ordered the Wahl Proh Lithium 8546.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my head and body and have no irritation afterwards, which is very uncharacteristic for me as I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>Real smooth sensation even with thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, with little vibration, so it feels very comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new item nd</li>
            <li>Anyway, I had Wahl hair trimmer for over 8 years now and it is still like new.</li>
            <li>Of course it might be because I typically wait too long to trim my beard, which this kind of machine may not be designed for.</li>
            <li>I have tried many clippers over the past 10 years and nothing has come close to the quality and performance of this unit.</li>
            <li>great cutting performance and battery life, feels like a premium product, its a bit top heavy they (the blade weighs alot and the silver part feels like plastic).</li>
            <li>Hard to explain - just a clean even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any written information on that and J&amp;R even told me it is not true, but it is and eventually Wahl confirmed it as well.</li>
            <li>This is a professional trimmer.</li>
            <li>my old Panasonic died and this was my choice for a replacement.</li>
            <li>These are professional class clippers.</li>
            <li>mainly used for occasional trims and keeping beards &amp; mustaches under control.</li>
            <li>The device comes with a nice black round stand that holds the oil and the brush, but there is no pouch or anything like that included for the 6 spacers or the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>Trims very close and the battery lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I wrapped a long rubber-band around it a few times and it&#x27;s very comfortable, should last forever.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at the quality of the actual cut.</li>
            <li>but this one is a major improvement on all of them.</li>
            <li>I own a Salon and my wife runs it and was tired of poor quality cordless clippers and how quickly the just fail to work.&lt;br /&gt;These where great for her and fairly quiet for what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a follow up to my initial comments a few weeks later - I own 2 other $200 + clippers.</li>
            <li>My five-year old appreciates trimming his hair with a very quiet trimmer  - Health</li>
            <li>:  DC battery produces a far smaller EM field compared to an AC-powered trimmer  Cons  -</li>
            <li>have two of these for personal use (2 &amp; 1  year old)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the handle is a bit too smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have any regrets on paying the somewhat high price for it.</li>
            <li>After using this trimmer the first time, I realized I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on trimmers over the years.  </li>

            <li> He was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> This are great clippers I really recommend this to anybody</li>
            <li> second and most important feature is it&#x27;s performance which is excellent.  </li>
            <li> The new lithium model is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar Wahl product and was equally happy with it, but after using it for many years, on many dogs, I wore it out, :)  </li>
            <li> These are easily the lightest, most powerful clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching to find the best clipper I could.</li>
            <li> but it really saves a good 10-15 mins each time</li>
            <li> , very nice lady took my address and sent out a new blade (with the plastic) free of charge - the item was at my doorstep (in Hawaii) within a week.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and lightweight .</li>
            <li> After having Norelco and Panasonic pro models this is hands down the best trimmer out there.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine product both engineered and assembled in Germany --</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> It is Made in Germany and the charger it comes with works on international voltage 110V-220V 50/60Hz (stamped on the charger), which is great; you&#x27;d just need a plug adaptor.</li>
            <li> I have owned several high end cordless hair trimmers over the years and this product ranks with the best.</li>
            <li> I use air spray (like for electronics) to clean out the horse hair every 15 minutes or so, so it will keep going.</li>
            <li> These are probably great clippers for the not so busy stylist but not for high volume haircut stores</li>
            <li> The surface looks great, but it makes it somewhat harder to grip.  </li>
            <li> After 3 hair cuts, battery life still shows a full charge.</li>
            <li> It holds its charge for 2 hours and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers several times and love them!</li>
            <li> The only negatives are the high price and the guards could be slightly more rounded on the edges to make it more comfortable when using.</li>
            <li> Powerful and work well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, can&#x27;t think of any; true test is to see how long it lasts  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and these make it a breeze with no cord, being lightweight and low vibration.</li>
            <li> It has a looooong lasting Lithium Ion batter and cuts nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> but this one proves you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Light weight, quiet, easy to change the guards.</li>
            <li> Quiet, light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Super cool styling and very quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper is quiet, easy to clean, and oil.</li>
            <li> As the saying goes &#x27;only rich people can afford themselves to buy cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it goes thru my hair like a hot knife thru butter.</li>
            <li> Silent &amp; Used by professionals!&lt;br /&gt;Better then most of the brands that i already used like philips or braun.</li>
            <li> German engineering on this model is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first pair as a groomer</li>
            <li> Then I read a bit the manual and realized the top needs to be opened and oiled regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few trimmers and this one is by far the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Confident I won&#x27;t need to replace them for a long time</li>
            <li> When I have to put it down in order to use another grooming tool, it remains upright in its charger, handy to grab and continues to charge itself...</li>
            <li> The portability and light weight while very robust construction is also a major improvement.</li>
            <li> Wala, the oil kicked it back to its full might and smoothness!</li>
            <li> I figure this Wahl will pay for itself in less than a year, while I have the opportunity to use a well-designed and effective tool.</li>
            <li> With the trimmer set to 1/2&amp;#34; or so, I set a mirror I can see from our shower stall and can get a pretty decent haircut while all the hair drops on the shower floor.</li>
            <li> The motor hums along powerfully, smoothly and quietly.</li>
            <li> Fast recharge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the animal clipper sold which appears to be identical.</li>
            <li> Anything that saves time and motion is appreciated.</li>
            <li> Besides, the lithium battery lasts much, much longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the last dozen years, resolving that once the spot on the back of my head was exposed, I didn&#x27;t need to attempt to hide my hair loss through longer length hair.</li>
            <li> Very Powerful  - Very quiet  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the larger bottle of professional oil(3310-230) for $3 as this fine piece of German engineering requires frequent oil touch ups, like most clippers.  </li>
            <li> - Much faster to cut my hair than any other trimmer (much fewer second passes)  - A \\&quot;real\\&quot; stainless steel head that doesn&#x27;t rust at all  - Much easier to clean  - No need for cord; very powerful Lithium Ion battery  </li>
            <li> Most clippers have a large length adjuster on the side, this one has a length adjuster too, but its smaller and located at the back of the blade.</li>
            <li> The main clipper I looked at was one my barber uses called the Osterizer Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if he couldn&#x27;t hear it (which it&#x27;s super quiet)</li>
            <li> After searching for a replacement trimmer for my older, worn-out cordless trimmer, I ordered the Wahl Proh Lithium 8546.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my head and body and have no irritation afterwards, which is very uncharacteristic for me as I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> Real smooth sensation even with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, with little vibration, so it feels very comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new item nd</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had Wahl hair trimmer for over 8 years now and it is still like new.</li>
            <li> Of course it might be because I typically wait too long to trim my beard, which this kind of machine may not be designed for.</li>
            <li> I have tried many clippers over the past 10 years and nothing has come close to the quality and performance of this unit.</li>
            <li> great cutting performance and battery life, feels like a premium product, its a bit top heavy they (the blade weighs alot and the silver part feels like plastic).</li>
            <li> Hard to explain - just a clean even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any written information on that and J&amp;R even told me it is not true, but it is and eventually Wahl confirmed it as well.</li>
            <li> This is a professional trimmer.</li>
            <li> my old Panasonic died and this was my choice for a replacement.</li>
            <li> These are professional class clippers.</li>
            <li> mainly used for occasional trims and keeping beards &amp; mustaches under control.</li>
            <li> The device comes with a nice black round stand that holds the oil and the brush, but there is no pouch or anything like that included for the 6 spacers or the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> Trims very close and the battery lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I wrapped a long rubber-band around it a few times and it&#x27;s very comfortable, should last forever.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the quality of the actual cut.</li>
            <li> but this one is a major improvement on all of them.</li>
            <li> I own a Salon and my wife runs it and was tired of poor quality cordless clippers and how quickly the just fail to work.&lt;br /&gt;These where great for her and fairly quiet for what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a follow up to my initial comments a few weeks later - I own 2 other $200 + clippers.</li>
            <li> My five-year old appreciates trimming his hair with a very quiet trimmer  - Health</li>
            <li> :  DC battery produces a far smaller EM field compared to an AC-powered trimmer  Cons  -</li>
            <li> have two of these for personal use (2 &amp; 1  year old)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle is a bit too smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any regrets on paying the somewhat high price for it.</li>
            <li> After using this trimmer the first time, I realized I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Actually trimmed my entire horse, who hates loud corded trimmers, a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about over charging and the charge last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pros  - Runs through thick hair like a hot knife through butter  -</li>
            <li> I bought this product from J&amp;R directly as it seemed I could save some processing time , perhaps not true, but it said so.</li>
            <li> Definately a precision trimmer, quality craftsmanship, and the lithium battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp (it can cut your lips if you&#x27;re not careful)</li>
            <li> Most cordless clippers are weak and shoddy.</li>
            <li> I had various other brands</li>
            <li> battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> lasts a very long time indeed.</li>
            <li> I have yet for it to pull a single hair.</li>
            <li> I think the only down fall is</li>
            <li> For the &amp;#34;fuel gauge&amp;#34; to read accurately, you need to let it run down between charging according to the instructions which is a little weird but no big</li>
            <li> well spent period.</li>
            <li> cannot think of one aspect of this clipper I do not absolutely adore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No power no crisp cut total waste of money, except I can use for wheel chair client but still doesn&#x27;t cut crispy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any affiliation with Wahl or other conflicts of interest.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely well made and high-quality.</li>
            <li> I am keeping it for travel to countries on 220V, where I wouldn&#x27;t have any other choice.&lt;br /&gt;The battery</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about the Wahl cordless clippers is the  5-n-1 blade.</li>
            <li> A client told me the other day</li>
            <li> I was hesitant due to the price tag</li>
            <li> My other cordless required me to remove its battery (not a lithium) and insert it in its charger, pick up the other fully-charged battery and put it into the trimmer before I could continue.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit pricey compared with some of the other products</li>
            <li> This Wahl clipper works extremely well.</li>
            <li> - Long trimming time with very little power drop-off as battery is drained  -</li>
            <li> Charges in less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> The clippers kept getting bogged down.</li>
            <li> My only small complaint is that the Wahl 8546 is a tad slippery to hold.  </li>
            <li> ended up buying a separate little machine for that (from phillips)</li>
            <li> they are a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Very high quality cutting blades.</li>
            <li> I tried Wahl&#x27;s cheap lithium ion cordless hair clippers and they were horrible.</li>
            <li> Thick hair</li>
            <li> They are expensive but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> The cutting length adjustment integrated in the blade set has five settings to determine the length of the hair from 0.7 mm to 3.0 mm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> he wouldn&#x27;t believe i was actually cutting his hair!</li>
            <li> This is used to trim a beard and around the base of the hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are top notch. Powerful and work well.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to give a review of this item since it&#x27;s an incredible trimmer.  After using this trimmer the first time, I realized I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on trimmers over the years.  I wish I&#x27;d found this trimmer earlier, and hopefully this review will help those on the fence.  Pros  - Runs through thick hair like a hot knife through butter  - Very Powerful  - Very quiet  - Much faster to cut my hair than any other trimmer (much fewer second passes)  - A \\&quot;real\\&quot; stainless steel head that doesn&#x27;t rust at all  - Much easier to clean  - No need for cord; very powerful Lithium Ion battery  - Long trimming time with very little power drop-off as battery is drained  - My five-year old appreciates trimming his hair with a very quiet trimmer  - Health:  DC battery produces a far smaller EM field compared to an AC-powered trimmer  Cons  - Honestly, can&#x27;t think of any; true test is to see how long it lasts  I don&#x27;t have any affiliation with Wahl or other conflicts of interest.  This is a fine product both engineered and assembled in Germany -- buy and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers several times and love them! I cut my own hair and these make it a breeze with no cord, being lightweight and low vibration. I have tried many clippers over the past 10 years and nothing has come close to the quality and performance of this unit. I tried Wahl&#x27;s cheap lithium ion cordless hair clippers and they were horrible. The clippers kept getting bogged down. Not this pro version.....it goes thru my hair like a hot knife thru butter. After 3 hair cuts, battery life still shows a full charge. Most clippers have a large length adjuster on the side, this one has a length adjuster too, but its smaller and located at the back of the blade. The guards are a perfect fit for the clippers. The quality of the unit is like nothing I have ever seen. The motor hums along powerfully, smoothly and quietly. The blade is top notch. Probably because it&#x27;s made in Germany and not China. I would recommend buying the larger bottle of professional oil(3310-230) for $3 as this fine piece of German engineering requires frequent oil touch ups, like most clippers.  The only negatives are the high price and the guards could be slightly more rounded on the edges to make it more comfortable when using. I just wish I found this unit sooner.....great investment!</li>
            <li> Took me forever to find a quality trimmer. This is the one.</li>
            <li> Replaced my corded trimmer, battery lasts forever. A must have!</li>
            <li> Hold a charge for days and it&#x27;s in use constantly and the shop.  Highly recommend, worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great. Real smooth sensation even with thick hair. Only thing it&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li> After having Norelco and Panasonic pro models this is hands down the best trimmer out there.  Money well spent period.</li>
            <li> Great first shaver on my journey into beard cultivation.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching to find the best clipper I could. The main clipper I looked at was one my barber uses called the Osterizer Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this cordless clipper in the end over the Osterizer Juice. It is ridiculously amazing!!! It is extremely well made and high-quality. It cuts through the thickest hair like a hit knife through butter. I have yet for it to pull a single hair. I use it on my head and body and have no irritation afterwards, which is very uncharacteristic for me as I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time. The clipper is quiet, easy to clean, and oil. It fits very nicely in my hand and is incredibly light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of one aspect of this clipper I do not absolutely adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for I guess!!!</li>
            <li> Outlasted many that preceded it.</li>
            <li> It works relatively well, probably the best of all cordless clippers that I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s still not as good as a corded one. I am keeping it for travel to countries on 220V, where I wouldn&#x27;t have any other choice.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time indeed. It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, with little vibration, so it feels very comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best machine that I have ever been used.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good trimmer, but a cordless one.  This one is great.  It has a looooong lasting Lithium Ion batter and cuts nice.  The blade even has a multi settign adjustment that clicks in for different lengths.  If you need even longer than you can use one of the guards that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I like best about this one is it comes with a charger/stand and even has a slot for the oil and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super cool styling and very quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> These are probably great clippers for the not so busy stylist but not for high volume haircut stores and they need to be advertised as a clipper not a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I own a Salon and my wife runs it and was tired of poor quality cordless clippers and how quickly the just fail to work.&lt;br /&gt;These where great for her and fairly quiet for what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> No power no crisp cut total waste of money, except I can use for wheel chair client but still doesn&#x27;t cut crispy</li>
            <li> These are easily the lightest, most powerful clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 15 years. Confident I won&#x27;t need to replace them for a long time but if I do it will just be with another Wahl Pro cordless. Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever had. Use it every week for my head. It does not matter what kind of cut you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;ll get it. The kit does not come with a cape or a comb just so everyone knows.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.  Trims very close and the battery lasts a very long time.  For the &amp;#34;fuel gauge&amp;#34; to read accurately, you need to let it run down between charging according to the instructions which is a little weird but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive but worth it.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous trimmers and this is the best.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer available worldwide, incredible performance! Silent &amp; Used by professionals!&lt;br /&gt;Better then most of the brands that i already used like philips or braun.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I use it to cut my hair weekly.  I&#x27;ve only had to charge it three times in the last year.  The Lithium batteries are the best.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Makes grooming my dog a breeze. The tool is a pleasure to use. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Most cordless clippers are weak and shoddy. Not this one. It has a powerful lithium powered motor and an excellent adjustable blade. My only complaint is that the handle is a bit too smooth. Putting some kind of grippy cover on it would be a good idea. Maybe those stick-on things you put on the bottom of the tub?</li>
            <li> I have been grooming for over 35 years. I absolutely love cordless clippers. I have owned several pairs of Wahl cordless clippers, but eventually the battery gives out. The new lithium model is great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about over charging and the charge last a long time. The other thing I like about the Wahl cordless clippers is the  5-n-1 blade. At a touch of the finger, you can change the setting. The plastic combs that slide over the blade are nice for a longer clip. I will never go back to corded clippers again!!</li>
            <li> This is a professional trimmer. German engineering on this model is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sturdy. The cutting length adjustment integrated in the blade set has five settings to determine the length of the hair from 0.7 mm to 3.0 mm.&lt;br /&gt;Per specs the battery lasts max 75 minutes and I can confirm that (obviously performance will degrade as Li-Ion battery ages). Fast recharge.&lt;br /&gt;I have two of these for personal use (2 &amp; 1  year old) and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this model (Wahl Li+Pro 8546).</li>
            <li> Light weight, quiet, easy to change the guards. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this electric clipper. Don&#x27;t have any regrets on paying the somewhat high price for it. It is lightweight and and fully charged when i received it.</li>
            <li> The most awesome clippers I have ever owned, and Ive been doing hair for 14 yesrs!  Cuts so smooth, and holds a great charge!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair clipper I&#x27;ve bought to date...!</li>
            <li> I ordered a new item nd it came to me used</li>
            <li> After going through a number of &amp;#34;consumer&amp;#34; level hair trimmers, I find this one a joy to use. I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the last dozen years, resolving that once the spot on the back of my head was exposed, I didn&#x27;t need to attempt to hide my hair loss through longer length hair. With the trimmer set to 1/2&amp;#34; or so, I set a mirror I can see from our shower stall and can get a pretty decent haircut while all the hair drops on the shower floor. After I pick it up so that it doesn&#x27;t clog the drain, I can immediately shower, thus avoiding the &amp;#34;scratchy neck&amp;#34; syndrome that always accompanied in-shop haircuts. It&#x27;s not all that stylish, but as the hairline recedes, I don&#x27;t worry a great deal about &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; and certainly enjoy the $20 - $40 savings with each haircut. I figure this Wahl will pay for itself in less than a year, while I have the opportunity to use a well-designed and effective tool.</li>
            <li> Quality product. I have owned several high end cordless hair trimmers over the years and this product ranks with the best.</li>
            <li> I own a salon and this is the BEST full size trimmer I have ever used. Love the fact it&#x27;s lithium Ion and I don&#x27;t have to worry about timing the charge. A client told me the other day it&#x27;s the smoothest clipper anyone had ever used and if he couldn&#x27;t hear it (which it&#x27;s super quiet) he wouldn&#x27;t believe i was actually cutting his hair! Plus it feels great in your hand. If you run out of battery it&#x27;s not a problem since you can just plug it in. Although the battery seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is my first pair as a groomer and I&#x27;ve got to say I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. I feel like it could have been more convenient, maybe? It&#x27;s very sharp (it can cut your lips if you&#x27;re not careful) but I still need to put some energy into trimming some areas of my beard. Of course it might be because I typically wait too long to trim my beard, which this kind of machine may not be designed for. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> BESIDES BEING A PIECE OF ART, IT DELIVERS IN EVERY ASPECT.</li>
            <li> my old Panasonic died and this was my choice for a replacement. very happy with the decision - ergonomically shaped, battery seems to last forever between use. mainly used for occasional trims and keeping beards &amp; mustaches under control.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant due to the price tag but it really saves a good 10-15 mins each time I trim my hair and beard. Very quiet and smooth. As the saying goes &#x27;only rich people can afford themselves to buy cheap&#x27;. One thing I&#x27;d like to share concerns maintenance. It became sluggish after some 8 months of use and I was about to send it back to Wahl for repair. Then I read a bit the manual and realized the top needs to be opened and oiled regularly. Wala, the oil kicked it back to its full might and smoothness! I bought mine at J&amp;R.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. Actually trimmed my entire horse, who hates loud corded trimmers, a little at a time. It holds its charge for 2 hours and recharges quickly. I use air spray (like for electronics) to clean out the horse hair every 15 minutes or so, so it will keep going. Easy to hold and lightweight . Much cheaper than the animal clipper sold which appears to be identical.</li>
            <li> A great product and you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve gone through a few trimmers and this one is by far the best so far.  Quiet, light and easy to use.  It cuts well without any pulling.</li>
            <li> These are professional class clippers. Very high quality cutting blades. It is made in Germany and runs very smooth and it is lithium powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a follow up to my initial comments a few weeks later - I own 2 other $200 + clippers. I am very surprised at the quality of the actual cut. It shows on my beard. I assume it is in the quality of the blades. The end result just looks better. I am actually pleased and surprised!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife commented that had I done something different. Hard to explain - just a clean even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> After searching for a replacement trimmer for my older, worn-out cordless trimmer, I ordered the Wahl Proh Lithium 8546.  It was recommended by a friend who also grooms her own dogs.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance.  One of its best features is the sound it makes---hardly any!  The quieter a trimmer, the better dogs tolerate it.  It&#x27;s second and most important feature is it&#x27;s performance which is excellent.  I&#x27;ve used a similar Wahl product and was equally happy with it, but after using it for many years, on many dogs, I wore it out, :)  My only small complaint is that the Wahl 8546 is a tad slippery to hold.  The shape is excellent, but its taking me a while to get used to its very smooth exterior.  Thus, only four stars.  The surface looks great, but it makes it somewhat harder to grip.  Oh, one more good point, it comes with a stand for recharging, and this is very handy.  When I have to put it down in order to use another grooming tool, it remains upright in its charger, handy to grab and continues to charge itself...excellent feature.  My other cordless required me to remove its battery (not a lithium) and insert it in its charger, pick up the other fully-charged battery and put it into the trimmer before I could continue. That may not seem like a nuisance, but when I&#x27;m grooming, the quicker I&#x27;m done, the better for both the dog and I.  Anything that saves time and motion is appreciated. Besides, the lithium battery lasts much, much longer.  The Wahl 8546 fulfills all my needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from J&amp;R directly as it seemed I could save some processing time , perhaps not true, but it said so. Anyway, I had Wahl hair trimmer for over 8 years now and it is still like new. Fantastic product and it was USA made.&lt;br /&gt;This Li-Pro  seems great too, quite and well made. It is Made in Germany and the charger it comes with works on international voltage 110V-220V 50/60Hz (stamped on the charger), which is great; you&#x27;d just need a plug adaptor. I couldn&#x27;t find any written information on that and J&amp;R even told me it is not true, but it is and eventually Wahl confirmed it as well. The device comes with a nice black round stand that holds the oil and the brush, but there is no pouch or anything like that included for the 6 spacers or the trimmer itself. I love the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect Hair Cutter! It was amazing gift for my nephew. He was satisfied with it. What else that is it.</li>
            <li> This is used to trim a beard and around the base of the hair.  It&#x27;s very smooth and does an excellent job.  It seemed a bit pricey compared with some of the other products but this one proves you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This Wahl clipper works extremely well. I had various other brands but this one is a major improvement on all of them. The battery life for one thing outlasts anything out there. The portability and light weight while very robust construction is also a major improvement. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more for anybody who takes care of their own hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> Very well made-cuts great, nice and even. Charges in less than an hour.  Heavier than the cheaper ones and the finish, though beautiful, can be slippery. I wrapped a long rubber-band around it a few times and it&#x27;s very comfortable, should last forever.</li>
            <li> As a hair professional, these are the best clippers I have purchased in 16 years ! I do about 6 men&#x27;s cuts/week and this clipper holds a charge in my drawer for about a month before needing a recharge&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money !</li>
            <li> great cutting performance and battery life, feels like a premium product, its a bit top heavy they (the blade weighs alot and the silver part feels like plastic). the machine fell on the floor and the plastic tip holding the blade to the machine broke off, called Whal, very nice lady took my address and sent out a new blade (with the plastic) free of charge - the item was at my doorstep (in Hawaii) within a week. great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;i just wish it had an option of a narrower blade for outlining my hair/beard trimming. ended up buying a separate little machine for that (from phillips)</li>
            <li> Definately a precision trimmer, quality craftsmanship, and the lithium battery lasts a long time.  I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. No cord and they cut! Thick hair no problem.</li>
            <li> This are great clippers I really recommend this to anybody</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, I have been doing hair for 12 years and so far the best ones I&#x27;ve found.  They are expensive but you get what you pay for.  I think the only down fall is they are a little heavy.</li>
