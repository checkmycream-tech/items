            <li> I have tried many different types of hand softeners to get my hands softer.I have very hard water that makes my skin very dry and rough. Add low humidity and my hands almost crack. This stuff is wonderful! I can put it on and my hands will stay soft even after repeated washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who has tried them all. This truly is the best!</li>
            <li> I love the Glysolid that I ordered.  The buy 2 get one get one free was a very good deal.</li>

            <li> tubes are very small!</li>
            <li> Quality product, does come off in water, not sticky, have used for years</li>
            <li> On a recent TV show A dermatologist recommended using hand creams with high glycerin content. After reading the ingredients, I purchased Glysolid cream in tubes to carry in my purse and a jar of the solid for home use. It is very moisturizing and softens my hands. I carry the tubes with me and use the jar for over night. The cream in the tubes soaks in very quickly softening my hands. Thru the years I&#x27;ve used many different hand creams but none as effective as this Glysolid. When the tubes are gone I&#x27;ll be purchasing more. I highly recommend it. The only negative is that I wish they offered larger tubes of a pump container of the cream.</li>
            <li> The speedy delivery and the wonderful results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;For chafing fingers and hands it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: It works!</li>
            <li> Glysolid is a great product.  It even helps rough dry feet.  Great for your hands.  Will be really nice with winter coming on.</li>
            <li> This is good, Mother used this when I was a baby...like the flat round tin the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, and the smaller tubes fit in your pocket.  I am in the health care arena, and all the antibacterial lotion was really drying me out.  This lotion rocks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glysolid for years in both the tube and can for my nail cuticles.  I love it and carry the tube with me in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> The best skin protection ever!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful - it does soften without grease.  Cured those ugly elbows &amp; knees!</li>
