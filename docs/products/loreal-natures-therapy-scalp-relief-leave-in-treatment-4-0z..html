            <li>This felt good on my scalp but didn&#x27;t make the flakes go away.  </li>

            <li>smells good but</li>
            <li>(it smells good)</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product smells good and feels good when applied but doesn&#x27;t have the longer term (day-long) benefit I hoped for.</li>

            <li>I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t pepper-minty, minty, or tee tree</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-not quite as effective</li>
            <li>I had ordered this product before and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, so you can feel comfortable having it in your hair at work or out on a date or during your favorite psychedelic rave--whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products and that is the best I have found so far.</li>

            <li>Easy to use, smells nice.</li>
            <li>job L&#x27;Oreal !!  :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t know about this product.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SURE there are better products or better ways of doing this.    </li>
            <li>However, if I come across something else, I will try that product to see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ingredients and mostly the amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>Suffered from an itchy scalp for many months.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Great scent and fast working.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>The scalp treatment above is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>and I now have a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer more of a tingle....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The product I received also had an orange cap and the bottle was more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Menopause brings on many wild and crusty skin/hair issues that can be relieved by this great product.</li>
            <li>Very cool and soothing to the scalp with not oder.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application&lt;</li>
            <li>The nozzle makes application easy.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and it&#x27;s easy to manage with this product.</li>
            <li>Scalp relief works fine.</li>
            <li>stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I got several types from L&#x27;Oreal and they work great.</li>
            <li>It feels great and cooling when I apply it at the top of my scalp right in the middle and then rub it into my scalp a bit.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use (put on after I wash my hair)</li>
            <li>It cools and soothes these areas, but didn&#x27;t significantly reduce the flakes.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>Great to use right after the shower and your pores are still open.</li>
            <li>and I always use special shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, that I MUST have it with me at all times.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will be ordering a backup bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>I paid full price and got 1/3 the value I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and my makes my hair nice and soft and look healthier.</li>
            <li>This product feels soothing and smells nice, but I don&#x27;t think it really helped much.</li>
            <li>Luckily my daughter did not have any reactions despite her nut allergies, because it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>....but doesn&#x27;t really do very much for me!</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to try this product it offers great results for the right price.</li>
            <li>bottle is a good size, but it seemed to take a lot to cause itch relief to my scalp compared to other products (scalpicin, etc).  </li>
            <li>And I got sores on the right side of the scalp</li>
            <li>and I could feel a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be a customer for a very long time, it&#x27;s really THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>Tingled at first use but didnt improve itchy scalp or flakes.</li>
            <li>Our local Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying this, and we were so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I found it at Sally&#x27;s first</li>
            <li>I thought it was dandruff at first, so I tried using anti dandruff products.</li>
            <li>Thanks, L&#x27;oreal!</li>
            <li>, so it seems soothing at first.</li>
            <li>I towel dry my hair and apply this stuff and work it into my hair and scalp and magically gets rid of my frizz</li>
            <li>I had very high expectations for this product</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really relieve my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Worked well for my grandson and fast service.</li>
            <li>Provided much needed itch relief.</li>
            <li>It really helped me with the dryness of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have dandruff, just an ITCHY head that seemed to have no cure.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me,made my hair greasy and still itchy.</li>
            <li>my scalp feels so much nicer</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m using a much more product than expected, given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many other products are for dandruff</li>
            <li>/&gt;-take much more product to relieve itchiness compared to other products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I would strongly suggest this product for anyone dealing with dry, sore scalp.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this it stopped almost completely.</li>
            <li>This product works great in relieving itchy scalp and does not weigh hair down like other products.</li>
            <li>I put a generous amount in my hair more than the 3 drops it asks for and after working it in to my scalp and the rest of my hair it like instantly turns my bad hair day into a good one!</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for years and just recently I have developed an allergy to color making my scalp incredibly itchy, this stopped the itching immediately and actually gave my hair a little bit of a wave to it.</li>
            <li>Got made fun of at school, and tried different things.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine leaving it in during the day since it has such a powerful fragrence and ends up matting the hair after it dries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a very sensitive scalp since childhood.</li>
            <li>( Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews both negative and positive:) This stuff was instant relief.  </li>
            <li>Which leads me to believe this stuff is worth using for the long term.</li>
            <li>but it was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>Too busy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Have to separate hair to put directly onto skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I was experiencing, although it didn&#x27;t eliminate it completely.</li>
            <li>I use it directly out of the shower before bed and always shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Try another vendor; I&#x27;m surprised Amazon does business with this one.</li>
            <li>but it surprised me in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I have long curly hair that gets pretty frizzy when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Also, after the first few times you use it, you get used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as soothing as when you first used it.</li>
            <li>Irritated red areas looked normal again.  </li>
            <li>new revised product is thinner and has a different smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a suggested purchase it worked really well to soothe the itches and kept my scalp from being dry during the day</li>
            <li>If too much is applied, my hair looks greasy, so I only use it at betime if I will be washing my hair the next day.</li>
            <li>and It barely itches anymore!</li>
            <li>It did the complete opposite of what it was supposed to do, it increased flakes and itchiness .</li>
            <li>It works really well the first few times you use it, especially if you have short, trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li>but it cooled without the overwhelming smell and irritating burn</li>
            <li>So I ordered what I thought was the same product but apparently in the interim, which I believe was only a few months, the manufacturer changed the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I originally ordered was by L&#x27;Oreal under the brand name Nature&#x27;s Therapy and was referred to as &amp;#34;Scalp</li>
            <li>I have a very inflamed scalp and was hoping, based on other reviews, this product would help relieve the discomfort and redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve certainly seen a lot less of it since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>If you have sore scalp due to using color products or even sunburn, then I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to be oily, this does not make it worse.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;-take much more product to relieve itchiness compared to other products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I would strongly suggest this product for anyone dealing with dry, sore scalp.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it stopped almost completely.</li>
            <li> This product works great in relieving itchy scalp and does not weigh hair down like other products.</li>
            <li> I put a generous amount in my hair more than the 3 drops it asks for and after working it in to my scalp and the rest of my hair it like instantly turns my bad hair day into a good one!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years and just recently I have developed an allergy to color making my scalp incredibly itchy, this stopped the itching immediately and actually gave my hair a little bit of a wave to it.</li>
            <li> Got made fun of at school, and tried different things.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine leaving it in during the day since it has such a powerful fragrence and ends up matting the hair after it dries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very sensitive scalp since childhood.</li>
            <li> ( Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews both negative and positive:) This stuff was instant relief.  </li>
            <li> Which leads me to believe this stuff is worth using for the long term.</li>
            <li> but it was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> Too busy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Have to separate hair to put directly onto skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I was experiencing, although it didn&#x27;t eliminate it completely.</li>
            <li> I use it directly out of the shower before bed and always shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Try another vendor; I&#x27;m surprised Amazon does business with this one.</li>
            <li> but it surprised me in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that gets pretty frizzy when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Also, after the first few times you use it, you get used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as soothing as when you first used it.</li>
            <li> Irritated red areas looked normal again.  </li>
            <li> new revised product is thinner and has a different smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was a suggested purchase it worked really well to soothe the itches and kept my scalp from being dry during the day</li>
            <li> If too much is applied, my hair looks greasy, so I only use it at betime if I will be washing my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> and It barely itches anymore!</li>
            <li> It did the complete opposite of what it was supposed to do, it increased flakes and itchiness .</li>
            <li> It works really well the first few times you use it, especially if you have short, trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li> but it cooled without the overwhelming smell and irritating burn</li>
            <li> So I ordered what I thought was the same product but apparently in the interim, which I believe was only a few months, the manufacturer changed the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I originally ordered was by L&#x27;Oreal under the brand name Nature&#x27;s Therapy and was referred to as &amp;#34;Scalp</li>
            <li> I have a very inflamed scalp and was hoping, based on other reviews, this product would help relieve the discomfort and redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly seen a lot less of it since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> If you have sore scalp due to using color products or even sunburn, then I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to be oily, this does not make it worse.</li>
            <li> I like this for the dry scalp patches I get occasionally but a bit to oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> It turned out that my issue was dry scalp and this product is what ultimately got rid of the flakes that infuriates me beyond words!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also have had a dry, irritated, and itchy scalp for years now and after using this product for a short period of time</li>
            <li> /&gt;After attempting to compare the labeling on the container of the product I purchased earllier to the labeling on the container of the product I just received, the only difference that I find is that this new product does not contain the words &amp;#34;Tamanu Oil&amp;#34; on the front of the container and a few other French language descriptive phrases.  </li>
            <li> This is likely due to lack of hydrocortizone.  </li>
            <li> But I want to categorically state that I have lived with dry, patchy scalp since I was about 12.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my scalp always feels itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp all my life</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my hair and whenever my scalp feels dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a lot of products to address my dry scalp issue.</li>
            <li> The soreness and dry scalp literally vanished.</li>
            <li> Soothes dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Solved 5 year dry scalp problem overnight!  </li>
            <li> It was very dry and flaky and awful--but this product reduced the tightness immediately upon application.</li>
            <li> Every so often, my scalp gets very dry and sore.</li>
            <li> Had tight, itchy scalp and female hair loss for years.</li>
            <li> but they appear to be somewhat different or at least listed in a different order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the nozzle wasn&#x27;t as wide the opening.</li>
            <li> Good stuff -- it actually does relieve the terrible itch of seborrhea, which I can&#x27;t say about other products.</li>
            <li> definitely noticeable change in scalp, less flakes, less itch.  </li>
            <li> This product, unlike other lotions, doesn&#x27;t appear to have any alcohol in it because it stays wet on your scalp for awhile.</li>
            <li> My only thought is that if you have a really bad problem with flaking/dandruff, you should get a strong shampoo to deal with it rather than using a little serum.</li>
            <li> I have previously used it and it relieved my dry scalp issue in no time.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> you used it other than your scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using other products trying to manage my symptoms throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-lacks active ingredients found in other stronger products</li>
            <li> Both drying and irritating, these may actually tear up the \\&quot;good\\&quot; skin cells that are left on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The picture of the container from which I ordered was the same container I had previously ordered with a green bottle and green cap</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> but this stuff helped tone it down to a managable itch.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no more dry.</li>
            <li> I still found my scalp felt tight and itchy between washings.</li>
            <li> I suffer from itchy and tight scalp that worsens during the winter.</li>
            <li> Pricey on Amazon, too, considering it&#x27;s such a small bottle!!</li>
            <li> You have to apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> no itch relief at all, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I picked this up, and within a few hours I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal</li>
            <li> Made his hair really stiff and looked greasy.</li>
            <li> and I had no more tight, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Had a bad bleach job done last tuesday that left my scalp feeling like it had been sunburned.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s this product</li>
            <li> Small bottle you can take anywhere.  </li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I may still keep using, not sure at this point.</li>
            <li> Found out about this products through a friend in France when I was in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product is average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t complain about the smell of products but this is weird.</li>
            <li> , guess we will see.the bottle was also very dirty on the outside, what&#x27;s up with that?!</li>
            <li> It does not make any flakes go away, in fact they get A LOT worse after using as recommended.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I usually get flare-ups when the cold weather starts, and I pair it up with Head and Shoulders shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s how I knew it was working nothing dramatic though.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a product that worked until I randomly found this product.</li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from scalp itch should try this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something to relieve my scalp itch.  </li>
            <li> it itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> My scalp had been itching and driving me crazy for days.</li>
            <li> I bought this planning on using it on a particularly bad spot of Psoriasis on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Very bad smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> item came on time, seems to work as it is described.</li>
            <li> definitely noticeable change in scalp, less flakes, less itch.  I use 3-4 times a week and also use stopitt once a week. Great results.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my psoriasis at all.</li>
            <li> This solution is the best I&#x27;ve found, and at 67 I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. The only place that I have a problem is around the hairline on the back of my neck. I started using the solution as soon as I got it and it works wonders besides smelling delightful!! As soon as the solution is put on the itching stops. I&#x27;m going to be a customer for a very long time, it&#x27;s really THAT GOOD FOR ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job L&#x27;Oreal !!  :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me. Tingled at first use but didnt improve itchy scalp or flakes. And I got sores on the right side of the scalp not sure if it&#x27;s this product but I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job in ensuring my scalp is not dry!!</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  It didn&#x27;t really relieve my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> This felt good on my scalp but didn&#x27;t make the flakes go away.  Buy Philip B Anti Flake Shampoo instead!  I have tried a lot of products and that is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I never review products. Too busy. But I want to categorically state that I have lived with dry, patchy scalp since I was about 12. Got made fun of at school, and tried different things. Found out about this products through a friend in France when I was in my late 20&#x27;s. Been using it every since and buying wherever I can find it. Loreal Scalp Relief makes it go away instantly. I usually get flare-ups when the cold weather starts, and I pair it up with Head and Shoulders shampoo treatment. Works like a charm. Not only for me, but for my dad and my husband. If this product ever discontinues, I&#x27;m basically up a creek.</li>
            <li> Made his hair really stiff and looked greasy. And he still had an itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months. I spray it on everyday and my scalp itch has descreased so much. I use to tear at my scalp and hair for relief until my head was sore. Now it kinda itches sometimes. One bottle only last me about a month. I did find it locally at Sally&#x27;s too, in case I forgot to get it online.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t know about this product.  I have dry skin and my scalp always feels itchy.  This stuff instantly soothes without making your hair feel greasy - it dries in a second and you feel relief.  It&#x27;s a great thing to have around.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, that I MUST have it with me at all times. If you suffer from psoriasis then this is something that you would like to consider to provide moisture. It smells great ! &amp; works great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I could feel a difference right away. I wish I would of found it sooner it made the world of difference</li>
            <li> I have not seen the results and I have several applications used .</li>
            <li> This is great for dry scalp.  Our local Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying this, and we were so glad to find it on Amazon. It is similar in feel to an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> The best for scalp issues! Love the scent as well!</li>
            <li> If you have sore scalp due to using color products or even sunburn, then I highly recommend this product.  It will take the soreness away and you will feel very much better!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp all my life and I always use special shampoos and conditioners. I still found my scalp felt tight and itchy between washings. This leave in is wonderful! I use it after I wash my hair and whenever my scalp feels dry. It makes my scalp feel moisturized and refreshed. There&#x27;s no more dry. itchy feeling. The scent is lovely too. It&#x27;s like a body lotion but for your scalp.</li>
            <li> Had a bad bleach job done last tuesday that left my scalp feeling like it had been sunburned. It was very dry and flaky and awful--but this product reduced the tightness immediately upon application. Easy to use, smells nice. Does exactly what it claims to do. All tingly and moisturizey.</li>
            <li> It does not make any flakes go away, in fact they get A LOT worse after using as recommended.  Maybe for an hour, the product allows you to \\&quot;control\\&quot; the flaking.  I&#x27;m SURE there are better products or better ways of doing this.    The product contains Ether and Salicylic Acid.  My opinion is that these two ingredients are the products downfall.  Both drying and irritating, these may actually tear up the \\&quot;good\\&quot; skin cells that are left on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application&lt;br /&gt;- No need to rinse&lt;br /&gt;- Very light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Have to separate hair to put directly onto skin&lt;br /&gt;- Amount dispersed varies greatly&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product, it reduced scalp itching I was experiencing, although it didn&#x27;t eliminate it completely. However, if I come across something else, I will try that product to see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandma and she loves it</li>
            <li> Worked well for my grandson and fast service.</li>
            <li> This product feels soothing and smells nice, but I don&#x27;t think it really helped much. I have problems with dryness and scales at my hairline and temples. It cools and soothes these areas, but didn&#x27;t significantly reduce the flakes. If too much is applied, my hair looks greasy, so I only use it at betime if I will be washing my hair the next day. I won&#x27;t buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I suffer from itchy and tight scalp that worsens during the winter. I bought this product  based on it&#x27;s claims, it&#x27;s ingredients and mostly the amazon reviews. I found it at Sally&#x27;s first but since I had never heard of it I amazoned it for it&#x27;s reviews.  ( Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews both negative and positive:) This stuff was instant relief.  The salicylic acid burned a bit but that&#x27;s how I knew it was working nothing dramatic though. I liked the fact that it wasn&#x27;t pepper-minty, minty, or tee tree but it cooled without the overwhelming smell and irritating burn I find these ingredients to have; however, it moisturized and soothed in one step and I had no more tight, itchy scalp.  I would definitely recommend to try this product it offers great results for the right price. If you happen to not like it simply return and try something else.</li>
            <li> Solved 5 year dry scalp problem overnight!  Menopause brings on many wild and crusty skin/hair issues that can be relieved by this great product.</li>
            <li> I like this for the dry scalp patches I get occasionally but a bit to oily feeling.  I use it at night only &amp; wash my hair in the morning. I decided to try it after reading the great reviews,</li>
            <li> Suffered from an itchy scalp for many months. Couldn&#x27;t find a product that worked until I randomly found this product. Works great! Super easy to use (put on after I wash my hair) and a little goes a long way. I do not have dandruff - just itchy scalp. Many other products are for dandruff so it made my hair oily. This product did not do that. Provided much needed itch relief.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Helps ease the tightness and itchiness i get at the hairline of my scalp. Use sparingly or you will get buildup! Great to use right after the shower and your pores are still open.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a lot of products to address my dry scalp issue. I thought it was dandruff at first, so I tried using anti dandruff products. It turned out that my issue was dry scalp and this product is what ultimately got rid of the flakes that infuriates me beyond words! Love it!</li>
            <li> It really helped me with the dryness of my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product works great in relieving itchy scalp and does not weigh hair down like other products. Very cool and soothing to the scalp with not oder. I have colored my hair for years and just recently I have developed an allergy to color making my scalp incredibly itchy, this stopped the itching immediately and actually gave my hair a little bit of a wave to it. Love this product and will be ordering a backup bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I don&#x27;t really have dandruff, just an ITCHY head that seemed to have no cure. This does the trick! Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great scent and fast working. I apply this to problem spots where my scalp eczema appear whenever I&#x27;m under stress. The nozzle makes application easy. Thanks, L&#x27;oreal!</li>
            <li> I have chronic itchy scalp even thought theres No dandruff but this stuff helped tone it down to a managable itch.</li>
            <li> It did the complete opposite of what it was supposed to do, it increased flakes and itchiness . Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Works well - don&#x27;t use a lot of it in my hair at once but just the middle part where I&#x27;ve seen flaking. I&#x27;ve certainly seen a lot less of it since I started using this product. My only thought is that if you have a really bad problem with flaking/dandruff, you should get a strong shampoo to deal with it rather than using a little serum.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as it did relieve my scalp itch.  Anyone who suffers from scalp itch should try this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Scalp relief works fine. I wish the nozzle wasn&#x27;t as wide the opening.</li>
            <li> I bought this planning on using it on a particularly bad spot of Psoriasis on my scalp.  It does seem to help, but the messiness outweighs the usefulness of this product to some degree.  I use it directly out of the shower before bed and always shower in the morning.  I can&#x27;t imagine leaving it in during the day since it has such a powerful fragrence and ends up matting the hair after it dries.  I&#x27;m still undecided on whether or not I&#x27;ll buy again since the price of this product is so low.</li>
            <li> Good stuff -- it actually does relieve the terrible itch of seborrhea, which I can&#x27;t say about other products. It&#x27;s not cheap but you don&#x27;t need much to relief the itch.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cold., so it seems soothing at first. But the relief doesn&#x27;t last.  You have to apply it everyday. Probably not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Judging by the price, I assumed I was getting a full-size (12-ounce) bottle. Surprise!  It&#x27;s only 4 ounces.  I paid full price and got 1/3 the value I was expecting. Try another vendor; I&#x27;m surprised Amazon does business with this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, gives you a cooling sensation on the scalp, and is never greasy or goopy or noticeable.  You can leave it in overnight, throughout the day--no big deal.  The best part about this product--besides the heavenly smell--is its effectiveness.  Within days I saw big improvement.  Flaking lessened.  Irritated red areas looked normal again.  My scalp did not itch or feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Scalp Relief.  Small bottle you can take anywhere.  It actually works.  It smells great, so you can feel comfortable having it in your hair at work or out on a date or during your favorite psychedelic rave--whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; with this product, but a GIANT IMPROVEMENT.  Which leads me to believe this stuff is worth using for the long term.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy Scalp Relief treatment is very good for relieving itching and moisturizing the scalp. Just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> smells good but no itch relief at all, waste of money.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT ... stops the itch and yet doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy etc.  In fact, after it&lt;br /&gt;soaks in you can&#x27;t even telly you used it other than your scalp isn&#x27;t driy anymore and&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something to relieve my scalp itch.  I got several types from L&#x27;Oreal and they work great.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  It don\\&quot;t feel greasy like some products.  My hair looks shiny and it&#x27;s easy to manage with this product. No more itchy scalp.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO HELP ITCHY SCALP.</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment above is an excellent product.  You can feel the relief as soon as it is applied and you do not have to wash it out.  I shall purchase this product again in the future.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me,made my hair greasy and still itchy. So need to find something else. (it smells good)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Whenever I have a seborrhea flare-up, this provides soothing comfort. I have fine hair that tends to be oily, this does not make it worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great for me. Had tight, itchy scalp and female hair loss for years. I went to several dermatologists and my family doctor who all shrugged and said &amp;#34;sorry, you&#x27;ve got female pattern hair loss, nothing you can do&amp;#34;. Stumbled upon this on Amazon while searching for &amp;#34;scalp lotion&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s changed everything for me. Turns out I must have been stressing my scalp with the heat of my blow dryer or something. I started using this every night before I go to bed and I now have a healthy head of hair. It feels great and cooling when I apply it at the top of my scalp right in the middle and then rub it into my scalp a bit.</li>
            <li> I have a very inflamed scalp and was hoping, based on other reviews, this product would help relieve the discomfort and redness. (I don&#x27;t have dandruff and my prescribed meds also haven&#x27;t helped much.)&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good and feels good when applied but doesn&#x27;t have the longer term (day-long) benefit I hoped for. I&#x27;m still using other products trying to manage my symptoms throughout the day. This product, unlike other lotions, doesn&#x27;t appear to have any alcohol in it because it stays wet on your scalp for awhile. Not a huge deal but it surprised me in the beginning.  I may still keep using, not sure at this point.</li>
            <li> everytime i braid my hair it itches like crazy. Ordered scalpicin and this was a suggested purchase it worked really well to soothe the itches and kept my scalp from being dry during the day</li>
            <li> Works great! My scalp had been itching and driving me crazy for days. The first time I used this it stopped almost completely.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this product but it didnt work for me. I thought it would be a relief for my scalp but it was the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> ....but doesn&#x27;t really do very much for me! I&#x27;d prefer more of a tingle....Pricey on Amazon, too, considering it&#x27;s such a small bottle!!</li>
            <li> After only one week of 2x a day application my daughter stopped scratching her scalp and it is actually healing. A week ago she had a dime sized scap on her head and I didn&#x27;t know what else to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only warning is that it says it has tamanu oil which I read elsewhere is actually from a nut, so if you have nut allergies beware. Luckily my daughter did not have any reactions despite her nut allergies, because it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Did not help with my itchy seborrhea scaly scalp.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. It actually causes itch! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works great and really relieves my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> It works really well the first few times you use it, especially if you have short, trimmed hair.  But if your hair is longer, it doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s way to the scalp.  Also, after the first few times you use it, you get used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as soothing as when you first used it.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that gets pretty frizzy when I get out of the shower. I towel dry my hair and apply this stuff and work it into my hair and scalp and magically gets rid of my frizz and my makes my hair nice and soft and look healthier. I put a generous amount in my hair more than the 3 drops it asks for and after working it in to my scalp and the rest of my hair it like instantly turns my bad hair day into a good one! I&#x27;ve also have had a dry, irritated, and itchy scalp for years now and after using this product for a short period of time my scalp feels so much nicer and It barely itches anymore! I love this product. It&#x27;s a life saver for my hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was hopeful that it would work as well for me as it has for others.  Unfortunately, the product is average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good size, but it seemed to take a lot to cause itch relief to my scalp compared to other products (scalpicin, etc).  This is likely due to lack of hydrocortizone.  So I&#x27;m using a much more product than expected, given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-relieves scalp itchiness&lt;br /&gt;-slight cooling sensation when massaged into scalp&lt;br /&gt;-nice neutral scent (not to feminine of a smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-take much more product to relieve itchiness compared to other products&lt;br /&gt;-lacks active ingredients found in other stronger products&lt;br /&gt;-not quite as effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very sensitive scalp since childhood. Every so often, my scalp gets very dry and sore. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists, tried every product, every dandruff shampoo -- but nothing seems to work. I picked this up, and within a few hours I could tell the difference. The soreness and dry scalp literally vanished. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I would strongly suggest this product for anyone dealing with dry, sore scalp.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Smells great. Soothes dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have previously used it and it relieved my dry scalp issue in no time.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product before and liked it.  So I ordered what I thought was the same product but apparently in the interim, which I believe was only a few months, the manufacturer changed the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I originally ordered was by L&#x27;Oreal under the brand name Nature&#x27;s Therapy and was referred to as &amp;#34;Scalp Relief Leave-In Tonic&amp;#34;.  The picture of the container from which I ordered was the same container I had previously ordered with a green bottle and green cap (I believe the same container pictured above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received was by L&#x27;Oreal unde the brand name &amp;#34;Nature&#x27;s Therapy and was described as &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp Relief Leave-In Treatment&amp;#34; (a difference I noted only in writing this note and after searching for differences).  The product I received also had an orange cap and the bottle was more translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After attempting to compare the labeling on the container of the product I purchased earllier to the labeling on the container of the product I just received, the only difference that I find is that this new product does not contain the words &amp;#34;Tamanu Oil&amp;#34; on the front of the container and a few other French language descriptive phrases.  I have tried to compare the ingredients on the rear of the container but they appear to be somewhat different or at least listed in a different order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new revised product is thinner and has a different smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not trust another L&#x27;Oreal product. I will not trust Amazon to provide me the same product on any subsequent reorder.  This is on the order of bait and switch</li>
            <li> Just Got it. Very bad smell. I usually don&#x27;t complain about the smell of products but this is weird. I&#x27;ve put it in my hair to see how it works, guess we will see.the bottle was also very dirty on the outside, what&#x27;s up with that?! I&#x27;ll update soon</li>
