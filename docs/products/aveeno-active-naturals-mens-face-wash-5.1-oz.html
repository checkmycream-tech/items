            <li>Loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno&#x27;s Face Wash is a great product for anyone who desires a silky smooth face.</li>
            <li>My face remains 10 times more free of shaving bumps of any kind!</li>
            <li>as a gift, my husband love this product...</li>
            <li>I also was impressed by how much actually comes in the tube, so you get both quality and quantity with this face wash.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I did look on the internet but was to overwhelming</li>
            <li>Nice light almond scents.</li>
            <li>and it worked like magic ever since.</li>
            <li>The men at my house love this product.</li>
            <li>He used to be a bar of soap kind of guy, whatever was cheap and easy; but now he is asking that I make sure we have this stocked in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and oatmeal-y (mmm, breakfast in the shower) and feels good against the face, not to abrasive or too soft.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much that he requested that I purchase him more.</li>
            <li>I love the way his face feels, it&#x27;s so smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>I am a true satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mild, non-drying, no awful smells.</li>
            <li>I shave with a razor on my face, so it also helps with a smooth save.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out, I love their lotion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The fact that its fragrance free is a plus.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and it great for keeping my skin fresh and clean without irritation.</li>
            <li>the one i normally use is better, even though it&#x27;s more pricey.</li>
            <li>and it was rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many higher end products (Kiehl&#x27;s etc.)</li>
            <li>and my pores were clean from the microbeads</li>
            <li>As opposed to bar soap, this men&#x27;s face wash goes on cool and moisturizes my skin as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I love the way this face felt; soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave and afterwards my skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The skin-feel is cool and soothing with just the right amount of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>and you feel and see a fresh face after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>the skin has a fresh smell,  do not leave a oil film on his skin</li>
            <li>This Aveeno&#x27;s product has really refreshed my face and provides a fresh, clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>I use in in the shower right before I shave</li>
            <li>As it is, there isn&#x27;t that nice clean feeling that I get after I&#x27;ve used some other face washes.</li>
            <li>Price was amazing for such a large tube.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite facial products on the market.</li>
            <li>I got my first one from Target</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free so no scent allergies on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This men&#x27;s face wash really is completely fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is the scrubbing bits that make this better than the rest, but the overall ingredients and mixture of ingredients that make this face wash</li>
            <li>The rich texture of the soap really conveys the high quality of its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually feel the exfoliation, and after rinsing away the wash, my face feels moist, cool, and definitely clean.</li>
            <li>It is not as gritty as the others, but there are scrubbing bits in the product, but ever so fine.  </li>
            <li>I use this face wash 2x per day and really like it...</li>
            <li>This face wash is very unobtrusive in smell, texture, what have you.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a mild face cleaner for dry skin types, would like to see it clean a little better.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what it is, but the Aveeno Face Wash works much better than other face scrubs I have used.  </li>
            <li>The smell in not to strong and it doesn&#x27;t clash with my wet shaving  products.</li>
            <li>I ordered too more few days ago.</li>
            <li>this is all new to me.</li>
            <li>Because his face is very sensitive he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about his skin getting irritated.</li>
            <li>This is not usually on grocery shelves.</li>
            <li>After each use my face feels fresh and conditioned (even in dry weather).  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, especially how it makes his face feel and look after using it.</li>
            <li>As a young man with acne.</li>
            <li>The cleansing feeling remains soft and moist throughout the scrubbing</li>
            <li>and far prefer Aveeno.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not even a dollar more than the other men&#x27;s scrubs out there and well worth the few extra pennies.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates and leaves my skin so much smoother than other products that I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s disappointing because the other products in the Aveeno Men&#x27;s line smell great.</li>
            <li>This i thought was pretty much a waste of my money.</li>

            <li> This i thought was pretty much a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad but not great either.</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno&#x27;s Daily Moisturizing Lotion because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only facewash that doesn&#x27;t make me break out badly or dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> I no longer experience dry razor burn.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the Aveeno® Active Naturals® Men&#x27;s(tm)</li>
            <li> I think after you use it just once, you will not go back to your previous face scrubs.</li>
            <li> and it seams to help prep my face for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Although it could be a bit too rough for some people.</li>
            <li> The tiny grains help scrub off dead flakes or other junks.</li>
            <li> I now prefer it over the other options for face wash, including other Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard and shaving after using this product has never been so close.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to go down Walmart to look at what they have.</li>
            <li> I wash my face everyday because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> and he loves it - not too harsh and cleans well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not huge on cosmetics but picked this up for some acne problems that had cropped up for me.</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s a logger and gets pretty dirty!)</li>
            <li> and I mean.. lots of products over the years for my face but its either too harsh and drying or too oily but</li>
            <li> It has a creamy texture, so probably not good as a aftershave.</li>
            <li> It made shaving less painful.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face dealing hydrated without that nasty oil touch</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have tried several facial cleansers for my shave and I have no idea why, but this one works head and shoulders above the rest! My face remains 10 times more free of shaving bumps of any kind! I am a true satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must be the oats!</li>
            <li> as a gift, my husband love this product...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone. He absolutely loves it, especially how it makes his face feel and look after using it. After he used it a couple of times, I noticed a difference in his face.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with my experience with this face wash.  It exfoliates and leaves my skin so much smoother than other products that I have used.  After each use my face feels fresh and conditioned (even in dry weather).  The rich texture of the soap really conveys the high quality of its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also was impressed by how much actually comes in the tube, so you get both quality and quantity with this face wash.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite facial products on the market. It leaves my face dealing hydrated without that nasty oil touch</li>
            <li> Bought this face wash for my husband.  Loved the results.  He felt it made it face cleaner and smoother.  It made shaving less painful.  I love the way this face felt; soft and smooth.  His facial hair was even softer!  Price was amazing for such a large tube.  I stole a bit for my face as well and my pores were clean from the microbeads and it was rich and creamy.  Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> This i thought was pretty much a waste of my money. i didn&#x27;t feel anything different. the one i normally use is better, even though it&#x27;s more pricey.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has never gotten such a close shave. His skin is not only glowing from the micro-exfoliants, but it is probably softer than mine?! He used to be a bar of soap kind of guy, whatever was cheap and easy; but now he is asking that I make sure we have this stocked in our bathroom. This face wash has made it&#x27;s way into our regular routine.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I have very sensitive skin and it great for keeping my skin fresh and clean without irritation. I shave with a razor on my face, so it also helps with a smooth save. Love this product.</li>
            <li> As a young man with acne. I have used lots of products and I mean.. lots of products over the years for my face but its either too harsh and drying or too oily but the is just perfect and it has a feeling like you can feel it go under your skin and you feel and see a fresh face after you wash it off. Its beautiful - I think I have found the ONE. I ordered too more few days ago.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash 2x per day and really like it... in the morning before shaving and end of day.  I now prefer it over the other options for face wash, including other Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I just started getting into &amp;#34;Wet Shaving&amp;#34; and was looking for a face wash/scrub to prep my face. So I decided to go down Walmart to look at what they have. I did look on the internet but was to overwhelming so I thought just go and see. I use Aveeno&#x27;s Daily Moisturizing Lotion because I have dry skin. So I thought why not try the face wash. This is before I read all the reviews and didn&#x27;t even think about looking into Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never tried face wash/scrubs before so this is all new to me. I like it. I wash my face everyday because I have oily skin and it seams to help prep my face for wet shaving. The smell in not to strong and it doesn&#x27;t clash with my wet shaving  products. Just as an after-thought, I wanted to read the reviews and see what they have to say about it... Now I know and will be getting it from here.</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliating sensation I get from this facewash. Definitely worth trying out, I love their lotion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This face wash is very unobtrusive in smell, texture, what have you. I would prefer if it lathered a bit or had a touch of menthol. As it is, there isn&#x27;t that nice clean feeling that I get after I&#x27;ve used some other face washes.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno&#x27;s product has really refreshed my face and provides a fresh, clean feeling after using it. As opposed to bar soap, this men&#x27;s face wash goes on cool and moisturizes my skin as soon as it&#x27;s applied. The cleansing feeling remains soft and moist throughout the scrubbing so I never feel like it&#x27;s drying on my skin. I actually feel the exfoliation, and after rinsing away the wash, my face feels moist, cool, and definitely clean. It helps my face feel moist and easier for me to shave after using the wash. I no longer experience dry razor burn. I would definitely recommend this face wash as a simple option that doesn&#x27;t require a lot of time nor is it price prohibitive.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue. It&#x27;s disappointing because the other products in the Aveeno Men&#x27;s line smell great. Nice light almond scents. Not this one though. Definitely will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliating face wash.</li>
            <li> The only facewash that doesn&#x27;t make me break out badly or dry out my face.  It has a creamy texture, so probably not good as a aftershave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage with this.</li>
            <li> best face wash ever for men or women</li>
            <li> This is not usually on grocery shelves. I got my first one from Target and it worked like magic ever since. It&#x27;s fragrance free so no scent allergies on sensitive skin. The tiny grains help scrub off dead flakes or other junks. Although it could be a bit too rough for some people.</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s face wash for the money--mild, non-drying, no awful smells. I&#x27;ve tried many higher end products (Kiehl&#x27;s etc.) and far prefer Aveeno.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this face wash for almost a year now and he loves it - not too harsh and cleans well (he&#x27;s a logger and gets pretty dirty!) you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price. The only thing I wish was different was the smell, it&#x27;s not bad but not great either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to my husband  exfoliate,  doesn&#x27;t scratch the skin has a fresh smell,  do not leave a oil film on his skin</li>
            <li> Aveeno&#x27;s Face Wash is a great product for anyone who desires a silky smooth face. I&#x27;m usually not huge on cosmetics but picked this up for some acne problems that had cropped up for me. It smells nice and oatmeal-y (mmm, breakfast in the shower) and feels good against the face, not to abrasive or too soft. I use in in the shower right before I shave and it GREATLY improves my result as well as clearing up my skin. I get a better shave and afterwards my skin feels smooth and soft. Also reduced the number of blackheads on my nose. Overall a great product that&#x27;s reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes you buy a product that says &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but when you open it, it smells flowery or fruity and the ingredients list one or two fragrance ingredients?  This isn&#x27;t that!  This men&#x27;s face wash really is completely fragrance free.  The skin-feel is cool and soothing with just the right amount of exfoliation.  The men at my house love this product.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a mild face cleaner for dry skin types, would like to see it clean a little better.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the Aveeno® Active Naturals® Men&#x27;s(tm) Face Wash For someone as a gift. He loved it so much that he requested that I purchase him more. He loves the way it soothes his skin. He enjoys the soothing oat that helps moisturizes his skin. I love the way his face feels, it&#x27;s so smooth to touch. The fact that its fragrance free is a plus. Because his face is very sensitive he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about his skin getting irritated.</li>
            <li> Before I use it, I assumed that it has already been opened. The tag inside was teared up. When I returned it by UPS, I did not have a box. So, I keep it and use it now. But I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what it is, but the Aveeno Face Wash works much better than other face scrubs I have used.  It is not as gritty as the others, but there are scrubbing bits in the product, but ever so fine.  I don&#x27;t think it is the scrubbing bits that make this better than the rest, but the overall ingredients and mixture of ingredients that make this face wash work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not even a dollar more than the other men&#x27;s scrubs out there and well worth the few extra pennies. I have an average beard and shaving after using this product has never been so close.  I think after you use it just once, you will not go back to your previous face scrubs.</li>
