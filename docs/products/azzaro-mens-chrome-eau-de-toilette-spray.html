            <li>The scent is very light</li>
            <li>And the smell is pleasant but almost &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;, nothing distinct about the smell.  </li>

            <li>i really like it, you guys did a great job, thanks a lot for make cool stuffs, keep the good work</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>He has had this before and loved it, and this was so much simpler than going to a department store that time of year..</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li>Keep the good job and thanks</li>
            <li>The scent is not that strong like others, but if used enough it can smell real nice.</li>
            <li>This scent projects strongly as well.</li>
            <li>It is a strong scent though, even through the wash.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great men smells not to strong and not too wimp.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably in a minority here as these days &amp;#34;Fresh Aquatic&amp;#34; scents like Chrome tend to be more popular than &amp;#34;Aromatic Woody&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Fougere&amp;#34;) scents like the original Azzaro for Men.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean fresh scent that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the fast delivery of this great product.</li>
            <li>and i have had the most positive comments on this cologne a nice sweet smell not muscky at all</li>
            <li>The best smelling cologne I use, have used in the past and tried Chrome Sport decided to return to this instead of Sport, smells much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites perfumes, smooth but strongly manly fragance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Chrome as it is a very rewarding scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge at 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li>So it is a Huge bargain buying it on here.</li>
            <li>Does not seem genuine.</li>
            <li>Great smelling Cologne for the a low price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>He smells absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>A very clean and fresh scent, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable (and even more so here than in a department store).</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>compared to my original one.</li>
            <li>To quote their website &amp;#34;What&#x27;s unique about this fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I turn into George Clooney when I wear this stuff.</li>
            <li>this Arrived on time in the original box.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent but not too overpowering!</li>
            <li>If you want a mild odor and does not disturb more, this perfume is right for you.</li>
            <li>smells clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of CK One but not as sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>overall a good purchase</li>
            <li>Arrived in a reasonable time and was packaged safely.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband because frankly no man should be wearing that Ax/Tag Stuff, its inexpensive and shipping was quick classic scent not too offensive unless you drown yourself in it, and still able to smell it after couple hours.</li>
            <li>Chrome is a light crisp sent that will adjust to anbodysw body chemistry, it has the smell of glory  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Pretty good not the same that I had before</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was fairly cheap and came fast</li>
            <li>However, for the price, this makes for a great everyday spray.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I deviated from my normal three colognes and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Product arrived safely and complete.</li>
            <li>It was nice big size as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I buy now.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Azzaro for Men has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Classy smell without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>i love the smell not to loud</li>
            <li>Birthday Gift for my 11 year old grand son.  </li>
            <li>Not unhappy with it, just wish it stayed longer.</li>
            <li>Read reviews here that were very positive.</li>
            <li>Most will probably like this a lot, its just that I personally turned out to prefer the original.</li>
            <li>I received my cologne today and I tried it on right away while I was in the office.</li>
            <li>Great, powerful (but not overwhelming) scent.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it and is most likely to become a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>It goes a long way, one spritz its all you need or its very strong.</li>
            <li>great long lasting scent</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It looks and smells exactly like the one at Macy&#x27;s for triple the price.</li>
            <li>my dad has used this perfume forever and this is the first time i bought it online for mi.</li>
            <li>For that same reason, Chrome is also probably a pretty safe bet as a gift.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sizable collection of smell bottles, and nothing on my shelf comes close.</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Delivery was carried out on time and exactly with the promise of conditions.</li>
            <li>But this is a fragrance spray and doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>It is a good everyday scent</li>
            <li>My son had previously bought this spray and he loved it so much that I bought him some as well</li>
            <li>So to me, I&#x27;d say anyone who likes Cool Water or is thinking about trying Cool Water should definitely give Azzaro Chrome a try instead.</li>
            <li>This a great starting point if you are curious about modern &amp;#34;Aquatic&amp;#34; men&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li>Good and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very masculine, powerful, and seductive.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to apply a large amount.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The order arrived sooner than expected and more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>It has a very manly citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li>Been using this for 2 years being that I&#x27;m 16 I&#x27;ve learned it attracts the ladies very recommended for anyone</li>
            <li>Really like this and bought it for my bf who loves this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>like I was getting ready for a Friday night out with the cast of Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li>Some will really appreciate this, but some also won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>what it was, I was not broken.</li>
            <li>This one was the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely lovey.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item as described.  </li>
            <li>Taking a chance sight unseen worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very much appreciated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s has light scent,long lasting and</li>
            <li>i bought this for my husband who normally wears kenneth cole black or yves saint laurent, and he actually really liked this as well</li>
            <li>Smells great but the smell wouldn&#x27;t last as long as when I bought the same one at a department store.</li>
            <li>I have since gotten more into fragrances and by other standards, it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of praise.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t bother listing individual scent notes that either I think I can smell or that Azzaro says are there because I can&#x27;t distinguish them individually, and you probably won&#x27;t be able to either.</li>
            <li>I started using this back in high school and still love it to this day 10 years later.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it , highly recommend 👌</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a highly recommended scent</li>
            <li>I would  high recommend it.</li>
            <li>very clean smelling and the smell will last several hours.</li>
            <li>Still has a strong scent idk what the other review was talking about ..  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to move into the world of adult scents and leave the Axe/ Adidas brands if middle/high school behind, but aren&#x27;t ready to drop the coin on the more expensive varieties available, then this may be a good compromise option.</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last long as original one !</li>
            <li>but really, it&#x27;s a feel good scent that can be worn casual or formal aaannnnddd you can work in it (manual labor) and still catch compliments.</li>
            <li>Not musky, but has a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Its slightly more expensive but much better in the same category imo.</li>
            <li>First of all, i have what i wanted, same as described.&lt;br /&gt;i like this fragrance because is a soft fragrance i can use.</li>
            <li>The ladies will love it, and it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I will not go as far as to say it is a knockoff, however.</li>
            <li>the smell don&#x27;t last more than few hours it must be diluted ,i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the sent but not as much as similar scents from other companies.</li>
            <li>all the ladies love this serious.</li>
            <li>long lasting fresh scent..</li>
            <li>and it last&#x27;s a long long time enjoy</li>
            <li>Not to mention that received a small face cleanser for free.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what we expected and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many Azzaro Chrome Eau de toilette colognes from many other vendors, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve found is a fake.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper in price than many other big name colognes or eau de toilette sprays, but the quality us less as well.</li>
            <li>Finally got to replace his old cologne.  </li>
            <li>Once applied, the fragrance did not last long at all as opposed to the fragrances that I purchased and were shipped directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>A little overbearing, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great scent and has been my go-to scent since first</li>
            <li> The scent is very light</li>
            <li> And the smell is pleasant but almost &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;, nothing distinct about the smell.  </li>
            <li> Chrome is my favorite cologne</li>

            <li> Very clean smelling cologne..</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and boxed up nice just like retail.</li>
            <li> Very soft but rich in sent, superior!</li>
            <li> Smells like soap in a good way and whoever wears it feels fresh showered and clean.  </li>
            <li> i really like it, you guys did a great job, thanks a lot for make cool stuffs, keep the good work</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> He has had this before and loved it, and this was so much simpler than going to a department store that time of year..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> Keep the good job and thanks</li>
            <li> The scent is not that strong like others, but if used enough it can smell real nice.</li>
            <li> This scent projects strongly as well.</li>
            <li> It is a strong scent though, even through the wash.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great men smells not to strong and not too wimp.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably in a minority here as these days &amp;#34;Fresh Aquatic&amp;#34; scents like Chrome tend to be more popular than &amp;#34;Aromatic Woody&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Fougere&amp;#34;) scents like the original Azzaro for Men.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean fresh scent that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the fast delivery of this great product.</li>
            <li> and i have had the most positive comments on this cologne a nice sweet smell not muscky at all</li>
            <li> The best smelling cologne I use, have used in the past and tried Chrome Sport decided to return to this instead of Sport, smells much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites perfumes, smooth but strongly manly fragance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Chrome as it is a very rewarding scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge at 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> So it is a Huge bargain buying it on here.</li>
            <li> Does not seem genuine.</li>
            <li> Great smelling Cologne for the a low price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> He smells absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> A very clean and fresh scent, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable (and even more so here than in a department store).</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> compared to my original one.</li>
            <li> To quote their website &amp;#34;What&#x27;s unique about this fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I turn into George Clooney when I wear this stuff.</li>
            <li> this Arrived on time in the original box.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent but not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> If you want a mild odor and does not disturb more, this perfume is right for you.</li>
            <li> smells clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly strong and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of CK One but not as sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> Arrived in a reasonable time and was packaged safely.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband because frankly no man should be wearing that Ax/Tag Stuff, its inexpensive and shipping was quick classic scent not too offensive unless you drown yourself in it, and still able to smell it after couple hours.</li>
            <li> Chrome is a light crisp sent that will adjust to anbodysw body chemistry, it has the smell of glory  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Pretty good not the same that I had before</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was fairly cheap and came fast</li>
            <li> However, for the price, this makes for a great everyday spray.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I deviated from my normal three colognes and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Product arrived safely and complete.</li>
            <li> It was nice big size as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind I buy now.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Azzaro for Men has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Classy smell without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> i love the smell not to loud</li>
            <li> Birthday Gift for my 11 year old grand son.  </li>
            <li> Not unhappy with it, just wish it stayed longer.</li>
            <li> Read reviews here that were very positive.</li>
            <li> Most will probably like this a lot, its just that I personally turned out to prefer the original.</li>
            <li> I received my cologne today and I tried it on right away while I was in the office.</li>
            <li> Great, powerful (but not overwhelming) scent.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it and is most likely to become a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, one spritz its all you need or its very strong.</li>
            <li> great long lasting scent</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells exactly like the one at Macy&#x27;s for triple the price.</li>
            <li> my dad has used this perfume forever and this is the first time i bought it online for mi.</li>
            <li> For that same reason, Chrome is also probably a pretty safe bet as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sizable collection of smell bottles, and nothing on my shelf comes close.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Delivery was carried out on time and exactly with the promise of conditions.</li>
            <li> But this is a fragrance spray and doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> It is a good everyday scent</li>
            <li> My son had previously bought this spray and he loved it so much that I bought him some as well</li>
            <li> So to me, I&#x27;d say anyone who likes Cool Water or is thinking about trying Cool Water should definitely give Azzaro Chrome a try instead.</li>
            <li> This a great starting point if you are curious about modern &amp;#34;Aquatic&amp;#34; men&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li> Good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very masculine, powerful, and seductive.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to apply a large amount.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The order arrived sooner than expected and more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> It has a very manly citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 years being that I&#x27;m 16 I&#x27;ve learned it attracts the ladies very recommended for anyone</li>
            <li> Really like this and bought it for my bf who loves this</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> like I was getting ready for a Friday night out with the cast of Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li> Some will really appreciate this, but some also won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> what it was, I was not broken.</li>
            <li> This one was the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely lovey.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described.  </li>
            <li> Taking a chance sight unseen worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s has light scent,long lasting and</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband who normally wears kenneth cole black or yves saint laurent, and he actually really liked this as well</li>
            <li> Smells great but the smell wouldn&#x27;t last as long as when I bought the same one at a department store.</li>
            <li> I have since gotten more into fragrances and by other standards, it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of praise.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bother listing individual scent notes that either I think I can smell or that Azzaro says are there because I can&#x27;t distinguish them individually, and you probably won&#x27;t be able to either.</li>
            <li> I started using this back in high school and still love it to this day 10 years later.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it , highly recommend 👌</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a highly recommended scent</li>
            <li> I would  high recommend it.</li>
            <li> very clean smelling and the smell will last several hours.</li>
            <li> Still has a strong scent idk what the other review was talking about ..  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to move into the world of adult scents and leave the Axe/ Adidas brands if middle/high school behind, but aren&#x27;t ready to drop the coin on the more expensive varieties available, then this may be a good compromise option.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long as original one !</li>
            <li> but really, it&#x27;s a feel good scent that can be worn casual or formal aaannnnddd you can work in it (manual labor) and still catch compliments.</li>
            <li> Not musky, but has a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Its slightly more expensive but much better in the same category imo.</li>
            <li> First of all, i have what i wanted, same as described.&lt;br /&gt;i like this fragrance because is a soft fragrance i can use.</li>
            <li> The ladies will love it, and it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I will not go as far as to say it is a knockoff, however.</li>
            <li> the smell don&#x27;t last more than few hours it must be diluted ,i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the sent but not as much as similar scents from other companies.</li>
            <li> all the ladies love this serious.</li>
            <li> long lasting fresh scent..</li>
            <li> and it last&#x27;s a long long time enjoy</li>
            <li> Not to mention that received a small face cleanser for free.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what we expected and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many Azzaro Chrome Eau de toilette colognes from many other vendors, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve found is a fake.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper in price than many other big name colognes or eau de toilette sprays, but the quality us less as well.</li>
            <li> Finally got to replace his old cologne.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, the fragrance did not last long at all as opposed to the fragrances that I purchased and were shipped directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A little overbearing, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell, you don&#x27;t have to put alot on last a long time.definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Long lasting and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and it actually lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long at all and the box had bar codes and information removed or cut out from it.</li>
            <li> Had wanted to find a subtle fragance and that&#x27;s exactly what I experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, except the bottle is bigger</li>
            <li> Have been a user of this  product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Works well.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, it was too expensive at the department store and they only offered a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Came in a different bottle (Silver), I usually get it in  transparent one and can see the fluid.</li>
            <li> product recd on time and as expected</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always replaced once it&#x27;s empty and added on to my cologne collection.  </li>
            <li> Comparing apples to apples (eau de toilette to eau de toilette), this product is absolutely a fake, it smells nothing like the real eau de toilette product, it only lasts for a few minutes, and even the bottle sprayer is different from Azarro&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> People who state that the fragrance isn&#x27;t right have something wrong with their noses.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts my husband over a year because unlike women, men only use a spray or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they took 2 WEEKS for the other one to come, i had to email them a lot of times.</li>
            <li> I like this spray alot and at least for me it last all day with it.</li>
            <li> I dont know, not very secure about this product</li>
            <li> then I expected!!  </li>
            <li> This is probably fake the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> A word of warning, a little of this stuff goes a LOOOONNNGG way, so keep that in mind when you spray it.</li>
            <li> It is a little shifty getting cologne online sometimes.</li>
            <li> He can be picky and doesn&#x27;t like over powering heavy cologne.  </li>
            <li> Have bought it a few times now.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I try other cologne but not a year passes by without me buying at least one bottle of Chrome by Azzaro.  </li>
            <li> Its not strong at all</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday since Ive gotten it (neglecting my other poor colognes) and have gotten a few compliments as well.</li>
            <li> I useto cop a small bottle frm walmart</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> bad quality and service overall.</li>
            <li> I think its fake the writing on the bottle is missing.....</li>
            <li> Guys, definitely give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A very disappointed granddaughter and a waste of $ even at only $1.99.  </li>
            <li> what so ever not happy at all with this product</li>
            <li> Hey guys if you really confused about  which perfume you need to spray.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake from a company called OxKom.</li>
            <li> It was for my honey, he is crazy about and so am I.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> and my girlfriend goes crazy when she smell this scent on me.</li>
            <li> Still to expensive!</li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> I HATE THE SMELL!!</li>

            <li> Very soft but rich in sent, superior!</li>
            <li> Great product...Outstanding price!</li>
            <li> Best clean smelling cologne for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this fresh scent.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great smell and a great buy!</li>
            <li> Very masculine, powerful, and seductive.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites perfumes, smooth but strongly manly fragance. I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Wanna smell so good that women drive to your house and do your laundry for free?! Me too!! Buy this and that could happen!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it , highly recommend 👌</li>
            <li> Very good smell. This is the first time I deviated from my normal three colognes and I&#x27;m glad I did. I think it&#x27;s a very good spring/summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Awesome price for the product. I got double for my money.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands Favorite cologne. It has a very manly citrus scent to it. The bottle is huge at 3.4 oz. One bottle usually lasts my husband over a year because unlike women, men only use a spray or two.&lt;br /&gt;If you were to buy this same bottle in a department store your looking at $40-$50 for this size. So it is a Huge bargain buying it on here.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  The price was great, so much more in stores.  It was for my honey, he is crazy about and so am I.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 years being that I&#x27;m 16 I&#x27;ve learned it attracts the ladies very recommended for anyone</li>
            <li> good pricing, my son love it very happy with the order fast delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, it smells amazing!! the price was great and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell, you don&#x27;t have to put alot on last a long time.definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> We already knew what it smelled like and I love it.  It was exactly what we expected and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered. It looks and smells exactly like the one at Macy&#x27;s for triple the price. People who state that the fragrance isn&#x27;t right have something wrong with their noses. Thank you very much for the fast delivery of this great product. Cheers!</li>
            <li> My hubby loved Chrome.  He can be picky and doesn&#x27;t like over powering heavy cologne.  This one was a hit!</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne.  Price much better than department stores.</li>
            <li> I think its fake the writing on the bottle is missing.....compared to my original one. Its not strong at all</li>
            <li> Good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Pretty good not the same that I had before but I like it</li>
            <li> My GF loves this stuff on me!</li>
            <li> I useto cop a small bottle frm walmart but this time amazon hooked me up wit a bigger bottle for tha price frm walmart.</li>
            <li> product recd on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, it was too expensive at the department store and they only offered a small bottle.  This is a great price for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected. I received it within three days. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> Product arrived safely and complete. I like this spray alot and at least for me it last all day with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cologne I  ever purchased. I recommend it for any occasion</li>
            <li> Got it for an anniversary and he loved it!!! It was nice big size as well.</li>
            <li> Really like this and bought it for my bf who loves this and it&#x27;s the real thing. Doesn&#x27;t fade at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing to this additional app.  Just changing the length of the nails. A very disappointed granddaughter and a waste of $ even at only $1.99.  Wish there was a way to return these things!</li>
            <li> i ordered two of this and only one came in the mail. they took 2 WEEKS for the other one to come, i had to email them a lot of times. then when i gifted this to my dad, this didnt smell at all! my dad has used this perfume forever and this is the first time i bought it online for mi. it doesnt smell at all. bad quality and service overall.</li>
            <li> This a great starting point if you are curious about modern &amp;#34;Aquatic&amp;#34; men&#x27;s scents. Azzaro Chrome is definitely &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, and its definitely not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  The price is also very reasonable (and even more so here than in a department store). A word of warning, a little of this stuff goes a LOOOONNNGG way, so keep that in mind when you spray it. Even a sample size bottle might last a person for days. This scent projects strongly as well. How do I feel about it personally? I like how it smells in the bottle, but when I tried it on my skin... it was pleasant, but it just wasn&#x27;t me. I felt kind of like I was getting ready for a Friday night out with the cast of Jersey Shore. This isn&#x27;t necessarily what you&#x27;ll make everyone else think of you if you&#x27;re wearing Chrome, but its how I felt about myself. I won&#x27;t bother listing individual scent notes that either I think I can smell or that Azzaro says are there because I can&#x27;t distinguish them individually, and you probably won&#x27;t be able to either. To quote their website &amp;#34;What&#x27;s unique about this fragrance is in its linear composition, so how it smells when you apply it is how it will smell all day long&amp;#34;. Some will really appreciate this, but some also won&#x27;t. So to me, I&#x27;d say anyone who likes Cool Water or is thinking about trying Cool Water should definitely give Azzaro Chrome a try instead. Its slightly more expensive but much better in the same category imo. For that same reason, Chrome is also probably a pretty safe bet as a gift. Most will probably like this a lot, its just that I personally turned out to prefer the original. I&#x27;m probably in a minority here as these days &amp;#34;Fresh Aquatic&amp;#34; scents like Chrome tend to be more popular than &amp;#34;Aromatic Woody&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Fougere&amp;#34;) scents like the original Azzaro for Men.</li>
            <li> My husband loves chrome - he has received many compliments</li>
            <li> Like product. Not overbearing. Excellent service</li>
            <li> love the product, arrived on time, very pleased with purchase. Happy customer Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Had wanted to find a subtle fragance and that&#x27;s exactly what I experience with this product. Will definitely reorder in addition to Men&#x27;s Chrome After Shave Lotion. Amazon service, as always, excellent.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and he absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Great Price and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son, well it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than department store.  He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I received my cologne today and I tried it on right away while I was in the office. I honestly have to give it a 5 stars. Everyone around was complimenting the smell ..!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not enjoy as much. Thank goodness the price was low.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Cheaper than in dept. stores.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my hubby  and it smells so good on his skin...long lasting fresh scent..This is my 3rd purchase of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This package came seperate from all the others. I had purchased it for my husband. I left one morning and when I returned, he stated a package came from Amazon today. It might be one of Brookes things. (our grandbaby). Anyway, he had no idea what it was, I was not broken. He has had this before and loved it, and this was so much simpler than going to a department store that time of year..</li>
            <li> Smells great and it actually lasts a very long time. It was well worth it and is most likely to become a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It&#x27;s the only kind I buy now.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Chrome many times and it is part of my collection.  The scent is very light but you don&#x27;t need to apply a large amount. It is great for wearing in the office and throughout the day.  My wife loves it and several coworkers complimented me on its scent.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cologne to any guy out there. It has a nice clean fresh scent that is not overbearing. All the ladies will like it; never met one who doesn&#x27;t like the scent. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Step dad loves it ! Still has a strong scent idk what the other review was talking about ..  Came in three days!!</li>
            <li> No but really, it&#x27;s a feel good scent that can be worn casual or formal aaannnnddd you can work in it (manual labor) and still catch compliments.</li>
            <li> Great females love it</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Excellent product.  Will do business again in the future when needed.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great experience. No complaints</li>
            <li> Smell like a million dollars</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell!! Still to expensive! Very pleased with the fragrance</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband who normally wears kenneth cole black or yves saint laurent, and he actually really liked this as well</li>
            <li> It is awsome, smells good and I always get compliments on my good smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I will let my husband wear. Smells fresh but not over powering. Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Just ask described.</li>
            <li> Azzaro for Men has a fresh scent. I like this perfume and ladies love it, too. So, guys buy one.</li>
            <li> Purchased this toilette spray for my nephew. He loves it. Would definitely order it  again. He has received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper in price than many other big name colognes or eau de toilette sprays, but the quality us less as well. I enjoy the sent but not as much as similar scents from other companies. If you are looking to move into the world of adult scents and leave the Axe/ Adidas brands if middle/high school behind, but aren&#x27;t ready to drop the coin on the more expensive varieties available, then this may be a good compromise option.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whats going on with  cologne  purchase on amazon but the smell don&#x27;t last more than few hours it must be diluted ,i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband because frankly no man should be wearing that Ax/Tag Stuff, its inexpensive and shipping was quick classic scent not too offensive unless you drown yourself in it, and still able to smell it after couple hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I turn into George Clooney when I wear this stuff. I have a pretty sizable collection of smell bottles, and nothing on my shelf comes close. Except for maybe Vintage (John Varvatos)....nah, not even Vintage.</li>
            <li> Chrome is a light crisp sent that will adjust to anbodysw body chemistry, it has the smell of glory  the package arrived just when they said it would</li>
            <li> this Arrived on time in the original box. Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Coworker brought this in one day and I loved the way it smelled and smelled good on me, too. Reminds me of CK One but not as sweet smelling. Got it here for a good price. Shipping was quick and boxed up nice just like retail. It is a little shifty getting cologne online sometimes. This one was the real deal. Been using it everyday since Ive gotten it (neglecting my other poor colognes) and have gotten a few compliments as well.</li>
            <li> I started using this back in high school and still love it to this day 10 years later.  Sometimes I try other cologne but not a year passes by without me buying at least one bottle of Chrome by Azzaro.  It&#x27;s not overly strong and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son. He loves it and it smells great. Arrived on time and packaged correctly!</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad and he loves it.  It is a strong scent though, even through the wash.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  Have bought it a few times now.  It has a nice scent, without being overbearing!  My wife loves it!  Guys, definitely give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> thank you very much excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> My husband loves the fresh scent. My son had previously bought this spray and he loved it so much that I bought him some as well so he wouldn&#x27;t use up all of my son&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of my favorites. Classy smell without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was unfamiliar with this when I purchased it as a gift for my son. It is absolutely lovey. He loves, I love it, his girlfriend loves it! A light wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> i love the smell not to loud</li>
            <li> Birthday Gift for my 11 year old grand son.  He loves it and says everybody says that he smells good.</li>
            <li> The best smelling cologne I use, have used in the past and tried Chrome Sport decided to return to this instead of Sport, smells much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> been using chrome for 10 years and this bottle i got smells like water there&#x27;s no scent what so ever not happy at all with this product</li>
            <li> Much better product than anticipated!</li>
            <li> Amazing as always ! I have 2 teenage boys and they wont wear anything else ! It smells amazing !!!! Everyone always ask what they wear !!!! great price</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap price, and a great smell. I always get the most comments and compliments when using this one. The ladies will love it, and it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t. Have bought multiple times from Amazon, can&#x27;t ask for anymore.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and at a great price, love it</li>
            <li> great quality for the price. very clean smelling and the smell will last several hours.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I both love the smell of this cologne! It smells very fresh and clean. I would suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> smells clean. my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Fake! Smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes. Never buying it again if seller is listen as OxKom. Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Good product. My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great men smells not to strong and not too wimp.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for over a month and I am planning to get my next one before the current runs out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is good, is ideal for use during the day. If you want a mild odor and does not disturb more, this perfume is right for you.</li>
            <li> i really like it, you guys did a great job, thanks a lot for make cool stuffs, keep the good work</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He only needs two sprays and you can smell him outside of his car! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described.  It&#x27;s Chrome!!  Not much else to say, except the bottle is bigger then I expected!!  Will take a while to use this one up!!  I always try and buy under 3.5oz size as that is the max for carry on bags in the US on airlines.  3.5 oz of Chrome, seems huge!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Product came as anticipated. Purchased this without ever smelling the scent. Read reviews here that were very positive. Let me simply say that I now have three &amp;#34;go to scents&amp;#34;. Chrome, Dreamer and Jovan musk. Taking a chance sight unseen worked very well for me. I highly recommend Chrome as it is a very rewarding scent. My wife enjoys the scent so it works for me!</li>
            <li> Was a gift.  Very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely! A very clean and fresh scent, just like I wanted. The ladies are gonna love this</li>
            <li> Nice scent, good price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since it first came out. It&#x27;s always replaced once it&#x27;s empty and added on to my cologne collection.  My son is on his 2nd bottle and he&#x27;s only 15.</li>
            <li> I like the perfume but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Keep the good job and thanks</li>
            <li> This cologne is just ok. Does not seem genuine. Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long at all and the box had bar codes and information removed or cut out from it. Seemed like product was repacked/re-shrinkwrapped too.&lt;br /&gt;It was fairly cheap and came fast + it was packed well so 3 stars. I&#x27;m afraid I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long as original one ! I think it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> Great smell!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Great smelling Cologne for the a low price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling cologne..,Lasts about 7 to 8 hrs on me....It&#x27;s a highly recommended scent</li>
            <li> Not musky, but has a very masculine scent. Also not my favorite cologne, but better than most. Long lasting and inexpensive. A little overbearing, so don&#x27;t use too much. Suitable for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Thank you very very happy with my purchase and I advise all who have not yet bought obyazyaatelno buy. Delivery was carried out on time and exactly with the promise of conditions. Thank you.</li>
            <li> loved it. overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> Once applied, the fragrance did not last long at all as opposed to the fragrances that I purchased and were shipped directly from Amazon. I will not go as far as to say it is a knockoff, however.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the smell wouldn&#x27;t last as long as when I bought the same one at a department store.</li>
            <li> Very nice, very good fragrance! I recommend!</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my nephew for Christmas. It is one of my favorite men&#x27;s colognes. I would  high recommend it. Love anything from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> Well according to the characteristics ...</li>
            <li> Worked out just great, I&#x27;m going to order another one, thank you</li>
            <li> Arrived in a reasonable time and was packaged safely. Love the scent, good summerie scent</li>
            <li> My son does like this cologne.</li>
            <li> Came in a different bottle (Silver), I usually get it in  transparent one and can see the fluid. I was a bit hesitant about keeping it but ended up keeping it... Not to mention that received a small face cleanser for free.  Thank you very much! Will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li> smells so good on my hubby!</li>
            <li> This is probably fake the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and so do I. Great price</li>
            <li> My son  has been wanting this.  I purchased it for Christmas.  It smells great and was delivered on time as promised.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle. I have since gotten more into fragrances and by other standards, it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of praise. It is a good everyday scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means the best cologne on the shelf... However, for the price, this makes for a great everyday spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband it smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Yummo!  Hubby smells amazing when he wears this.  Finally got to replace his old cologne.  :)</li>
            <li> all the ladies love this serious. Showed up on time if not earlier.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake from a company called OxKom. I&#x27;ve bought many Azzaro Chrome Eau de toilette colognes from many other vendors, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve found is a fake. I read another review from someone who also purchased this product from Oxkom and had the same experience. Comparing apples to apples (eau de toilette to eau de toilette), this product is absolutely a fake, it smells nothing like the real eau de toilette product, it only lasts for a few minutes, and even the bottle sprayer is different from Azarro&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I dont know, not very secure about this product</li>
            <li> First of all, i have what i wanted, same as described.&lt;br /&gt;i like this fragrance because is a soft fragrance i can use. i can tell im not compatible with a lot perfume because of health.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the office, mornings, afternoon and night!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Great product, service and shipment!</li>
            <li> Fresh scent but not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my sons birthday. The size was even larger than I thought it would be. I am very happy! :)</li>
            <li> Great! Would  purchase more.</li>
            <li> Great all around scent. Get complements constantly on it. It&#x27;s my go to cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Chrome the best perfume for men</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews for this EDS I thinks perhaps my nose is out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;I will give 5 stars if an item performs it&#x27;s function without any problems.  But this is a fragrance spray and doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a couple of hours.  And the smell is pleasant but almost &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;, nothing distinct about the smell.  For me it metallic, unsubtle...no complexity.  Smells like soap in a good way and whoever wears it feels fresh showered and clean.  But nothing that girls will melt for but it will also not offend anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Can be either a day or night time fragrance.  Also it can be unisex, why not!&lt;br /&gt;So my reason for the 1 star; no longevity and no personality.  I have about 25 fragrances and when this is used up will not be replaced by another Chrome.</li>
            <li> Decided to try it after getting a sample, but it&#x27;s just ok.  The scent is not that strong like others, but if used enough it can smell real nice. Not unhappy with it, just wish it stayed longer.</li>
            <li> just one or two sprits….thats it.</li>
            <li> Hey guys if you really confused about  which perfume you need to spray. I will suggest start with this one it&#x27;s has light scent,long lasting and every time you will feel fragrance around you. I started to get compliments from girls and my girlfriend goes crazy when she smell this scent on me.</li>
            <li> My Favorite! the Ladies love it!</li>
            <li> best smelling cologne i have had curve and abercrombie and i have had the most positive comments on this cologne a nice sweet smell not muscky at all</li>
            <li> Great scent and has been my go-to scent since first I bought it two years ago.  Great, powerful (but not overwhelming) scent.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, one spritz its all you need or its very strong. It smells AWESOME ON MY MAN!!!!!! Sexy smell!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this on my bf. He smells absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li> Have been a user of this  product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Works well.</li>
