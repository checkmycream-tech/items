            <li>I do recommend this wig especially at this price it is beautiful and good quality.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit on the thinner side, but for the price it was of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>It does seem to tangle a bit, but that&#x27;s just the nature of these things, and I&#x27;ve been able to comb most everything out.</li>
            <li>I love this one .</li>
            <li>It is made out of Japanese synthetic fiber and from my experience is the best fibers that you can get with a synthetic wig without breaking your wallet.</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Used this wig for a cosplay and was very soft, silky and great quality for the price, didn&#x27;t frizz or dread.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>It does tangle because it&#x27;s synthetic and cheap</li>
            <li>Also comfortable and not itchy.</li>
            <li>The hair is so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Although, it would be better if the adjustment was more flexible but not so much problem if the size fits you.</li>
            <li>This was incredible , it wasn&#x27;t a sharp black color it did reflect brown in it , but it was beautiful .</li>
            <li>and it fit pretty well on my head.</li>
            <li>I Love it, its very soft and smooth and it looks real.</li>
            <li>Got this wig for a cosplay..its cheap and fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Came super fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>But it looks very real</li>
            <li>I also found if I sweep the bangs to be like side bangs (using a comb), they stay pretty well.</li>
            <li>Would get another one of those for a different purpose, for sure.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and looks just like the image.</li>
            <li>This wig however came as I expected: very soft, medium shine and good quality.</li>
            <li>but I can always install in some new wefts of hair to make it full and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>It actually feels like real hair to the touch, and I think it has a natural sheen to it (not too shiny--just healthy looking!).</li>
            <li>Really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Product came fast, no issues.  </li>
            <li>Wig was what birthday expected and came so fast hair was nice and soft</li>
            <li>cheaply made and not as long as it looks in the pic</li>
            <li>I never expected to get such a great quality wig for so little money.  </li>
            <li>Cheap but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>right as it&#x27;s quite a long wig.</li>
            <li>The bangs are on the long side, but I was able to pull it back enough that it didn&#x27;t need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really surprised at how well this one fits and how natural it looks.</li>
            <li>but I almost felt sorry letting all that long beautiful hair go</li>
            <li>It is smooth and soft, not overly shiney and it may even past off as natural hair.</li>
            <li>was not black like I ordered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little thin, which is why I took away one star, but it&#x27;s soft and straight and the bangs look good.</li>
            <li>it is super shiny but nothing a little baby powder can&#x27;t cure</li>
            <li>It looks real enough for live performance on the stage.</li>
            <li>It does look a bit frizzy as if that will be a major problem.</li>
            <li>feels nice but looks really fake</li>
            <li>I agree with a lot of other people that it&#x27;s surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li>Buying long wigs can be a hassle or buying wigs in general can be because you have no idea how they will look on you or feel in person.</li>

            <li> but if rather it be too long then to short!</li>
            <li> Has a long of open space between the tracks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty thick</li>
            <li> only issues (like with all long wigs), is that it can tangle when worn loose</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it is hard to fit over my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was long shiny</li>
            <li> The skull cap was pretty small but the little straps held it in place.</li>
            <li> Sheds like hell but that&#x27; expected.</li>
            <li> with a few adjustments and pins, it is very simple to fix.</li>
            <li> Also there is some shedding which I expected since its length and possibility of tangle, but it is not as bad as many of my wigs from the past especially for its length.</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little to long too</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little long, but nothing scissors can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> the tangles are not to extreme like lower quality synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> Def recommend to anyone looking for a long black wig with bangs!</li>
            <li> Horrible looks nice only model</li>
            <li> It was dark brown.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I bought it to cosplay Kate Bishop/Hawkeye, and it will work, but I think i&#x27;ll need to cut off a few inches to get the length</li>
            <li> haha but not too bad</li>
            <li> they bangs are really ugly and it gets frizzy fast</li>
            <li> I do admit it was really small for my head but</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it holds up to custom styling because when I buy wigs I buy them as</li>
            <li> It was horrible, it was coming apart right out of the bag...</li>
            <li> Really thin.</li>
            <li> Very thin and feel soo synthetic</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see the base when wearing it.</li>

            <li> Horrible looks nice only model</li>
            <li> This was incredible , it wasn&#x27;t a sharp black color it did reflect brown in it , but it was beautiful . The hair is amazing quality , did cut a couple inches off tho because I like a blunt weight line but the wig didn&#x27;t need to be cut . It was long shiny and I loved it . The bangs were a little to long too but if rather it be too long then to short! I would buy this wig again(:</li>
            <li> Horriiibbllee wig. I took it out the package and it tangled immediately. So shiny and costumey. Waste of money</li>
            <li> The hair tangles easily and the bangs had to be trimmed, but was very satisfied. Was used as part of a costume.  Good product for the cost.</li>
            <li> Softest wig I own. Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It looks real enough for live performance on the stage. The size is adjustable. Although, it would be better if the adjustment was more flexible but not so much problem if the size fits you. It shed and tangled a lot as it was expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if you use for a short term.</li>
            <li> Sheds like hell but that&#x27; expected. Looks great though</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work but nope.</li>
            <li> I Love it, its very soft and smooth and it looks real. I do admit it was really small for my head but with a few adjustments and pins, it is very simple to fix. I really like it and think that its an excellent product</li>
            <li> When you put it on it keeps running off your head it have no electric in the front or it doesn&#x27;t have a clipper to clip for it to stay on your head</li>
            <li> cheaply made and not as long as it looks in the pic</li>
            <li> The hair is pretty good for the price. it&#x27;s a little thin, which is why I took away one star, but it&#x27;s soft and straight and the bangs look good. I&#x27;m going to be braiding this into pigtails anyway, so it&#x27;s perfect for my purposes.</li>

            <li> Worked very well. The skull cap was pretty small but the little straps held it in place. A tiny bit on the thinner side, but for the price it was of excellent quality. The bangs are on the long side, but I was able to pull it back enough that it didn&#x27;t need to be trimmed.</li>

            <li> Great wig! I agree with a lot of other people that it&#x27;s surprisingly high quality. It actually feels like real hair to the touch, and I think it has a natural sheen to it (not too shiny--just healthy looking!). It&#x27;s also pretty thick and I can&#x27;t see the base when wearing it. It does seem to tangle a bit, but that&#x27;s just the nature of these things, and I&#x27;ve been able to comb most everything out. I bought it to cosplay Kate Bishop/Hawkeye, and it will work, but I think i&#x27;ll need to cut off a few inches to get the length right as it&#x27;s quite a long wig. Def recommend to anyone looking for a long black wig with bangs! I also found if I sweep the bangs to be like side bangs (using a comb), they stay pretty well.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig it is super shiny but nothing a little baby powder can&#x27;t cure compared to another wig I got from Amazon I love this one . It does tangle because it&#x27;s synthetic and cheap haha but not too bad</li>
            <li> they bangs are really ugly and it gets frizzy fast</li>
            <li> Great product but the hair keep coming out</li>
            <li> Really amazing wig for the price!! Also comfortable and not itchy. I&#x27;ve bought wigs at all prices so I&#x27;m really surprised at how well this one fits and how natural it looks. My only problem would be the shedding but I can always install in some new wefts of hair to make it full and easier to manage. I&#x27;ll probably even by a second one and cut it in a different style.</li>
            <li> Came super fast in the mail. Haven&#x27;t tried it on yet. It does look a bit frizzy as if that will be a major problem.</li>
            <li> Great, easy care product!</li>
            <li> As pictured. Delivered fast. The bangs were a little long, but nothing scissors can&#x27;t fix. Over all a good buy. :)</li>
            <li> I never expected to get such a great quality wig for so little money.  The hair is so smooth and silky.  I needed a shorter haircut so I had my hairdresser style it but I almost felt sorry letting all that long beautiful hair go but it did turn into a beautiful cleopatra hair cut.  Would get another one of those for a different purpose, for sure.  Product came fast, no issues.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It was horrible, it was coming apart right out of the bag...DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> was not black like I ordered. It was dark brown. feels nice but looks really fake</li>
            <li> Used this wig for a cosplay and was very soft, silky and great quality for the price, didn&#x27;t frizz or dread.</li>
            <li> nice wig for the money</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect! I can wear it anywhere and it fit pretty well on my head. The only issue is that it is hard to fit over my thick hair. But it looks very real and I gulive it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Really thin. Has a long of open space between the tracks.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Hair falls out all the time. Wig rides up. Cheap but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wig was what birthday expected and came so fast hair was nice and soft</li>
            <li> This wig is great! It is exactly as described and looks just like the image. Buying long wigs can be a hassle or buying wigs in general can be because you have no idea how they will look on you or feel in person. This wig however came as I expected: very soft, medium shine and good quality. It is made out of Japanese synthetic fiber and from my experience is the best fibers that you can get with a synthetic wig without breaking your wallet. It is smooth and soft, not overly shiney and it may even past off as natural hair. I am not sure how it holds up to custom styling because when I buy wigs I buy them as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues (like with all long wigs), is that it can tangle when worn loose so it&#x27;s best to finger comb it from time to time but the tangles are not to extreme like lower quality synthetic wigs. Also there is some shedding which I expected since its length and possibility of tangle, but it is not as bad as many of my wigs from the past especially for its length. I do recommend this wig especially at this price it is beautiful and good quality.</li>
