            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how amazing it has made my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>But you dont have to believe me,make your own researches.</li>
            <li>This one works really well, plus it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>At the first application I was not that impressed, but after using this for a week my hair is very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and made my hair gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing product for your hair.</li>
            <li>thus I have to perm my hair every three months to get my hair to look good, now with me using this oil, I don&#x27;t have to perm my hair as much, I can now go longer, I am now able to perm my hair every five to six month, thats how good</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the speed with which the order arrived.  </li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many hair products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells.  </li>
            <li>but I think the chi hair silk is better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Many synthetic colors can be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>NOR HAS THE COMPANY BEEN ABLE TO TRACE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>OMG, I Love LOVE l-o-v-e</li>
            <li>My curls are softer and I find myself running my fingers through it over and over :) :)  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff much better than friz-ease.</li>
            <li>but I like the thickness of the Morrocan Oil better</li>
            <li>and it seems to react better with my hair.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I thought the product was OK.</li>
            <li>since I thought I was getting this exotic OIL</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t mention that it is mostly silicons.</li>
            <li>My hair was soooo reflectively shiny and smooth and had amazing movement.  </li>
            <li>Lovely movement.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>did come out better if I hadn&#x27;t used the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I need some more</li>
            <li>the smell of this is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing, soft and has a great scent,</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>I love my moroccan oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I loved after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it or ever experience this stuff I loved it.  </li>
            <li>just strong and overwhelming IMO.</li>
            <li>I felt it&#x27;s silky effect when my hair was DRY, which was a wonderful softness, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Sure, my hair smelled amazing for days after I used it and felt really soft to the touch, but it made my hair MORE frizzy!</li>
            <li>She did &amp; we were both surprised how beautifully silky, shiny, &amp; smooth my hair looked.</li>
            <li>loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I will be using the Moroccan oil from here on out &amp; have checked out other websites for price comparisons but Amazon has the BEST prices.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair that gets staticy and damaged easily.</li>
            <li>I recently received the moroccan oil and love love loved it.  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t found a seller that does free shipping on Amazon.com that also accepts Amazon.com gift credits.  </li>
            <li>you really should try this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this oil and how it makes my hair feel after washing.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk.      </li>
            <li>Something in this product \\&quot;builds up\\&quot; or \\&quot;removes important stuff\\&quot; from your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li>free shipping</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell good, makes it soft, and gets rid of frizzies and fly-a-ways.</li>
            <li>VERY prompt shipper and even sent out a smaller sample with the one that I purchased which was an excellent bonus.</li>
            <li>Also, as a huge plus, it was left mostly frizz-free!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product based on all the fabulous reviews.  </li>
            <li>i was new to ordering on amazon and have learned so many lessons already!  </li>
            <li>I will definetly be purchasing more moroccon products and shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>So I excitedly went out and bought myself a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I put in a small amount after straightening today just to see how it would turn out, and I had great results!</li>
            <li>Later, my best friend asked if I had just gotten a professional \\&quot;blow</li>
            <li>Great for dry tatty</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything terribly special</li>
            <li>my hair felt marvelously soft (&amp; the smell is clean &amp; nice like coconuts.)</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and leaves hair extremely soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This price was very competitive and it&#x27;s the authentic Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Received it very promptly and even was given two samples of shampoo and conditioner by Terax that I also love.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Chi user for years.  </li>
            <li>so it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also used this at a summer concert which was very humid and my hair did NOT frizz which is a miracle since my hair is very porous and frizzes very easily</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying the whole MO line.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product for my hair which is colour treated and delicate/thin which I also blow dry and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an amazing product that actually makes a difference then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  </li>
            <li>but I believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>So I love Morrocan Oil, it makes my hair ends so soft and not brittle and cracked.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and so healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and healthy with it.  </li>
            <li>Product for the price isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair soft and</li>
            <li>Its smooth and very easy to comb and blow dry.  </li>
            <li>They were very apologetic and friendly and shipped another product out right away.</li>
            <li>I think the right shampoo &amp; conditioner in combination with the moroccan oil treatment will give you favorable results.  </li>
            <li>I bought the smaller size first to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair super shiny and repaired when used correctly and in the right amount and was highly recommended by my stylist.</li>
            <li>After flat ironing, I will also apply a nickel or dime size drop in my hands and lightly apply it to my hair for shine and once again it looks FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair softer and more manageable, and it only takes about a capful to do the trick.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this oil</li>
            <li>the product is okay, however, i paid the same amount in shipping alone!  </li>
            <li>So overall, I am satisfied and will definitely add this product in my top 5 stash of oils.</li>
            <li>I let my hair recover and then tried it a 3rd time to be sure</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on</li>
            <li>My windblown hair was smooth and soft after the ride.</li>
            <li>It seems to seal the cuticle, leaving healthy locks with extra shine.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the silicone based de frizz products and it does the same thing!</li>
            <li>purchased it the first time at a salon in Melbourne FL and paid ten dollars more than I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I had some damage on the top layer from a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>While my hairdresser does a great job in coloring, cutting &amp; styling my hair; I am never quite able to duplicate her results.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Moroccanoil a try after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>and have given up on them after one or two times because they either did not make a positive difference or made my hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li>a large (around 5 or 6 oz I think) size.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that during the winter months it takes the static right out of your hair w/o weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve found that this works SOOOO much better on dry hair than on wet hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is very processed and does not look or feel like it thanks to Moroccanoil hair products.</li>
            <li>I have very curly</li>
            <li>Makes it very shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much...  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It makes combing your hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make much of any impact with my hair &amp; its frizziness.</li>
            <li>I did really like the seller though.</li>
            <li>I threw this stuff out and my hair is much much happier.  </li>
            <li>( my hair is very frizzy when I start).  </li>
            <li>This is a scam the real bottle does not have hebrew writing or any scratched out codes or labels.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much&#x27;</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I received this product within a few days of ordering it which was nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to see how many women with highly diverse hair types (straight and thin to thick and wiry) love this</li>
            <li>I have course wavy hair and live in a very humid climate with alot of rain - and my hair DOES NOT FRIZZ!  </li>
            <li>, course, think, long hair and Moroccan Oil makes it so easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, which is great because I&#x27;m saving to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>careful how many other styling products you apply as you can easily overload once you&#x27;ve applied Moroccan Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I had to go over areas with a flat iron to smooth them out, but with the Moroccanoil I don&#x27;t have to do that.  </li>
            <li>and I just apply a half dime sized amount (which I have rubbed between my palms) mostly to the ends.</li>
            <li>This stuff (not sold in California yet except for Temecula) really creates a soft, swingy feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I would caution someone trying this for the first time NOT to put too much in the hair - you only need a bit.    </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product minus the very long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves it very shiny and silky smooth as compared to friz-ease which weighs the hair down a bit and lacks that shiny quality.    </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m only going to put this into dry hair from now on :)</li>
            <li>:::shrug:::    I have tried other things like Cowboy Magic that have similar ingredients and did the same thing for MUCH cheaper - not with that yummy scent though!!    </li>
            <li>I live in south Florida.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, and I have  tried many products to tame the frizz without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>I was considering an expensive Keritan treatment, but now will not bother since I get fantastic results with the oil and get so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was left much more shiny than if I had just put this into wet hair, like I did before.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>My hair now  looks healthier and is very, very soft.</li>
            <li>I  try to let my long hair dry naturally most of the time</li>
            <li>because I can&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but gives me shine and silkiness to my strands.</li>
            <li>Makes my coarse hair soft and it does not seem to build up like so many other products.</li>
            <li>I find that with just a very small amount added to my wet hair I can have hair that is smooth, shiny and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It might be small but it will last &amp;#60;3 amazing results.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of this product helps soften and make hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I drove around town recently with the convertible top down and guess what?!</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and no frizz..   </li>
            <li>I buy it only from Amazon because it is the absolute cheapest way to go.  </li>
            <li>And the only downside I have found is that when I use it my hair gets oilier much faster and needs to be washed faster.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 71 years old and it works well on my graying hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more (to expensive right now).</li>
            <li>It seems like a lot of money to pay for such a small amount of oil, but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much at all, and its so worth it.</li>
            <li>My main concern is that this is a TINY bottle....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much so this size bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li>I recently went to a new stylist who suggested I try the MoroccanOil - let me tell you -</li>
            <li>I think those who complain of the smell and greasy texture days later are simply using way too much.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair which I straighten AND flat iron daily.</li>
            <li>The cost of this oil is a little pricy but so worth it.</li>
            <li>I just applied a few tiny drops to my clean damp hair from roots to tips after I washed it.</li>
            <li>When I put it in my hair while it was wet, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on conditioners, smoothers, etc.</li>
            <li>little to heavy for my thick hair, great to use in the evening as a treatment</li>
            <li>and I thought that was sufficient to see if I liked it enough before buying the big expensive size and it was.</li>
            <li>Normally it would take me 15 mins to dry it all, then another 15 to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I wash my hair, I put the oil on my damppen hair and let it air dry, when my hair drys it feels soft, silky and manageable.</li>

            <li> I SOOOOO wanted to love this product based on all the amazing reviews I read!</li>
            <li> I thought it would leave my hair shiny and frizz-free, but instead, it made my hair more frizzy!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how amazing it has made my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> But you dont have to believe me,make your own researches.</li>
            <li> This one works really well, plus it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> At the first application I was not that impressed, but after using this for a week my hair is very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and made my hair gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing product for your hair.</li>
            <li> thus I have to perm my hair every three months to get my hair to look good, now with me using this oil, I don&#x27;t have to perm my hair as much, I can now go longer, I am now able to perm my hair every five to six month, thats how good</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the speed with which the order arrived.  </li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many hair products.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells.  </li>
            <li> but I think the chi hair silk is better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Many synthetic colors can be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> NOR HAS THE COMPANY BEEN ABLE TO TRACE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> OMG, I Love LOVE l-o-v-e</li>
            <li> My curls are softer and I find myself running my fingers through it over and over :) :)  </li>
            <li> I like this stuff much better than friz-ease.</li>
            <li> but I like the thickness of the Morrocan Oil better</li>
            <li> and it seems to react better with my hair.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I thought the product was OK.</li>
            <li> since I thought I was getting this exotic OIL</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t mention that it is mostly silicons.</li>
            <li> My hair was soooo reflectively shiny and smooth and had amazing movement.  </li>
            <li> Lovely movement.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> did come out better if I hadn&#x27;t used the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I need some more</li>
            <li> the smell of this is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing, soft and has a great scent,</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I love my moroccan oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I loved after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it or ever experience this stuff I loved it.  </li>
            <li> just strong and overwhelming IMO.</li>
            <li> I felt it&#x27;s silky effect when my hair was DRY, which was a wonderful softness, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Sure, my hair smelled amazing for days after I used it and felt really soft to the touch, but it made my hair MORE frizzy!</li>
            <li> She did &amp; we were both surprised how beautifully silky, shiny, &amp; smooth my hair looked.</li>
            <li> loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I will be using the Moroccan oil from here on out &amp; have checked out other websites for price comparisons but Amazon has the BEST prices.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that gets staticy and damaged easily.</li>
            <li> I recently received the moroccan oil and love love loved it.  </li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t found a seller that does free shipping on Amazon.com that also accepts Amazon.com gift credits.  </li>
            <li> you really should try this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this oil and how it makes my hair feel after washing.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk.      </li>
            <li> Something in this product \\&quot;builds up\\&quot; or \\&quot;removes important stuff\\&quot; from your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li> free shipping</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell good, makes it soft, and gets rid of frizzies and fly-a-ways.</li>
            <li> VERY prompt shipper and even sent out a smaller sample with the one that I purchased which was an excellent bonus.</li>
            <li> Also, as a huge plus, it was left mostly frizz-free!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product based on all the fabulous reviews.  </li>
            <li> i was new to ordering on amazon and have learned so many lessons already!  </li>
            <li> I will definetly be purchasing more moroccon products and shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> So I excitedly went out and bought myself a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I put in a small amount after straightening today just to see how it would turn out, and I had great results!</li>
            <li> Later, my best friend asked if I had just gotten a professional \\&quot;blow</li>
            <li> Great for dry tatty</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything terribly special</li>
            <li> my hair felt marvelously soft (&amp; the smell is clean &amp; nice like coconuts.)</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and leaves hair extremely soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This price was very competitive and it&#x27;s the authentic Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Received it very promptly and even was given two samples of shampoo and conditioner by Terax that I also love.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Chi user for years.  </li>
            <li> so it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also used this at a summer concert which was very humid and my hair did NOT frizz which is a miracle since my hair is very porous and frizzes very easily</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying the whole MO line.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for my hair which is colour treated and delicate/thin which I also blow dry and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an amazing product that actually makes a difference then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  </li>
            <li> but I believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> So I love Morrocan Oil, it makes my hair ends so soft and not brittle and cracked.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and so healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and healthy with it.  </li>
            <li> Product for the price isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair soft and</li>
            <li> Its smooth and very easy to comb and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> They were very apologetic and friendly and shipped another product out right away.</li>
            <li> I think the right shampoo &amp; conditioner in combination with the moroccan oil treatment will give you favorable results.  </li>
            <li> I bought the smaller size first to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair super shiny and repaired when used correctly and in the right amount and was highly recommended by my stylist.</li>
            <li> After flat ironing, I will also apply a nickel or dime size drop in my hands and lightly apply it to my hair for shine and once again it looks FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer and more manageable, and it only takes about a capful to do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this oil</li>
            <li> the product is okay, however, i paid the same amount in shipping alone!  </li>
            <li> So overall, I am satisfied and will definitely add this product in my top 5 stash of oils.</li>
            <li> I let my hair recover and then tried it a 3rd time to be sure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on</li>
            <li> My windblown hair was smooth and soft after the ride.</li>
            <li> It seems to seal the cuticle, leaving healthy locks with extra shine.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the silicone based de frizz products and it does the same thing!</li>
            <li> purchased it the first time at a salon in Melbourne FL and paid ten dollars more than I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I had some damage on the top layer from a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> While my hairdresser does a great job in coloring, cutting &amp; styling my hair; I am never quite able to duplicate her results.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Moroccanoil a try after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> and have given up on them after one or two times because they either did not make a positive difference or made my hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li> a large (around 5 or 6 oz I think) size.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that during the winter months it takes the static right out of your hair w/o weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve found that this works SOOOO much better on dry hair than on wet hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is very processed and does not look or feel like it thanks to Moroccanoil hair products.</li>
            <li> I have very curly</li>
            <li> Makes it very shiny.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much...  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It makes combing your hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t make much of any impact with my hair &amp; its frizziness.</li>
            <li> I did really like the seller though.</li>
            <li> I threw this stuff out and my hair is much much happier.  </li>
            <li> ( my hair is very frizzy when I start).  </li>
            <li> This is a scam the real bottle does not have hebrew writing or any scratched out codes or labels.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much&#x27;</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I received this product within a few days of ordering it which was nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to see how many women with highly diverse hair types (straight and thin to thick and wiry) love this</li>
            <li> I have course wavy hair and live in a very humid climate with alot of rain - and my hair DOES NOT FRIZZ!  </li>
            <li> , course, think, long hair and Moroccan Oil makes it so easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, which is great because I&#x27;m saving to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> careful how many other styling products you apply as you can easily overload once you&#x27;ve applied Moroccan Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I had to go over areas with a flat iron to smooth them out, but with the Moroccanoil I don&#x27;t have to do that.  </li>
            <li> and I just apply a half dime sized amount (which I have rubbed between my palms) mostly to the ends.</li>
            <li> This stuff (not sold in California yet except for Temecula) really creates a soft, swingy feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I would caution someone trying this for the first time NOT to put too much in the hair - you only need a bit.    </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product minus the very long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves it very shiny and silky smooth as compared to friz-ease which weighs the hair down a bit and lacks that shiny quality.    </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m only going to put this into dry hair from now on :)</li>
            <li> :::shrug:::    I have tried other things like Cowboy Magic that have similar ingredients and did the same thing for MUCH cheaper - not with that yummy scent though!!    </li>
            <li> I live in south Florida.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, and I have  tried many products to tame the frizz without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I was considering an expensive Keritan treatment, but now will not bother since I get fantastic results with the oil and get so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was left much more shiny than if I had just put this into wet hair, like I did before.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> My hair now  looks healthier and is very, very soft.</li>
            <li> I  try to let my long hair dry naturally most of the time</li>
            <li> because I can&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but gives me shine and silkiness to my strands.</li>
            <li> Makes my coarse hair soft and it does not seem to build up like so many other products.</li>
            <li> I find that with just a very small amount added to my wet hair I can have hair that is smooth, shiny and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It might be small but it will last &amp;#60;3 amazing results.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this product helps soften and make hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I drove around town recently with the convertible top down and guess what?!</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and no frizz..   </li>
            <li> I buy it only from Amazon because it is the absolute cheapest way to go.  </li>
            <li> And the only downside I have found is that when I use it my hair gets oilier much faster and needs to be washed faster.</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 years old and it works well on my graying hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more (to expensive right now).</li>
            <li> It seems like a lot of money to pay for such a small amount of oil, but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much at all, and its so worth it.</li>
            <li> My main concern is that this is a TINY bottle....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much so this size bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a new stylist who suggested I try the MoroccanOil - let me tell you -</li>
            <li> I think those who complain of the smell and greasy texture days later are simply using way too much.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair which I straighten AND flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> The cost of this oil is a little pricy but so worth it.</li>
            <li> I just applied a few tiny drops to my clean damp hair from roots to tips after I washed it.</li>
            <li> When I put it in my hair while it was wet, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on conditioners, smoothers, etc.</li>
            <li> little to heavy for my thick hair, great to use in the evening as a treatment</li>
            <li> and I thought that was sufficient to see if I liked it enough before buying the big expensive size and it was.</li>
            <li> Normally it would take me 15 mins to dry it all, then another 15 to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I wash my hair, I put the oil on my damppen hair and let it air dry, when my hair drys it feels soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use a straight iron daily to try to tame my unruly locks.</li>
            <li> - it takes literally minutes to blow dry my super thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought their shampoo and conditioner to use in conjunction with the oil, but found no major difference.  </li>
            <li> I apply the oil after washing and towel drying, and use a big round brush to blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, you don&#x27;t have to overdo it by applying too much oil.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about putting \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in my hair as that usually means it&#x27;ll weigh it down and make it more oily.</li>
            <li> I have stopped blow drying and flat ironing my hair for about a year, I purchased this product a month ago and it has worked wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Long story short....</li>
            <li> If you flat iron or blow your hair out</li>
            <li> I cannot flat iron my hair ever again without it.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky and soft without making it look greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This is all you need in addition to a flat iron to straighten your hair!  </li>
            <li> No matter what products and deep conditioners I used, this layer was always dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for just a week all that dryness and damage is gone.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my hair stylist when my hair was looking/feeling dry and lifeless for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and have natural sandy brown/gold highlighted hair... and it&#x27;s usually hard to find products that keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I then blew dried my hair and immediately noticed a natural, silky softness in my hair&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s \\&quot;long term\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You can find oils that are less expensive and just as good if not better than this.</li>
            <li> The friz-ease is heavier likely due to the mineral oil vs the argra oil and linseed oil in moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> I put together the Moroccanoil oil and the pump hair conditioner and place on my hair concentrating on the ends and dry areas, but staying away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my damp hair then proceed to blow dry.</li>
            <li> It can be used on towel dried/slightly damp hair or on totally dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my hair has become dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my extremely dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> My hair did take a bit longer to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is getting dry and dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> -- I didn&#x27;t want to waste such an expensive bottle of product that seemed to be such a miracle at first!  </li>
            <li> I bought an argan oil product at a local beauty store for much less and it does just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, a few years ago you could find it at every salon, now not so much.</li>
            <li> 8 wks or so &amp; have found that over time my hair has become very dry.</li>
            <li> and it was very dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair had become lifeless after starting a new medication, Moroccan oil restored the shine, decreased the dryness and increased the body.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin/scalp, yet dry hair due to coloring and styling.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase other product from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Third time, I&#x27;m noticing that not only does my hair not look amazing, it looks awful.  </li>
            <li> It really helps control  the crazy frizz of my hair and makes the hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a small size, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use a pea size amount when hair is wet before styling</li>
            <li> This is worth a try, it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Oil Treatment did as expected.  </li>
            <li> My hair cannot take a lot of oil, so I just put a dab through my wet hair, blow-dried my hair and flatten with the irons and my hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is not really curly but gets wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way to moisturize hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Works well to treat hair but not as oily feeling as other products.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount, about the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> Nor are any of my other products.  </li>
            <li> I have 10 bottles of other stuff..</li>
            <li> so I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> Now I can use a round brush and dry it all in 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> have very very thick, naturally curly hair that I have colored for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The emphasis should be on very small quantity as applying too much can make your hair very limp once it&#x27;s dried and styled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside is not worth the upside.</li>
            <li> I have unruly, thick, coarse</li>
            <li> and then just dampen it and blow it dry in very little time</li>
            <li> does not weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> This oil does not weigh my hair down or leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy their curly cream and other products but this oil is not worth the price!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I also put a small amount of the oil on after it is dry .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and usually use prescription loprox, a moisture shampoo and reconstructer to follow.  </li>
            <li> And I use less than a dime sized amount on my hair.</li>
            <li> less than one ounce....</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble with them in the beginning as my order was shipped but never made it to it&#x27;s destination.</li>
            <li> I have hair down past my shoulder blades</li>
            <li> This Moroccan Oil is all the rage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply a very small quantity on your wet, just washed hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any worse or really better than any others, since the ingredient list has a bunch of silicone derivatives, I was disappointed with that</li>
            <li> I kept putting small amounts in before my hair dried</li>
            <li> but you use very little of it</li>
            <li> and I think there is actually very little of the oil in there.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> They have a small (.85oz) and</li>
            <li> I bought this small bottle</li>
            <li> Because of this, I could never use an oil treatment, as it would turn my head into an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I used the small sample size</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this product and was left disappointed :(    </li>
            <li> I AM HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THE COMPANY TO REFUND MY MONEY.  </li>
            <li> and it can be hard to brush.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this at salons anymore</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick mid-length hair</li>
            <li> NO MORE RATS NEST!</li>
            <li> But unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last long :(</li>
            <li> However, I think the price of this product is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This smells horrible compared to the real thing!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist, if you can call him that, put this crap in my hair and now 5 days later, I still can&#x27;t get the horrendous smell out or the greasy, oily feeling.</li>
            <li> The product is OK--as others have mentioned, the smell is not great</li>
            <li> , so I was a bit annoyed with that.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to hair products and try everything on the market.  </li>
            <li> My secret beauty weapon in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE TANGLES!!!</li>
            <li> My hair looks waxy and feels like fake doll hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the basis of rave reviews here and elsewhere, but I&#x27;m not terribly impressed.  </li>
            <li> Dont waist your time or money with this false advertised item!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad....</li>
            <li> I suggest everyone that experiences \\&quot;bad hair days\\</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Moroccanoil not only softens hair but repairs the hair. It is a fantastic product. I put it on my hair after I use the Moroccanoil Shanpoo and Conditioner. I put together the Moroccanoil oil and the pump hair conditioner and place on my hair concentrating on the ends and dry areas, but staying away from the scalp. Then I blow dry. My hair is very processed and does not look or feel like it thanks to Moroccanoil hair products. I have not found one that is not beneficial.</li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy, so I bought this product.  I loved after the first time I used it.  I does not leave your hair oily either.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky and soft without making it look greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have stopped blow drying and flat ironing my hair for about a year, I purchased this product a month ago and it has worked wonders for my hair.  Whenever I wash my hair, I put the oil on my damppen hair and let it air dry, when my hair drys it feels soft, silky and manageable. I can go longer without perming my hair because of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am african american thus I have to perm my hair every three months to get my hair to look good, now with me using this oil, I don&#x27;t have to perm my hair as much, I can now go longer, I am now able to perm my hair every five to six month, thats how good this oil is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I just applied a few tiny drops to my clean damp hair from roots to tips after I washed it. I then blew dried my hair and immediately noticed a natural, silky softness in my hair&#x27;s texture. This oil also has a very nice scent. I reiceived my oder within 2-3 days. I would recommend this product!! I plan on purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Moroccanoil a try after reading all the positive reviews.  I bought the smaller size first to see if I liked it.  At the first application I was not that impressed, but after using this for a week my hair is very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very very thick, naturally curly hair that I have colored for over 15 years.  I had some damage on the top layer from a flat iron.  No matter what products and deep conditioners I used, this layer was always dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for just a week all that dryness and damage is gone.  I apply the oil after washing and towel drying, and use a big round brush to blow dry my hair straight.  Normally I had to go over areas with a flat iron to smooth them out, but with the Moroccanoil I don&#x27;t have to do that.  I think my hair dries quicker too.  Normally it would take me 15 mins to dry it all, then another 15 to flat iron.  Now I can use a round brush and dry it all in 10 mins.  I also put a small amount of the oil on after it is dry .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair definitely looks a lot healthier and smoother.  I do recommend this product to anyone that has damage from coloring and heat styling.  I&#x27;ll be buying a bigger bottle soon!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the speed with which the order arrived.  Also, the Moroccan Oil is the same as I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years.  It seems to add control to my hair.  Sometimes I apply it 10 minutes before my shampooing to restore life to my hair.  If I forget to do it then, I may apply it after the shampooing to get about the same results.  It was recommended by my hair stylist when my hair was looking/feeling dry and lifeless for no apparent reason.  It makes my hair softer and more manageable, and it only takes about a capful to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The product does work and I like the way it makes my hair feel.  However, I think the price of this product is ridiculous.  I bought an argan oil product at a local beauty store for much less and it does just as well.</li>
            <li> I color my hair every approx. 8 wks or so &amp; have found that over time my hair has become very dry. While my hairdresser does a great job in coloring, cutting &amp; styling my hair; I am never quite able to duplicate her results. Last time I was in for my color etc. I asked her to use some Moroccan Oil treatment on my hair. She did &amp; we were both surprised how beautifully silky, shiny, &amp; smooth my hair looked. My hair had movement when whenever I moved my head. I felt like I should be making a hair product commercial...my hair felt marvelously soft (&amp; the smell is clean &amp; nice like coconuts.) I will be using the Moroccan oil from here on out &amp; have checked out other websites for price comparisons but Amazon has the BEST prices. I am so grateful I found this hair product; I feel sassy knowing my hair looks great:-) Wishing you the same results if you try it.  Best regards to all.  Elena</li>
            <li> amazing. my hair has been longer and healthier every time I go to the hair dresser</li>
            <li> My hair stylist, if you can call him that, put this crap in my hair and now 5 days later, I still can&#x27;t get the horrendous smell out or the greasy, oily feeling. My hair looks waxy and feels like fake doll hair. GROSS,.</li>
            <li> awesome product.  does not weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.  helps control friz and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product for my hair which is colour treated and delicate/thin which I also blow dry and flat iron.  It can literally save your hair from all the damage from colouring, highlighting and heat styling.  I also used this at a summer concert which was very humid and my hair did NOT frizz which is a miracle since my hair is very porous and frizzes very easily so I&#x27;m very impressed!  It&#x27;s also not at all greasy. I use a pea size amount when hair is wet before styling and I&#x27;m good to go.    All I can say is get this!</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many hair products.  I have dry scalp and usually use prescription loprox, a moisture shampoo and reconstructer to follow.  I recently received the moroccan oil and love love loved it.  I decided to purchase the shampoo and restorative mask from a nearby town.  I am sold.  My hair is silky, shiny beautiful.  Not all products work for everybody.  This is worth a try, it is a bit expensive but I believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It works wonders....Sally&#x27;s sells a product called Argan oil that has the same ingredients. Its 75% cheaper! This product is great, however, I wont purchase it again.  I&#x27;ll buy their curly cream and other products but this oil is not worth the price!</li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way to moisturize hair.  absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This Moroccan Oil is all the rage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply a very small quantity on your wet, just washed hair. The emphasis should be on very small quantity as applying too much can make your hair very limp once it&#x27;s dried and styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick mid-length hair and I just apply a half dime sized amount (which I have rubbed between my palms) mostly to the ends. After I apply the oil I comb it though my hair to distribute it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful how many other styling products you apply as you can easily overload once you&#x27;ve applied Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to see how many women with highly diverse hair types (straight and thin to thick and wiry) love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend purchasing the small sized bottle first.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Works well to treat hair but not as oily feeling as other products. I love it.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! leaves my hair so shiny and manageable! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware this is not a 6pk as it is being advertised, it is only 1 .85 oil, and can be purchased cheaper elsewhere!! Dont waist your time or money with this false advertised item!</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells.  The first time I used it or ever experience this stuff I loved it.  I still like it but I think the chi hair silk is better.</li>
            <li> I received this product within a few days of ordering it which was nice. This price was very competitive and it&#x27;s the authentic Moroccanoil. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble with them in the beginning as my order was shipped but never made it to it&#x27;s destination. I called but got no where. When I emailed them I received a reply the same day saying they would look into it and 2 days later saying the label was damaged during shipment and illegible by UPS. They were very apologetic and friendly and shipped another product out right away.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have very curly, course, think, long hair and Moroccan Oil makes it so easy to manage.  Makes it very shiny.  Gets rid of frizz.  I only have to use a dime size amount for all of my hair.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this oil and I love it.Makes my coarse hair soft and it does not seem to build up like so many other products.</li>
            <li> A lot of produts have elements that are harmfull,however this one has SYNTHETIC COLORS Used to make cosmetics \\&quot;pretty,\\&quot; synthetic colors, along with synthetic hair dyes, should be avoided at all costs. They will be labeled as FD&amp;C or D&amp;C, followed by a color and a number.In this case D&amp;C Yellow-11,D&amp;C Red-17. Many synthetic colors can be carcinogenic. If a cosmetic contains them, don&#x27;t use it.  But you dont have to believe me,make your own researches.</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever heard of to straighten hair (and even wear it curly.)</li>
            <li> I kept putting small amounts in before my hair dried and I didn&#x27;t see much...  Then I put a good amount (quarter size) to my medium length hair, and it worked!  My hair was soft and no frizz..   so i recommend.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair super shiny and repaired when used correctly and in the right amount and was highly recommended by my stylist. I will definetly be purchasing more moroccon products and shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product in a discount beauty store when the woman in front of me swore it was the best product she ever used.  I love the way it makes my hair feel smooth and soft.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  It adds shine too.  My only gripe about it is the price and size availability.  I buy it only from Amazon because it is the absolute cheapest way to go.  They have a small (.85oz) and a large (around 5 or 6 oz I think) size.  I would like to see a 3 ounce size.  Also, I haven&#x27;t found a seller that does free shipping on Amazon.com that also accepts Amazon.com gift credits.  Long story short....you really should try this amazing product.</li>
            <li> i was new to ordering on amazon and have learned so many lessons already!  the product is okay, however, i paid the same amount in shipping alone!  won&#x27;t make mistake again!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED FROM AMAZON MAY 10, 2011.  I RECEIVED A NOTICE IT WOULD ARRIVE BETWEEN MAY 16 AND MAY 19.  IT IS JUNE 11, 2011.  I HAVE NOT SEEN MY PRODUCT NOR HAS THE COMPANY BEEN ABLE TO TRACE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. I AM HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THE COMPANY TO REFUND MY MONEY.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Since I started using it I have seen a definite difference in my hair.  I have very curly hair and it can be hard to brush.  It makes combing your hair so much easier.  I also noticed that during the winter months it takes the static right out of your hair w/o weighing it down.  Also, everything came quickly and the seller did an excellent job shipping this product.  Very Happy!</li>
            <li> little to heavy for my thick hair, great to use in the evening as a treatment</li>
            <li> This oils is the best thing I have ever put on my hair.  After shampooing and conditioning I put just a dab of this on my hair and tangles fall out.  Its smooth and very easy to comb and blow dry.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This makes your hair feel like silk.  If you flat iron or blow your hair out this is the product for you.  Introduced to me by my hairdresser; I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> The most amazing product for your hair. Ever. Period. Worth the price. Makes your hair feel amazing! Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the basis of rave reviews here and elsewhere, but I&#x27;m not terribly impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything terribly special and I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for hair and skin. Can&#x27;t believe the value of this item. It has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Chi user for years.  I recently went to a new stylist who suggested I try the MoroccanOil - let me tell you - my hair has NEVER felt softer or looked healthier.  I have course wavy hair and live in a very humid climate with alot of rain - and my hair DOES NOT FRIZZ!  Its amazing!</li>
            <li> IT came next day and I used it immediately. I love the way it makes my hair feel. This size is a perfect sample size.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this oil and how it makes my hair feel after washing. I apply it to my damp hair then proceed to blow dry. I notice a difference in the texture of my hair and I LOVE IT.  I am an African American woman and have natural sandy brown/gold highlighted hair... and it&#x27;s usually hard to find products that keep my hair moisturized. After flat ironing, I will also apply a nickel or dime size drop in my hands and lightly apply it to my hair for shine and once again it looks FABULOUS. :) I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying the whole MO line. The cost of this oil is a little pricy but so worth it. A little goes a very long way, you don&#x27;t have to overdo it by applying too much oil. the perfumy smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, I actually like it. So overall, I am satisfied and will definitely add this product in my top 5 stash of oils.</li>
            <li> I have out of control frizzy beach hair.  This stuff (not sold in California yet except for Temecula) really creates a soft, swingy feel to my hair.  Remember what your hair felt like when you were 15?  That is what it makes it feel like again.  I cannot keep my hands off of it!&lt;br /&gt;Now . .  .&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any prolonged experience with this product ; so cannot speak to it&#x27;s \\&quot;long term\\&quot; effects.&lt;br /&gt;For now; I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> OMG, I Love LOVE l-o-v-e this product!  I have hair down past my shoulder blades and I only use a pea sized amount to completly transform my hair! My curls are softer and I find myself running my fingers through it over and over :) :)  It can be used on towel dried/slightly damp hair or on totally dry hair.  It smells so good and I rub any remaining oil into my hands and forearms!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! A little goes a long way though. It makes my hair smell good, makes it soft, and gets rid of frizzies and fly-a-ways. And the only downside I have found is that when I use it my hair gets oilier much faster and needs to be washed faster. Maybe its because I have an oily scalp or maybe its because I can&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> This is all you need in addition to a flat iron to straighten your hair!  Leaves hair silky-smooth with a healthy shimmer/shine!  Don&#x27;t need to use much so this size bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and my hair has become dry and frizzy. Perhaps as a guy I shouldn&#x27;t care but I do. I like this stuff much better than friz-ease. The friz-ease is heavier likely due to the mineral oil vs the argra oil and linseed oil in moroccanoil. Visually you can&#x27;t even tell you put something in your hair and the friz is gone. Leaves it very shiny and silky smooth as compared to friz-ease which weighs the hair down a bit and lacks that shiny quality.    BUT I wish they would sell an unscented version of this stuff. Smells like a cross between a clothes drier sheet and petruli oil. It is not that the smell just lingers....it stays, and stays, and stays. It smells stronger than my aftershave! And I use less than a dime sized amount on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad....just strong and overwhelming IMO. But perhaps based on all the reviews here, the ladies seem to like the smell so perhaps that will help me as nothing else seems too....lol.    Overall, a very good product minus the very long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this product helps soften and make hair smooth and silky. I just started using this product and have already noticed a difference. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my extremely dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  The product arrived very quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and my hair is softer and shinier.  A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed, which is great because I&#x27;m saving to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> The product is OK--as others have mentioned, the smell is not great but you use very little of it so it dissipates quickly.  I think those who complain of the smell and greasy texture days later are simply using way too much.  My main concern is that this is a TINY bottle....less than one ounce....for $8.  There is no way the shipping charge should be another $8, essentially doubling the price.  I need to find somewhere to buy it over-the-counter.....</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount, about the size of a dime.  My hair smells great and my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy.  I also don&#x27;t feel that my hair is oily.</li>
            <li> So I love Morrocan Oil, it makes my hair ends so soft and not brittle and cracked. I have a hard time finding this at salons anymore I&#x27;m not sure why, a few years ago you could find it at every salon, now not so much. I purchased some Argan Oil and I like it but I like the thickness of the Morrocan Oil better and it seems to react better with my hair. I bought this small bottle so I could travel with it and the cover broke, which is find for the house I can leave it sitting up in the drawer but traveling that&#x27;s not going to work, so I was a bit annoyed with that.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good - as all of the Moroccan Oil products do.  The only negative is I don&#x27;t think its worth the money.  My hair felt pretty oily not like it usually is after Chi oil and it didn&#x27;t make much of any impact with my hair &amp; its frizziness.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle for my hair.  I have oily skin/scalp, yet dry hair due to coloring and styling.  Because of this, I could never use an oil treatment, as it would turn my head into an oil slick.  Moroccan Oil is fantastic!  My hair is shiny, soft and so healthy.  No oil residue is present...EVER!  Only a pea-sized amount is needed.  The best part - it takes literally minutes to blow dry my super thick hair.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair had become lifeless after starting a new medication, Moroccan oil restored the shine, decreased the dryness and increased the body.  Smells wonderful on your hair.</li>
            <li> I thought the oil smelled realllly yummy. Felt oily in my hands, no surprise there! When I put it in my hair while it was wet, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference but I would caution someone trying this for the first time NOT to put too much in the hair - you only need a bit.    I felt it&#x27;s silky effect when my hair was DRY, which was a wonderful softness, not greasy. My hair did take a bit longer to dry. (I have shoulder length hair)    I thought the product was OK. I used the small sample size and I thought that was sufficient to see if I liked it enough before buying the big expensive size and it was. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any worse or really better than any others, since the ingredient list has a bunch of silicone derivatives, I was disappointed with that since I thought I was getting this exotic OIL and I think there is actually very little of the oil in there. I read up on all the infomercials about it and on their official site and they didn&#x27;t mention that it is mostly silicons. :::shrug:::    I have tried other things like Cowboy Magic that have similar ingredients and did the same thing for MUCH cheaper - not with that yummy scent though!!    I can see how I might like to keep a product like this around on days when my hair is feeling unruly. I don&#x27;t think it improved my hair overall, I only felt the silky effects on days I used the product.    I did really like the seller though. VERY prompt shipper and even sent out a smaller sample with the one that I purchased which was an excellent bonus. Would definitely purchase other product from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to hair products and try everything on the market.  I was so excited about this product based on all the fabulous reviews.  So I excitedly went out and bought myself a bottle.  I LOVED it.  It was easy to use and made my hair gorgeous.  My hair was soooo reflectively shiny and smooth and had amazing movement.  Everyone at the office stopped me and complimented me.  Later, my best friend asked if I had just gotten a professional \\&quot;blow out\\&quot;!!  I was thrilled!  My secret beauty weapon in a bottle.  (or so I thought)    So after my next shampoo, I used it again.  Very similar results.  Shiny shiny shiny.  Lovely movement.  Smooth as silk.      Third time, I&#x27;m noticing that not only does my hair not look amazing, it looks awful.  My hair is getting dry and dehydrated.  The product just isn&#x27;t \\&quot;working\\&quot;.  Nor are any of my other products.  It took me a while to connect the dots.  I stopped using it for a while until my hair \\&quot;got back to normal\\&quot;.  Then I used it again and the same pattern as before.  I let my hair recover and then tried it a 3rd time to be sure -- I didn&#x27;t want to waste such an expensive bottle of product that seemed to be such a miracle at first!  Same pattern as before.      Something in this product \\&quot;builds up\\&quot; or \\&quot;removes important stuff\\&quot; from your hair.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on but I can tell you I don&#x27;t like it.  I threw this stuff out and my hair is much much happier.  Maybe the trick is to only use it every 5 weeks.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to figure it out.  The downside is not worth the upside.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair. I live in south Florida. This stuff makes frizz-eaze look like a joke. I have 10 bottles of other stuff..All I use is this stuff..It WORKS.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Just a small amount goes a long way!  My hair is pretty thick so I use it every other day.  Gives my hair lots of shine and keeps the flyaways away!  Received it very promptly and even was given two samples of shampoo and conditioner by Terax that I also love.  Will definitely order from Jade Beauty Supply again!</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about putting \\&quot;oil\\&quot; in my hair as that usually means it&#x27;ll weigh it down and make it more oily. But it&#x27;s anything but that. This stuff has actually brought my hair to life. I have very curly hair which I straighten AND flat iron daily. At one point my hair fell out and broke to about an inch away from my scalp. This product makes my hair shiny, without the greasy feeling, and very healthy. My stylist said I have the healthiest hair for all the damage I should be doing to it. I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Oil Treatment did as expected.  I think the right shampoo &amp; conditioner in combination with the moroccan oil treatment will give you favorable results.  My hair cannot take a lot of oil, so I just put a dab through my wet hair, blow-dried my hair and flatten with the irons and my hair did come out better if I hadn&#x27;t used the product.  But, I will use in-between my salon appointments.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to use when using heat on hair. It smells amazing, and leaves hair extremely soft and moisturized. I cannot flat iron my hair ever again without it.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products to improve the appearance of my dry,frizzy unattractive hair. I use a straight iron daily to try to tame my unruly locks. My hair ends up looking like straw. After reading the awesome reviews for Moroccan Oil I just had to try it out. WOW....GREAT STUFF!!! My hair now  looks healthier and is very, very soft. NO MORE TANGLES!!! I drove around town recently with the convertible top down and guess what?! My windblown hair was smooth and soft after the ride. I could not believe it.....NO MORE RATS NEST! This oil does not weigh my hair down or leave a greasy residue. It seems to seal the cuticle, leaving healthy locks with extra shine. My hair is now silky smooth. I suggest everyone that experiences \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot; buy some today!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, and I have  tried many products to tame the frizz without weighing hair down. This one works really well, plus it smells wonderful. It is much better than the silicone based de frizz products and it does the same thing!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels so soft and healthy with it.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Moroccanoil before, but this smaller size  is so helpful for travelling!  It really helps control  the crazy frizz of my hair and makes the hair really soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair care product that I have ever purchased.  I have spent so much money on conditioners, smoothers, etc. and have given up on them after one or two times because they either did not make a positive difference or made my hair too greasy.  I find that with just a very small amount added to my wet hair I can have hair that is smooth, shiny and much more manageable.  I have a lot of hair and it is not really curly but gets wavy and frizzy.  I  try to let my long hair dry naturally most of the time and then just dampen it and blow it dry in very little time( my hair is very frizzy when I start).  I can not tell you how amazing it has made my hair.  I recently bought their shampoo and conditioner to use in conjunction with the oil, but found no major difference.  It is the oil that is the miracle product.  I use the \\&quot;light\\&quot; since I have dyed blond hair.  If you are looking for an amazing product that actually makes a difference then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  I was considering an expensive Keritan treatment, but now will not bother since I get fantastic results with the oil and get so many compliments on my hair.  I tell everyone, \\&quot;it&#x27;s the oil!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Makes hair shine but not oily.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that gets staticy and damaged easily. Moroccan oil solved both my problems. I have no split ends now and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking. It seems like a lot of money to pay for such a small amount of oil, but you really don&#x27;t need to use that much at all, and its so worth it.</li>
            <li> I SOOOOO wanted to love this product based on all the amazing reviews I read! I thought it would leave my hair shiny and frizz-free, but instead, it made my hair more frizzy! Sure, my hair smelled amazing for days after I used it and felt really soft to the touch, but it made my hair MORE frizzy! I was expecting more from this product and was left disappointed :(    EDIT: Okay, so I&#x27;ve found that this works SOOOO much better on dry hair than on wet hair! I put in a small amount after straightening today just to see how it would turn out, and I had great results! My hair was left much more shiny than if I had just put this into wet hair, like I did before. Also, as a huge plus, it was left mostly frizz-free!! So I&#x27;m only going to put this into dry hair from now on :)</li>
            <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve used for years.  I&#x27;m 71 years old and it works well on my graying hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for a fantastic product. Even though it&#x27;s a small size, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for dry tatty hair.&lt;br /&gt;Had highlights in hair and it was very dry.  This helped a lot.  I need some more</li>
            <li> This is a scam the real bottle does not have hebrew writing or any scratched out codes or labels. This smells horrible compared to the real thing! These people have been called out before and changed their name so that could continue to scam and steal money! Don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
            <li> Product for the price isn&#x27;t worth it. You can find oils that are less expensive and just as good if not better than this. For me this didn&#x27;t work well at all. I have unruly, thick, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER the smell of this is FANTASTIC! But unfortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t last long :( If anyone knows the scent to this product please share!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair feels amazing, soft and has a great scent, Thank you so much&#x27; I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more (to expensive right now). My husband even uses it. But I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> It works well. I cannot stand the smell. I prefer the smell of the Tuscan oil. They both work about the same.</li>
            <li> It might be small but it will last &amp;#60;3 amazing results. I used it before i did my hair at the tips and it looks healthier. loved it so much.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair conditioner!  Love the way it makes my hair soft and so manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it the first time at a salon in Melbourne FL and paid ten dollars more than I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;With free shipping it made my purchase a very rewarding purchase.  I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love my moroccan oil treatment. Very good product.  Shipment was fast. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff! A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be turned off by the price. It&#x27;s light, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but gives me shine and silkiness to my strands.</li>
