            <li>Shipping and receipt of article excellent.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shaver is excellent for an electic shaver.</li>

            <li>In my opinion you should change the blade about every 6-8 months for best performance.</li>

            <li>It is really great.  </li>

            <li>Great product at a great price and timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Very handy</li>
            <li>this seems to be a very nice shaver and cleanup</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very nice</li>
            <li>It was AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The comfort and closeness of this shaver is remarkable.    </li>
            <li>Grip and operation wise</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the Braun would do a superior job on my neck</li>
            <li>Now for the good part...</li>
            <li>It has good grips on it.  </li>
            <li>The Braun is a good shaver</li>
            <li>Shave is as good as my brush and lather shave.  </li>
            <li>Good in a pinch but not as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>So given that, its a good value and has met all that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver available for the best price available.</li>
            <li>The razor has good power</li>
            <li>While there are some good features, it is not working for me.    </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>A really good buy.</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem getting a good shave even with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that others  gave me words of wisdom.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best available.</li>
            <li>Good close shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li>The cutter head and foils are fairly pricey to replace every year.</li>
            <li>Not so good for travelling.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from a Braun 6000 based on the excellent Consumer Reports rating for this shaver and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>IT SURE DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is a razor I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the performance for the price.  </li>
            <li>Performs as advertised as is easy to operate and especially easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the shaver and the service from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>My son requested it for christmas and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>battery life is amazing, I used it once a day for 2 1/2 weeks before it signaled that I needed a charge.  </li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly well</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver comes with a nice carrying case.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am impressed with this razor which gives me a close, good shave.</li>
            <li>the trimmer works nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really good shave with one of those, and always found myself turning to a blade.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the carrying case also held the charging cord, but it doesn&#x27;t so I keep everything in a nylon bag when I am travelling.</li>
            <li>I have tried many electic razors and have always had to use a safety razor inbetween to feel like I had a good shave.</li>
            <li>If I skip a day, it is about as effective as a shoe.  </li>
            <li>2- the design is nice  </li>
            <li>Consistent with the reviews, it does provide an excellent shave in that my skin is very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>good shaver and easy to handle</li>
            <li>I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver I have owned by far.  </li>
            <li>So to make a long story longer good shaver but not the best for me!</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 line of blade shavers is great, but they cut so close that any bumps get cut right off too.  </li>
            <li>This particular model Series 5 is very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, fast and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>shaver itself is very comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>It keeps a good charge and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Rather than sticking at that level I figured I&#x27;d try the better model to see what the benefits are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is it a worthwhile razor?  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>So, I am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used Panasonic, but Braun is definitely better than Philips.</li>
            <li>I think it shaves better than Norelco</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that it has Ni-MH batteries as opposed to Ni-Cd.  </li>
            <li>Better for the environment</li>
            <li>This one is better that any electric shavers and I tried (have) three others.  </li>
            <li>I switched from a razor to the Braun, but a razor provides a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to compare the shaves from each.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve since read many reviewers who like the cleaning system, I am more than satisfied without it.  </li>
            <li>It costs more</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve found overall.</li>
            <li>I know most people won&#x27;t believe me, but I&#x27;m going to say it anyway...</li>
            <li>I have used shavers for 16 years and I love this one.</li>
            <li>and I am quite satisfied with the quality and performance.    </li>
            <li>Now that I have passed the magical age of 40</li>
            <li>Many retail stores sell canned \\&quot;cleaner and lubricant\\&quot; for electric shavers that is a spray.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, even better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been happy with for years.    </li>
            <li>I can feel stubble with my hands, but the shaver won&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save money and get much better results.</li>
            <li>This is my third Braun shaver and the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Why spend more?</li>
            <li>Neither of these gave me a satisfying shave and took for ever to shave.  </li>
            <li>So I chose this Braun model and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>My 5000 series shaver ran noticeably faster (and better) when plugged in even though it could run un-plugged.</li>
            <li>And this Braun does that better than anything I&#x27;ve used at any price.</li>
            <li>The price was better than all the discount and warehouse stores I had searched.  </li>
            <li>There is no need for me to use a sfety razor at all any more.</li>
            <li>100%.He says this is a much much better shaver than the ones he had before.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better buying transaction.</li>
            <li>Right from the beginning out of the box, this razor has provided me with a good close shave whith out razor burns.</li>
            <li>I wish my original Norelco had as nice of a case.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver with high expectations, based on the great reviews here.    </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Its shave is not as close as the Norelco was, the  top easily dsengages.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is really good and shaves real close at most places on your face.</li>
            <li>I just finished with my first shave with the new braun and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the trimmer on it, but it shaves and cleans out just fine.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly the close shave is comparable to that of a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>For real world use, the Norelco is superior.</li>
            <li>This worked very well &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li>I purchased a series of high end shavers to compair and found this particular model to be the best for comfort,  &lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun uses a much more bulky cord/plugarrangement that&#x27;s not as travel friendly.</li>
            <li>easy to use......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shave and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin compared to my old cheap electric razor.</li>
            <li>is relatively easy for me</li>
            <li>It does an average job at best.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is fine and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the higher end Braun Pulsonic being a better shave for the $100 more it costs.  </li>
            <li>know there is a newer model out there, but this one is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>and it has held up just fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one yet - nearly as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>This shaver is light years ahead of the 150.  </li>
            <li>Braun was great about sending my $$ back.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard.</li>
            <li>I had a really cheap electirc razor I was using</li>
            <li>my skin is not as smooth as before.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need earplugs with this like I did with my cheap Remington.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparatively quiet, gives a great shave without preping the beard (they recommend shaving BEFORE you wash your face.  </li>
            <li>After a great deal of research I choose this razor for my husband as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>He has quite happily thrown out his last disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>2- Ergonomically, not as comfortable as the Norelco.</li>
            <li>my old nerelco lasted me a good 2 months before it needed a recharge.  </li>
            <li>I had another Braun years before, (which I loved), but it got old</li>
            <li>The trimmer is far superior on this Braun.</li>
            <li>It works just fine on the face but nothing special.</li>
            <li>All electric shaver companies say to allow 2 to 3 weeks for your skin and beard to adjust to the new shaver, but I can&#x27;t see how it can get any better than my test shave!    </li>
            <li>There is no question that the 8975 is superior as a trimmer and as a general shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an electric shaver in more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>My first Norelco rotary lasted many years.</li>
            <li>so you have to clean often or it will trickle out while you are shaving.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 8975 is as close as the blade (maybe closer), much quicker, and certainly more comfortable with no nicks or scrapes.  </li>
            <li>The floating head is better than the one on my last Braun and fits the contours of my face nicely.  </li>
            <li>it is all about the shave and this shaver cleanly  </li>
            <li>So far after useing the shaver for about one month, I find it better than most.</li>
            <li>No rinsing, washing or brushing to clean the heads.  </li>
            <li>Cheeks are smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and neck is adequate.</li>
            <li>It even gets those certain areas on my neck where the hair grows more at an angle to my skin.  </li>
            <li>That said, it was still a FANTASTIC first shave, and I would not hestitate to recommend (already have) this shaver to anyone!</li>
            <li>It does a great job, easily beating any shaver I&#x27;d previously used.  </li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is that it looks really cool too.</li>
            <li>It finally died on me, and based on the good reviews here and in Consumer Reports, I went for this razor.  </li>
            <li>The good things about this shaver are the short charging time, the 50-minute shaving time, and the quality of its construction.  </li>
            <li>It is good for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was really cool, and always wanted to try a Braun foil shaver without spending a lot of money, so I bought one.</li>
            <li>A true review would take about 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>This was true from day 1, so had nothing to do with a worn out battery.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated this one star lower but being that it shaves differently for everyone, I had to be fair and give it three stars.    </li>
            <li>can not say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li>3- The trimmer doesn&#x27;t project much above the razor, unlike the Norelco, which sticks up a good inch or so and allows you to see easier.</li>
            <li>It works much better and requires much less time to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life, quick recharge, lightweight &amp; fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for 10 months and it does a great job on my face although I do have to go over the same spots a couple times, which disagrees with their advertisement of the smart comb technology.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is a great product if you are one of those who shaves every other day/frequently...</li>
            <li>The other great thing is the charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>I have to run the shave over a given spot many times in many different directions.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco guy.</li>
            <li>Here is a quick shaving history for me.  </li>
            <li>But everyone&#x27;s face is different and everyone should try multiple shaving systems until they find the one that works best for them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for about four years now and I like it much more than older ones I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I choose the braun as it does live up to its reputation for quality.</li>
            <li>Norelco (are you reading this?), your short lived products prompted me to try Braun again and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I just used the Braun 8975 for the first time, and what a difference!</li>
            <li>Very close, comfortable, and quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It gave me about the same shave I got with the Norelco rotaries, but given that it is a battery operated single blade shaver, I was impressed, and wondered what a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Braun shaver would do.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>my old 6000 is actually better.  </li>
            <li>Good shave but be careful</li>
            <li>the shave is better than my old razor.  </li>
            <li>and I wondered if this would be worth the steep price.</li>
            <li>Retailers seem to only carry the complete system with the cleaner, so Amazon is a great place to get it.  </li>
            <li>My only success with this razor on my neck is to use the beard trimmer which has it&#x27;s own issues.    </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite shaver so far.</li>
            <li>I picked up the Braun 8975 last week and can honestly say I look forward to shaving in the morning.  </li>
            <li>short, the shave is not quite as good as a Mach 3 shave, but it is very close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington triple head shavers for a long time and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I get a better shave than I did with my old shaver, a Norelco 3 radial blade one.</li>
            <li>I had a norelco before, but this is by far better.</li>
            <li>For this price, I&#x27;d rather have something with a rubberized or soft grip exterior that feels better in the hand.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it works so much better than the 360, both on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I do not believe any electric razor can shave as closely as a bladed razor,however,This razor comes close and makes up for it&#x27;s shortcomings by being very handy with little to no fuss.</li>
            <li>My first one, which I still use as a travel back up, still works great and is probably 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;m going to be switching back to a nerelco very soon, as this is becoming more of a hassel to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and right out of the box</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so much easier to clean than the Braun.</li>
            <li>What I can tell you is that the shaver gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, is quiet and comfortable and even works great on my neck where other shavers suffered.</li>
            <li>My older Braun came with a charging stand, which made for a much neater look as it sat on the sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Still using this product 2 years later, and it still provides me with a good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best everyday shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close for an electronic shaver and the shave is both quick</li>
            <li>You are getting much better performance if you upgrade to an 8000 series shaver and it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because although it&#x27;s a fantastic razor, Braun does not present it to be a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>I had been using Norelco rotary razors for the last 12 years and was happy with them until my current model&#x27;s battery started going, and the trimmer stopped working.</li>
            <li>Looks like it is pretty much the same shaving technology with the ability to rinse it clean, more flexible foil, and some fancier styling.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it took a long time to get a smooth shave with it so after seeing several good reviews for the Braun 8975</li>
            <li>to clean, you just lift off the top, shake out the hairs, blow, brush a little, easy and fast.  </li>
            <li>I first had the 360 complete that had the same gillette blades and loved that one...</li>
            <li>Actual shaving wise all the new gadgets don&#x27;t seem to have done much.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave, smooth texture and isn&#x27;t super loud.  </li>
            <li>My face was as smooth as the proverbial \\&quot;baby&#x27;s butt\\&quot;, with no skin irritation (always a problem with the Norelcos for me) because the Gillette blade is so sharp, and the new foil system was so effective.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I expected a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My first the 3525 has been with me up till now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My first ever shaver was a Remmington followed by the Brauns.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people keep expecting that an electric razor will cut like a blade on the first pass.</li>
            <li>It was FAST and CLOSE!</li>
            <li>using this razor, the Braun 8975, shaving with it while pushing it against my face to make sure i get all the hairs, tiny particles of hair that has been shaved and saved inside the razor falls out.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works much better than my last two Brauns!</li>
            <li>All in all, I am ready to junkt it!</li>
            <li>The sonic shaver was nice, but since i am in the military and deploy, the head gets all gunked up without the cleaning station...and no one will ship the alcohol containing cleaner to Afghanistan or Iraq.  </li>
            <li>First some background...</li>
            <li>This is my first Braun razor.  </li>
            <li>I eventually received a top of the line Braun for a present.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a pretty close shave, but at what cost?</li>
            <li>And the final star for nifty hard-shell case with the brush :)  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I even dropped it in my dog&#x27;s water bowl when I first got it</li>
            <li>I tried so many different brands.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Braun, and depending upon its durability, this blows the Norelco&#x27;s out of the water.  </li>
            <li>Could not wait to switch back as the Braun shaves better and is easier on  your face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quiet, smooth shave, the 8975 is the one for you!</li>
            <li>It does shave better than my old razor, but that one needed a new shaving block (and battery, hence replacing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I know that I could have paid $30 more and purchased one with a self cleaning stand, but i didn&#x27;t, and all braun gives me is a cheap little cord?</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with the close shave, the ease of use, the long lasting charge and the pinch free shave.</li>
            <li>It is much better at keeping hairs that lay down out of sight by nipping them off and there is no question that it does a better job with everything else, even keeping in mind that the screen on my old shaver was two years</li>
            <li>This is the first foil shaver I know of that can REALLY shave longer hairs.</li>
            <li>plugged in (the plug end is large) and lying on the bathroom sink, which makes the sink area look cluttered.</li>
            <li>but I have to say the Panasonic is far better than the Braun or my old Norelco with new blades.</li>
            <li>a presentable little hunk of plastic would have been nice.</li>
            <li>It stays strong to the end of it&#x27;s charge... doesn&#x27;t start slowing down until the very, very end!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and simple to open when you need to clean it.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>But since it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as I expected, I cannot give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t very substantial either</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li>This unit does offer a much closer shave against my face than my Norelco 3 head unit ever did.  </li>
            <li>Also the head doesn&#x27;t collect too much stubble debris</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use a spray cleaner like Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver after each shave as a substitute at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>(Morning NPR news and listening to the wife is now much easier.)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do very well on the neck, but I&#x27;ve yet to see an electric that does.</li>
            <li>To be objective, I have not used all the available settings or features on the shaver yet.  </li>
            <li>I find that it works very well and is rather inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It seemed to miss a lot and what it did shave, it didn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very noisy, and the carrying case is bulky for travel.</li>
            <li>The razor has also given very close shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a much closer and smoother</li>
            <li>I can tell because my \\&quot;5:00 shadow\\&quot; is much reduced from before.</li>
            <li>He has to shave fast.</li>
            <li>I really expected more for an item with the Braun name on it.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Plus it didn&#x27;t shave much closer than my Norelco</li>
            <li>so I never used it much.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate the skin as much either.</li>
            <li>He said it really cuts a close shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is sturdy and works well; it shaves very close and the charge lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap plastics and it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like a razor you&#x27;d shell out triple digit prices for.</li>
            <li>The charge cord is nice since it can be used when the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, this model has a very nice sideburn trimmer which can get into tough to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for short facial hair (use once daily) with a consistent direction.</li>
            <li>Like most other shavers, however, it does not get neck hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes going across rather than up and down allows it to do a better job.</li>
            <li>It also shaves MUCH CLOSER than even a brand new top-of-the-line Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li>It sits in a stand (from the older version) which recharges and cleans the razor for you.</li>
            <li>My main concern is the life of the shaving foil.</li>
            <li>my shave was so quick and so close that i can&#x27;t wait for my beard to grow back again!</li>
            <li>About 10 years ago, I tried a high-end Braun foil shaver because I read good things about them, and found it just didn&#x27;t shave longer hairs (especially on the neck or if you went a few days without shaving).</li>
            <li>I believe that a single large cutter shaves more closely than two smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY support and recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to all that were looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very cheap, the mechanical actions are not smooth or refined.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>No electric razor can shave the neck as well as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ll gladly trade a little bit of roughness for kissing razor burn and gashes</li>
            <li>It just cant get the part directly under the nose very well.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the holes in the screen of the head seem to be the reason for the very close shave especially of those hairs that seem to lie contrary to the general slant of most of the hairs especially those found under the chin and in the neck area.   </li>
            <li>It shaves very well around my neck, which is usually where most problems for me are.</li>
            <li>Shave quality is 10 times better than a panasonic electric razor I used a few years ago.</li>
            <li>P.S. Bottom line - not recommended to anyone even with a slight case of sensitive skin. :)</li>
            <li>The razor charges quickly and the charge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>So, when my main Remington finally wore out I decided to try one of Braun&#x27;s higher end models.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the face, cuts in one pass, cuts and does not miss long hairs, and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>BUT MY NEW BRAUM IS</li>
            <li>They come out with new models and I like to to try them</li>
            <li>I had been using Norelco for years and needed a new shaver</li>
            <li>However, I know it takes a while to get used to a new shaver, so I gave it a month.</li>
            <li>The new blade is about $30.</li>
            <li>Its \\&quot;new technology\\</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very loud.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning brush works fine and lastly the plastic foil guard is nice, although if you try to pull it off wrong, the foil remains in the plastic guard as it comes off the shaver.      </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much better the new models were until I received the Braun 8975 for Christmas this past year.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting those hard to catch hairs that used to get away from my other shaver.</li>
            <li>My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately.</li>
            <li>I bought the Panasonic Vortex at the exact same time.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on Braun!</li>
            <li>About 10 years ago I bought a rotary blade razor from Norelco and was surprised how well and close the shave was!</li>
            <li>I started out using the Schick Protector when I first started growing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It may be more expensive than others but if its quality close shave, clean cuts, and reliability - this is the one.</li>
            <li>Since, I&#x27;m upgrading from a Braun 6550, for which I bought my first foil cutterblock after nearly 10 years of use (!)</li>
            <li>About the only positive I can say about the 360 Complete is the battery system.</li>
            <li>(I think it may have to do with the special Smart Foil feature, but I&#x27;m not sure.)  </li>
            <li>Hey it works a little better then the last generation of shavers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that the Braun is a bad product, as there are many satisfied customers based on the reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li>Charge hold better than expected, charging is faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>It replaced my 10 year old Braun 150 that my son droped on the bathroom tile.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the 9-year old Braun shaver that I bought it to replace.  </li>
            <li>He gets a close shave and loves that he can use it in the car if we are meeting friends for dinner or he has an appointment later in the day and wants to get rid of his \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve discharged it completely twice already.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely give me the close shave that one would think you would get.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, then this is not for you either,</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with the FreeControl.</li>
            <li>After researching on Braun&#x27;s website and reading reviews, trading off features for price, I decided on the 360 Complete (without the cleaning system that needed to be plugged in all the time.)    </li>
            <li>In fact, after shaving with the 360 Complete, I can take out my inexpensive FreeControl, and it finds and cuts the stubble that the 360 won&#x27;t cut any closer.    </li>
            <li>Bottom line: if you&#x27;re considering the 360 Complete, do yourself a favor and buy the FreeControl instead.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks ago I bought a 360º Complete Braun Shaver.   </li>
            <li>It does shave closer, quicker and is quieter than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>Not quite a year old.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still loud.  </li>
            <li>So far (3 weeks)</li>
            <li>I frequently find myself \\&quot;re-shaving\\&quot; with a blade after using this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was 60 days like Norelco offers.  </li>
            <li>The side-burn trimmer becomes essential to tackle hairs that lie really close to the skin in order to avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li>and wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>This thing is like a buzz-saw, so loud that, if my wife&#x27;s sleeping, I have to take it in another room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to loud noise in the morning,  check it out before buying.  </li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.</li>
            <li>After having used a rotary shaver for five years, I was pleasantly surprised at the difference this shaver made.  </li>
            <li>Two missing stars for: one ripping my face to pieces second week in a row and one for hard-shell case not being able to hold a cord (what&#x27;s the point of a dual-voltage shaver, if one has to stick the cord somewhere (not with the shaver)?)   </li>
            <li>(I have a little blower to clean out the hair cuttings).  </li>
            <li>Finally, the Braun is not very convenient to clean.     </li>
            <li>am all the more disappointed because Braun allegedly has a good reputation.  </li>
            <li>They last on average 4-5 years are very reliable and shave better than any other I have even tried.</li>
            <li>To clean, I follow the directions to loosen the shaver foil, but not remove, then hold the shaver horizontally over a sink and run for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>the braun is heavy/ solid and pretty quiet as well.</li>
            <li>So, first star for the close shave, second star for the battery time, second week</li>
            <li>With minimal effort, it cuts quietly and quickly.</li>
            <li>No matter how long I shave, and how thorough I am, it still misses and doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>Last but NOT least...</li>
            <li>So, my one priority for buying a new razor was having that same technology.    </li>
            <li>it also warns you when you have about three shaves left by means of the green charge indicater light....</li>
            <li>I decided to go with this model simply because I have buy cutter and foil replacements at every major retail department store where I live.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy and a little loud, but who cares because it gives me a great shave.    </li>
            <li>At first you need to charge them once a week, then twice, and so on until it&#x27;s every other day.</li>
            <li>It has two major problems.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d buy the Braun 360 again, if for no other reason than not giving Norelco my hard-earned money to get that battery soldered.</li>
            <li>I figured I would get a decent shaver because I would have it for so long, so I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t expect to have to go over the same area of my face numerous times in order to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s solution to make it less slipery was to put sharp bumps on the hard plastic case and it feels kind of rough and cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li>My current Norelco is over 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>I had recently bought a replacement blade and foil for my 2-year old 5000 series shaver.</li>
            <li>If I shave every day, it is barely acceptable as it leaves hair despite my going over and over my face for 10+ minutes.  </li>
            <li>1- the shave is closer than Norelco, requiring far fewer passes over the same territory.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the Norelcos use a standard small coiled power cord that&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I suspect this is on purpose to get you to buy expensive blade sets or a new shaver and generate more income for Norelco?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain about the Remmington, but of the other Braun shavers, this one is the quietest.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that BRAUN was the top in its class, as i&#x27;ve owned other ones in the past.  </li>
            <li>Which, of course, is necessary, because you have to shave a long time with it just to get a halfway decent shave.    </li>
            <li>I got a much closer shave than any other.  </li>
            <li>The other advantages are:    1) Much quieter than the 5000 series  2)</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve used the norelco, several other braun&#x27;s years ago and most recently i had a panasonic wet dry that died in just over one year.</li>
            <li>This is my second braum the last one was 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>The smart comb is supposed to lift hairs that are laying down and allow the shaver to cut them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face.</li>
            <li>Before this I had a Norelco automatic cleaning model, but I got really tired of ordering more cleaning fluid and changing the cleaning fluid</li>
            <li>There is certainly a lot less used up product going into landfills this way.</li>
            <li>This baby shaves REALLY close in half the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39, Caucasian with pretty heavy facial hair.  </li>
            <li>agree with others that the self cleaning thingy in higher Bruan models is gimmicky and not necessary, especially since it requires you to buy cleaner refills periodically.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a good razor, its just not really better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>The new Model 8975 cuts better, I like the Gilette cutting system</li>
            <li>I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer.</li>
            <li>- It takes about 3 times longer to shave than when I was using my Norelco.  - Very loud but that was listed in other reviews so that is my fault.  </li>

            <li> In spite of that, this is the best shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li> , I have to admit that I know someone who uses it and is very happy with it, it just doesn&#x27;t suit my type of skin.   </li>
            <li> It works great!</li>
            <li> This is a superb shaver.</li>
            <li> The 8975 is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> There is a high-end Panasonic shaver that gets very good reviews too.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is also very good.  </li>
            <li> The price and delivery from Amazon was very good.</li>
            <li> Although I have not used this product myself, my dad just loved it!</li>
            <li> Had some issues on delivery time but company was great to work with and refunded that to us also without any problem.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s still a great razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver....</li>
            <li> the 8975 is a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> He says it is a great shave; enjoys</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great features.</li>
            <li> Great protection for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a great buy gentlemen.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Before this, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> One thing that is great is the gillette blade technology.  </li>
            <li> Great consistant, quality shave.</li>
            <li> I am happy that he loves it</li>
            <li> It is really great.  </li>
            <li> Braun is always a great choice after all.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Very handy</li>
            <li> this seems to be a very nice shaver and cleanup</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very nice</li>
            <li> It was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The comfort and closeness of this shaver is remarkable.    </li>
            <li> Grip and operation wise</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the Braun would do a superior job on my neck</li>
            <li> Now for the good part...</li>
            <li> It has good grips on it.  </li>
            <li> The Braun is a good shaver</li>
            <li> Shave is as good as my brush and lather shave.  </li>
            <li> Good in a pinch but not as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> So given that, its a good value and has met all that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver available for the best price available.</li>
            <li> The razor has good power</li>
            <li> While there are some good features, it is not working for me.    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> A really good buy.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem getting a good shave even with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that others  gave me words of wisdom.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best available.</li>
            <li> Good close shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li> The cutter head and foils are fairly pricey to replace every year.</li>
            <li> Not so good for travelling.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a Braun 6000 based on the excellent Consumer Reports rating for this shaver and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> IT SURE DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is a razor I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the performance for the price.  </li>
            <li> Performs as advertised as is easy to operate and especially easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the shaver and the service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> My son requested it for christmas and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> battery life is amazing, I used it once a day for 2 1/2 weeks before it signaled that I needed a charge.  </li>
            <li> and it worked amazingly well</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver comes with a nice carrying case.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed with this razor which gives me a close, good shave.</li>
            <li> the trimmer works nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really good shave with one of those, and always found myself turning to a blade.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the carrying case also held the charging cord, but it doesn&#x27;t so I keep everything in a nylon bag when I am travelling.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electic razors and have always had to use a safety razor inbetween to feel like I had a good shave.</li>
            <li> If I skip a day, it is about as effective as a shoe.  </li>
            <li> 2- the design is nice  </li>
            <li> Consistent with the reviews, it does provide an excellent shave in that my skin is very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> good shaver and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have owned by far.  </li>
            <li> So to make a long story longer good shaver but not the best for me!</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 line of blade shavers is great, but they cut so close that any bumps get cut right off too.  </li>
            <li> This particular model Series 5 is very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, fast and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li> shaver itself is very comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a good charge and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Rather than sticking at that level I figured I&#x27;d try the better model to see what the benefits are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is it a worthwhile razor?  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> So, I am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used Panasonic, but Braun is definitely better than Philips.</li>
            <li> I think it shaves better than Norelco</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that it has Ni-MH batteries as opposed to Ni-Cd.  </li>
            <li> Better for the environment</li>
            <li> This one is better that any electric shavers and I tried (have) three others.  </li>
            <li> I switched from a razor to the Braun, but a razor provides a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to compare the shaves from each.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve since read many reviewers who like the cleaning system, I am more than satisfied without it.  </li>
            <li> It costs more</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve found overall.</li>
            <li> I know most people won&#x27;t believe me, but I&#x27;m going to say it anyway...</li>
            <li> I have used shavers for 16 years and I love this one.</li>
            <li> and I am quite satisfied with the quality and performance.    </li>
            <li> Now that I have passed the magical age of 40</li>
            <li> Many retail stores sell canned \\&quot;cleaner and lubricant\\&quot; for electric shavers that is a spray.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, even better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been happy with for years.    </li>
            <li> I can feel stubble with my hands, but the shaver won&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save money and get much better results.</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun shaver and the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Why spend more?</li>
            <li> Neither of these gave me a satisfying shave and took for ever to shave.  </li>
            <li> So I chose this Braun model and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> My 5000 series shaver ran noticeably faster (and better) when plugged in even though it could run un-plugged.</li>
            <li> And this Braun does that better than anything I&#x27;ve used at any price.</li>
            <li> The price was better than all the discount and warehouse stores I had searched.  </li>
            <li> There is no need for me to use a sfety razor at all any more.</li>
            <li> 100%.He says this is a much much better shaver than the ones he had before.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better buying transaction.</li>
            <li> Right from the beginning out of the box, this razor has provided me with a good close shave whith out razor burns.</li>
            <li> I wish my original Norelco had as nice of a case.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with high expectations, based on the great reviews here.    </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Its shave is not as close as the Norelco was, the  top easily dsengages.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is really good and shaves real close at most places on your face.</li>
            <li> I just finished with my first shave with the new braun and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the trimmer on it, but it shaves and cleans out just fine.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly the close shave is comparable to that of a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> For real world use, the Norelco is superior.</li>
            <li> This worked very well &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a series of high end shavers to compair and found this particular model to be the best for comfort,  &lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun uses a much more bulky cord/plugarrangement that&#x27;s not as travel friendly.</li>
            <li> easy to use......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shave and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin compared to my old cheap electric razor.</li>
            <li> is relatively easy for me</li>
            <li> It does an average job at best.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is fine and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the higher end Braun Pulsonic being a better shave for the $100 more it costs.  </li>
            <li> know there is a newer model out there, but this one is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> and it has held up just fine.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one yet - nearly as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> This shaver is light years ahead of the 150.  </li>
            <li> Braun was great about sending my $$ back.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard.</li>
            <li> I had a really cheap electirc razor I was using</li>
            <li> my skin is not as smooth as before.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need earplugs with this like I did with my cheap Remington.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparatively quiet, gives a great shave without preping the beard (they recommend shaving BEFORE you wash your face.  </li>
            <li> After a great deal of research I choose this razor for my husband as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> He has quite happily thrown out his last disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> 2- Ergonomically, not as comfortable as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> my old nerelco lasted me a good 2 months before it needed a recharge.  </li>
            <li> I had another Braun years before, (which I loved), but it got old</li>
            <li> The trimmer is far superior on this Braun.</li>
            <li> It works just fine on the face but nothing special.</li>
            <li> All electric shaver companies say to allow 2 to 3 weeks for your skin and beard to adjust to the new shaver, but I can&#x27;t see how it can get any better than my test shave!    </li>
            <li> There is no question that the 8975 is superior as a trimmer and as a general shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric shaver in more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> My first Norelco rotary lasted many years.</li>
            <li> so you have to clean often or it will trickle out while you are shaving.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 8975 is as close as the blade (maybe closer), much quicker, and certainly more comfortable with no nicks or scrapes.  </li>
            <li> The floating head is better than the one on my last Braun and fits the contours of my face nicely.  </li>
            <li> it is all about the shave and this shaver cleanly  </li>
            <li> So far after useing the shaver for about one month, I find it better than most.</li>
            <li> No rinsing, washing or brushing to clean the heads.  </li>
            <li> Cheeks are smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and neck is adequate.</li>
            <li> It even gets those certain areas on my neck where the hair grows more at an angle to my skin.  </li>
            <li> That said, it was still a FANTASTIC first shave, and I would not hestitate to recommend (already have) this shaver to anyone!</li>
            <li> It does a great job, easily beating any shaver I&#x27;d previously used.  </li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is that it looks really cool too.</li>
            <li> It finally died on me, and based on the good reviews here and in Consumer Reports, I went for this razor.  </li>
            <li> The good things about this shaver are the short charging time, the 50-minute shaving time, and the quality of its construction.  </li>
            <li> It is good for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was really cool, and always wanted to try a Braun foil shaver without spending a lot of money, so I bought one.</li>
            <li> A true review would take about 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> This was true from day 1, so had nothing to do with a worn out battery.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated this one star lower but being that it shaves differently for everyone, I had to be fair and give it three stars.    </li>
            <li> can not say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li> 3- The trimmer doesn&#x27;t project much above the razor, unlike the Norelco, which sticks up a good inch or so and allows you to see easier.</li>
            <li> It works much better and requires much less time to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life, quick recharge, lightweight &amp; fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for 10 months and it does a great job on my face although I do have to go over the same spots a couple times, which disagrees with their advertisement of the smart comb technology.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a great product if you are one of those who shaves every other day/frequently...</li>
            <li> The other great thing is the charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> I have to run the shave over a given spot many times in many different directions.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco guy.</li>
            <li> Here is a quick shaving history for me.  </li>
            <li> But everyone&#x27;s face is different and everyone should try multiple shaving systems until they find the one that works best for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about four years now and I like it much more than older ones I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I choose the braun as it does live up to its reputation for quality.</li>
            <li> Norelco (are you reading this?), your short lived products prompted me to try Braun again and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I just used the Braun 8975 for the first time, and what a difference!</li>
            <li> Very close, comfortable, and quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It gave me about the same shave I got with the Norelco rotaries, but given that it is a battery operated single blade shaver, I was impressed, and wondered what a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Braun shaver would do.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> my old 6000 is actually better.  </li>
            <li> Good shave but be careful</li>
            <li> the shave is better than my old razor.  </li>
            <li> and I wondered if this would be worth the steep price.</li>
            <li> Retailers seem to only carry the complete system with the cleaner, so Amazon is a great place to get it.  </li>
            <li> My only success with this razor on my neck is to use the beard trimmer which has it&#x27;s own issues.    </li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shaver so far.</li>
            <li> I picked up the Braun 8975 last week and can honestly say I look forward to shaving in the morning.  </li>
            <li> short, the shave is not quite as good as a Mach 3 shave, but it is very close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington triple head shavers for a long time and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I get a better shave than I did with my old shaver, a Norelco 3 radial blade one.</li>
            <li> I had a norelco before, but this is by far better.</li>
            <li> For this price, I&#x27;d rather have something with a rubberized or soft grip exterior that feels better in the hand.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it works so much better than the 360, both on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe any electric razor can shave as closely as a bladed razor,however,This razor comes close and makes up for it&#x27;s shortcomings by being very handy with little to no fuss.</li>
            <li> My first one, which I still use as a travel back up, still works great and is probably 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;m going to be switching back to a nerelco very soon, as this is becoming more of a hassel to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and right out of the box</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so much easier to clean than the Braun.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that the shaver gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, is quiet and comfortable and even works great on my neck where other shavers suffered.</li>
            <li> My older Braun came with a charging stand, which made for a much neater look as it sat on the sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Still using this product 2 years later, and it still provides me with a good, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best everyday shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close for an electronic shaver and the shave is both quick</li>
            <li> You are getting much better performance if you upgrade to an 8000 series shaver and it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because although it&#x27;s a fantastic razor, Braun does not present it to be a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco rotary razors for the last 12 years and was happy with them until my current model&#x27;s battery started going, and the trimmer stopped working.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is pretty much the same shaving technology with the ability to rinse it clean, more flexible foil, and some fancier styling.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it took a long time to get a smooth shave with it so after seeing several good reviews for the Braun 8975</li>
            <li> to clean, you just lift off the top, shake out the hairs, blow, brush a little, easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> I first had the 360 complete that had the same gillette blades and loved that one...</li>
            <li> Actual shaving wise all the new gadgets don&#x27;t seem to have done much.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave, smooth texture and isn&#x27;t super loud.  </li>
            <li> My face was as smooth as the proverbial \\&quot;baby&#x27;s butt\\&quot;, with no skin irritation (always a problem with the Norelcos for me) because the Gillette blade is so sharp, and the new foil system was so effective.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I expected a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My first the 3525 has been with me up till now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My first ever shaver was a Remmington followed by the Brauns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people keep expecting that an electric razor will cut like a blade on the first pass.</li>
            <li> It was FAST and CLOSE!</li>
            <li> using this razor, the Braun 8975, shaving with it while pushing it against my face to make sure i get all the hairs, tiny particles of hair that has been shaved and saved inside the razor falls out.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than my last two Brauns!</li>
            <li> All in all, I am ready to junkt it!</li>
            <li> The sonic shaver was nice, but since i am in the military and deploy, the head gets all gunked up without the cleaning station...and no one will ship the alcohol containing cleaner to Afghanistan or Iraq.  </li>
            <li> First some background...</li>
            <li> This is my first Braun razor.  </li>
            <li> I eventually received a top of the line Braun for a present.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a pretty close shave, but at what cost?</li>
            <li> And the final star for nifty hard-shell case with the brush :)  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I even dropped it in my dog&#x27;s water bowl when I first got it</li>
            <li> I tried so many different brands.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Braun, and depending upon its durability, this blows the Norelco&#x27;s out of the water.  </li>
            <li> Could not wait to switch back as the Braun shaves better and is easier on  your face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quiet, smooth shave, the 8975 is the one for you!</li>
            <li> It does shave better than my old razor, but that one needed a new shaving block (and battery, hence replacing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I know that I could have paid $30 more and purchased one with a self cleaning stand, but i didn&#x27;t, and all braun gives me is a cheap little cord?</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with the close shave, the ease of use, the long lasting charge and the pinch free shave.</li>
            <li> It is much better at keeping hairs that lay down out of sight by nipping them off and there is no question that it does a better job with everything else, even keeping in mind that the screen on my old shaver was two years</li>
            <li> This is the first foil shaver I know of that can REALLY shave longer hairs.</li>
            <li> plugged in (the plug end is large) and lying on the bathroom sink, which makes the sink area look cluttered.</li>
            <li> but I have to say the Panasonic is far better than the Braun or my old Norelco with new blades.</li>
            <li> a presentable little hunk of plastic would have been nice.</li>
            <li> It stays strong to the end of it&#x27;s charge... doesn&#x27;t start slowing down until the very, very end!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and simple to open when you need to clean it.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> But since it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as I expected, I cannot give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t very substantial either</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li> This unit does offer a much closer shave against my face than my Norelco 3 head unit ever did.  </li>
            <li> Also the head doesn&#x27;t collect too much stubble debris</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use a spray cleaner like Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver after each shave as a substitute at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li> (Morning NPR news and listening to the wife is now much easier.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do very well on the neck, but I&#x27;ve yet to see an electric that does.</li>
            <li> To be objective, I have not used all the available settings or features on the shaver yet.  </li>
            <li> I find that it works very well and is rather inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It seemed to miss a lot and what it did shave, it didn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very noisy, and the carrying case is bulky for travel.</li>
            <li> The razor has also given very close shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a much closer and smoother</li>
            <li> I can tell because my \\&quot;5:00 shadow\\&quot; is much reduced from before.</li>
            <li> He has to shave fast.</li>
            <li> I really expected more for an item with the Braun name on it.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> Plus it didn&#x27;t shave much closer than my Norelco</li>
            <li> so I never used it much.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate the skin as much either.</li>
            <li> He said it really cuts a close shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is sturdy and works well; it shaves very close and the charge lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap plastics and it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like a razor you&#x27;d shell out triple digit prices for.</li>
            <li> The charge cord is nice since it can be used when the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, this model has a very nice sideburn trimmer which can get into tough to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for short facial hair (use once daily) with a consistent direction.</li>
            <li> Like most other shavers, however, it does not get neck hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes going across rather than up and down allows it to do a better job.</li>
            <li> It also shaves MUCH CLOSER than even a brand new top-of-the-line Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> It sits in a stand (from the older version) which recharges and cleans the razor for you.</li>
            <li> My main concern is the life of the shaving foil.</li>
            <li> my shave was so quick and so close that i can&#x27;t wait for my beard to grow back again!</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago, I tried a high-end Braun foil shaver because I read good things about them, and found it just didn&#x27;t shave longer hairs (especially on the neck or if you went a few days without shaving).</li>
            <li> I believe that a single large cutter shaves more closely than two smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY support and recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to all that were looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very cheap, the mechanical actions are not smooth or refined.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> No electric razor can shave the neck as well as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ll gladly trade a little bit of roughness for kissing razor burn and gashes</li>
            <li> It just cant get the part directly under the nose very well.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the holes in the screen of the head seem to be the reason for the very close shave especially of those hairs that seem to lie contrary to the general slant of most of the hairs especially those found under the chin and in the neck area.   </li>
            <li> It shaves very well around my neck, which is usually where most problems for me are.</li>
            <li> Shave quality is 10 times better than a panasonic electric razor I used a few years ago.</li>
            <li> P.S. Bottom line - not recommended to anyone even with a slight case of sensitive skin. :)</li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and the charge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> So, when my main Remington finally wore out I decided to try one of Braun&#x27;s higher end models.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the face, cuts in one pass, cuts and does not miss long hairs, and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> BUT MY NEW BRAUM IS</li>
            <li> They come out with new models and I like to to try them</li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco for years and needed a new shaver</li>
            <li> However, I know it takes a while to get used to a new shaver, so I gave it a month.</li>
            <li> The new blade is about $30.</li>
            <li> Its \\&quot;new technology\\</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very loud.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning brush works fine and lastly the plastic foil guard is nice, although if you try to pull it off wrong, the foil remains in the plastic guard as it comes off the shaver.      </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much better the new models were until I received the Braun 8975 for Christmas this past year.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of getting those hard to catch hairs that used to get away from my other shaver.</li>
            <li> My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic Vortex at the exact same time.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on Braun!</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I bought a rotary blade razor from Norelco and was surprised how well and close the shave was!</li>
            <li> I started out using the Schick Protector when I first started growing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It may be more expensive than others but if its quality close shave, clean cuts, and reliability - this is the one.</li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;m upgrading from a Braun 6550, for which I bought my first foil cutterblock after nearly 10 years of use (!)</li>
            <li> About the only positive I can say about the 360 Complete is the battery system.</li>
            <li> (I think it may have to do with the special Smart Foil feature, but I&#x27;m not sure.)  </li>
            <li> Hey it works a little better then the last generation of shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that the Braun is a bad product, as there are many satisfied customers based on the reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li> Charge hold better than expected, charging is faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> It replaced my 10 year old Braun 150 that my son droped on the bathroom tile.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the 9-year old Braun shaver that I bought it to replace.  </li>
            <li> He gets a close shave and loves that he can use it in the car if we are meeting friends for dinner or he has an appointment later in the day and wants to get rid of his \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve discharged it completely twice already.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely give me the close shave that one would think you would get.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, then this is not for you either,</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with the FreeControl.</li>
            <li> After researching on Braun&#x27;s website and reading reviews, trading off features for price, I decided on the 360 Complete (without the cleaning system that needed to be plugged in all the time.)    </li>
            <li> In fact, after shaving with the 360 Complete, I can take out my inexpensive FreeControl, and it finds and cuts the stubble that the 360 won&#x27;t cut any closer.    </li>
            <li> Bottom line: if you&#x27;re considering the 360 Complete, do yourself a favor and buy the FreeControl instead.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks ago I bought a 360º Complete Braun Shaver.   </li>
            <li> It does shave closer, quicker and is quieter than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> Not quite a year old.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still loud.  </li>
            <li> So far (3 weeks)</li>
            <li> I frequently find myself \\&quot;re-shaving\\&quot; with a blade after using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was 60 days like Norelco offers.  </li>
            <li> The side-burn trimmer becomes essential to tackle hairs that lie really close to the skin in order to avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li> and wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a buzz-saw, so loud that, if my wife&#x27;s sleeping, I have to take it in another room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to loud noise in the morning,  check it out before buying.  </li>
            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.</li>
            <li> After having used a rotary shaver for five years, I was pleasantly surprised at the difference this shaver made.  </li>
            <li> Two missing stars for: one ripping my face to pieces second week in a row and one for hard-shell case not being able to hold a cord (what&#x27;s the point of a dual-voltage shaver, if one has to stick the cord somewhere (not with the shaver)?)   </li>
            <li> (I have a little blower to clean out the hair cuttings).  </li>
            <li> Finally, the Braun is not very convenient to clean.     </li>
            <li> am all the more disappointed because Braun allegedly has a good reputation.  </li>
            <li> They last on average 4-5 years are very reliable and shave better than any other I have even tried.</li>
            <li> To clean, I follow the directions to loosen the shaver foil, but not remove, then hold the shaver horizontally over a sink and run for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> the braun is heavy/ solid and pretty quiet as well.</li>
            <li> So, first star for the close shave, second star for the battery time, second week</li>
            <li> With minimal effort, it cuts quietly and quickly.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I shave, and how thorough I am, it still misses and doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> Last but NOT least...</li>
            <li> So, my one priority for buying a new razor was having that same technology.    </li>
            <li> it also warns you when you have about three shaves left by means of the green charge indicater light....</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this model simply because I have buy cutter and foil replacements at every major retail department store where I live.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy and a little loud, but who cares because it gives me a great shave.    </li>
            <li> At first you need to charge them once a week, then twice, and so on until it&#x27;s every other day.</li>
            <li> It has two major problems.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d buy the Braun 360 again, if for no other reason than not giving Norelco my hard-earned money to get that battery soldered.</li>
            <li> I figured I would get a decent shaver because I would have it for so long, so I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t expect to have to go over the same area of my face numerous times in order to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s solution to make it less slipery was to put sharp bumps on the hard plastic case and it feels kind of rough and cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li> My current Norelco is over 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> I had recently bought a replacement blade and foil for my 2-year old 5000 series shaver.</li>
            <li> If I shave every day, it is barely acceptable as it leaves hair despite my going over and over my face for 10+ minutes.  </li>
            <li> 1- the shave is closer than Norelco, requiring far fewer passes over the same territory.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the Norelcos use a standard small coiled power cord that&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I suspect this is on purpose to get you to buy expensive blade sets or a new shaver and generate more income for Norelco?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain about the Remmington, but of the other Braun shavers, this one is the quietest.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that BRAUN was the top in its class, as i&#x27;ve owned other ones in the past.  </li>
            <li> Which, of course, is necessary, because you have to shave a long time with it just to get a halfway decent shave.    </li>
            <li> I got a much closer shave than any other.  </li>
            <li> The other advantages are:    1) Much quieter than the 5000 series  2)</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve used the norelco, several other braun&#x27;s years ago and most recently i had a panasonic wet dry that died in just over one year.</li>
            <li> This is my second braum the last one was 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> The smart comb is supposed to lift hairs that are laying down and allow the shaver to cut them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face.</li>
            <li> Before this I had a Norelco automatic cleaning model, but I got really tired of ordering more cleaning fluid and changing the cleaning fluid</li>
            <li> There is certainly a lot less used up product going into landfills this way.</li>
            <li> This baby shaves REALLY close in half the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, Caucasian with pretty heavy facial hair.  </li>
            <li> agree with others that the self cleaning thingy in higher Bruan models is gimmicky and not necessary, especially since it requires you to buy cleaner refills periodically.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a good razor, its just not really better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> The new Model 8975 cuts better, I like the Gilette cutting system</li>
            <li> I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer.</li>
            <li> - It takes about 3 times longer to shave than when I was using my Norelco.  - Very loud but that was listed in other reviews so that is my fault.  </li>
            <li> previously that was 20 years old!!</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and would recomend it highly.</li>
            <li> I thought I would switch to electric just long enought for my face to heal and then switch back.  </li>
            <li> In the long run this shaver will actually save money with the rising cost of disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> After doing a bit of research on the various models and reading the customer reviews (on this site), I decided on the 8975, due to the new foil, Gillette blade technology, power comb, and active head.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if I buy a $40 or $100 Norelco, they just don&#x27;t last very long anymore.</li>
            <li> Not what you would expect for the money and less than a year old.  </li>
            <li> Patches of hair are completely missed unless I work the shaver over the same spot for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I do have to go over areas a few times, causing irritation, but irritation with the Norelco isn&#x27;t anywhere near the same as it is with the Braun.      </li>
            <li> It has two foil heads and flat part between them that is supposed to cut long hairs.</li>
            <li> After a while, it tends to make the hand feel strange.   </li>
            <li> is that the battery does not seem to hold out for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> The technology has come a long way.</li>
            <li> Probably waited too long to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Norelco user who also owned a Braun a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Braun shaver user.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Norelco, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it any more (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> Remington, altough a good close shaver, the shaving head disintergrates after a few months and they are very expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> On the negative side though, it takes a lot long to get to that point than it did with my older rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> The next one lasted only a few years.</li>
            <li> He is not new to electric shavers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the benefits are limited.  </li>
            <li> And the last several have only gone about a year before the blades go dull, the batteries start to give out, or both.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the fact it took 7 weeks for the replacement charger to arrive.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought the Braun 8975 and have used it for a couple of months now every day.  </li>
            <li> When it gets down to low, I can shave with it plugged in if need be.</li>
            <li> It cuts as close as a blade for me without much trouble, even gets the long hairs on the back of the neck, does edges of the ear too.  </li>
            <li> So the result is that I use the shaver for a few days and then when the hair grows long enough on my neck, I use a razor to get rid of those pesky hairs.      </li>
            <li> He usually gets the models that are around $50-$70.This time I chose the more expensive model because of the reviews people wrote.</li>
            <li> But, knowing what I know now I would have stuck with the next model level down as there really is no difference where it counts.</li>
            <li> only have a few small gripes so far.</li>
            <li> The smart comb does a worse job on my neck, not working whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to (since i&#x27;m only shaving for 5 minutes a day), I would have expected it to last at least a few weeks without a recharge.   </li>
            <li> I also prefer shavers with traditional foils that have round holes (since I never got razor burns with those).      </li>
            <li> This model seems harder to find, by the way.  </li>
            <li> And so for the last 30 years or so, I&#x27;ve used electric razors everyday.  </li>
            <li> I just got it, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it will hold up, or the battery life, but it&#x27;s really no contest against the Norelco&#x27;s for the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> Switched back to Braun after buying a Remington to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> I even recently shaved a few times with a quad-blade wet razor</li>
            <li> but I have to say I think it is worth it, and the 8975 without the unnecessary cleaning system saves a few $$.  </li>
            <li> And I mean, I would go over the missed hair at different angles, pressures, etc., five or ten times before the razor would catch it.</li>
            <li> For the last few years, i&#x27;ve been using a norelco, but got tired of the &#x27;3 blades spinning&#x27; action as it was difficult to clean.   </li>
            <li> I tried the less expensive versions, but this version is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For the past 20 years I&#x27;ve used Norelco, got roughly about 5 years out of each,it seems that Norelco must be cutting corners somewhere because their shavers didn&#x27;t do such a great job shaving me, I have a real tough beard and this Braun goes through it</li>
            <li> For the past ten years, I used a Norelco rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical the first time I tried this, but followed the directions</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Money is not a big driver for me, but an added benefit is that you will likely save money over the life of the electric shaver compared to using the expensive multi-blade shaving systems such as Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> That is the reason I gave up on the Braun: it does 95% of the job quickly--and then you struggle with the other 5%.</li>
            <li> Difficult areas on the neck are challenging to shave without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> previously i had the very same braun shaver, but it feels like the battery and the quality of the foil has improved these past 2 years.</li>
            <li> This unit comes with a padded hard case that is just slightly larger than the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li> The second one also worked well but broke when my son dropped it onto a hard tile floor.</li>
            <li> the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t collect the shavings as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Braun because I wanted a top-of-the-line unit but without the silly washing system, which adds too much complexity.</li>
            <li> after receiving the shaver, I charged it for the recommended initial charge time of (at least) 4 hours, then test shaved with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure any electric shaver will shave as close as a blade as long as there is that foil between the blades and your face.</li>
            <li> , it has lasted me 2 weeks before it went down to a 0 charge.  </li>
            <li> I shaved for 5 weeks before I ran the charge down to less than 25%.  </li>
            <li> (1) the razor cannot shave my face closely; (2) the hair which is shaved turns to powder within the mechanism and slowly dumps out on me while I&#x27;m shaving; (3) the charge does not last more than 4-5 uses of maybe 5 minutes per use; (4) the razor is far noisier than a rotary; (5) the clipper configuration is very awkward and nearly useless.      </li>
            <li> The negatives are slight.  </li>
            <li> During the past year I have tried several of the newer Norelco&#x27;s but just was not pleased.</li>
            <li> (less irritation) shave with the 8000.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase a different less expensive brand next time.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present to replace one of my battery-operated foil shavers which had to retire for the same reason I&#x27;m gonna retire this expensive 8975 (</li>
            <li> The 360 is a little louder than previous rotary shavers I&#x27;ve used, but it is not noticibly noisy.</li>
            <li> It just takes 10 minutes as opposed to 5 minutes, and your hand vibrates a little.  </li>
            <li> It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> It gets really cold in Afghanistan and the last thing i want to do is walk through the snow twice to go back and retrieve a power cord.      </li>
            <li> The shave is close after a few passes, depending on where you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> I still have to take a few passes.  </li>
            <li> It prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on in your suitcase, which I&#x27;m told causes trouble for sensors in the airline cargo bays.  </li>
            <li> Someone suggested to me I could expedite the \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; process to an electric shave by letting my whiskers grow out a few days before shaving with the electric and that seem to work.  </li>
            <li> Although this item is not cheap, it has worked well for me since I bought it @1</li>
            <li> was a messy chore that needed to be done all too often.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco has a round body which you can wrap your fingers and thumb around.</li>
            <li> I came to this razor after using a Braun 6000 series for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but definately the only way to go.</li>
            <li> It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED A NUMBEDR OF SHAVERS IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> I bought it two weeks ago and the difference between the braun 8975 and my prior remington microscreen is difficult to describe.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burns from my electric razor!I  </li>
            <li> with very few passes.  </li>
            <li> My first shave was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sad to say, it is far worse.</li>
            <li> The grip on the shaver is not very good.</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco retained at least 97% of the hair within the head, looking at the design of this shaver, it is not surprising that this happens.    </li>
            <li> Included is a hard carrying case, a charge cord, a cleaning brush, and a plastic foil guard.  </li>
            <li> and I wish all shavers came with the hard variety.  </li>
            <li> if, a few years down the line, I find out I&#x27;ve got to get it soldered as well, I&#x27;m going to be very annoyed.</li>
            <li> I am someone who spent a lot of money on expensive electric razors over time and never stuck by them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlikely anyone who has always shaved with a wet razor will switch to anything electric, but for the electric crowd, I can&#x27;t see this shaver being beat.  </li>
            <li> No more nicks and cuts!</li>
            <li> If you just need to replace your actual razor, the base stand from your previous 8000 series</li>
            <li> I just hate using a razor and shaving cream for the little bit of facial hair that I have.  </li>
            <li> I tried a new Remington and the stupid hair trimmer keeps popping up because the switch for it is in the way of holding it.  </li>
            <li> I travel and that is not good.   </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with having a slick looking shaver on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> After 2 months I&#x27;m disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......</li>
            <li> I have had this Braun for 2 months and am less than unhappy.  </li>
            <li> This is very annoying to shave only to look down at your shirt and sink to see cut hairs all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I have course hair and an extremely tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the razor for the following reasons:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a little problem with cutting around my adams apple.  </li>
            <li> You then remove the foil and cutting blade then brush out the shaver area of the few remaining clippings.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer, like everyone I&#x27;ve tried before, performs poorly.  </li>
            <li> After awhile, I grew tired using the \\&quot;goo,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I got tired of forking over $40 for a replacement, plus the time to bring it to a repair shop, so I thought I&#x27;d try a Braun.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts longer than before and the foil is giving me a cleaner and less painful shave.</li>
            <li> 4- comes with a small hard-shell case, unlike Norelco&#x27;s bulky case which makes it difficult to pack for a trip  Con:  1- Noisy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I did not buy the model with the expensive cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong; not quite blade close.</li>
            <li> purchased a Panasonic 8077 with the liquid head washers, including the expensive soap inserts.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just replace a Norelco battery, they have to be soldered in, a lousy way for them to make money.</li>
            <li> It cuts a very tough beard with ease.</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 previous Braun models, this is the WORST model I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave every day, you will have problems cutting the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> I then spray the cutting blades with Shaver Saver and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> 2000,it wouldn&#x27;t wear out, I replaced the cutting system once a year.</li>
            <li> I can go 2 days without shaving and it has no problem cutting through the growth.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were crazy</li>
            <li> Have tried a very expensive</li>
            <li> The electrical charger went bad about 6 months ago, so I called Braun.</li>
            <li> We have NEVER wrote a review but this shaver was so bad I wanted to hopefully save someone else some time and money &amp; pain.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> ATT&#x27;N: for people reading this review - I&#x27;m not claiming it&#x27;s a bad shaver</li>
            <li> However, I was a bit disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I am disappointed at the build quality of this product.</li>
            <li> try this one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is that I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is just worthless at shaving neck hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to be the guy whose shaver caused the flight to be delayed.  </li>
            <li> Got this razor as a replacement for the Braun 8585, which came with the Clean&amp;Renew cleaning base thing....</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace the sonic shaver made by Braun that I purchased and hated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed...  </li>
            <li> The worst part of the shave being around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Powercomb\\&quot; technology does</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to our son and he loves it! Had some issues on delivery time but company was great to work with and refunded that to us also without any problem.</li>
            <li> I have just bought Braun 8975 shaver.  It replaced my 10 year old Braun 150 that my son droped on the bathroom tile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wow!  What a difference between the two shvers!  This shaver is light years ahead of the 150.  It is very gentle on the face, cuts in one pass, cuts and does not miss long hairs, and shaves very close.  This shaver is the Mercedes Benz of shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver comes with a nice carrying case.  Do not know what type of rechargable battery it uses, my 150 used NiCd, which of course dies prematurely.  The grip on the shaver is not very good.</li>
            <li> I came to this razor after using a Braun 6000 series for the past 4 years.  Rather than sticking at that level I figured I&#x27;d try the better model to see what the benefits are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the benefits are limited.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a good razor, its just not really better than my old one.  Grip and operation wise my old 6000 is actually better.  Simpler where it needs to be.  Actual shaving wise all the new gadgets don&#x27;t seem to have done much.  It does shave better than my old razor, but that one needed a new shaving block (and battery, hence replacing it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it a worthwhile razor?  Definitely, thats why I gave it 4 stars.  But, knowing what I know now I would have stuck with the next model level down as there really is no difference where it counts.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Norelco, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it any more (no pun intended).  I chose this one because of a friends recommendation.  It&#x27;s wonderful, fast and smooth on my skin.  Very close shave, smooth texture and isn&#x27;t super loud.  It&#x27;s easy to operate and simple to open when you need to clean it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life is amazing, I used it once a day for 2 1/2 weeks before it signaled that I needed a charge.  I HIGHLY support and recommend this shaver.  The icing on the cake is that it looks really cool too. Nothing wrong with having a slick looking shaver on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed with this razor which gives me a close, good shave. I gave this razor a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating because it does not come with a charging stand, which forces me to leave it plugged in (the plug end is large) and lying on the bathroom sink, which makes the sink area look cluttered. My older Braun came with a charging stand, which made for a much neater look as it sat on the sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Still using this product 2 years later, and it still provides me with a good, close shave.  So, I am still satisfied with this product. The electrical charger went bad about 6 months ago, so I called Braun. The rep I spoke to was helpful and she said she would send me a replacement charger - at no cost. That was great! Only down side is the fact it took 7 weeks for the replacement charger to arrive.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever used. Have tried a very expensive Philips 3-head shaver. Really didn&#x27;t work for me. Haven&#x27;t used Panasonic, but Braun is definitely better than Philips.</li>
            <li> Good shave but be careful - it cut me twice. It has two foil heads and flat part between them that is supposed to cut long hairs. I twice got cut by this. Braun was great about sending my $$ back. I&#x27;m back to norelco. I think it shaves better than Norelco but if I want to cut myself, I&#x27;ll use a blade.</li>
            <li> I am someone who spent a lot of money on expensive electric razors over time and never stuck by them.  This one actually works as well as a blade.  No kidding.  Expensive, but definately the only way to go.</li>
            <li> For the past ten years, I used a Norelco rotary shaver.  It finally died on me, and based on the good reviews here and in Consumer Reports, I went for this razor.  Consistent with the reviews, it does provide an excellent shave in that my skin is very smooth afterwards.  On the negative side though, it takes a lot long to get to that point than it did with my older rotary shaver.  I have to run the shave over a given spot many times in many different directions.  Also, they could have used some type of vibration damping (rubber over-mold) to lessen the vibrations in your hand.  After a while, it tends to make the hand feel strange.   All in all, it&#x27;s still a great razor.  It just takes 10 minutes as opposed to 5 minutes, and your hand vibrates a little.  I do love the fact that it has Ni-MH batteries as opposed to Ni-Cd.  Better for the environment and they won&#x27;t die on you two years into the life of the razor</li>
            <li> Greetings, I have used rotary razors for my entire shaving life.  I&#x27;m 39, Caucasian with pretty heavy facial hair.  I finally broke down and bought the Braun 8975 and have used it for a couple of months now every day.  I am very unhappy with the razor for the following reasons:  (1) the razor cannot shave my face closely; (2) the hair which is shaved turns to powder within the mechanism and slowly dumps out on me while I&#x27;m shaving; (3) the charge does not last more than 4-5 uses of maybe 5 minutes per use; (4) the razor is far noisier than a rotary; (5) the clipper configuration is very awkward and nearly useless.      Just my two cents.  I&#x27;m going to give this Braun razor away and buy a rotary.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with high expectations, based on the great reviews here.    However, I was a bit disappointed with it.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the 9-year old Braun shaver that I bought it to replace.  Plus, it gave me razor burns.  (I think it may have to do with the special Smart Foil feature, but I&#x27;m not sure.)  So, I have given this shaver to my younger brother.    Personally, I prefer single-foil shavers to double-foil ones.  I believe that a single large cutter shaves more closely than two smaller ones.  This is based on my experience with 4-5 shavers.  I also prefer shavers with traditional foils that have round holes (since I never got razor burns with those).      The good things about this shaver are the short charging time, the 50-minute shaving time, and the quality of its construction.  But since it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as I expected, I cannot give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> previously i had the very same braun shaver, but it feels like the battery and the quality of the foil has improved these past 2 years. the battery lasts longer than before and the foil is giving me a cleaner and less painful shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  Try it and you will see.  Really good.</li>
            <li> Well I have this for almost 2 years now and it still working just find. I&#x27;d used it as a shaver and to shave my head. I&#x27;m not hirsute so I&#x27;d only used it twice a week as a shaver and once every 3 months to shave my head. I haven&#x27;t replace the foil or cutter since I purchased it. This is the second shaver I had by Braun and they all last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  He hasn&#x27;t used another razor since.  He gets a close shave and loves that he can use it in the car if we are meeting friends for dinner or he has an appointment later in the day and wants to get rid of his \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Shipping and receipt of article excellent.  This is my second braum the last one was 20 years old.  This one is better that any electric shavers and I tried (have) three others.  The cut is v/good for an electric shaver, but not as close as manual razors. It is good for daily use.  Charge hold better than expected, charging is faster than expected.  One concern, the shaver&#x27;s case does not have room for charger cord.  I travel and that is not good.   &lt;br /&gt;Overall the shaver is excellent for an electic shaver. &lt;br /&gt;Gene</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on all the great reviews. After using this product for a month I can&#x27;t understand how these reviews came about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I am disappointed at the build quality of this product. The silver paintwork is already peeling off. I thought considering the cost of this product that it was made of metal. The silver panels along the side are silver painted plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face. The worst part of the shave being around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Powercomb\\&quot; technology does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this product does not equate to quality and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product.</li>
            <li> Great shaver....easy to use......only complain I have is that the battery does not seem to hold out for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> i switched to a foil after using norelco triple heads for the last 10 years.  i picked this model because i don&#x27;t have the room for the cleaning setup.  the shave is better than my old razor.  the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t collect the shavings as well.  the trimmer works nicely.  good shaver and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving electric since 1936!  I have a light beard. My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately. I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer. I bought a Braun 8975 recently so I could leave it at my vacation house. It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.  After 2 months I&#x27;m disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......I get 5 shaves only before I have to recharge and I&#x27;ve discharged it completely twice already.  Also, it does not cut any closer than my 5520 which incidentally gives me about two weeks of shaving before I must recharge it. I&#x27;m sorry I got the 8975. It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment. The case isn&#x27;t very substantial either and it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I expected a closer shave.  I switched from a razor to the Braun, but a razor provides a much better shave.  If you don&#x27;t shave every day, you will have problems cutting the longer hairs.  I also didn&#x27;t expect to have to go over the same area of my face numerous times in order to get a decent shave.  However, the shaver is well made and does have an excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> Braun has always made a quality razor and this one is another example of their quality products &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The shaver is fine and works as advertised.  After using a razor blade for years, the electric shaver leaves something to be desired. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close, but then, I suppose no electric shaver does.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED A NUMBEDR OF SHAVERS IN THE PAST BUT MY NEW BRAUM IS IS ABSOLUTY  BEST THAT I HAVE EVEER HAD. IT SURE DOES A GREAT JOB. 1OO% SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and the charge lasts for a long time. I don&#x27;t have to buy any cleaning solution. It cuts a very tough beard with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 8975 for about 6 weeks now and I am very pleased with my purchase.  This unit does offer a much closer shave against my face than my Norelco 3 head unit ever did.  I shaved for 5 weeks before I ran the charge down to less than 25%.  The negatives are slight.  I&#x27;ve had a little problem with cutting around my adams apple.  I use the trimmer for that now.   Also the head doesn&#x27;t collect too much stubble debris so you have to clean often or it will trickle out while you are shaving.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is a razor I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Braun because I wanted a top-of-the-line unit but without the silly washing system, which adds too much complexity. The Braun 8975 delivers in spades.    Since, I&#x27;m upgrading from a Braun 6550, for which I bought my first foil cutterblock after nearly 10 years of use (!), I can tell you that it&#x27;s a quantum leap up in shaving performance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this thing. I had a really cheap electirc razor I was using and I wondered if this would be worth the steep price. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased! It&#x27;s a great shave and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin compared to my old cheap electric razor. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very close, comfortable, and quick shave.  I upgraded from a Braun 6000 based on the excellent Consumer Reports rating for this shaver and was not disappointed.  I even recently shaved a few times with a quad-blade wet razor so I&#x27;m able to compare the shaves from each.  The Braun 8975 is as close as the blade (maybe closer), much quicker, and certainly more comfortable with no nicks or scrapes.  The comfort and closeness of this shaver is remarkable.    The Model 8975 does not come with the cleaning and recharging system.  I just don&#x27;t have a convenient space for this and it just seemed like a way to get you to buy supplies from Braun.  While I&#x27;ve since read many reviewers who like the cleaning system, I am more than satisfied without it.  I use a spray cleaner like Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver after each shave as a substitute at a much lower cost.  To clean, I follow the directions to loosen the shaver foil, but not remove, then hold the shaver horizontally over a sink and run for a few seconds.  I was skeptical the first time I tried this, but followed the directions and it worked amazingly well - the shaver clippings just fall into the sink.  You then remove the foil and cutting blade then brush out the shaver area of the few remaining clippings.  I then spray the cutting blades with Shaver Saver and I&#x27;m done.  Only takes a few seconds for the whole process and no need to brush the blades.    It&#x27;s unlikely anyone who has always shaved with a wet razor will switch to anything electric, but for the electric crowd, I can&#x27;t see this shaver being beat.  It costs more but I have to say I think it is worth it, and the 8975 without the unnecessary cleaning system saves a few $$.  This model seems harder to find, by the way.  Retailers seem to only carry the complete system with the cleaner, so Amazon is a great place to get it.  I can&#x27;t imagine the higher end Braun Pulsonic being a better shave for the $100 more it costs.  Looks like it is pretty much the same shaving technology with the ability to rinse it clean, more flexible foil, and some fancier styling.  Bottom line - the 8975 is a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Braun electric razor.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for well over 15 years and I am completely satisfied.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much better the new models were until I received the Braun 8975 for Christmas this past year.  It works much better and requires much less time to get a good shave.  Would highly recommend this product to all that were looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> The Braun 8975 is the third Braun I have owned. My first the 3525 has been with me up till now. There is no question that the 8975 is superior as a trimmer and as a general shaver. It is much better at keeping hairs that lay down out of sight by nipping them off and there is no question that it does a better job with everything else, even keeping in mind that the screen on my old shaver was two years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first ever shaver was a Remmington followed by the Brauns. I can&#x27;t say for certain about the Remmington, but of the other Braun shavers, this one is the quietest. (Morning NPR news and listening to the wife is now much easier.)</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun,they never break. They come out with new models and I like to to try them but the last last one I had was Model 7505 purchased in November 2000,it wouldn&#x27;t wear out, I replaced the cutting system once a year. The new Model 8975 cuts better, I like the Gilette cutting system,you get a closer shave. The newest model Polaris in my oppinion is over priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people keep expecting that an electric razor will cut like a blade on the first pass. I also don&#x27;t understand why some people say it does. I use an electric because you don&#x27;t have to take the time to lather up, shave, and rinse. This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve found overall. The shave is close after a few passes, depending on where you&#x27;re shaving. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do very well on the neck, but I&#x27;ve yet to see an electric that does. Sometimes going across rather than up and down allows it to do a better job. The 360 is a little louder than previous rotary shavers I&#x27;ve used, but it is not noticibly noisy. It keeps a good charge and charges fairly quickly. Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best everyday shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 months and should have returned it after the trial period.  It is just worthless at shaving neck hair. Even if I shaved twice a day, it doesn&#x27;t even touch them. I have to pass over and over again to get any and then my skin is quite irritated.  My only success with this razor on my neck is to use the beard trimmer which has it&#x27;s own issues.    It works just fine on the face but nothing special. I still have to take a few passes.  It does seem well constructed and packaged well. I wish my original Norelco had as nice of a case. I was hoping the Braun would do a superior job on my neck but I&#x27;m sad to say, it is far worse. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for something that works.</li>
            <li> Every electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever bought or been given as a gift, has always been a Norelco rotary. I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really good shave with one of those, and always found myself turning to a blade. My blade of choice for the last number of years has been the Mach3.    Recently, my boss was given a Braun 370 PocketGo travel shaver. I thought it was really cool, and always wanted to try a Braun foil shaver without spending a lot of money, so I bought one. It gave me about the same shave I got with the Norelco rotaries, but given that it is a battery operated single blade shaver, I was impressed, and wondered what a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Braun shaver would do. After doing a bit of research on the various models and reading the customer reviews (on this site), I decided on the 8975, due to the new foil, Gillette blade technology, power comb, and active head. I also do not have a convenient place to keep the Clean&amp;Renew system plugged in.    Now for the good part... after receiving the shaver, I charged it for the recommended initial charge time of (at least) 4 hours, then test shaved with it. It was AMAZING! It was FAST and CLOSE! My face was as smooth as the proverbial \\&quot;baby&#x27;s butt\\&quot;, with no skin irritation (always a problem with the Norelcos for me) because the Gillette blade is so sharp, and the new foil system was so effective. I know most people won&#x27;t believe me, but I&#x27;m going to say it anyway... I got a CLOSER SHAVE than with my Mach3! All electric shaver companies say to allow 2 to 3 weeks for your skin and beard to adjust to the new shaver, but I can&#x27;t see how it can get any better than my test shave!    I did however, use a pre-electric shave (a CVS generic version of William&#x27;s &#x27;Lectric Shave) and an after shave (which I never used to use), so these things may have affected how the shaver performed, and minimized any skin irritation. That said, it was still a FANTASTIC first shave, and I would not hestitate to recommend (already have) this shaver to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shaver so far. I have used shavers for 16 years and I love this one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Says this is best gift I have ever gotten him. He says it is a great shave; enjoys it&#x27;s great features. A winner.</li>
            <li> After three years with a earlier version of this razor, mine died. Indications were that repair would cost close to the price of an updated version. Mine arrived about ten days after ordering and has been a satisfactory replacement. I do not believe any electric razor can shave as closely as a bladed razor,however,This razor comes close and makes up for it&#x27;s shortcomings by being very handy with little to no fuss. It sits in a stand (from the older version) which recharges and cleans the razor for you. Very handy and I am quite satisfied with the quality and performance.    glsheff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert in electric shavers.  I just hate using a razor and shaving cream for the little bit of facial hair that I have.  And so for the last 30 years or so, I&#x27;ve used electric razors everyday.  They all seem to last about 10 years if taken care of.  My last was a Braun 5416 which made it 11 years.  Probably waited too long to replace it.  I picked up the Braun 8975 last week and can honestly say I look forward to shaving in the morning.  I charged it for 4 hours as the manual said and after a week of shaves, I still have about 80% of the power left.  So the battery has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But moreover, I can&#x27;t get over the closeness of the shave. With minimal effort, it cuts quietly and quickly. The floating head is better than the one on my last Braun and fits the contours of my face nicely.  Furthermore, this model has a very nice sideburn trimmer which can get into tough to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is very comfortable in your hand.  It has good grips on it.  The on/off switch requires you to press on it to turn it on which is a safety precaution when travelling on airlines.  It prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on in your suitcase, which I&#x27;m told causes trouble for sensors in the airline cargo bays.  I&#x27;d hate to be the guy whose shaver caused the flight to be delayed.  This unit comes with a padded hard case that is just slightly larger than the shaver itself.  Great protection for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there is a newer model out there, but this one is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> it is all about the shave and this shaver cleanly  &lt;br /&gt;shaves with very few passes.  (medium growth)</li>
            <li> Although I have not used this product myself, my dad just loved it! I believe this is a great product if you are one of those who shaves every other day/frequently...</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic Vortex at the exact same time. I had been using Norelco for years and needed a new shaver so I tried both Panasonic and Braun.  The Braun is a good shaver but I have to say the Panasonic is far better than the Braun or my old Norelco with new blades. So to make a long story longer good shaver but not the best for me!</li>
            <li> To be objective, I have not used all the available settings or features on the shaver yet.  I bought it two weeks ago and the difference between the braun 8975 and my prior remington microscreen is difficult to describe.  The shave is very close for an electronic shaver and the shave is both quick (i.e. don&#x27;t have to go over same area twice) and painless.  It even gets those certain areas on my neck where the hair grows more at an angle to my skin.  Also, this shaver is very quiet and the charge lasts for quite a while as well. I am completely sold on Braun!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric shaver in more than 10 years.  Now that I have passed the magical age of 40 my skin is not as smooth as before.  The Mach 3 line of blade shavers is great, but they cut so close that any bumps get cut right off too.  I had a scab that would not heal because of the blade shave.  I thought I would switch to electric just long enought for my face to heal and then switch back.  After three weeks I&#x27;m not switching back.  The shave is very close and comfortable.  Someone suggested to me I could expedite the \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; process to an electric shave by letting my whiskers grow out a few days before shaving with the electric and that seem to work.  No irritation!  There is a high-end Panasonic shaver that gets very good reviews too.  I decided to go with this model simply because I have buy cutter and foil replacements at every major retail department store where I live.  I could not find any refills for Panasonic.  Furthermore, I did not buy the model with the expensive cleaning system.  Many retail stores sell canned \\&quot;cleaner and lubricant\\&quot; for electric shavers that is a spray.  I find that it works very well and is rather inexpensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, the shave is not quite as good as a Mach 3 shave, but it is very close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Money is not a big driver for me, but an added benefit is that you will likely save money over the life of the electric shaver compared to using the expensive multi-blade shaving systems such as Mach 3.  There is certainly a lot less used up product going into landfills this way.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the performance for the price.  Shave is as good as my brush and lather shave.  Performs as advertised as is easy to operate and especially easy to maintain.  No problems with battery life or the charging cycle.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that BRAUN was the top in its class, as i&#x27;ve owned other ones in the past.  For the last few years, i&#x27;ve been using a norelco, but got tired of the &#x27;3 blades spinning&#x27; action as it was difficult to clean.   &lt;br /&gt;When using this razor, the Braun 8975, shaving with it while pushing it against my face to make sure i get all the hairs, tiny particles of hair that has been shaved and saved inside the razor falls out.  It doesn&#x27;t completely give me the close shave that one would think you would get.  If you have sensitive skin, then this is not for you either, as I do, it iritated my skin (under my chin) when trying to get a closer shave.   &lt;br /&gt;The battery didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to (since i&#x27;m only shaving for 5 minutes a day), I would have expected it to last at least a few weeks without a recharge.   &lt;br /&gt;After the initial charge, it has lasted me 2 weeks before it went down to a 0 charge.  my old nerelco lasted me a good 2 months before it needed a recharge.  I think i&#x27;m going to be switching back to a nerelco very soon, as this is becoming more of a hassel to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need earplugs with this like I did with my cheap Remington. I like the  percent battery use left indicator. When it gets down to low, I can shave with it plugged in if need be. Someone claimed shaves as close as a blade. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong; not quite blade close.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver.  It cuts as close as a blade for me without much trouble, even gets the long hairs on the back of the neck, does edges of the ear too.  I can go 2 days without shaving and it has no problem cutting through the growth.  Good battery life, quick recharge, lightweight &amp; fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington triple head shavers for a long time and have been very pleased. Since I travel often I wanted an inexpensive shaver to keep with my travel bag. I found the Braun FreeControl and it met my requirements: inexpensive, battery &amp; AC operation. I was very pleasantly surprised with the FreeControl. It gives a very close shave, even better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been happy with for years.    So, when my main Remington finally wore out I decided to try one of Braun&#x27;s higher end models. After researching on Braun&#x27;s website and reading reviews, trading off features for price, I decided on the 360 Complete (without the cleaning system that needed to be plugged in all the time.)    My first shave was very disappointing. It seemed to miss a lot and what it did shave, it didn&#x27;t shave very close. However, I know it takes a while to get used to a new shaver, so I gave it a month. I also started shaving before showering based on the recommendation in the manual.    Well, after a few months I&#x27;m still very dissapointed in this model. No matter how long I shave, and how thorough I am, it still misses and doesn&#x27;t shave very close. I can feel stubble with my hands, but the shaver won&#x27;t do any better. In fact, after shaving with the 360 Complete, I can take out my inexpensive FreeControl, and it finds and cuts the stubble that the 360 won&#x27;t cut any closer.    About the only positive I can say about the 360 Complete is the battery system. It charges quickly, and holds a charge for a long time. Which, of course, is necessary, because you have to shave a long time with it just to get a halfway decent shave.    Bottom line: if you&#x27;re considering the 360 Complete, do yourself a favor and buy the FreeControl instead. You&#x27;ll save money and get much better results.</li>
            <li> Hey it works a little better then the last generation of shavers. Good in a pinch but not as close as a razor.So given that, its a good value and has met all that I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 previous Braun models, this is the WORST model I&#x27;ve owned.  The plastic is very cheap, the mechanical actions are not smooth or refined.  I&#x27;m very disappointed...  Gillette, you&#x27;re ruining the brand!</li>
            <li> I have been using the BRAUN shavers for years. They last on average 4-5 years are very reliable and shave better than any other I have even tried. This particular model Series 5 is very good. In my opinion you should change the blade about every 6-8 months for best performance. The new blade is about $30.</li>
            <li> Got this razor as a replacement for the Braun 8585, which came with the Clean&amp;Renew cleaning base thing....If you just need to replace your actual razor, the base stand from your previous 8000 series *is* compatible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints with this shaver at all. I get a better shave than I did with my old shaver, a Norelco 3 radial blade one. Before, there used to be hairs that would be missed but with this Braun, there aren&#x27;t-nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others that the self cleaning thingy in higher Bruan models is gimmicky and not necessary, especially since it requires you to buy cleaner refills periodically. This model without that feature is the one to buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Norelco user who also owned a Braun a decade ago. Lured by the promise of a closer shave, I purchased a Braun 8975 recently--and ended up returning it for refund. Pros: Close shave. Cons: MISSED HAIRS. And I mean, I would go over the missed hair at different angles, pressures, etc., five or ten times before the razor would catch it. That is the reason I gave up on the Braun: it does 95% of the job quickly--and then you struggle with the other 5%. It&#x27;s also very noisy, and the carrying case is bulky for travel. Finally, the Braun is not very convenient to clean.     I would instead recommend the Norelco 9195, which is quiet, compact, and does not miss any hairs. It is not quite as close shaving as the Braun--but in my opinion, close enough. And it&#x27;s so much easier to clean than the Braun. For real world use, the Norelco is superior.</li>
            <li> So far after useing the shaver for about one month, I find it better than most. A true review would take about 6 months of use. My main concern is the life of the shaving foil. Remington, altough a good close shaver, the shaving head disintergrates after a few months and they are very expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 4775 and I thought it took a long time to get a smooth shave with it so after seeing several good reviews for the Braun 8975 I ordered it and tried it for a week.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the Braun 4775.  So I sent it back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks ago I bought a 360º Complete Braun Shaver.   Although the head doesn&#x27;t seem to wabble back and forth I am sold on the shaver.  The shape of the holes in the screen of the head seem to be the reason for the very close shave especially of those hairs that seem to lie contrary to the general slant of most of the hairs especially those found under the chin and in the neck area.   Over 60 years of shaving with numerous different shavers I have found the Braun shaver the best I haver used.          J. Owen Granville</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than my last two Brauns! I had the $37 ones before. It does shave closer, quicker and is quieter than my old Braun. It stays strong to the end of it&#x27;s charge... doesn&#x27;t start slowing down until the very, very end! it also warns you when you have about three shaves left by means of the green charge indicater light....it turns red. It does a great job of getting those hard to catch hairs that used to get away from my other shaver. I would say that it does everything that the ads say it does...no complaints!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have owned by far.  I have been using it for about a month and right out of the box I got a much closer shave than any other.  It&#x27;s a little heavy and a little loud, but who cares because it gives me a great shave.    It would be nice if the carrying case also held the charging cord, but it doesn&#x27;t so I keep everything in a nylon bag when I am travelling.</li>
            <li> My son realy likes the shaver. He said that he got a close shave and could  use it durning the day for a touch up.</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun shaver and the best one yet. My first one, which I still use as a travel back up, still works great and is probably 10 years old. The second one also worked well but broke when my son dropped it onto a hard tile floor. The problem with both of those shavers and I don&#x27;t know if it is endemic to all electric shavers, is that they lose their ability to hold a charge.    At first you need to charge them once a week, then twice, and so on until it&#x27;s every other day. Perhaps this has been corrected with the 8975 but only time will tell.    What I can tell you is that the shaver gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, is quiet and comfortable and even works great on my neck where other shavers suffered. No need for anything more expensive than this. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Although this item is not cheap, it has worked well for me since I bought it @1 month ago. Braun makes excellent products.</li>
            <li> We have NEVER wrote a review but this shaver was so bad I wanted to hopefully save someone else some time and money &amp; pain.  He is not a person to complain or write reviews.  So on his behalf here goes.  Our daughter bought this Christmas of 2007.  Not quite a year old.  It has two major problems.  Short and simple.  For one, it yanks his hair out.  He could always wax.  Same pain but not an option for a man.  Last but NOT least...it&#x27;s very loud.  He closes the bathroom door, turns the shower on and it&#x27;s still loud.  He is not new to electric shavers so yes he has tried to fix the problem.  Not what you would expect for the money and less than a year old.  Well, there is always this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I just finished with my first shave with the new braun and I am very impressed. this is the best razor that i have ever used bar none. let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ve used the norelco, several other braun&#x27;s years ago and most recently i had a panasonic wet dry that died in just over one year. the braun beats the bejesus out of all of them! my shave was so quick and so close that i can&#x27;t wait for my beard to grow back again! how often have you felt like this guys??  the braun is heavy/ solid and pretty quiet as well. this is a great buy gentlemen. try this one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Why spend more? This is the best shaver available for the best price available.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the shaver and the service from Amazon. Shaver performs as was described in web page material.</li>
            <li> This is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s comparatively quiet, gives a great shave without preping the beard (they recommend shaving BEFORE you wash your face.  I thought they were crazy BUT I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave with an electric razor.)  Just loosen the head and turn on the switch and all the stubles fall out.  No rinsing, washing or brushing to clean the heads.  I rate this a 10 on a scale of 5!!!  Great value. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Panasonic 8077 with the liquid head washers, including the expensive soap inserts.  It&#x27;s the noisiest razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  I tried a new Remington and the stupid hair trimmer keeps popping up because the switch for it is in the way of holding it.  Neither of these gave me a satisfying shave and took for ever to shave.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been a 20+ year Norelco user. My current Norelco is over 12 years old.  During the past year I have tried several of the newer Norelco&#x27;s but just was not pleased. The Norelco&#x27;s seemed to be of less quality than my older ones. They also seemed to lack power. So I decided to give the Braun 360 a try. I have been using it for about a month and have been very pleased. The razor has good power and I like the blade design. The razor has also given very close shaves. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> So far (3 weeks) this seems to be a very nice shaver and cleanup is relatively easy for me (I have a little blower to clean out the hair cuttings).  Before this I had a Norelco automatic cleaning model, but I got really tired of ordering more cleaning fluid and changing the cleaning fluid was a messy chore that needed to be done all too often.  So I chose this Braun model and I am pleased with it.  It gives a nice shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Braun shaver user. I had recently bought a replacement blade and foil for my 2-year old 5000 series shaver. The foil tore and scratched me after only about a month of use, so I decided to upgrade to the 8000 series.    I&#x27;m getting a much closer and smoother (less irritation) shave with the 8000. I can tell because my \\&quot;5:00 shadow\\&quot; is much reduced from before. The other advantages are:    1) Much quieter than the 5000 series  2) Shaver runs off the battery so you don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged in like the 5000 series. My 5000 series shaver ran noticeably faster (and better) when plugged in even though it could run un-plugged. This was true from day 1, so had nothing to do with a worn out battery.  3) Battery indicator so you know when to recharge    Conclusion: You are getting much better performance if you upgrade to an 8000 series shaver and it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun razors from my teens.( I was raised in Germany and Braun was the best razor there.) About 10 years ago I bought a rotary blade razor from Norelco and was surprised how well and close the shave was! A year ago it was time to get a replacement. After doing all the ratings research on the web, I went back to Braun. What a mistake! Its \\&quot;new technology\\&quot; twitches the skin. Its shave is not as close as the Norelco was, the  top easily dsengages. All in all, I am ready to junkt it!</li>
            <li> I had a norelco before, but this is by far better. I figured I would get a decent shaver because I would have it for so long, so I purchased this one. Very impressed. It shaves very well around my neck, which is usually where most problems for me are. I will recommend my friends to switch to Braun.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who is in the Army. He has to shave fast. This worked very well &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> They say you need to give a shaver about 20 days to start working properly.  Well I have given it about 90 days and I am disappointed.  While there are some good features, it is not working for me.    - It is not shaving all places properly.  It just cant get the part directly under the nose very well.  - I have now managed to cut the above mentioned area twice now!!  How do you cut yourself with an electric shaver????  - It takes about 3 times longer to shave than when I was using my Norelco.  - Very loud but that was listed in other reviews so that is my fault.  - The cut hairs are not well contained within the head at all.  This is very annoying to shave only to look down at your shirt and sink to see cut hairs all over the place.  My previous Norelco retained at least 97% of the hair within the head, looking at the design of this shaver, it is not surprising that this happens.    Bottom line is that I am disappointed.  I really expected more for an item with the Braun name on it.  I just purchased a Braun electric tooth brush and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it but this shaver is a bust for me.  This shaver may work for others, but not for me.  I would have rated this one star lower but being that it shaves differently for everyone, I had to be fair and give it three stars.    This is my second electric shaver.  I came from a Norelco which I beat to death.  Before this, it worked great.  Back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> After a great deal of research I choose this razor for my husband as a Christmas present. He is thrilled with the close shave, the ease of use, the long lasting charge and the pinch free shave. He has quite happily thrown out his last disposable razor.  In the long run this shaver will actually save money with the rising cost of disposable razors.  I&#x27;m glad I choose the braun as it does live up to its reputation for quality. Most importantly the close shave is comparable to that of a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace the sonic shaver made by Braun that I purchased and hated.  I have used electric shavers for years.  The sonic shaver was nice, but since i am in the military and deploy, the head gets all gunked up without the cleaning station...and no one will ship the alcohol containing cleaner to Afghanistan or Iraq.  So, i had to switch.      One thing that is great is the gillette blade technology.  It really makes a difference.  I first had the 360 complete that had the same gillette blades and loved that one...but, i also left it in a tent in Kuwait.  So, my one priority for buying a new razor was having that same technology.    The other great thing is the charge indicator.  It gets really cold in Afghanistan and the last thing i want to do is walk through the snow twice to go back and retrieve a power cord.      Overall a great shaver.  I would definately reccomend this.</li>
            <li> First some background... About 10 years ago, I tried a high-end Braun foil shaver because I read good things about them, and found it just didn&#x27;t shave longer hairs (especially on the neck or if you went a few days without shaving). Plus it didn&#x27;t shave much closer than my Norelco so I never used it much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco guy. My first Norelco rotary lasted many years. The next one lasted only a few years. The next only a couple of years. And the last several have only gone about a year before the blades go dull, the batteries start to give out, or both. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if I buy a $40 or $100 Norelco, they just don&#x27;t last very long anymore. I suspect this is on purpose to get you to buy expensive blade sets or a new shaver and generate more income for Norelco?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well Norelco (are you reading this?), your short lived products prompted me to try Braun again and boy am I glad I did! This is the first foil shaver I know of that can REALLY shave longer hairs. It also shaves MUCH CLOSER than even a brand new top-of-the-line Norelco rotary. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate the skin as much either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I opted for the 8975 becuase it doesn&#x27;t need any refills like the more expensive versions do. But it uses the same blade head so it shaves just as well as the more expensive versions. I just got it, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it will hold up, or the battery life, but it&#x27;s really no contest against the Norelco&#x27;s for the quality of the shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I only have a few small gripes so far. For this price, I&#x27;d rather have something with a rubberized or soft grip exterior that feels better in the hand. Braun&#x27;s solution to make it less slipery was to put sharp bumps on the hard plastic case and it feels kind of rough and cheap in your hand. It&#x27;s also noisier than the Norelcos but it&#x27;s not too bad. Finally, the Norelcos use a standard small coiled power cord that&#x27;s easy to travel with. The Braun uses a much more bulky cord/plugarrangement that&#x27;s not as travel friendly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, when it&#x27;s all said and done, you buy a shaver to SHAVE. And this Braun does that better than anything I&#x27;ve used at any price. Period. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I just used the Braun 8975 for the first time, and what a difference! I had another Braun years before, (which I loved), but it got old so I replaced it with a Panasonic. I suffered with the Panasonic for about 3 years before deciding to treat myself to another Braun. Why did I wait so long? This baby shaves REALLY close in half the time. I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> My son requested it for christmas and was very pleased with the results.  He uses it everyday and would recomend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and I use it from time to time; however, it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  I frequently find myself \\&quot;re-shaving\\&quot; with a blade after using this shaver.  I&#x27;m not sure any electric shaver will shave as close as a blade as long as there is that foil between the blades and your face.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaves so close that you should disregard their suggestion to shave before you wash your face \\&quot;to get a closer shave\\&quot;. This is like shaving without shaving cream. Yikes. Great consistant, quality shave. Compared to my Norelco, this is like using surgical shears compare to a lawn mower. It may be more expensive than others but if its quality close shave, clean cuts, and reliability - this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have tried several shavers over the years, but keeping going back to Braun. I tried the less expensive versions, but this version is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is my first Braun razor.  It does an average job at best.  I constantly need to use a bic razor to trim my neck where the Braun will not cut hair closely.  I&#x27;ll purchase a different less expensive brand next time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality and ease of shave.  The battery life is also very good.  The trimmer, like everyone I&#x27;ve tried before, performs poorly.  In spite of that, this is the best shaver I have owned.  The price was better than all the discount and warehouse stores I had searched.  A really good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriend for his birthday. He absolutley loves it!!! He had a braun previously that was 20 years old!! It was just worn out so I gave him an updated one. He said it really cuts a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razor&#x27;s for 20 years.  This is by far the best one yet - nearly as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Here is a quick shaving history for me.  I started out using the Schick Protector when I first started growing facial hair.  I eventually received a top of the line Braun for a present.  Eventually the battery died, so I went out and bought a Norelco CoolSkin because I was growing dissatisfied with the Braun.  After awhile, I grew tired using the \\&quot;goo,\\&quot; so I switched to the Gillette Mach 3 and Fusion systems.  I wanted to get back to an electric because I can&#x27;t shave with a blade against the grain as is recommended for closeness because I get irritation on my face and numerous cuts on my neck.  I bought the Braun 360 because of the reviews on this website.    I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for 10 months and it does a great job on my face although I do have to go over the same spots a couple times, which disagrees with their advertisement of the smart comb technology.  The smart comb is supposed to lift hairs that are laying down and allow the shaver to cut them.  The smart comb does a worse job on my neck, not working whatsoever.  Patches of hair are completely missed unless I work the shaver over the same spot for a few minutes.  This also irritates my skin.  So the result is that I use the shaver for a few days and then when the hair grows long enough on my neck, I use a razor to get rid of those pesky hairs.      Included is a hard carrying case, a charge cord, a cleaning brush, and a plastic foil guard.  The carrying case is very nice and I wish all shavers came with the hard variety.  The charge cord is nice since it can be used when the battery is dead.  It also charges the battery in an hour  and you get 60 minutes of shave time with the shaver.  The cleaning brush works fine and lastly the plastic foil guard is nice, although if you try to pull it off wrong, the foil remains in the plastic guard as it comes off the shaver.      For an experiment, I brought out my CoolSkin to see how it matched up to the Braun.  I was surprised that it works so much better than the 360, both on my face and neck.  It does miss some hairs on my neck once in awhile and I do have to go over areas a few times, causing irritation, but irritation with the Norelco isn&#x27;t anywhere near the same as it is with the Braun.      It also doesn&#x27;t help that there is only a 30 day trial for the Braun.  I wish it was 60 days like Norelco offers.  I&#x27;m not saying that the Braun is a bad product, as there are many satisfied customers based on the reviews on this site.  But everyone&#x27;s face is different and everyone should try multiple shaving systems until they find the one that works best for them.</li>
            <li> This shaver is sturdy and works well; it shaves very close and the charge lasts for about a week. Like most other shavers, however, it does not get neck hair.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present to replace one of my battery-operated foil shavers which had to retire for the same reason I&#x27;m gonna retire this expensive 8975 (aka 550) - razor burns. This shaver gives a pretty close shave, but at what cost? It rips my skin to pieces - my skin got red in a matter of seconds.   ATT&#x27;N: for people reading this review - I&#x27;m not claiming it&#x27;s a bad shaver, I have to admit that I know someone who uses it and is very happy with it, it just doesn&#x27;t suit my type of skin.   So, first star for the close shave, second star for the battery time, second week and I still haven&#x27;t charged it. And the final star for nifty hard-shell case with the brush :)  Two missing stars for: one ripping my face to pieces second week in a row and one for hard-shell case not being able to hold a cord (what&#x27;s the point of a dual-voltage shaver, if one has to stick the cord somewhere (not with the shaver)?)   P.S. Bottom line - not recommended to anyone even with a slight case of sensitive skin. :)</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard that especially under the neck wants to grow every which way. I have always had a problem getting a good shave even with a safety razor. I would have to shave from all angles to capture and shave my beard. I have tried many electic razors and have always had to use a safety razor inbetween to feel like I had a good shave. NOT WITH THIS RAZOR! Right from the beginning out of the box, this razor has provided me with a good close shave whith out razor burns. There is no need for me to use a sfety razor at all any more. No more nicks and cuts! No more razor burns from my electric razor!I  can not say enough good things about this razor. It works great!</li>
            <li> My husband has always been buying Braun machines because he does not like the machines with the circular heads.He usually gets the models that are around $50-$70.This time I chose the more expensive model because of the reviews people wrote.I am happy that he loves it 100%.He says this is a much much better shaver than the ones he had before.Shaves quikly,closely,&amp; quietly.Does not irritate his skin either.It was shipped promptly too.This was my first purchase from Amazon.I loved the fact that others  gave me words of wisdom.</li>
            <li> Did not suffer from razor burn after second use. Good for short facial hair (use once daily) with a consistent direction. Difficult areas on the neck are challenging to shave without irritating skin. The side-burn trimmer becomes essential to tackle hairs that lie really close to the skin in order to avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and an extremely tough beard.  (I am also thin and fit.)  I have had this Braun for 2 months and am less than unhappy.  If I shave every day, it is barely acceptable as it leaves hair despite my going over and over my face for 10+ minutes.  If I skip a day, it is about as effective as a shoe.  It definitely cannot get to those hairs that lay close to the skin regardless of the technique I use.  My only recourse has been to follow my Braun \\&quot;shave\\&quot; with a straightrazor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am all the more disappointed because Braun allegedly has a good reputation.  It get&#x27;s one star only because there is no lower grade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about four years now and I like it much more than older ones I&#x27;ve had.  I mostly use the trimmer on it, but it shaves and cleans out just fine.  I even dropped it in my dog&#x27;s water bowl when I first got it and it has held up just fine.  Charges still last for a while.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric shaver like this before.  It is really great.  Gives a close shave.  I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Just picked one of these up and wow is all I can say. Shave quality is 10 times better than a panasonic electric razor I used a few years ago. Cheeks are smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and neck is adequate. No electric razor can shave the neck as well as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ll gladly trade a little bit of roughness for kissing razor burn and gashes is my face goodbye. I gave it four stars because although it&#x27;s a fantastic razor, Braun does not present it to be a fantastic razor. It feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap plastics and it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like a razor you&#x27;d shell out triple digit prices for. Also, I know that I could have paid $30 more and purchased one with a self cleaning stand, but i didn&#x27;t, and all braun gives me is a cheap little cord? a presentable little hunk of plastic would have been nice.</li>
            <li> This is a superb shaver. I purchased a series of high end shavers to compair and found this particular model to be the best for comfort,  &lt;br /&gt;sound level, charge time and cleaning ease. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;                             Leo,  Palm City, Fl.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different brands.  Braun is always a great choice after all.</li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco rotary razors for the last 12 years and was happy with them until my current model&#x27;s battery started going, and the trimmer stopped working. You can&#x27;t just replace a Norelco battery, they have to be soldered in, a lousy way for them to make money. I got tired of forking over $40 for a replacement, plus the time to bring it to a repair shop, so I thought I&#x27;d try a Braun. After 1 week these are my observations:  Pro:  1- the shave is closer than Norelco, requiring far fewer passes over the same territory.  2- the design is nice  3- I didn&#x27;t bother getting the solution-cleaning thing, which seemed like a lot of bother and added expense; to clean, you just lift off the top, shake out the hairs, blow, brush a little, easy and fast.  4- comes with a small hard-shell case, unlike Norelco&#x27;s bulky case which makes it difficult to pack for a trip  Con:  1- Noisy! This thing is like a buzz-saw, so loud that, if my wife&#x27;s sleeping, I have to take it in another room. I&#x27;ve compared it to my Norelco and estimate it&#x27;s four times louder. I don&#x27;t mind, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to loud noise in the morning,  check it out before buying.  2- Ergonomically, not as comfortable as the Norelco. Imagine holding an extra-heavy ice-cream bar between your thumb and fingers for 3-5 minutes, and you&#x27;ll have an idea. The Norelco has a round body which you can wrap your fingers and thumb around. So far, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me. But again, if you&#x27;ve got arthritis in your hands, this might be a problem.  3- The trimmer doesn&#x27;t project much above the razor, unlike the Norelco, which sticks up a good inch or so and allows you to see easier. With the Braun, trimming my moustache is more difficult, as the razor edge itself gets in the way of my vision. I&#x27;m getting used to it, however.  4- The Braun hard-case doesn&#x27;t hold the cord. Might not be a factor for you; I&#x27;d rather have the much smaller case. But if you&#x27;re traveling, you have to remember to bring the cord.  All in all, I&#x27;d buy the Braun 360 again, if for no other reason than not giving Norelco my hard-earned money to get that battery soldered. However, the Braun instruction manual makes no reference to how to change the battery, so if, a few years down the line, I find out I&#x27;ve got to get it soldered as well, I&#x27;m going to be very annoyed.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best available. Have owned numerious shavers over the years and this one beats them all. The price and delivery from Amazon was very good.</li>
            <li> This is my first Braun, and depending upon its durability, this blows the Norelco&#x27;s out of the water.  For the past 20 years I&#x27;ve used Norelco, got roughly about 5 years out of each,it seems that Norelco must be cutting corners somewhere because their shavers didn&#x27;t do such a great job shaving me, I have a real tough beard and this Braun goes through it like it&#x27;s nothing.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It takes about a week to adjust to your skin. It is really good and shaves real close at most places on your face. The neck is the problem! I always find strand hair and have to shave with my Mach3 as well!</li>
            <li> Switched back to Braun after buying a Remington to save a few bucks.  Could not wait to switch back as the Braun shaves better and is easier on  your face.  The trimmer is far superior on this Braun.</li>
            <li> After having used a rotary shaver for five years, I was pleasantly surprised at the difference this shaver made.  It does a great job, easily beating any shaver I&#x27;d previously used.  The fact that it needs charging every three weeks or so is an added bonus.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quiet, smooth shave, the 8975 is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better buying transaction. Great product at a great price and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rotary type razors. I had a Braun 6520 just before purchasing this razor 4 years ago. The 8975 is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Good close shave and good battery life. Two flaws: 1. The cutter head and foils are fairly pricey to replace every year. 2. The case only holds the razor, no room for cord and brush. Not so good for travelling.</li>
