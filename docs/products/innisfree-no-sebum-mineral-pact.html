    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I apply it on my face just by itself and it gives me a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Best setting powder ever.</li>
            <li>Is it the best power?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not THE best, but for the lower price, I would purchase again.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the perfect for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The pact is perfect for oils.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the look, packaging and price of this product.</li>
            <li>She takes very good care of her face and body and keeps herself in the know about products.</li>
            <li>and I think this product is great for people with oily skin too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>However, it would be great for traveling if you want to tuck it in a purse or your pant pocket.</li>
            <li>It does work great with oily-skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered from YouRiShop and will purchase from them again, they almost always have the lowest price for great items</li>
            <li>Its also great for touch ups through out the day if you touch your face a lot.</li>
            <li>Good job with good ingredients and still inexpensive and doing the job well!</li>
            <li>Love this, perfect size for purse.</li>
            <li>doenst look caked, easy application, so great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about this compact</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder doesn&#x27;t change the color or appearance of your skin, just the finish, so if you are looking to cover acne or scaring this wouldn&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li>She has a beautiful, light, blemish-free complexion.</li>
            <li>totally love it!</li>
            <li>this is perfect for hot summer days.</li>
            <li>This is a great compact IF you are light skinned.  </li>
            <li>so it fits nicely into my purse.  </li>
            <li>The puff is nice, though a bit lighter and flimsier than I thought it&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes your face matte and oil free, which is good for summer weather.</li>
            <li>but I have to continually apply more (I have combination skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s even better with the primer and the powder combined.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>got this at a shop and the lady working there told me that this product acts like oil control blotting paper but better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s lasting forever, and its perfect for my purse.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this prime available !</li>
            <li>love it, use it with Wayne Goss foundation method.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products I have ever ordered.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love and have reordered twice</li>
            <li>The pact itself is quite like a compact, and it&#x27;s thicker than in the photo but definitely cute and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love innisfree products.</li>
            <li>It looks lovely and I love innisfree products.</li>
            <li>I found this powder to set my face better than BM veil.  </li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin, enlarged pores and blackhead coverage.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was using my oil control powder compact from Naris Up - which I was satisfied with</li>
            <li>not exactly the greatest powder I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>but because of the radically changing weather I tend to get oily a lot especially during the summer, and any other translucent powder or compact foundation didn&#x27;t help me to get rid of my oiliness and look very nicely mattifying, but this one does an excellent job!</li>
            <li>I will purchase this item again because it is worth more than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It is light and airy.</li>
            <li>The powder is not too light that it will flake off the compact.</li>
            <li>and it does refreshes me to my original made-up look.</li>
            <li>Packaging 10/10 (beautiful box and simple and sleek design for the compact)&lt;br /&gt;Presentation 10/10 (arrived safely, with a sample mask pack as a gift!)&lt;br /&gt;Scent 10/10 (no scent)&lt;br /&gt;Application 10/10 (does not irritate sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>But does a pretty good job making the face more matte and reducing the &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; left from cc creams</li>
            <li>nice product so far.</li>
            <li>Good and worth the price totally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute pastel green color cover and compact convenience is what makes it good to go.</li>
            <li>Its great to just stop some of the shine without worrying about adding a ton of your powder&#x27;s color to your face making you look odd.</li>
            <li>Overall, nice powder pact.</li>
            <li>Such good value and goes on very transparent.</li>
            <li>flawless finish for skin)&lt;br /&gt;Color 10/10 (goes on as expected, invisible matte!)&lt;br /&gt;Sizing 10/10 (smaller than most American compacts, just a</li>
            <li>smooth, light enough and does what it says</li>
            <li>Sets very well; definitely gives the nice matte, while also brightening.</li>
            <li>The pact went on very naturally and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin a bit more matte and pale.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if the packaging separated the applicator and product in different compartments to keep it a bit more hygienic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality 10/10 (overall extremely satisfied)</li>
            <li>I have pretty tan skin</li>
            <li>I does control the oil pretty well</li>
            <li>My first Korean-brand powder (I&#x27;ve been using MAC until now).</li>
            <li>Small, portable, and handy!</li>
            <li>Personally I didn&#x27;t notice any huge change in oiliness, but it&#x27;s not a massive problem for me and usually more a result of my foundation than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>cute pact, lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because the puff is light in color, but I can barely see the product get onto this puff.</li>
            <li>I really like this finishing powder............</li>
            <li>dot put too much otherwise</li>
            <li>It does take away the shine, seal in my make-up for the majority of the day (depending on how much I am outdoors or sweat in the heat).</li>
            <li>Quite small but very cute.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product has a mirror; quite convenient really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s translucent, so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about your skintone.</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin, this mineral is not for you.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it is truly &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have not broken out using this product</li>
            <li>I have even noticed when I was in really sunny weather that it stays on the skin for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for oily skin.</li>
            <li>For me, it does what it says it does, mattifies the skin and sets makeup like a normal powder.</li>
            <li>It sometimes makes my face a little too white when I apply a bit more layer to keep my face matte, but it does keep my foundation in place!</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and it seems to blend well with other cosmetics products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase the new no sebum blur pact now.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>I use this compact prior to using my other compact that has more color to it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really keep my face from getting greasy, mostly it just makes my white look really pale.</li>
            <li>Still, the puff is just large enough so that the product is covered by it and doesn&#x27;t get all over the mirror.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 25 year old niece for Christmas at her request.</li>
            <li>so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be damaging my sensitive skin and control the oil while not drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is really translucent, not white at all.</li>
            <li>Innisfree is such a gentle brand and when I saw this I was a bit weary, but decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Additional plus it arrived way early and came with Korean skincare brand samples.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>All ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding a powder that looks good on really pale skin without making my face look like I rubbing baby powder on it.</li>
            <li>I do not use the little sponge that came with it, but it is nice to have the little piece of plastic to keep the product protected.</li>
            <li>Comparing expensive HD powder and more natural but also very expensive Julique powder, this is very good.</li>
            <li>This product works really well, as expected.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t super messy and gets everywhere!</li>
            <li>If you have combo to dry skin or sensitive skin, this powder may be something for you to consider trying.  </li>

            <li> but boy do I get oily as the day goes on) and it has a slightly strange smell.</li>
            <li> This compact is smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Slight herby scent, but it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry skin AT ALL and doesn&#x27;t look cakey (as long as you don&#x27;t aply a ton of it).&lt;br /&gt;This powder is good, if you have bad skin, go for it!</li>
            <li> I wish the powder was a loose powder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very tiny, but believe little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin</li>
            <li> It made my bb cream last a little longer and controlled my oil for about 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> Does leave a little bit of white hue on your face after applying.</li>
            <li> have been using the primer of the same brand (the No Sebum one) and the Green Tea BB Cream of Innisfree too since almost a year</li>
            <li> I have used this compact for a little less than a year and even though it&#x27;s slightly smaller than an average sized compact.</li>
            <li> a little dry for my oily skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, but I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> Less product than I thought there&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> and I have really little</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the little sponge is separated by a plastic cover.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about this compact so I finally gave in and tried it. Originally, I was using my oil control powder compact from Naris Up - which I was satisfied with but I have to continually apply more (I have combination skin but boy do I get oily as the day goes on) and it has a slightly strange smell. That is not what I am reviewing so anyways, I like that the Innisfree compact doesn&#x27;t have a smell. As for the actual application, I like it. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I have to reapply this a few times throughout the day but I still like it. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin. The powder is white but it doesn&#x27;t go on your skin white unless you apply a generous amount, which will eventually absorb the oil and blend in with your skin anyways. Overall, I am satisfied. I would have given it 5 stars if the packaging separated the applicator and product in different compartments to keep it a bit more hygienic.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really keep my face from getting greasy, mostly it just makes my white look really pale.</li>
            <li> Love this, perfect size for purse. On my second</li>
            <li> It works well absorbs oil would recommend to those who have oily skin</li>
            <li> a little dry for my oily skin</li>
            <li> smooth, light enough and does what it says</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 25 year old niece for Christmas at her request. It&#x27;s one of her must-have products. She has a beautiful, light, blemish-free complexion. She takes very good care of her face and body and keeps herself in the know about products. I have no personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Packaging 10/10 (beautiful box and simple and sleek design for the compact)&lt;br /&gt;Presentation 10/10 (arrived safely, with a sample mask pack as a gift!)&lt;br /&gt;Scent 10/10 (no scent)&lt;br /&gt;Application 10/10 (does not irritate sensitive skin, flawless finish for skin)&lt;br /&gt;Color 10/10 (goes on as expected, invisible matte!)&lt;br /&gt;Sizing 10/10 (smaller than most American compacts, just a warning)&lt;br /&gt;Quality 10/10 (overall extremely satisfied)</li>
            <li> I have pretty tan skin and my face doesn&#x27;t like white at all when using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this powder because I have horribly oily skin and acne. But the problem is that I also have dehydrated skin so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be damaging my sensitive skin and control the oil while not drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the primer of the same brand (the No Sebum one) and the Green Tea BB Cream of Innisfree too since almost a year so I know that Innisfree is not damaging in anyway my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This powder doesn&#x27;t have any coverage so don&#x27;t worry, I won&#x27;t look white on you. I does control the oil pretty well but it&#x27;s even better with the primer and the powder combined.&lt;br /&gt;But the size is really small, about my palm and I have really little hands.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry skin AT ALL and doesn&#x27;t look cakey (as long as you don&#x27;t aply a ton of it).&lt;br /&gt;This powder is good, if you have bad skin, go for it!</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin, enlarged pores and blackhead coverage. I apply it on my face just by itself and it gives me a flawless look.I will purchase this item again because it is worth more than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helped tons in Hawaii during a wedding! Highly recommended for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Best setting powder ever.</li>
            <li> I really like this finishing powder............I will buy it again maybe a shade darker</li>
            <li> This is a great compact IF you are light skinned.  I am Asian so it works well for me.  It is a smaller compact so it fits nicely into my purse.  I only apply to my T-zone.  Is it the best power?  It&#x27;s not THE best, but for the lower price, I would purchase again.  Next time, I will try out the loose powder, but I would still keep this compact of it&#x27;s smaller feature.</li>
            <li> It gets the shine off as soon as i put it on my face on a hot day, but makes my skin look cakey, or powdery :/</li>
            <li> nice product so far. neat.</li>
            <li> cute pact, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I think this product is great for people with oily skin too.&lt;br /&gt;I put them on whenever I&#x27;m wearing foundation and my face starts to get oily.&lt;br /&gt;I got this at a shop and the lady working there told me that this product acts like oil control blotting paper but better.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a powder that looks good on really pale skin without making my face look like I rubbing baby powder on it. This is really translucent, not white at all. The size is pretty small but it&#x27;s lasting forever, and its perfect for my purse.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the perfect for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;Just dot put too much otherwise u look like a ghost!lol</li>
            <li> I have this in my purse especially in summer to touch up if I have a bit of oil on my face. Great stuff no complaints. I also use it to set my bb cream or makeup.</li>
            <li> This compact is smaller than I had expected. However, it would be great for traveling if you want to tuck it in a purse or your pant pocket. I like to use a kabuki brush to use this compact. It is light and airy. The powder is not too light that it will flake off the compact. I find it similar to my Make Up Forever HD Pressed Powder. So if you want to go the less expensive route, purchase this, for similar effect and consistency in the powder as the Make Up Forever HD Pressed Powder. It does take away the shine, seal in my make-up for the majority of the day (depending on how much I am outdoors or sweat in the heat). I like to touch up in the afternoon and it does refreshes me to my original made-up look. My skin is combination T-zone oilier than the rest. It does work great with oily-skin.</li>
            <li> totally love it! I have a very dry skin but because of the radically changing weather I tend to get oily a lot especially during the summer, and any other translucent powder or compact foundation didn&#x27;t help me to get rid of my oiliness and look very nicely mattifying, but this one does an excellent job! doenst look caked, easy application, so great! I&#x27;m going to purchase the new no sebum blur pact now. Thank you for making this prime available !</li>
            <li> love it, use it with Wayne Goss foundation method.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products I have ever ordered. Any sort of makeup causes me to break out, so it was next to impossible to find something to give my skin a soft matte finish. Innisfree is such a gentle brand and when I saw this I was a bit weary, but decided to give it a shot. Absolutely love and have reordered twice now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder doesn&#x27;t change the color or appearance of your skin, just the finish, so if you are looking to cover acne or scaring this wouldn&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, as expected. It is transparent, and keeps my face looking and feeling matte all day. I do not use the little sponge that came with it, but it is nice to have the little piece of plastic to keep the product protected. It does not irritate my skin. For the price, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected. Quite small but very cute. There&#x27;s no smell at all and it works similarly to HD complexion powder. I ordered from YouRiShop and will purchase from them again, they almost always have the lowest price for great items</li>
            <li> I use this powder after my BB to release some of the shine from the moisturizer. I use a brush with it instead of the pad. I usually follow up up with my colored powder as well. Its great to just stop some of the shine without worrying about adding a ton of your powder&#x27;s color to your face making you look odd. Its also great for touch ups through out the day if you touch your face a lot.</li>
            <li> not exactly the greatest powder I&#x27;ve used but it works well enough for 5-6 hours on my combination skin. the compact is pretty small and when I dropped it the tin of powder inside fell out! it was held with a dab of plastic glue(?) and refuses to stck back in the compact. just a warning..</li>
            <li> The pact went on very naturally and smoothly. It made my bb cream last a little longer and controlled my oil for about 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much what you&#x27;d expect. The pact itself is quite like a compact, and it&#x27;s thicker than in the photo but definitely cute and sturdy. I thought there would be a lid separating the puff and product, but it&#x27;s just plastic packaging. Still, the puff is just large enough so that the product is covered by it and doesn&#x27;t get all over the mirror. Yes, this product has a mirror; quite convenient really. The puff is nice, though a bit lighter and flimsier than I thought it&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because the puff is light in color, but I can barely see the product get onto this puff. It&#x27;s tough to get powder on the puff without some effort. Still, this helps you use just the amount you need. For me, it does what it says it does, mattifies the skin and sets makeup like a normal powder. It&#x27;s translucent, so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about your skintone. Slight herby scent, but it&#x27;s barely there. Less product than I thought there&#x27;d be. Overall, nice powder pact. Additional plus it arrived way early and came with Korean skincare brand samples.</li>
            <li> I love innisfree products. this is perfect for hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin a bit more matte and pale. It looks lovely and I love innisfree products. I live in Arizona so I sweat a lot and this helps cover up parts on my face where it gets sweaty and gross. I totally recommend it but I especially the big powder one.</li>
            <li> I use this to absorb any oil after applying air cushion foundation. Makes your face matte and oil free, which is good for summer weather.</li>
            <li> Does leave a little bit of white hue on your face after applying. Also, needs to be reapplied, so doesn&#x27;t powder over oily residue as well as I would like. But does a pretty good job making the face more matte and reducing the &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; left from cc creams</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyelids because they tend to get shiny. I like it because im not looking for overall coverage. its a sebum pact so its only suppose to take the shine out.</li>
            <li> Good and worth the price totally.</li>
            <li> It sometimes makes my face a little too white when I apply a bit more layer to keep my face matte, but it does keep my foundation in place!</li>
            <li> The pact is perfect for oils. It does its job. It&#x27;s very tiny, but believe little goes a long way. So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Such good value and goes on very transparent. Personally I didn&#x27;t notice any huge change in oiliness, but it&#x27;s not a massive problem for me and usually more a result of my foundation than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase. Very happy with the look, packaging and price of this product.</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin, this mineral is not for you.  If you have combo to dry skin or sensitive skin, this powder may be something for you to consider trying.  I really like that it is truly &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; powder.  It has a matte finish and sets my powder foundation well.  I found this powder to set my face better than BM veil.  The test I did was setting my concealer. It held up for solid 6 hours.  BM veil only set for couple hours. I have not broken out using this product and I usually do. This mineral pact is small, I would say &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size.  I also appreciate the little sponge is separated by a plastic cover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, but when I do this helps my makeup stay in place and keeps my skin from getting oily. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, but I&#x27;m very pale so I might not notice. I wish the powder was a loose powder but maybe there&#x27;s a version of that that I just didn&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> Comparing expensive HD powder and more natural but also very expensive Julique powder, this is very good. All ingredients are natural. Good job with good ingredients and still inexpensive and doing the job well!</li>
            <li> I use this compact prior to using my other compact that has more color to it. It feels smooth and it seems to blend well with other cosmetics products. I usually use it in the morning. I have even noticed when I was in really sunny weather that it stays on the skin for quite some time. I have used this compact for a little less than a year and even though it&#x27;s slightly smaller than an average sized compact. It&#x27;s cute pastel green color cover and compact convenience is what makes it good to go.</li>
            <li> Works very well. My first Korean-brand powder (I&#x27;ve been using MAC until now). Sets very well; definitely gives the nice matte, while also brightening. Small, portable, and handy! Since it&#x27;s not a pact, (and not a powder) it isn&#x27;t super messy and gets everywhere!</li>
