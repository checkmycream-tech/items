            <li>It&#x27;s led timer on top .</li>
            <li>This is a quality UV lamp that we use with the latest Shellac system.</li>
            <li>I love the motion detection.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the automatic on when putting the hand in.  </li>
            <li>My clients love it because they do not hit their fingers going in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got this particular machine.  </li>
            <li>Love this,the auto feature when you put your hand in makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>I love the timer and most important that it self activates when you get your hand inside, specially if you are doing your on nails.</li>
            <li>This lamp was easy to put together</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and set the times.</li>
            <li>The lights were easy to install and it cures gelish in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>The bulbs were easy to install</li>
            <li>Dries the hybrid polish very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>still going strong.....</li>
            <li>Used with CND Shellac, perfect for one hand or foot at a time, timer counting down remaining time.</li>
            <li>that it has the sheild to block some of the light coming out</li>
            <li>I am using the light with the Harmony Gelish product and it works like a charm within the time frame suggested by Harmony.  </li>
            <li>When I got my shellac nails done at the salon, the light shined in my eyes and the nail tech kept telling me that \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Because I worry about the light in my eyes, I close my eyes when the UV light comes on (even though it doesn&#x27;t go into your eyes...</li>
            <li>A foot would probably fit as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this dryer and by making this small investment, we are able to keep our nails looking great without the cost of a nail shop.  </li>
            <li>Is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it, they turn out great and last 10-20 days depending on your lifestyle.</li>
            <li>However, I still followed instructions about wiping it clean.  </li>
            <li>A full set will take about 40 minutes to and hour depending on the color, if you are doing it on yourself (darker colors take longer than lighter colors).&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t already have 4 more bulbs ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This is a really large lamp...works great, and your entire hand fits.  </li>
            <li>None the less it works great.</li>
            <li>Item is EXACTLY as described!  </li>
            <li>Features that are particularly handy include fan option, timer that can be set so that you can use the same time repeatedly and sensor on the tray that automatically activates the lamp so that you don&#x27;t have to push any buttons.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make it more comfortable and be worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be a good investiment at a reasonable price for Gelish or any regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The digital timer is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I had the fan go on, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it did very much...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back in a couple weeks when I change out to a color :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this light and this seller to anybody!</li>
            <li>This product works REALLY well and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this... saves me a $$$$, especially for a touch up between nail salons.  </li>
            <li>The beep sound is quite loud.</li>
            <li>At first after I put the included bulbs in the nail dryer it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I have had this lamp for over 3 years now and absolutely LOOOVE it!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Amazon for Christmas shopping and most likely will be my last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite particular and don&#x27;t want to spend one penny more than necessary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)This is not as easy as regular polsh.</li>
            <li>But the lamps are strong enough.</li>
            <li>The label on the top is poorly glued, so that was very cheap.</li>
            <li>For home use, the sensor feature is really helpful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because one set of lights doesn&#x27;t fit properly in the bracket.  </li>
            <li>I can still feel the lamp&#x27;s heat when it cures, but I don&#x27;t feel much of a breeze from the fan.</li>
            <li>The light are angled on the side just enough to get the thumb as well.</li>
            <li>and I would have been very upset</li>
            <li>Very upset that this was shipped.  </li>
            <li>If this came from Amazon they really have lowered their standards just to make a buck.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I are now doing our own shellac manicures and pedicures and when use both the lamp and the dryer at the same time, this little baby dries nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>Timer is a very flexible digital timer that is super easy to set (even with wet nails).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this u.v. lamp if you are looking for one.  </li>
            <li>I like the blue plastic shield so the UV light doesn&#x27;t shine up into your eyes, especially if you accidentally look into it while it&#x27;s turned on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Vogue Professional products.</li>
            <li>first, try second.</li>
            <li>There is a specific tecnique to gel nails, so read the instructions on any nail website first.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had ordered 4 replacement bulbs at the same time for a different uv dryer I have</li>
            <li>The protective film was laying in the product and clearly had been taken off before.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this once.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and last well over a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She doesn&#x27;t really have any dislikes, but it&#x27;s only made for one hand at a time.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only tried it with CND clear base and top coat, it performed better than any lamp used when I paid to go to a \\&quot;nail spa.\\</li>
            <li>The box was clearly used, opened the box and the bulb packaging was already torn open and used.  </li>
            <li>steady.&lt;br /&gt;3)Do not put the bottle near the lamp for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I bought the shellac Vogue professional 36 watt lamp several months ago&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Lasted a couple months then one day upon use it starts to smoke and makes a scary electricity sound and completely dies.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this u.v. lamp if you are looking for one.  </li>

            <li> Luckily I had ordered 4 replacement bulbs at the same time for a different uv dryer I have</li>
            <li> The protective film was laying in the product and clearly had been taken off before.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this once.</li>

            <li> I bought the shellac Vogue professional 36 watt lamp several months ago&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Lasted a couple months then one day upon use it starts to smoke and makes a scary electricity sound and completely dies.</li>
            <li> It is indeed price however it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of waiting for 10 minutes with other lamps with this one it takes 30 seconds for your nails to be dried.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m not sure how much difference the fan makes.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to tell if the Fan is really doing anything, but it doesn&#x27;t make any noise and doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall functionality.</li>
            <li> Life is so busy it&#x27;s hard to schedule time to get to salon.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful and cannot fix mistakes once you have cured a layer</li>
            <li> I have used it several times with CND base, color and top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought this model based on other reviews I had read about it.</li>
            <li> and I like the shield (the blue part)that protects your eyes and excessive UV lights from coming out.  </li>
            <li> Never had a problem with this lamp contrarily with other brands that kept failing or didn&#x27;t perform well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly not an air conditioner!   </li>
            <li> So my only complaint is that the lights provided didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the wrong ones were included with my order or if they somehow all broke in transit but very weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I also bought a base &amp; top coat shellac &amp; 3 colors, Now&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> A little (and I do mean very little) of the polish color came off (maybe from the edges where my nails are short?), but not from my nail.</li>

            <li> The only thing I thought it was led I must of read it wrong.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m just a little weird that way!)</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s not OK with me!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never leave reviews on products, but had to on this u.v. lamp because I bought it based on others&#x27; feedback, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I used it today to do my own shellac manicure and it turned out beautifully!!  I do like that it has the sheild to block some of the light coming out and I love the auto-on feature when you put your hand in it.  Highly recommend this u.v. lamp if you are looking for one.  I am very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> Item is EXACTLY as described!  Arrived on time and in mfg packaging.  I love the auto-on feature.  Just turn it on and then everytime you put your hand in it turns on automatically and starts the countdown.  Timer is a very flexible digital timer that is super easy to set (even with wet nails).  I am using the light with the Harmony Gelish product and it works like a charm within the time frame suggested by Harmony.  No extra curing required.  I am VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on doing your own nails at home, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve been doing my wives nails for over a year now and she is still happy with her nails and still gets lots of &amp;#34; where do you get you nails done&amp;#34;. That says a lot. Good fan and reliable lights.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice lamp. Although I&#x27;ve only tried it with CND clear base and top coat, it performed better than any lamp used when I paid to go to a \\&quot;nail spa.\\&quot; The gel cured perfectly with excellent shine. Features that are particularly handy include fan option, timer that can be set so that you can use the same time repeatedly and sensor on the tray that automatically activates the lamp so that you don&#x27;t have to push any buttons. For home use, the sensor feature is really helpful. I&#x27;ll report back in a couple weeks when I change out to a color :)</li>
            <li> This is the best and has amazing automatic on and off settings.  best device used yet.  I have to say this is better then the   ones used in the salons and I prefer to do touch ups at home.</li>
            <li> Poor product. Lasted a couple months then one day upon use it starts to smoke and makes a scary electricity sound and completely dies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got this particular machine.  It&#x27;s very handy having the UV light turn on just by sticking my hand in.  I do my manicures myself and so I don&#x27;t have to worry about messing up my nails by having to mess with buttons or switches.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because one set of lights doesn&#x27;t fit properly in the bracket.  Since it still works and I didn&#x27;t want to have to wait for another one to be shipped, I&#x27;m just keeping this one.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a UV light to do my own shellac nails! I researched UV lamps on Amazon and on Ebay and combed through several product reviews. I am quite particular and don&#x27;t want to spend one penny more than necessary. In the end, I decided on this UV lamp (Vogue ND362), AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY I DID!!  I like the blue plastic shield so the UV light doesn&#x27;t shine up into your eyes, especially if you accidentally look into it while it&#x27;s turned on. When I got my shellac nails done at the salon, the light shined in my eyes and the nail tech kept telling me that \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot;. Well, that&#x27;s not OK with me!!! My father had melanoma, and I already have difficulty with my eyes, so I don&#x27;t want to take any chances.   I LOVE that it turns on automatically when you insert your hand, then beeps and turns off automatically with whatever time you decide (in 5 second increments). Because I worry about the light in my eyes, I close my eyes when the UV light comes on (even though it doesn&#x27;t go into your eyes...I&#x27;m just a little weird that way!) and the audible beep tells me that the time is up. Love that! Then I apply another coat, and do it again. So easy!  It also has a fan/blower which turns on if you want it to. I had the fan go on, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it did very much...it&#x27;s certainly not an air conditioner!   I got excellent and immediate customer service from the company which makes this product (which is in California...important if you want something from the USA!!!!)  I would definitely recommend this light and this seller to anybody!</li>
            <li> Love this,the auto feature when you put your hand in makes it so easy. Works great and is well worth the extra money. Would definately recommend to make doing Shellac a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Updated feb. 2013....still going strong.....the fan does make an awful noise ....I don&#x27;t use the fan, found out it made noise when I turned it on by accident. The bulbs still working great...would still buy this again...still love it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of reseach prior to buying this lamp. I even had a run in with a cheaper one (different brand/seller) that did not work. This product works REALLY well and totally worth the money. A couple of FYI&#x27;s about Gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;1)Read first, try second. There is a specific tecnique to gel nails, so read the instructions on any nail website first. It will not work if you skip steps or are careless.&lt;br /&gt;2)This is not as easy as regular polsh. You need to be careful and cannot fix mistakes once you have cured a layer so go slow and steady.&lt;br /&gt;3)Do not put the bottle near the lamp for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;4) A full set will take about 40 minutes to and hour depending on the color, if you are doing it on yourself (darker colors take longer than lighter colors).&lt;br /&gt;5) It is well worth it, they turn out great and last 10-20 days depending on your lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This is a really large lamp...works great, and your entire hand fits.  A foot would probably fit as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> Love it! And the fan works well</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this once. I love the intensity of the lights and built in fan. I hope to save a lot of money doing my nails at home instead of the salon. It&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
            <li> This UV Lamp Dryer is wonderful!  My daughter and I are now doing our own shellac manicures and pedicures and when use both the lamp and the dryer at the same time, this little baby dries nails quickly.  I am extremely pleased with this dryer and by making this small investment, we are able to keep our nails looking great without the cost of a nail shop.  Ladies, if you want to save money, BUY this unit.  You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Life is so busy it&#x27;s hard to schedule time to get to salon. I was nervous as I had never applied Shellac on my own. This lamp was easy to put together it has a timer and has auto shut off. I have used it several times with CND base, color and top coat. It only does one hand at a time but its only a 3 minute set time so its doable. Worth every penny!!! This product has saved me $$$ me as one trip to Salon was $25.00. Now I have the freedom to do my nails on my schedule. Refreshing change.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for home use. It is easy to use and set the times. The lights were easy to install and it cures gelish in 10 seconds. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this model based on other reviews I had read about it. I also researched eBay as well for the lowest price.  I wanted it to use with the Harmony Gelish mini kit.  This model works great for it!  I did the 2 minutes per layer according to the instructions - 2 minutes for the foundation, 2 minutes for each polish layer, and 2 minutes for the top coat; it cured wonderfully.  I had no sticky residue at the end. However, I still followed instructions about wiping it clean.  A little (and I do mean very little) of the polish color came off (maybe from the edges where my nails are short?), but not from my nail. The lamp has a fan which was the one of the big selling points for me.  I thought it would make it more comfortable and be worth the extra money.  Personally, I&#x27;m not sure how much difference the fan makes.  I can still feel the lamp&#x27;s heat when it cures, but I don&#x27;t feel much of a breeze from the fan. You hear it, but you don&#x27;t feel it.  Maybe that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s suppose to work?  It won&#x27;t blow like a regular low level fan (if that&#x27;s what you think it will do.)  The bulbs were easy to install and I like the shield (the blue part)that protects your eyes and excessive UV lights from coming out.  The digital timer is very easy to use.  You can choose to use only the lamp, the lamp and fan, or just the fan. There are small ridges inside to keep your fingers seperated.  They are comfortable and a nice guide to placing your fingers inside the dryer without smudging your polish.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  I think it would be a good investiment at a reasonable price for Gelish or any regular nail polish.  I have yet to try it out for a pedicure, but it seems like it would be simple enough to do.</li>
            <li> Is super easy to use.  I love the timer and most important that it self activates when you get your hand inside, specially if you are doing your on nails. the cord has some issue I should contact the seller for that. Overall I am very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I recommend this lamp to anybody. It is indeed price however it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of waiting for 10 minutes with other lamps with this one it takes 30 seconds for your nails to be dried.</li>
            <li> Love it! Used with CND Shellac, perfect for one hand or foot at a time, timer counting down remaining time. Fan and sheild for eyes are a plus! Saved $$$ by getting a light to do my own nails and not pay salon prices.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works great. The only thing I thought it was led I must of read it wrong. It&#x27;s led timer on top . None the less it works great. It also does all five fingers at once. The light are angled on the side just enough to get the thumb as well.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year &amp; LOVE it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier! The hand activated sensor is great. I use with CND Shellac with great mani that ladts 2 weeks! Save tons $$$$$ over trips to salon!</li>
            <li> Love this... saves me a $$$$, especially for a touch up between nail salons.  Takes only minutes.. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great my wife likes it. The beep sound is quite loud.</li>
            <li> My second order from BARGAINSOURCES. This is a quality UV lamp that we use with the latest Shellac system. Dries the hybrid polish very quickly. Nice design, supported by a warranty enclosed with the unit. Never had a problem with this lamp contrarily with other brands that kept failing or didn&#x27;t perform well. I highly recommend the Vogue Professional products.</li>
            <li> At first after I put the included bulbs in the nail dryer it didn&#x27;t work.  All the lights were clicking and sometimes they would come on but never all 4 at once.  Luckily I had ordered 4 replacement bulbs at the same time for a different uv dryer I have so I put those in and they worked perfectly.  So my only complaint is that the lights provided didn&#x27;t work and I would have been very upset if I didn&#x27;t already have 4 more bulbs ready to go.  I don&#x27;t know if the wrong ones were included with my order or if they somehow all broke in transit but very weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the lights all started working I have had no complaints.  Everything works wonderfully!!  I love the motion detection.  Works great when doing your toes!!</li>
            <li> I have had this lamp for over 3 years now and absolutely LOOOVE it! It works great &#x3D;) I use it for shellac nails. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this just with regular nail polish. It dries fast and last well over a week.My nails have a nice shine to them and look great. I am in shipping and receiving so I am using my hands non stop. I&#x27;ve had my lamp now for a couple of months and am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the automatic on when putting the hand in.  My clients love it because they do not hit their fingers going in.  I use Shellac, Gelish and OPI did great on all!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Today she opened it and we set it up tonight for her and the girls to use.  The box was clearly used, opened the box and the bulb packaging was already torn open and used.  The protective film was laying in the product and clearly had been taken off before.  Then we tried to run the machine and the fan would work and then not work.  Very upset that this was shipped.  If this came from Amazon they really have lowered their standards just to make a buck.  If this came from a third party vendor they should be dropped from the Amazon list of vendors.  We went to exchange this product and guess what?  They are now out of stock.  This is the first time I have used Amazon for Christmas shopping and most likely will be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will update later to see how my return is handled.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as promised. The label on the top is poorly glued, so that was very cheap. The controls are very basic. But the lamps are strong enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful&lt;br /&gt;- Automatic hand sensor&lt;br /&gt;- Timer&lt;br /&gt;- Nice build quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t really have any dislikes, but it&#x27;s only made for one hand at a time. Also, it&#x27;s hard to tell if the Fan is really doing anything, but it doesn&#x27;t make any noise and doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall functionality.</li>
            <li> I bought the shellac Vogue professional 36 watt lamp several months ago&lt;br /&gt;And it works great. I also bought a base &amp; top coat shellac &amp; 3 colors, Now&lt;br /&gt;I can do my nails at home a lot cheaper then going to the salon. Easy to use.</li>
