            <li>This one is a huge success!!!!</li>
            <li>It is bit more greasy than I like, but for the price I purchased it for, $3.50, I get a lot of bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>After using this product for one week, I purchased Hawaiian Silky 14-In One, which worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love is that it moisturizes without a greasy feel.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the moisture, I just wish there was more slip for detangling my 3c curls. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have shiny hair after I solely use this on my wash day.for healthy hair purpose/treatment.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for people with natural hair!\\&quot; Very moisturizing! !</li>
            <li>great product, leave in hair condition keeps hair soft not crusty</li>
            <li>This stuff right here is the truth.com!!</li>
            <li>I like the smell, its a strong fragrant product, which I do</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still strongly recommend the product for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The stuff has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Love it and it leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The definition was great when mixed with Eco Styler for a wash n go.</li>
            <li>This product compared feels light on my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is really soft and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I went through so many trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very exciting that a product does not need to cost $30.00 to work.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my twist out last night with great success....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I continue to use this often my hair will start to grow like a wild fire. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, contains vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to nourish your hair and scalp, smells nice, and leaves my hair soft with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was so cool</li>
            <li>I have never had success with wash and go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and I&#x27;ve used many leave ins that were pricey</li>
            <li>Finally, I would recommend this product because it smells good and works very well with additional &#x27;oils&#x27;-</li>
            <li>a long way great item for detangling natural hair</li>
            <li>Help to detangle my hair (4b/4c) with little hair lost, nice smell and keep my hair smooth</li>
            <li>My method of use is as follows: 1) Apply Coconut Oil-which I purchase from the Indian Grocer in my neighborhood ($3.99 for a very good size bottle) to my sectioned, wet hair, especially the ends.</li>
            <li>As someone who has purchased and used thousands of dollars worth of hair products since my BC in Dec 2010, I believe I am in a position to offer great advice/recommendation on hair products for (natural) black hair.</li>
            <li>and this is just great for someone with thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would not want any thing better for my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair.</li>
            <li>first time using this product</li>
            <li>Everyday after I&#x27;ve been rubbing it in between the braided parts, my scalp feel so good afterwards</li>
            <li>For me, its best for laying down my hair for ponytail days, or trying to tame mild frizzies.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I would recommend this product because it is very affordable (not from this Amazon seller of course!)-Please visit your local beauty supply shops/stores in your neighborhood to purchase this product-I just re-stocked mine on Saturday for $4.99-15Oz jar-side note-The owner of the Beauty Supply store told me that many people are purchasing this \\&quot;Leave-In&#x27; and he immediately pulled out his order catalog</li>
            <li>I have mostly 4a hair with 3c in the very back and very front and all is well.</li>
            <li>This large jar of heaven costs all of $4.99....</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I would recommend this product because it &#x27;saved&#x27; my hair from breakage: I was having MAJOR breakage and split ends issues due to dryness/lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>Got the product fast...</li>
            <li>My hair really loves this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like how my curls turn out.</li>
            <li>And that means a lot coming from me, a person who is usually very picky about scented products.</li>
            <li>None, really.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to report that I do not see &#x27;100&#x27;s of bits &amp; pieces&#x27; of my broken hair in my sink, after manipulation, any longer.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to report that I do not see &#x27;100&#x27;s of bits &amp; pieces&#x27; of my broken hair in my sink, after manipulation, any longer.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and it gets HOT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product and makes my hair feel amazing, but I will not be using everyday maybe only once as a leave in after I wash my hair, but for a everyday moisturizer I will be finding something else.</li>
            <li>$15 is pretty steep though for something that isn&#x27;t completely natural.</li>
            <li>I had decent results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>3) Apply a little more Coconut Oil to my hair to finish/polish the look.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which is very frizzy if no product is applied.</li>
            <li>It will now be my go to leave-in when I can&#x27;t get the product that I normally use.</li>
            <li>I have not advanced to wash and goes yet, so I do mostly twists and braid outs.</li>
            <li>:) Strangely, it is imported and sold in our local beauty stores at a cheaper price than this amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally do</li>
            <li>I start getting little bits of white buildup in my hair that kind of resembled dandruff.</li>
            <li>A friend recently sent me a pic of her first wash and go.  </li>
            <li>If you are natural and are lacking moisture, this is it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and works for me and a little goes</li>
            <li>I only use this after I wash and condition my hair (organix keratin) and work this through wet hair focusing primarily on my roots and ends.</li>
            <li>; It made my hair unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think that my 4a/4b hair could ever feel as soft and moisturized as this has made my hair.</li>
            <li>I am a busy stylist.</li>
            <li>ppl talk about how soft it is..</li>
            <li>my hair and  leaves  my hair soft and  moisturized.</li>
            <li>I went natural for the summer</li>
            <li>I actually bought this in Walmart so it was much cheaper than online.</li>
            <li>It becomes soft and silky without using a lot.</li>
            <li>and my hair stays perfectly soft until bedtime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no frizz, enhancing my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I came across this Leave-In conditioner in early March and decided to try it</li>
            <li>I came across this Leave-In conditioner in early March and decided to try it</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to manage and can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>it was only $3.00 what was I losing after my normal wash day</li>
            <li>I only see the normal &#x27;shedded&#x27; hair</li>
            <li>I only see the normal &#x27;shedded&#x27; hair</li>
            <li>Secondly, this product is phenomenal in hydrating/moisturizing my very thick hair-I do not necessarily need a product to make my hair curly, but when I apply this product, it saturates my hair strands thus causing it to become very tamed/</li>
            <li>I bought for 3.50 at the dollar general...</li>
            <li>But when my hair dried most of it went away, and came back when my hair was wet</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase and do not use everyday</li>
            <li>I hate when i experiment when new things even though I know a great product for my hair and</li>
            <li>The only caveat I&#x27;d add is that it&#x27;s a little heavier than what I was using previously; so I may have to start using shampoo more often in case of buildup.</li>
            <li>PS, buying this at your local dollar general, walmart or beauty supply store will save you a ton of money</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning back to my natural hair and this is the only thing that makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I had gotten half braids/half micros in my hair the next day after purchase, as the day progressed I start to experience this intense itch all through out my scalp</li>
            <li>I have 4c hair and have always had trouble finding something that gave me long lasting moisture(as in more than a few hours).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at other less expensive items as well a great buy</li>

            <li> and I am happy to report that I do not see &#x27;100&#x27;s of bits &amp; pieces&#x27; of my broken hair in my sink, after manipulation, any longer.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and it gets HOT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good product and makes my hair feel amazing, but I will not be using everyday maybe only once as a leave in after I wash my hair, but for a everyday moisturizer I will be finding something else.</li>
            <li> $15 is pretty steep though for something that isn&#x27;t completely natural.</li>
            <li> I had decent results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 3) Apply a little more Coconut Oil to my hair to finish/polish the look.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is very frizzy if no product is applied.</li>
            <li> It will now be my go to leave-in when I can&#x27;t get the product that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I have not advanced to wash and goes yet, so I do mostly twists and braid outs.</li>
            <li> :) Strangely, it is imported and sold in our local beauty stores at a cheaper price than this amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally do</li>
            <li> I start getting little bits of white buildup in my hair that kind of resembled dandruff.</li>
            <li> A friend recently sent me a pic of her first wash and go.  </li>
            <li> If you are natural and are lacking moisture, this is it!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and works for me and a little goes</li>
            <li> I only use this after I wash and condition my hair (organix keratin) and work this through wet hair focusing primarily on my roots and ends.</li>
            <li> ; It made my hair unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think that my 4a/4b hair could ever feel as soft and moisturized as this has made my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a busy stylist.</li>
            <li> ppl talk about how soft it is..</li>
            <li> my hair and  leaves  my hair soft and  moisturized.</li>
            <li> I went natural for the summer</li>
            <li> I actually bought this in Walmart so it was much cheaper than online.</li>
            <li> It becomes soft and silky without using a lot.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays perfectly soft until bedtime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no frizz, enhancing my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I came across this Leave-In conditioner in early March and decided to try it</li>
            <li> I came across this Leave-In conditioner in early March and decided to try it</li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to manage and can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> it was only $3.00 what was I losing after my normal wash day</li>
            <li> I only see the normal &#x27;shedded&#x27; hair</li>
            <li> I only see the normal &#x27;shedded&#x27; hair</li>
            <li> Secondly, this product is phenomenal in hydrating/moisturizing my very thick hair-I do not necessarily need a product to make my hair curly, but when I apply this product, it saturates my hair strands thus causing it to become very tamed/</li>
            <li> I bought for 3.50 at the dollar general...</li>
            <li> But when my hair dried most of it went away, and came back when my hair was wet</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase and do not use everyday</li>
            <li> I hate when i experiment when new things even though I know a great product for my hair and</li>
            <li> The only caveat I&#x27;d add is that it&#x27;s a little heavier than what I was using previously; so I may have to start using shampoo more often in case of buildup.</li>
            <li> PS, buying this at your local dollar general, walmart or beauty supply store will save you a ton of money</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning back to my natural hair and this is the only thing that makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I had gotten half braids/half micros in my hair the next day after purchase, as the day progressed I start to experience this intense itch all through out my scalp</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and have always had trouble finding something that gave me long lasting moisture(as in more than a few hours).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at other less expensive items as well a great buy</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t speak for everyone&#x27;s hair but as far as mines goes i probably only have to re-moisturize my hair every other day or every two days.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling very soft, hydrated, and slightly relaxed.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize very well with very little build up.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m too lazy to really style my hair, I will use this.</li>
            <li> I also seal with a Hopkins oil or grape seed oil, l brought this and wasn&#x27;t using until last month long it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on Day 4 of a 3 strand twisted out hair in dry weather at the tail end of summer and my hair doesn&#x27;t have the dry crunch sound, feels soft still and is holding its curl.</li>
            <li> : I was having MAJOR breakage and split ends issues due to dryness/lack of moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with dry, frizzy, curly hair and this is all I use.</li>
            <li> it left it dry....VERY dry.</li>
            <li> My twist outs are moist and not dry when it take them down.</li>
            <li> but I found it left my hair feeling extremely \\&quot;built-up\\&quot; with product as the week progressed.</li>
            <li> I have thick, very soft that turns to puff as soon ands moisture hits.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday along with extra virgin olive oil even though this stuff does have olive oil already in it.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED IT TO DO..</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive of scents or want something with a subtle scent this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> now a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way - I moisturize with it in the morning</li>
            <li> so well I don&#x27;t need any other styling product.</li>
            <li> i have always had very thick and coarse hair but ever since i BC (big chopped)</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Walmart a few days ago for my daughters thick natural hair.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is so soft and thick!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way my hair is past ( bsl )</li>
            <li> Less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this product left my hair very dry and frizzy after it completely dried.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was going crazy</li>
            <li> Now granted, I didn&#x27;t add a little water to my hairlike</li>
            <li> so I chose this to be my everday slip, but using this everyday did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a thousand products to tame my curls and this is it.</li>
            <li> after using a little i then seal it with a thick oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s selling here for $15 when I paid $5 at my beauty store</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to put this in your hair everyday, well at least i don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not crunchy or hard either..</li>
            <li> The jar was clumsily wrapped in packing tape.  </li>
            <li> it is cheaper than this or at least from the store I shop</li>
            <li> but once I did add some water, it felt worse.</li>
            <li> ITS KINDA THIN.</li>
            <li> I tried all the expensive, &#x27;high end&#x27; branded products but was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried all the expensive, &#x27;high end&#x27; branded products but was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> , by night the itch was so unbearable that I was miserable and unable to sleep, my scalp was burning and itching all over, this conditioner was the first thing I layed eyes on, I was so desperate I globbed it all throughout my scalp.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> so now, I am mad because i have a big jar of crap that I don&#x27;t plan to use ever again unless I combine it with something else which i hate to do.</li>
            <li> The painful itching and burning ceased immediately.  </li>
            <li> this stuff would be crap.</li>
            <li> and it is CRAP.</li>
            <li> , I had to stop using this crap.</li>
            <li> but I am not into all the perfume scented crap.</li>
            <li> I am mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got the product fast...Love this cream!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It will now be my go to leave-in when I can&#x27;t get the product that I normally use. It does moisturize very well with very little build up. It is bit more greasy than I like, but for the price I purchased it for, $3.50, I get a lot of bang for my buck. It smells fruity and mixes well with Eco Styler gel, although it doesn&#x27;t mix well with the curling custard from the same line. The definition was great when mixed with Eco Styler for a wash n go.</li>
            <li> This product is water based and does not have the thickness/consistency I was looking for to use on my hair. I have very thick hair, and this product left my hair very dry and frizzy after it completely dried. After using this product for one week, I purchased Hawaiian Silky 14-In One, which worked much better. It&#x27;s thicker, contains vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to nourish your hair and scalp, smells nice, and leaves my hair soft with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CD&lt;br /&gt;Lancaster, CA</li>
            <li> I can finally comb my 4C hair without the &amp;#34;velcro&amp;#34; noise as my husband calls it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li> I have not advanced to wash and goes yet, so I do mostly twists and braid outs. I have used this along with the boucny curly product. I had decent results. Now I have used this leave in alone to just to moisturize my hair. And I am thinking if I use this to do a blow out, it will great. Lastly, I didn&#x27;t get this on amazon, I got it for 4.99 at a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> A friend recently sent me a pic of her first wash and go.  Her hair is type 4 and beautifully coily.  I have never had success with wash and go&#x27;s as my hair is always drying, puffing and frizzing but this product kept her hair perfectly moisturized all day.  I asked her what she used and immediately purchased a jar.  Used it on my twist out last night with great success....I love this stuff and it leaves a very nice mango tropical smell to the hair that stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love is that it moisturizes without a greasy feel.  My twist out is curly, moisturized and defined with no frizz.  I can&#x27;t wait to try a wash and go with this product and see how it works.  It&#x27;s very exciting that a product does not need to cost $30.00 to work.  This large jar of heaven costs all of $4.99....and this is just great for someone with thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased the As I am double butter cream but I will be returning that to Sally&#x27;s.  In my opinion it does not perform like this product and I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on that.  They need to lower the cost of that line and maybe I will go back to it.  This one is a huge success!!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My mom gave this to my daughter, and I decided to try it and I am so glad that I did; It made my hair unbelievably soft. I didn&#x27;t even think that my 4a/4b hair could ever feel as soft and moisturized as this has made my hair. My twist outs are moist and not dry when it take them down. I am so happy I found this, and I will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it! I don&#x27;t always have time to help with her hair. I am a busy stylist. Wanted something she could leave in and go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and I&#x27;ve used many leave ins that were pricey and I didn&#x27;t like them at all so I saw reviews and decided to give it a try it was only $3.00 what was I losing after my normal wash day I used this product I was insistanly impressed my hair was well moisturized for days gave my twists great definition this will be a permanent product in my hair regimen it&#x27;s cheap and works for me and a little goes a long way great item for detangling natural hair I&#x27;m looking at other less expensive items as well a great buy</li>
            <li> My hair really loves this product.  I use it every day.  It makes my hair easy to manage and can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a leave in by Cantu and it elongated my curls gives shine and definition to my curls I dampen hair before using. My hair is 3a b &amp; c I also seal with a Hopkins oil or grape seed oil, l brought this and wasn&#x27;t using until last month long it and the smell is wonderful, I definitely would  recommend this to anyone with moisture  and shine or dryness issues, love this product and I use it sparingly, a little goes a long way my hair is past ( bsl ) if that helps</li>
            <li> The jar was clumsily wrapped in packing tape.  It looked like someone had tried and returned this also.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is the truth.com!! When I can&#x27;t find my Elasta qp leave in conditioner I alternate to this and it leaves my hair so moisturized and detangled!! I love this and the moisturizer!!! 👌</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and have always had trouble finding something that gave me long lasting moisture(as in more than a few hours). Honey! This is it. I use olive oil to seal and I&#x27;m set. The great smell of this product over powers the olive oil. If you are natural and are lacking moisture, this is it!  Even my cuticles look better. I bought for 3.50 at the dollar general...</li>
            <li> Love it and it leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with dry, frizzy, curly hair and this is all I use. I&#x27;ve tried a thousand products to tame my curls and this is it. It leaves my curls moisturized, bouncy, shiny and healthy looking. Not crunchy or hard either.. ppl talk about how soft it is.. my daughter can&#x27;t keep her hands out of it!! And it smells good too!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it ls wonderful and it  detangles  my hair and  leaves  my hair soft and  moisturized. However, this product leaves buildup. I went natural for the summer so I chose this to be my everday slip, but using this everyday did not work for me. I start getting little bits of white buildup in my hair that kind of resembled dandruff. At first I thought I was going crazy lol. But when my hair dried most of it went away, and came back when my hair was wet so I knew it was this product !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product and makes my hair feel amazing, but I will not be using everyday maybe only once as a leave in after I wash my hair, but for a everyday moisturizer I will be finding something else.</li>
            <li> I like it, its not like a wonder product or anything but when I&#x27;m too lazy to really style my hair, I will use this. I like the smell, its a strong fragrant product, which I do like but if you are sensitive of scents or want something with a subtle scent this isn&#x27;t for you. For me, its best for laying down my hair for ponytail days, or trying to tame mild frizzies.</li>
            <li> This has to be the BEST leave in conditioner for curly hair. I use it everyday along with extra virgin olive oil even though this stuff does have olive oil already in it. I have naturally curly hair which is very frizzy if no product is applied. Is smells wonderful. In the end, you should definitely buy this. I actually bought this in Walmart so it was much cheaper than online.</li>
            <li> I would not want any thing better for my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair. It becomes soft and silky without using a lot. Thanks</li>
            <li> first time using this product and I really like how my curls turn out. Best product I started using this year!</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is 3b/c and my hair loves this! I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s selling here for $15 when I paid $5 at my beauty store but anyways...I like the smell and texture. This tames my frizz and leaves my hair feeling moisturized without feeling greasy. It tames the frizz so well I don&#x27;t need any other styling product. I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture and I do love Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl and Style Milk but I found it left my hair feeling extremely \\&quot;built-up\\&quot; with product as the week progressed. This product compared feels light on my hair. I use this then topped with coconut oil. Do NOT use Eco Styler gel with this as it will clump. $15 is pretty steep though for something that isn&#x27;t completely natural.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I ever used in my life. I went through so many trying to find the right one. I am currently transitioning back to my natural hair and this is the only thing that makes my hair manageable. I use it on my damp hair along with Organix Argan Oil &amp; Shea Butter Moisture Restore Weightless Oil. Perfect combination, I think it works well with any oils but I love those two together. Shine and nice smelling hair. Less breakage.</li>
            <li> It works well. Help to detangle my hair (4b/4c) with little hair lost, nice smell and keep my hair smooth</li>
            <li> Love this product.I live in the Caribbean and it gets HOT. My hair basically turns into a shrub. This product moisturizes my hair well and it smells very very good. Best smelling hair product I&#x27;ve ever had :) Strangely, it is imported and sold in our local beauty stores at a cheaper price than this amazon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still strongly recommend the product for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I hate when i experiment when new things even though I know a great product for my hair and it is cheaper than this or at least from the store I shop it is. Anyway, I knew from the moment, i opened the jar this stuff would be crap. and it is CRAP. I was putting in about 20 big twist in my hair when i got to twist number 6, I had to stop using this crap. The stuff only coats,so once it dries, I knew my hair would feel like straw. Now granted, I didn&#x27;t add a little water to my hairlike I normally do but once I did add some water, it felt worse. The stuff has a strong smell. Some females might like the smell but I am not into all the perfume scented crap. Keep it simple. so now, I am mad because i have a big jar of crap that I don&#x27;t plan to use ever again unless I combine it with something else which i hate to do. In case your wondering, I have 4C hair so maybe for girls with 2c or 3c, it might work. I am mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the moisture, I just wish there was more slip for detangling my 3c curls. :)</li>
            <li> THIS LEAVE IN HAS A GREAT SMELL, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T MOISTURE LIKE I EXPECTED IT TO DO.. ITS KINDA THIN.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Walmart a few days ago for my daughters thick natural hair.  I had gotten half braids/half micros in my hair the next day after purchase, as the day progressed I start to experience this intense itch all through out my scalp, by night the itch was so unbearable that I was miserable and unable to sleep, my scalp was burning and itching all over, this conditioner was the first thing I layed eyes on, I was so desperate I globbed it all throughout my scalp.  Oh My Goosh it felt sooooo good! it was so cool, it was like putting a fire out.  The painful itching and burning ceased immediately.  Everyday after I&#x27;ve been rubbing it in between the braided parts, my scalp feel so good afterwards this stuff is AWESOME!!!!! I&#x27;m sure if I continue to use this often my hair will start to grow like a wild fire. :-)</li>
            <li> i ABSOLUTELY love this stuff! i have always had very thick and coarse hair but ever since i BC (big chopped) recently it seems as if my hair is somewhat softer. now a little goes a long way with this product. after using a little i then seal it with a thick oil. my hair is really soft and it smells so good. you don&#x27;t need to put this in your hair everyday, well at least i don&#x27;t. i can&#x27;t speak for everyone&#x27;s hair but as far as mines goes i probably only have to re-moisturize my hair every other day or every two days. PS, buying this at your local dollar general, walmart or beauty supply store will save you a ton of money</li>
            <li> great product, leave in hair condition keeps hair soft not crusty</li>
            <li> Pro: Good for twist-outs on my 4C hair, and an excellent leave-in. A little bit goes a long way - I moisturize with it in the morning and my hair stays perfectly soft until bedtime.&lt;br /&gt; It also smells great! And that means a lot coming from me, a person who is usually very picky about scented products. It smells like a mango smoothie with hints of citrus, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Con: None, really. The only caveat I&#x27;d add is that it&#x27;s a little heavier than what I was using previously; so I may have to start using shampoo more often in case of buildup. No biggie, though.</li>
            <li> As someone who has purchased and used thousands of dollars worth of hair products since my BC in Dec 2010, I believe I am in a position to offer great advice/recommendation on hair products for (natural) black hair. Firstly, I would recommend this product because it is very affordable (not from this Amazon seller of course!)-Please visit your local beauty supply shops/stores in your neighborhood to purchase this product-I just re-stocked mine on Saturday for $4.99-15Oz jar-side note-The owner of the Beauty Supply store told me that many people are purchasing this \\&quot;Leave-In&#x27; and he immediately pulled out his order catalog to order/re-stock his shelves with this product. Secondly, this product is phenomenal in hydrating/moisturizing my very thick hair-I do not necessarily need a product to make my hair curly, but when I apply this product, it saturates my hair strands thus causing it to become very tamed/no frizz, enhancing my natural curls. I actually prefer to use this Leave-In Conditioner instead of the African Pride&#x27;Bouncy Curl Pudding&#x27; (will tell you why later). Thirdly, it is a non-greasy product, even though it contains oil. My method of use is as follows: 1) Apply Coconut Oil-which I purchase from the Indian Grocer in my neighborhood ($3.99 for a very good size bottle) to my sectioned, wet hair, especially the ends. 2) Apply this Leave-In, paying attention to my (hair) ends, taking time to smooth/detangle as I go along. 3) Apply a little more Coconut Oil to my hair to finish/polish the look. Now, I sometimes 2 strand-twist my hair and leave it, or style it, all depending on my agenda for the day/night. Finally, I would recommend this product because it smells good and works very well with additional &#x27;oils&#x27;- I do not encounter residue issues when using my coconut oil along with this product; however, you will have residue issues if you use the &#x27;Bouncy Curl Pudding&#x27; along with oils. Most importantly, I would recommend this product because it &#x27;saved&#x27; my hair from breakage: I was having MAJOR breakage and split ends issues due to dryness/lack of moisture.I tried all the expensive, &#x27;high end&#x27; branded products but was very disappointed with the results. I came across this Leave-In conditioner in early March and decided to try it and I am happy to report that I do not see &#x27;100&#x27;s of bits &amp; pieces&#x27; of my broken hair in my sink, after manipulation, any longer. I only see the normal &#x27;shedded&#x27; hair and I feel so Happy!!! I am a very satisfied consumer!breakage: I was having MAJOR breakage and split ends issues due to dryness/lack of moisture.I tried all the expensive, &#x27;high end&#x27; branded products but was very disappointed with the results.

            <li> Love IT!!! I&#x27;m on Day 4 of a 3 strand twisted out hair in dry weather at the tail end of summer and my hair doesn&#x27;t have the dry crunch sound, feels soft still and is holding its curl. I have mostly 4a hair with 3c in the very back and very front and all is well. I can run my fingers through my hair with out hearing the &amp;#34;snapping sound&amp;#34;. Bought it out of curiosity and it&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommend it. BTW I used just the product with no sealing oil, which I imagine would be even better, and it smells so good too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HTH Lovelies</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for my hair. it left it dry....VERY dry.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Leaves my hair feeling very soft, hydrated, and slightly relaxed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for people with natural hair!\\&quot; Very moisturizing! ! Some body referred me this product. To me, will definitely buy again! !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year now and my hair is so soft and thick! I have thick, very soft that turns to puff as soon ands moisture hits. I only use this after I wash and condition my hair (organix keratin) and work this through wet hair focusing primarily on my roots and ends. It works wonders for detangling I don&#x27;t even use a detangler spray anymore. Definitely worth the purchase and do not use everyday I don&#x27;t have shiny hair after I solely use this on my wash day.for healthy hair purpose/treatment.</li>
