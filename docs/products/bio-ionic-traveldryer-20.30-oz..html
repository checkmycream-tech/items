            <li>This is better for travel.</li>
            <li>Love my dryer..</li>
            <li>My favorite hair dryer</li>
            <li>My original 8 year old Bio Ionic Travel Pro was awesome.</li>
            <li>I have the full size one in this brand and this travel it is not as good as the full.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and perfect for everyday hair drying!</li>
            <li>Easy to store and light weight.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>it does make my hair look sleek, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>; that works perfect a few months</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t believe how light weight it is.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you want a light blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very light and actually makes my hair look better, nice and full and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>They said I should call BioIonic and try to get the S&amp;H waived because of how soon it broke and that I paid full price.  </li>
            <li>I have the full size and was carrying it around.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as larger one!!</li>
            <li>I love how it dries and leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I</li>
            <li>so I guess I might update this if the service is really good, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent $100 on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make my hair less frizzy, and the temperature settings (only 2 - hot and warm) are great.</li>
            <li>The directional nozzle is the right size for me, and prevents burning.   </li>
            <li>I use a round brush and this dryer to straighten my very curly hair and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>The most I had hoped for was that it would be an acceptable alternative to my current hair dryer while I was on the cruise.  </li>
            <li>I loved the look and feel of my hair so much that this hair dryer has become my everyday dryer.</li>
            <li>She uses the full size one, which I found to be a bit expensive, but this one is great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is probably fine for a domestic travel blow dryer, but that is not how it is represented.</li>
            <li>It heats evenly and blows a steady fast stream of hot air (like some people I know).  </li>
            <li>It fits my hand nicely and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use as it is light and small.</li>
            <li>I bought this full price from a local store for $99</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring it back to the store, but I was complaining that I paid full price for it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad if you&#x27;re looking to skip the middle man and bypass the pesky on/off switch!</li>
            <li>Had the older version of this for 10 years.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li>After 4 months, the high button was intermittent.  </li>
            <li>I received the newer version and the high setting on that broke as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to help me dry my hair faster...</li>
            <li>I feel I have even more control over it with the round brush on the that speed.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade to this new bio ionic and spend a little more to treat myself and my hair.  </li>
            <li>So I received a new one and used it about 10 times.  </li>
            <li>The new one was defective( must be a fluke) but the seller is replacing it with no hassle and paying all shipping costs.</li>
            <li>Both speeds dry the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating when I say that the first time we used it, I took it out of the plastic and the entire handle fell apart and the remainder of the blow dryer literally fell into pieces.  </li>
            <li>This was to replace my cheap little 15</li>
            <li>Although I did like the extra small size of the Chi better.</li>
            <li>I use it as my major hairdryer and leave it at home.  </li>
            <li>on the handle of the picture showed, it has four settings (including off), but turned out it has only three settings - high, low, and</li>
            <li>This dryer is a great size (relatively small) and doesn&#x27;t make your arm too tired.</li>
            <li>+ year old conair that we have used extensively.</li>
            <li>why it doesn&#x27;t really seem to dry my hair faster than any regular dryer....</li>
            <li>I had this carefully packed in my carry one which was in my possession the entire time and NOT thrown around in a large checked on bag.  </li>
            <li>each time the handle broke apart after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>Dries a little slower than my full size dryer which is to be expected.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item received as described. Love it.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife needed for her international trips. life is good</li>
            <li> Good power. Great for travel. Great price. Leaves my hair smooth. My hairdresser actually recomended the travel size for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Just used this dryer overseas, and it actually didn&#x27;t burn up like the Chi did. Although I did like the extra small size of the Chi better. This one is a bit bigger but not overly heavy. Dries a little slower than my full size dryer which is to be expected. All in all I guess it&#x27;s a good travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I have the full size one in this brand and this travel it is not as good as the full.  The full size is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for travel; I needed something under 1500 watt because of the watt limitation on the cruise ship. I also wanted a dryer with a good styling nozzle.  This dryer is a bit expensive for the purpose I originally purchased it for, but it met my needs so I bought it.    When it arrived I tried it out to see what it does to my hair.  The most I had hoped for was that it would be an acceptable alternative to my current hair dryer while I was on the cruise.  I loved the look and feel of my hair so much that this hair dryer has become my everyday dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not as powerful as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;It can dry my 5-year-old&#x27;s short hair(barely touch her shoulder) in 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;But for me, I have long hair all the way to the waist, and I can&#x27;t use it to dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the handle of the picture showed, it has four settings (including off), but turned out it has only three settings - high, low, and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is for people who have thin and short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after my hair stylist recommended it to me. She uses the full size one, which I found to be a bit expensive, but this one is great.  It fits my hand nicely and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.  Plus, since it&#x27;s a travel dryer, I can take it with me whenever I go somewhere that doesn&#x27;t provide hair dryers.  It&#x27;s dual-voltage, which makes it compatible for international travel, too.  The best thing about the dryer is the air temperature and quality. It does make my hair less frizzy, and the temperature settings (only 2 - hot and warm) are great. The directional nozzle is the right size for me, and prevents burning.   I do wish it had a cold temperature setting. And it takes a little bit to get used to the swivel action on the handle, but once you do, it&#x27;s not a problem to use it. Just try it a few times before you decide.</li>
            <li> Had the older version of this for 10 years. Ordered the newer one (twice!) each time the handle broke apart after the first few uses. They definitely don&#x27;t make it like they used to! I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this two months prior to my European vacation because it has dual voltage. This was to replace my cheap little 15 + year old conair that we have used extensively. I decided to upgrade to this new bio ionic and spend a little more to treat myself and my hair.  I was hesitant to purchase this because I did read some unfavorable reviews but that is to be expected with any product. I am not exaggerating when I say that the first time we used it, I took it out of the plastic and the entire handle fell apart and the remainder of the blow dryer literally fell into pieces.  I had this carefully packed in my carry one which was in my possession the entire time and NOT thrown around in a large checked on bag.  Unfortunately I am now beyond the one month return period. PLEASE EXAMINE AND TEST THIS PRODUCT  befor return period is up!!!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve used! Very light weight and perfect for everyday hair drying!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is lightweight but a heavyweight in power.  Travels so well too!  Would not want to use anything else and I pray they don&#x27;t ever change or discontinue it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I originally bought this to help me dry my hair faster...why it doesn&#x27;t really seem to dry my hair faster than any regular dryer....it does make my hair look sleek, shiny and frizz free. I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Great for non-travel as well. Easy to store and light weight. Hair texture seems softer and smoother as well !</li>
            <li> This dryer is a great size (relatively small) and doesn&#x27;t make your arm too tired. I use a round brush and this dryer to straighten my very curly hair and it works beautifully. The bio-ionic conditioning helps take the frizz out. I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this full price from a local store for $99 (I see it&#x27;s not $50).  After 4 months, the high button was intermittent.  Then, it stopped working.  Then, the low button was intermittent.  I couldn&#x27;t bring it back to the store, but I was complaining that I paid full price for it.  My dryer is still covered under warranty but I have to pay $20 for shipping and handling.  They said I should call BioIonic and try to get the S&amp;H waived because of how soon it broke and that I paid full price.  BioIonic said they wouldn&#x27;t waive it.  I&#x27;m about to send it in for replacement.. so I guess I might update this if the service is really good, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent $100 on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uodate 12/17/2013.  So I received a new one and used it about 10 times.  I received the newer version and the high setting on that broke as well.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Very light and actually makes my hair look better, nice and full and not frizzy.  I have short thin hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great!  It is just as good as my full size Bio Ionic but lighter in weight which makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I use it as my major hairdryer and leave it at home.  It heats evenly and blows a steady fast stream of hot air (like some people I know).  I like it.</li>
            <li> KEEP LOOKING! Broke after only 5 uses, and it was only used for maybe 5-10 minutes each time! Power button is stuck in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position. Now to turn it on, I plug it in. To shut it off, I unplug it. Not bad if you&#x27;re looking to skip the middle man and bypass the pesky on/off switch! POOR QUALITY. VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> I love Bio Ionic products. This dryer is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve travelled with this and used it at home . . . Compact and lightweight, this drier is easy to handle and does a great job drying.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4. I have been using this dryer for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and it takes a long time to dry it. This dryer keeps my hair from being so fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the high button starts to go bad. This is what happens to the dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very time. It looks like they could fix this problem.</li>
            <li> My original 8 year old Bio Ionic Travel Pro was awesome. I used it daily for eight years before it died.  Ordered this one as a replacement.  Something inside snapped after 4.5 months. I called the company who said to fill out the form and send it to them  with dryer for &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; and they may possibly replace it.  It&#x27;s been over 6 weeks, and I haven&#x27;t heard from them.  Maybe they don&#x27;t make this dryer like they used to.</li>
            <li> Hi I bought this dryer  on September 6, 2015  receive it on Sept 10 I started using it om Sept 11 or 12, but on Feb 8, 2016 it stopped working , it worked only 5 months and the other, because I buy 2, the other is working well and  I&#x27;ve already bought others like this and all have failed at sometime  but the newest one is 5 months of use , what happens with this ¨&amp;#34;professional dryers&amp;#34; that works perfect a few months and then they begin to fail and then suddenly stop working, and I love them because they don&#x27;t damaged hair , I need a solution. Thankyou</li>
            <li> great dryer that I use at home and traveling as well.</li>
            <li> We purchased this item specifically for a trip to Europe.  The wiring is for domestic US so we had to buy converters.  We turned it on in Paris and it fried in 2 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably fine for a domestic travel blow dryer, but that is not how it is represented.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Broke after a couple uses. Contacted the company and they want me to pay to ship it back.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. I have the full size and was carrying it around. This is better for travel. Love it!</li>
            <li> I got scared when I read some of these reviews, but bought the dryer anyway because my hairdresser suggested it. I have had none of the problems I read about. I love how it dries and leaves my hair soft and frizz free. I also can&#x27;t believe how light weight it is. I use the lower speed for styling. I feel I have even more control over it with the round brush on the that speed. Both speeds dry the hair quickly. I was using the conair ion dryer and it was nothing like this one. This is a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Great experience. Seller was wonderful about helping me to replace hair dryer.  Have had this dryer before and was very happy with it.  The new one was defective( must be a fluke) but the seller is replacing it with no hassle and paying all shipping costs. Would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love my dryer..I had surgery on my arm and other models are way to heavy.  I would recommend this product if you want a light blow dryer.  It works just as good as larger one!!</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use as it is light and small. Great for travel and every day. My favorite hair dryer and I have lots of them laying around unused.</li>
