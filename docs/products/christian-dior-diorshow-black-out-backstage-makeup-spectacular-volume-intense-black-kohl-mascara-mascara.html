            <li>Your lashes are darker, and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Once you understand how to apply it, you&#x27;ll likely be very happy with the way your eyes look.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It makes your eyes feel like they&#x27;re on fire - more so</li>
            <li>Although the price is more than I am accustomed topaying...</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments...</li>
            <li>I love mascara and have tried many brands.  </li>
            <li>Dior has better mascara than this.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara on the market</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I wear it for 14+ hours on most workdays and have no issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond just making my lashes LOOK great, I really feel as though they help my lashes stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many coming out as I used</li>
            <li>one of my top favorite mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>If this is real, it is not as good as what I bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Diorshow original mascara is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Diorshow Black Out Mascara is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m fine with that, because my eyes ROCK.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would give me huge lashes, and this mascara did jut that.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>every penny.the formula glides on smooth and clump free.</li>
            <li>A bit more money but worth it.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase this mascara again, I&#x27;ll stick with the original.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not as good as regular Diorshow.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it IS the blackest color mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara for a more dramatic eye look, great for date night or events where there will be photos taken.</li>
            <li>Perfect for day or night, nothing subtle about it.      </li>
            <li>You have to work with it a tiny bit by definitely applying 2 or 3 coats for the drama but the best part is if you cry or sweat it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>No clumping but adds BOLD volume...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that though this is my favorite mascara so far - totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a different mascara - pretty sure I hit reorder on my Dior Iconic curl, but this came instead.</li>
            <li>DiorShow looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>It has the same curling effect, which is nice.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li>The dramatic effect is priceless.</li>
            <li>I have used the regular DiorShow mascara once, and I liked it, but the results were just not as good as Black Out.</li>
            <li>But they are very light as I&#x27;m a redhead, so they definitely need some help to show</li>
            <li>By far my favorite mascara BY FAR!!</li>
            <li>And I am a very picky mascara user!</li>
            <li>I use it as a second coat on top of my first one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this one a try thinking it would be the same, just blacker or more intense colorwise.</li>
            <li>Just think the Dior mascara black out is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I just don&#x27;t feel like my lashes are as full and long looking with this one.</li>
            <li>Another is that this dries out pretty quickly if you&#x27;re not careful and god help you if you get ANY of this in your eye on accident.</li>
            <li>She has light eyes, hazel green and a light complexion</li>
            <li>This is not the real deal....</li>
            <li>very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real test that was going to a funeral and this mascara did not budge, at all.  </li>
            <li>No clumps and comes off very well.</li>
            <li>I actually really like it - except for the fact that it takes forever to wash off...</li>
            <li>Too much money for a mascara that was garbage.</li>
            <li>It came realy fast also.</li>
            <li>takes 1 makeup wipe and about 2-4 qtips worth of waterproof eye makeup remover just because it is that intense (not due to waterproof issues, it actually comes off quite easily</li>
            <li>Well, not to sound like a baby, but I cried for the first time while wearing this product yesterday (non waterproof version), and there was a bit of run, but it was nothing super messy.</li>
            <li>It is our hands down favorite on the market..    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am lucky in that I have lashes that curl naturally, so I&#x27;ve never had to do the whole curling thing.</li>
            <li>The brush is very large and thick, which is ok for me</li>
            <li>and I look weird (lol) without mascara.</li>
            <li>I swore I would never pay more than a few dollars for mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyes look so bright, young and big with Dior Black Out!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of all time, every time I&#x27;ve tried something different, I am always disappointed and return to my one true love!</li>
            <li>and if you put the 2 coats on you end up with the perfect realistic but still dramatic black colored lashes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Even my aesthetician told me that all mascaras were pretty much the same and not to spend too much money on it if I needed to cut back on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my lashes dried, they looked fine without needing a reapplication.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and thin and doesn&#x27;t really do much for the eyes.</li>
            <li>It boosts my natural lashes and gives my lashes va-va voom.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>It comes on really dark and makes your lashes look so full.</li>
            <li>We keep trying all the new mascaras, and ALWAYS come back to this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is a mascara for women who want MAJOR eyelashes.         </li>
            <li>(I might add, no other mascara has ever done that before).  </li>
            <li>This is the wettest mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s thin and more of a liquid consistency than mascara.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I own a lot of Dior makeup, this is FAKE.</li>
            <li>It is very thick, so at first you have to know that a lot of product comes out when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>Easily could replace the need for false eyelashes if you apply it correctly too.</li>
            <li>And in this day and age where beauty products are at its best I was very disappointed that a name brand such as Dior is making a mascara that doesn&#x27;t stay on the lash.  </li>

            <li> Easily could replace the need for false eyelashes if you apply it correctly too.</li>
            <li> And in this day and age where beauty products are at its best I was very disappointed that a name brand such as Dior is making a mascara that doesn&#x27;t stay on the lash.  </li>
            <li> In fact, one of my only complaints is how &#x27;stay fast&#x27; Black Out mascara is!</li>
            <li> It quickly dries and falls beneath eyes causing irritation and so not a good look.</li>
            <li> than just the usual makeup sting, it&#x27;s really intensely painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes to start, this mascara throughout the day comes off onto my upper eye area where my eyelashes touch.  </li>
            <li> but nothing compares so far to Dior&#x27;s Black out.</li>
            <li> Smoky Lash Mascara, so I was used to the large wand, and thick product application.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, had high hopes not not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look twice as long and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> If you apply additional coats after your lashes are dry it will make them clump together a bit, and start to look flaky.</li>
            <li> It is so creamy, never clumps, never is dry or cracks off.</li>
            <li> I think this product is comparable to Make Up Forever, however it might be a few dollars more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> So black your eyes stand out in a second!</li>
            <li> It completely changes my appearance, giving me long and thick eyelashes that often get commented upon.</li>
            <li> One thing to be careful of is during application.</li>
            <li> You need to apply additional coats while the product is still a bit wet on your lashes.</li>
            <li> If you like thick DRAMA LASHES -- this is your mascara -    My 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li> You can moderate how thick your application is, add an extra layer for night.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and like the black mascarra</li>
            <li> and I both use this mascara - for thick, deep, long lashes.    </li>
            <li> After washing my face and using makeup remover, there is usually a little black left under my eyes that cannot be removed.  </li>
            <li> Apply carefully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a little harder to take off than other mascaras at the end of the day because it holds so well.</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s just not worth the price tag...</li>

            <li> and we both wear BLACK.      </li>
            <li> It is a smoky matte finish, black.  </li>
            <li> After admiring a friend&#x27;s eyelashes, I decided to take the plunge and buy the DiorShow Black Out mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dior DiorShow Black Out for three years now, and will NEVER EVER go to another mascara unless Dior stops making this type.</li>
            <li> I have sweated in this mascara and been in 100+ heat and my Black Out</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes were black by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Some mornings when I wake up there is even still black under my eyelids.</li>
            <li> and they reviewed the Diorshow Black Out Mascara .</li>
            <li> However BLACK OUT Dior makes me eyelashes thick, long and just</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Dior makeup but this is pure crap.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for a few years</li>
            <li> Within a week or so of using it the brush was destroyed and dried up.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for about a week....</li>
            <li> I usually wear Make Up Forever</li>
            <li> I do have a few complaints!</li>
            <li> The first being that the brush on this is horrible and after awhile it starts to guck up and requires constant cleaning.</li>
            <li> Really slick and gets clumpy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and I was so anxious to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Also, as a side note, the combination of this mascara with red lipstick looks ultra dramatic!</li>
            <li> Very Black!</li>
            <li> This sounds like a contradiction, but it&#x27;s also hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes stick together, no separation and hardly any length.</li>
            <li> Lasts for at least 3 months for me, but I&#x27;m a one-application-per-day kinda girl.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look thick and feathery and</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully thick mascara, it takes some effort in applying, but this mascara lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and does not require repeated applications.  </li>
            <li> Very little needed!</li>
            <li> I have used regular Dior mascara, Loreal, Chanel, different Lancome mascaras and this one is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have thin wiry eyelashes, however, so the thickness may be a problem for people with thick eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Every time a drug store brand comes on the market and claims to make your eyes look dramatic</li>
            <li> No clumps but gives a dramatic effect to my lashes.</li>
            <li> it is FAKE ...made in Bance instead of france</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE.</li>
            <li> but it makes it very difficult to put on without smearing it all over your eyelids.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not worth the money, had high hopes not not worth the price tag. Can get this same look with any basic drugstore brand mascara,</li>
            <li> If you like thick DRAMA LASHES -- this is your mascara -    My 18 year old daughter and I both use this mascara - for thick, deep, long lashes.    She has light eyes, hazel green and a light complexion and I have dark brown and we both wear BLACK.      It is a smoky matte finish, black.  Perfect for day or night, nothing subtle about it.      This is a mascara for women who want MAJOR eyelashes.         We keep trying all the new mascaras, and ALWAYS come back to this mascara.  It is our hands down favorite on the market..    It makes the sexiest lashes.</li>
            <li> This is not the real deal....trust me it is FAKE ...made in Bance instead of france and it is not the same product...dont buy this</li>
            <li> This is the wettest mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s thin and more of a liquid consistency than mascara. Although it doesn&#x27;t flake, it does smudge - a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I like this product. I usually wear Make Up Forever Smoky Lash Mascara, so I was used to the large wand, and thick product application. If you aren&#x27;t used to this type of mascara, there is a bit of a learning curve. I think this product is comparable to Make Up Forever, however it might be a few dollars more expensive. You can definitely tell a difference between wearing Dior Blackout versus a drug store brand mascara like Covergirl, or Almay. Your lashes are darker, and more noticeable. When trying to decide if I should purchase this product, I read a few reviews where people were talking about how it stayed on their lashes even when their lashes got wet. Well, not to sound like a baby, but I cried for the first time while wearing this product yesterday (non waterproof version), and there was a bit of run, but it was nothing super messy. When my lashes dried, they looked fine without needing a reapplication. One thing to be careful of is during application. You need to apply additional coats while the product is still a bit wet on your lashes. Otherwise, your lashes will start to look like spider legs. If you apply additional coats after your lashes are dry it will make them clump together a bit, and start to look flaky. I would suggest practicing with this product a few times before you wear it out for real. Sort of like a trial run. Once you understand how to apply it, you&#x27;ll likely be very happy with the way your eyes look. Also, as a side note, the combination of this mascara with red lipstick looks ultra dramatic!</li>
            <li> I compared it to the one I bought at Dillard&#x27;s and it says made in bance, not france. It also does not work. It may as well have been a dollar store mascara</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  After admiring a friend&#x27;s eyelashes, I decided to take the plunge and buy the DiorShow Black Out mascara. This was three years ago, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. I am a teacher, so the pricetag is a bit steep, but I never regret spending the money on this mascara. It completely changes my appearance, giving me long and thick eyelashes that often get commented upon. The dramatic effect is priceless.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara. It makes my lashes look thick and feathery and the back is very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do have a few complaints! The first being that the brush on this is horrible and after awhile it starts to guck up and requires constant cleaning. Another is that this dries out pretty quickly if you&#x27;re not careful and god help you if you get ANY of this in your eye on accident. It makes your eyes feel like they&#x27;re on fire - more so than just the usual makeup sting, it&#x27;s really intensely painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that though this is my favorite mascara so far - totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Diorshow Black Out Mascara is the best I have ever used. I would suggest that anyone looking at this item, give it a try. It is terrific.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara for a more dramatic eye look, great for date night or events where there will be photos taken.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would give me huge lashes, and this mascara did jut that.  I was reluctant at the price, but I have been extremely happy with the results.  The real test that was going to a funeral and this mascara did not budge, at all.  This is a wonderfully thick mascara, it takes some effort in applying, but this mascara lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dior DiorShow Black Out for three years now, and will NEVER EVER go to another mascara unless Dior stops making this type. I have used the regular DiorShow mascara once, and I liked it, but the results were just not as good as Black Out. I have naturally blonde eyelashes (I&#x27;m a redhead) and I look weird (lol) without mascara. DiorShow looks more natural. It&#x27;s very light and thin and doesn&#x27;t really do much for the eyes. However BLACK OUT Dior makes me eyelashes thick, long and just POP out! I am constantly complimented on my mascara (yes! Even after three years!!). My eyes look so bright, young and big with Dior Black Out! And I don&#x27;t know how anyone can say the mascara runs. I have sweated in this mascara and been in 100+ heat and my Black Out has NEVER run. In fact, one of my only complaints is how &#x27;stay fast&#x27; Black Out mascara is! It&#x27;s honestly a little harder to take off than other mascaras at the end of the day because it holds so well. But I&#x27;m fine with that, because my eyes ROCK. Dior is this redhead&#x27;s life saver!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is really nice, but it smudges like crazy. It comes on really dark and makes your lashes look so full. For the price, I would expect something that doesn&#x27;t smudge as bad. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mascara on the planet!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Amplifies and lengthens, darkens and separates. You can moderate how thick your application is, add an extra layer for night. Washes off easily. Fantastic. And I am a very picky mascara user!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara on a whim and and I am so glad I did!!!!  It wears very well,washes off nicely and has longevity!!!!!! Although the price is more than I am accustomed topaying...it is well,well worth it!!!!Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It quickly dries and falls beneath eyes causing irritation and so not a good look.</li>
            <li> Best mascara. Well worth the money. I have been using it now for a few years and since I tried it, never looked back. It is very thick, so at first you have to know that a lot of product comes out when you first start using it. To me, that&#x27;s what makes it good. It stays put all day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST mascara ever!! So black your eyes stand out in a second! I got so many compliments... All women in my family including my Mom and Mom in Law only use this one from now on.</li>
            <li> If this is real, it is not as good as what I bought from Sephora. Really slick and gets clumpy. wish I could have returned.</li>
            <li> I have tried several mascaras and always ending coming back to this one. It really is the best! Makes my lashes look twice as long and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Vavava oomph. Makes you look as if your wearing falsies but your not. Worth every penny.the formula glides on smooth and clump free.</li>
            <li> clumpy and smears with in minutes..i may try another Dior product but will stay away from this mascara..love the color tho</li>
            <li> Just think the Dior mascara black out is amazing and now I have found my choice forever!  No clumps and comes off very well.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  I love mascara and have tried many brands.  Dior has better mascara than this.  I have long eyelashes to start, this mascara throughout the day comes off onto my upper eye area where my eyelashes touch.  (I might add, no other mascara has ever done that before).  This sounds like a contradiction, but it&#x27;s also hard to remove.  After washing my face and using makeup remover, there is usually a little black left under my eyes that cannot be removed.  I won&#x27;t be buying this mascara again.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with Benefit or Clinique mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great and goes on easy.  It&#x27;s thick and does not require repeated applications.  I have thin wiry eyelashes, however, so the thickness may be a problem for people with thick eyelashes.  Might look too goopy.  But me, I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw this recommended by a stylist in a magazine, I&#x27;ve been using it. It boosts my natural lashes and gives my lashes va-va voom.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara on the market</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara. Can&#x27;t live without it. It is so creamy, never clumps, never is dry or cracks off. I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years or so. You have to work with it a tiny bit by definitely applying 2 or 3 coats for the drama but the best part is if you cry or sweat it doesn&#x27;t run. The only way it runs is if you apply water. I take it off with Vaseline though. It&#x27;s like 10 times creamier than store bought mascaras too! It never makes my eyes itch and if you put the 2 coats on you end up with the perfect realistic but still dramatic black colored lashes. Easily could replace the need for false eyelashes if you apply it correctly too. Love it! Every time a drug store brand comes on the market and claims to make your eyes look dramatic I try them just to see but nothing compares so far to Dior&#x27;s Black out. For a daily look apply 1 to 2 coats. For a night look pile it on and it still won&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes were black by the end of the day. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst mascara... I have used regular Dior mascara, Loreal, Chanel, different Lancome mascaras and this one is horrible. It smudges EVERY TIME I use it and it does not even achieve the look it claims it can give you. Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a different mascara - pretty sure I hit reorder on my Dior Iconic curl, but this came instead. I actually really like it - except for the fact that it takes forever to wash off...takes 1 makeup wipe and about 2-4 qtips worth of waterproof eye makeup remover just because it is that intense (not due to waterproof issues, it actually comes off quite easily there is just a lot of product). Some mornings when I wake up there is even still black under my eyelids. Never had this problem with mascara in my life...but not enough of a problem to stop using it lol. Its very smooth and zero clumping or flaking. I wear it for 14+ hours on most workdays and have no issues. Will probably go back to my regular dior curl when this one is finished simply because of the removal process.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and like the black mascarra but I hate clumps. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have tried them all. No clumps but gives a dramatic effect to my lashes. A bit more money but worth it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mascara BY FAR!! I use it as a second coat on top of my first one. No clumping but adds BOLD volume... ladies, this is a must have !!</li>
            <li> I was REALLY excited to receive this product. Diorshow original mascara is my favorite. I decided to give this one a try thinking it would be the same, just blacker or more intense colorwise. I don&#x27;t see any difference in the color. And it&#x27;s not as good as regular Diorshow. It&#x27;s not bad, but I just don&#x27;t feel like my lashes are as full and long looking with this one. It has the same curling effect, which is nice. I was kind of disappointed. I will not purchase this mascara again, I&#x27;ll stick with the original.</li>
            <li> This is the thickest,clumpiest mascara I have ever purchased. Makes my lashes stick together, no separation and hardly any length. The only good thing I can say is that it IS the blackest color mascara I have ever used. But it&#x27;s just not worth the price tag...</li>
            <li> I swore I would never pay more than a few dollars for mascara. Even my aesthetician told me that all mascaras were pretty much the same and not to spend too much money on it if I needed to cut back on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found myself reading a beauty blog and they reviewed the Diorshow Black Out Mascara . I thought what the heck and ordered some. And I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky in that I have lashes that curl naturally, so I&#x27;ve never had to do the whole curling thing. But they are very light as I&#x27;m a redhead, so they definitely need some help to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond just making my lashes LOOK great, I really feel as though they help my lashes stay healthy. I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many coming out as I used to.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Lasts for at least 3 months for me, but I&#x27;m a one-application-per-day kinda girl.</li>
            <li> one of my top favorite mascaras on the market. perfect for going out on the town or night time events</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast! I love this Dior mascara! It has replaced my Lóreal one that I used for YEARS. I am picky with mascara and this one beat the others! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very Black! Very little needed! Apply carefully! Use a separate brush to avoid clumping! This is worth the money if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Dior makeup but this is pure crap. The brush is very large and thick, which is ok for me but it makes it very difficult to put on without smearing it all over your eyelids. Within a week or so of using it the brush was destroyed and dried up. This is a FAKE. Do not buy this. Trust me, I own a lot of Dior makeup, this is FAKE.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time, every time I&#x27;ve tried something different, I am always disappointed and return to my one true love! Dior Blackout!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and I was so anxious to buy it.  I used it everyday for about a week....It looked good on but it smeared and gave me raccoon eyes soon after application....it didn&#x27;t even wait for the morning after!  And in this day and age where beauty products are at its best I was very disappointed that a name brand such as Dior is making a mascara that doesn&#x27;t stay on the lash.  Too much money for a mascara that was garbage.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It came realy fast also. Dior has the best macara. I deffinately would order this again. Love it!</li>
