            <li> okay, nothing special</li>
            <li> My breath still smells somewhat like Big-Foot scat after a meal of six rotting skunk carcases but my gastritis is gone and I can now dance the Cha-Cha!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product does everything as advertised. we keep a box of lozenges at our front and back doors so we never leave the house with bad breath.</li>
            <li> This is not a 100 pack it&#x27;s a 72 count. Great product that works well. The vendor sent me a refund for the difference.</li>
            <li> Love these mints. Individually wrapped for worry free pocketing, and they taste great!</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and have lots of problems with dry mouth. This seems to do the trick for me. I also use their toothpaste which I love. I put them in my purse at all times for when I&#x27;m away. Thank you Dr Katz.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth syndrome no more, due to several medications, this is the mint to keep around at all time. Great favor, and easy to keep in all places. Thank you</li>

            <li> They work for  me at night when the moon is up and my mouth is dry...Never failing...</li>
            <li> These work incredibly well and the taste is not unpleasant. However, a 100 count box of these at Target is only $7.99. Don&#x27;t understand the drastic price difference?</li>
            <li> yes sir and thank you!</li>
            <li> Wife loves them for dry mouth.</li>
