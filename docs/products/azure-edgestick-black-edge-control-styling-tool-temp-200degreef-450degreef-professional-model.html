            <li>The Nouritress Silk Serum is excellent in having a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>Its really good, smoothed out my edges</li>
            <li>Do you know how good quality clothing irons, or waffle irons have some sort of coating on it so that it doesnt stick to the medium being ironed?</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea.</li>
            <li>If this hair heating utensil were good, they wouldn&#x27;t worry about my refund, but no, they do not accept refunds AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>My guests with natural/textured hair loved the results after I used it on them.</li>
            <li>I wish I read the fine print!!</li>

            <li>Gets the job done and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does every thing it says it does very easy to use</li>
            <li>This is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever bought since I went natural.</li>
            <li>By far this is the best product For pressing or strighting your hair just ordered (2) two more for my sisters because they are always trying to steal mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not use any product on the edges at first and it was great.  </li>
            <li>I gladly shelled out 4 20 dollar bills for this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I completely love my edge stick...</li>
            <li>So glad I got it...</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>Love the edgestick.  </li>
            <li>My coworkers love it.</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>They refused to give me a refund, so if you do purchase it, I suppose you have a better chance of refunding it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also buy the product if you don&#x27;t want your hair to grow or if you love breakage.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>it works great with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of color who has transition to a natural hair texture,  this edgestick is great for styling when I&#x27;m adding my hair extensions</li>
            <li>You can get close to the edges burn free.</li>
            <li>Come on ladies, embrace your fabulous hair and if you want it straighter than any chemical process can get it-</li>
            <li>Works really good on natural hair</li>
            <li>After you attend to the edges, a great flat iron will finish the job with the degree of curl you wish without using anything else.</li>
            <li>I give this a 5 star because it works miracles , doesn&#x27;t burn you &amp; way way better than a hot comb.</li>
            <li>I had one before from the original brand, but they discontinued it</li>
            <li>I really love it and it does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I love that the heating element is enclosed in the comb-like outer shell so you can really really close to the hairline.</li>
            <li>I use this on the edges of my leave out and not only does it work but it lasted which was surprising to me.</li>
            <li>This is excellent, it heats fast and cools down quickly</li>
            <li>It is easy to adjust to and heats up quick and hot.  </li>
            <li>For a  lot of people that regularly straighten their hair this is quick, easy and safe way to get the fine edges.</li>
            <li>, I decided to buy the edge stick, I use it weekly once I&#x27;ve flat-ironed my hair &amp; the initial results are nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The edge stick is wonderful for people with natural unprocessed hair and children.</li>
            <li>( yes, I am an African American female) and this product is great to smooth out my edges, it&#x27;s also great to create a sleek up-do.</li>
            <li>So useful to do a touch-up every couple of days or for that special occasion.</li>
            <li>A hot comb that can straighten out my edges but won&#x27;t burn my skin!</li>
            <li>It gets hot but it doesn&#x27;t straighten anything!</li>
            <li>For those familiar with the hair type system, I have 4a/b texture naturally &amp; while most of my hair is is transitioning well &amp; straightens w/o much issue, my edges are another story altogether!</li>
            <li>but my edges do not get real straight during this process.</li>
            <li>It got them so straight and smooth and lasted until I washed my hair again.</li>
            <li>It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>No longer useful.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the money a must have ladies.</li>
            <li>press your hair and use the right medium.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, but malfunctioned from the very start.</li>
            <li>Dudley creme press is the best, protective without the oil slick feel of some of the others, your hair is soft touchable and as straight as you please.</li>
            <li>The first one I broke</li>
            <li>Hot combs were placed in the fire and tested on newspaper to judge \\&quot;readiness\\</li>
            <li>And if you drop it on the floor, you most likely will break the teeth off of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most fabulous thing about Red and Edgestick is that they get hot enough to sizzle the grease</li>
            <li>Perfect for those hard to smooth, heavily textured, baby hairs around the hairline.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m free of chemicals &amp; no longer relaxing my hair, I find the most difficult part of the transition is not having the super smooth edges I had grown accustomed to with relaxing.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it funny how much running from our roots</li>
            <li>I was so ready to fire my hair dresser.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several gel options as well &amp; nothing gets it smooth as it once was</li>
            <li>I like to wear it straight so</li>
            <li>This worked very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this very exited thinking that this it will be the solution for the edge of my hair</li>
            <li>Getting ready to buy another.  </li>
            <li>really feel</li>
            <li>They replaced my product with no problems in a fast and timely manor</li>
            <li>the comb was ready.</li>
            <li>It does not get the edges straight at all.</li>
            <li>It is also nice to carry when you are traveling instead of a regular size flat iron.</li>
            <li>I am African American and love the Edge</li>
            <li>and then you will need a new one.  </li>
            <li>It never got hot and had an error message on the temperature digital screen.</li>
            <li>plus it gets them edges back to being bone straight baby !</li>
            <li>Your hair looks exactly the same</li>
            <li>The supposedly ceramic heating cylinder (possible ceramic) is just a cheap black comb that gets hot.</li>
            <li>That said, be aware, the teeth of the comb can really grab and/or break hair if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>and I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a must&lt;br /&gt;Had to use my old one&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised as to how well it worked.</li>
            <li>are too young and isolated to understand the process of pressing your hair.</li>
            <li>Warning, this product does not work for natural hair at all.  </li>
            <li>OMG for my natural woman.</li>
            <li>but hopefully the cooler temps will take care of that but even still, the smoothness doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like &amp; I use the highest temp of 450 to go over my edges rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little too excited.</li>
            <li>The comb&#x27;s metal has a cheap, poor quality coating, that is unlike any type of hot tool for hair that I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>The only con to this product, if you accidentally drop the EdgeStick you will more than likely break a few of the (teeth) of the comb part.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist, and I saw this being used at a major hair show.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really work the way I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m full on black with regular coarse hair and this product does not deliver.</li>
            <li>&quot; you&#x27;ll get right down to the scalp and no burn!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot and it is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re old enough you know exactly what I mean).  </li>
            <li>Please save yourself $100 and stick to your flat iron or go to a professional.... unless you want to fry your hair but still have it looking like you just washed and slept on it to dry.</li>

            <li> I then used the silk serum and a flat iron to do the rest of the job.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it is just metal with a slap of black paint on it.</li>
            <li> Will not work on naturally kinky black hair.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, I can&#x27;t keep my edges dry when washing my face, sweating, etc.</li>
            <li> I had a little malfunction with my cord and had to send it back:</li>
            <li> edges get a little wet, the edgestick is an instant fix!</li>
            <li> Washing my face gets my edges a lil wet</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> well spent</li>
            <li> Not much but 5 pumps and ran it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I did run it through to the end but not much because you will get it snagged.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need all those curling pastes and foams which will actually damage your hair in part because of the alcohols and other harsh chemicals like formaldehyde used in the Brazilian method, in part because your hair is now wet</li>
            <li> Not worth the price under these conditions.</li>
            <li> and we all know you don&#x27;t press wet hair!!  </li>
            <li> If you have slightly kinky hair, maybe otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I wish I had heard about this when my daughters were little  </li>
            <li> In my opinion don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> like I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Moving on, when I actually tried to comb it on my 4b hair the results were so bad, it was like using a regular comb.</li>
            <li> I then put a small amount of Barry Fletchers pressing carrot oil wax on my hair to finish the job.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s falling apart and now not turning on.  Not worth the price under these conditions.</li>
            <li> Keep your money in your pocket.  I thought this product was heaven sent. A hot comb that can straighten out my edges but won&#x27;t burn my skin! I gladly shelled out 4 20 dollar bills for this.  I was so ready to fire my hair dresser.   I am african american with NAPPY edges.  This thing did NOTHING for my naps.  It burned my hair and left it nappy, now how can that be? The horrid burnt hair smell awaited me everytime I plugged in  the dumb thing.  If you have slightly kinky hair, maybe otherwise don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m free of chemicals &amp; no longer relaxing my hair, I find the most difficult part of the transition is not having the super smooth edges I had grown accustomed to with relaxing. For those familiar with the hair type system, I have 4a/b texture naturally &amp; while most of my hair is is transitioning well &amp; straightens w/o much issue, my edges are another story altogether! Washing my face gets my edges a lil wet no matter how hard I try to keep them covered so after reading a review, I decided to buy the edge stick, I use it weekly once I&#x27;ve flat-ironed my hair &amp; the initial results are nice &amp; smooth. There&#x27;s some reversion with the humidity but hopefully the cooler temps will take care of that but even still, the smoothness doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like &amp; I use the highest temp of 450 to go over my edges rather quickly. I&#x27;ve tried several gel options as well &amp; nothing gets it smooth as it once was so I continue to experiment tho I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This works just says. I am also African American and I have natural hair. I like to wear it straight so blow it out and flat iron but my edges do not get real straight during this process. This edge stick solved that problem! It got them so straight and smooth and lasted until I washed my hair again. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love that the heating element is enclosed in the comb-like outer shell so you can really really close to the hairline. That said, be aware, the teeth of the comb can really grab and/or break hair if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, I can&#x27;t keep my edges dry when washing my face, sweating, etc. Even though my 4a/4b hair is relaxed, the edges are unruly at best. After washing &amp; blow drying, I put some KeraCare Creme Press on my edges and used the EdgeStick set at 430. Closest I&#x27;ve ever come at home to the \\&quot;just stepped out of the salon\\&quot; edges! The comb teeth may pull your hair a bit, so you do have to take your time &amp; not just rake it through.  It was worth it for me. YMMV.</li>
            <li> Great while it lasted.  I did not use it a lot. Maybe once a month.  The panel where the buttons popped off. No longer useful.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is my second Edge Stick. The first one I broke and I felt my world was coming to an end. The edge stick is wonderful for people with natural unprocessed hair and children. You can get close to the edges burn free. I love this product</li>
            <li> I use this on the edges of my leave out and not only does it work but it lasted which was surprising to me. I thought I would have to use something like this every couple of days but that was not the case. I would  definitely recommend this to any one</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, but malfunctioned from the very start. It never got hot and had an error message on the temperature digital screen.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!! I completely love my edge stick...it works great with natural hair. My hair actually looks like I just got it pressed out. Don&#x27;t want to kill my edges so I&#x27;ll probably just use it once a month. So glad I got it...worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It broke after a month&lt;br /&gt;Was not happy about it&lt;br /&gt;Hairstylist and it&#x27;s a must&lt;br /&gt;Had to use my old one&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had a chance to order another</li>
            <li> This worked very well. I was actually surprised as to how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star because it works miracles , doesn&#x27;t burn you &amp; way way better than a hot comb. plus it gets them edges back to being bone straight baby ! I&#x27;m a little too excited. BUY BUY BUY IT if you sick of burning yourself from flat irons.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I had one before from the original brand, but they discontinued it so I thought I would give this one a try.. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot and it is a waste of money.  I would say don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist. Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have natural unprocessed hair ( yes, I am an African American female) and this product is great to smooth out my edges, it&#x27;s also great to create a sleek up-do. The only con to this product, if you accidentally drop the EdgeStick you will more than likely break a few of the (teeth) of the comb part. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for edges. But will last you about 2 years and then you will need a new one.  This is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever bought since I went natural. I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this very exited thinking that this it will be the solution for the edge of my hair and it wasn&#x27;t like that, too expensive for don&#x27;t do nothing In my opinion don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love the edgestick.  Getting ready to buy another.  My coworkers love it. Need a backup because they want for me to share mine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really work the way I expected really feel like I wasted my money</li>
            <li> For a  lot of people that regularly straighten their hair this is quick, easy and safe way to get the fine edges. I wish I had heard about this when my daughters were little  I NEVER would have put a perm in their hair! This is excellent, it heats fast and cools down quickly you can lay it as close to the skin as you can and it straightens the roots beautifully! I am so grateful that my beautician told me about this for instant touch-ups in-between seeing her!</li>
            <li> I purchased this edge stick it worked well and did what it was described to do I had a little malfunction with my cord and had to send it back:( but with there wonderful customer service and there prompt replies to my emails just gave me that assurance that not only was this a great buy but it was money well spent it&#x27;s great to spend where the company will do there best to make sure the customers are happy!! They replaced my product with no problems in a fast and timely manor it&#x27;s hard to find service like this&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> I received the wrong order this item was not the one that I received . The item was returned.dont want a replacement</li>
            <li> I used the EdgeStick for the first time this past Saturday and am amazed at the outcome of my hair.  I did not use any product on the edges at first and it was great.  I then put a small amount of Barry Fletchers pressing carrot oil wax on my hair to finish the job. Once I completed the job on the root of my hair I then used the silk serum and a flat iron to do the rest of the job.  The Nouritress Silk Serum is excellent in having a smooth finish.  I did put the silk serum on my roots as well.  Not much but 5 pumps and ran it through my hair.  I am African American and love the Edge Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember this item is designed to be used on the root of your hair only.  I did run it through to the end but not much because you will get it snagged.</li>
            <li> The reviews I have read for this and similar edge straighteners prove that we have either forgotten our history or the buyers are too young and isolated to understand the process of pressing your hair. Hot combs were placed in the fire and tested on newspaper to judge \\&quot;readiness\\&quot;  If the paper burned you blew on the comb and waited a minute.  If the paper turned brown and the curl crimped the paper the comb was ready. And you NEVER pressed hair without pressing cream/oil. The Hair Rep and Madame Walker and Dax etc kept your hair from burning and straightened even the coarsest \\&quot;naps\\&quot; .  To have a nappy kitchen used to be the supreme embarrassment all your friends would point out to you. Comediennes used to comment that so-and so needed to have Madame walk around them edges.&lt;br /&gt;The most fabulous thing about Red and Edgestick is that they get hot enough to sizzle the grease (yeah I said grease and if you&#x27;re old enough you know exactly what I mean).  That is where the expression for well coiffed hair \\&quot;fried and dyed and laid to the side\\&quot; came from.  Come on ladies, embrace your fabulous hair and if you want it straighter than any chemical process can get it- press your hair and use the right medium. With the Red 1/2\\&quot; you&#x27;ll get right down to the scalp and no burn! IMHO  Dudley creme press is the best, protective without the oil slick feel of some of the others, your hair is soft touchable and as straight as you please. After you attend to the edges, a great flat iron will finish the job with the degree of curl you wish without using anything else. You don&#x27;t need all those curling pastes and foams which will actually damage your hair in part because of the alcohols and other harsh chemicals like formaldehyde used in the Brazilian method, in part because your hair is now wet and we all know you don&#x27;t press wet hair!!  Isn&#x27;t it funny how much running from our roots (generational) can ruin our roots (and the rest of your hair too)?</li>
            <li> Its really good, smoothed out my edges</li>
            <li> So useful to do a touch-up every couple of days or for that special occasion. Also, when I take a shower and my&lt;br /&gt; edges get a little wet, the edgestick is an instant fix! I am really glad that I bought it. It is also nice to carry when you are traveling instead of a regular size flat iron.</li>
            <li> Warning, this product does not work for natural hair at all.  It&#x27;s so terrible that I had to write a review, even though I bought it from the company&#x27;s website. They refused to give me a refund, so if you do purchase it, I suppose you have a better chance of refunding it through Amazon. The comb&#x27;s metal has a cheap, poor quality coating, that is unlike any type of hot tool for hair that I&#x27;ve bought.  Do you know how good quality clothing irons, or waffle irons have some sort of coating on it so that it doesnt stick to the medium being ironed? Well this company seems to have skipped that step. They claim to have ceramic coating on it, but this ain&#x27;t it. Moving on, when I actually tried to comb it on my 4b hair the results were so bad, it was like using a regular comb. I should have  took the advice from the other reviewer who gave it a poor review. When I attempted to get a refund via email, the rep said to turn the heat up to the highest level of 450 degrees. But from the degree of heat that it was and how my hair was smoking when I used it, I didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea. I feel like hair is like an extension of your body, and if you&#x27;re skin can&#x27;t handle even 200 degrees, why would I fry my hair? Plus I have had irons that straightened my hair that wasn&#x27;t 450 degrees. When I have turned it up all the way, I had heat damage. Please save yourself $100 and stick to your flat iron or go to a professional.... unless you want to fry your hair but still have it looking like you just washed and slept on it to dry. Also buy the product if you don&#x27;t want your hair to grow or if you love breakage. But if that doesn&#x27;t apply to you, then just DON&#x27;T!!! This company is pocketing all their profits and creating a VERY POOR QUALITY comb. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it is just metal with a slap of black paint on it. If this hair heating utensil were good, they wouldn&#x27;t worry about my refund, but no, they do not accept refunds AT ALL.  I wish I read the fine print!! Again do not buy, I cannot stress this enough!!!</li>
            <li> This styling tool is a very good replacement to your straightening comb in doing the edges of your hair.  It is easy to adjust to and heats up quick and hot.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I really love it and it does exactly what it says.  Perfect for blending hair.  I only wish the temperature would save after use instead of reseting when its turned on.</li>
            <li> OMG for my natural woman. This is a must have. I love this got in close smoothed out the hair like the video says. Worth the money a must have ladies.</li>
            <li> By far this is the best product For pressing or strighting your hair just ordered (2) two more for my sisters because they are always trying to steal mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does every thing it says it does very easy to use</li>
            <li> It does not get the edges straight at all. I&#x27;m full on black with regular coarse hair and this product does not deliver. Save your money ladies because the edge stick just doesn&#x27;t cut it. It gets hot but it doesn&#x27;t straighten anything! Your hair looks exactly the same and I tried every heat setting on this thing. The supposedly ceramic heating cylinder (possible ceramic) is just a cheap black comb that gets hot. And if you drop it on the floor, you most likely will break the teeth off of it. This product is geared toward women with chemically treated hair or Caucasian type hair. Will not work on naturally kinky black hair. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color who has transition to a natural hair texture,  this edgestick is great for styling when I&#x27;m adding my hair extensions</li>
            <li> Works really good on natural hair</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist, and I saw this being used at a major hair show. I bought it immediately. Perfect for those hard to smooth, heavily textured, baby hairs around the hairline. My guests with natural/textured hair loved the results after I used it on them.</li>
