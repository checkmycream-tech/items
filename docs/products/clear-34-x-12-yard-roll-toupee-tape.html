            <li>Good price and just the right size I wanted</li>

            <li>You need perfect eyesight razor sharp finger nails  </li>
            <li>FOR SOME REASON IT ABSORBS SWEAT EASILY &amp; WILL LIFT.  </li>
            <li>works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The ordering was easy and the product is fine.  </li>
            <li>I am a wig maker and i would recommend this tape for anyone look for a more secure yet comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a burlesque dancer, this is THE most economical way to get pastie tape</li>
            <li>Purchased this to secure insoles added to my shoes.  </li>
            <li>Great way to keep my blouse front closed!</li>
            <li>Works well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sticky</li>
            <li>BUT, this tape works great for mounting hidden microphones (with Rode Invisilav silicone mounts).</li>
            <li>It sticks to the surface very well, yet the protective tape is easily removed</li>
            <li>The fact that we use oil (light) on our hair, the tape loosen up to fast.</li>
            <li>This tape works as advertised and would buy more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;So far after almost 3 weeks it still holding.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased thus far with the quality and ease of use of this tape.  </li>
            <li>Used the tape on the back of pasties recently with great success!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right width, and I can cut the length to any size I want.</li>
            <li>Exactly the right size</li>
            <li>but I make sure my head is clean and dry before I put on the piece</li>
            <li>It is clear strong and discrete.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>skin with alcohol first for adherring power.</li>
            <li>Which in this case is theater; dinner theater to be exact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the tape would hold enough to finish the show even after peeling off the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>Fine for daily use, a nightmare for party animals and lip syncing contests.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as bra tape and it works really well.</li>
            <li>so my bra stays covered the whole day</li>
            <li>Super stick to the skin, but not so much plastic pieces such as the R0DE mic invisiLav plastic attachments.</li>
            <li>Now I know better and wipe the skin down well before adhering the clothes / accessories.  </li>
            <li>It sticks just okay on African American curly textured hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t wipe down the skin with alcohol, and it was a hot day, so the sweat ate through the adhesive immediately.  </li>
            <li>My son is sensitive to adhesives.</li>
            <li>Sticky enough to last a few days, this is a quality product that will treat your favorite &amp;#34;puppy&amp;#34; like royalty.</li>
            <li>I expected the tape to have a little more adhesive.  </li>
            <li>When taking it out (since it was taped to my skin), do it slowly and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well for keeping clothing and small woodland creatures in their place for other scenarios too.</li>
            <li>I have a pair of thigh high socks and it keeps slipping.</li>

            <li> I have a pair of thigh high socks and it keeps slipping.</li>
            <li> I play a dual role in which the first character wears a bad rug (which I also got here on Amazon.com) and the second character is follicle challenged (my natural state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a tape that would hold the piece in place but still be easily removed at the proper time without needing solvents or other time consuming cleanup.</li>
            <li> This is such a big roll of tape it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> super sticky but a little hard to peel back.</li>
            <li> Then I get about 1/4 inch of the backing paper started and fold it back tightly leaving the tab for me to grab later and put the toupee back in it&#x27;s storage pack.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a tad bit stickier, but it gets the job done as long as you don&#x27;t jog, are a drag queen doing shows, whipping your hair back and forth, etc.</li>
            <li> It works, but other brands that come in short strips are easier to work with.</li>
            <li> this is nothing like I expected it to be, it start loosing up just after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> This tape prevented my thigh highs from slipping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tape for those who wear behind the ear hearing aids.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore than other tape being peeled off skin.</li>
            <li> This keeps them attached without irritating her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would tear the paper slightly, which would stretch but not break the plastic tape.  </li>
            <li> less residue</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone whose hearing aids have a tendancy to fall half way out at times.</li>
            <li> We shot in the sun in 90* heat for about a half hour with no problems.</li>
            <li> Held my wig tight all night.</li>
            <li> and it has held tight every time so</li>
            <li> just a little patience is all it takes to get a corner of it started after which the rest peels off with ease.</li>
            <li> After a few times you learn the trick.</li>
            <li> I put a strip on the processor only and then stick it to the skin behind her ear.  </li>
            <li> I use small pieces of this to keep his over-the-ear hearing aids in place on him.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove the backing paper.  </li>
            <li> Extremely poor adhesion.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed based on the reviews I had read.  </li>
            <li> and nobody can tell I&#x27;m a bald fake and a liar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removing the backing paper is a touch difficult</li>

            <li> The only bad thing is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove the backing paper.  I would tear the paper slightly, which would stretch but not break the plastic tape.  The amount is generous as well.</li>
            <li> super sticky but a little hard to peel back. After a few times you learn the trick. Held my wig tight all night.</li>

            <li> good price and good product</li>
            <li> I use this to adhere my daughter&#x27;s cochlear implant processors to her head.  I put a strip on the processor only and then stick it to the skin behind her ear.  She is a head sweater and the tape will last all day at school, recess, and P.E. and into the night.</li>
            <li> Great tape and arrived on time!  Thanks!</li>

            <li> This was a reorder of a product that has always been great. I plan to keep on ordering as often as needed.</li>
            <li> This tape is great for securing object (cochlear device) to the scalp. Regular double sided tape didn&#x27;t do the job</li>

            <li> We are using this instead of fashion tape because my skin gets irritated by fashion tape. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, fashion tape is used to tape clothes to skin for fashion purposes or to prevent nip slips. Works great, no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it seems like it will work.&lt;br /&gt;  Jg</li>

            <li> Our baby has hearing loss, and keeping her aids in is a struggle. This keeps them attached without irritating her sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this tape for those who wear behind the ear hearing aids. This tape will hold them without having to worry about losing them.&lt;br /&gt;Ebb62</li>
            <li> Didnt stick well at all on me -__-</li>
            <li> I have a pair of thigh high socks and it keeps slipping. This tape prevented my thigh highs from slipping. I wore it all day and there&#x27;s no problems. When taking it out (since it was taped to my skin), do it slowly and you will be fine. This tape is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about toupee tape because it sounded like a more expensive version of fashion tape, but it works WAY better than fashion tape and is a lot stickier, too. It&#x27;s great for holding on wigs or for momentarily sticking something to your face if you&#x27;re in a rush. I&#x27;m a costumer and a performer, so this tape is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I had a project I was doing at work that I needed this for and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> awesome, exactly what I needed and plenty of it!</li>
            <li> Great holds my wig in place</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as bra tape and it works really well. It&#x27;s super sticky so my bra stays covered the whole day and I don&#x27;t have to pay a fortune for it like most bra tapes. I&#x27;m sure it also works great for toupee&#x27;s as well, but can&#x27;t confirm that.</li>
            <li> This is such a big roll of tape it will last me a long time.  It&#x27;s just the right width, and I can cut the length to any size I want.</li>
            <li> Good adhesive strength. Plenty of tape on each roll.</li>
            <li> Sticks perfectly, does not tear my skin off. Exactly the right size and nobody can tell I&#x27;m a bald fake and a liar.</li>
            <li> works great fast delivery</li>
            <li> This works so well with my hearing aids. I am so happy. Great product. I would recommend this for anyone whose hearing aids have a tendancy to fall half way out at times. This takes care of this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this tape to adhere costumes to skin.  The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t wipe down the skin with alcohol, and it was a hot day, so the sweat ate through the adhesive immediately.  Now I know better and wipe the skin down well before adhering the clothes / accessories.  Used the tape on the back of pasties recently with great success!  We shot in the sun in 90* heat for about a half hour with no problems. I will buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> Which in this case is theater; dinner theater to be exact. I play a dual role in which the first character wears a bad rug (which I also got here on Amazon.com) and the second character is follicle challenged (my natural state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a tape that would hold the piece in place but still be easily removed at the proper time without needing solvents or other time consuming cleanup. Enter 3M toupee Tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to perspire but I make sure my head is clean and dry before I put on the piece and it has held tight every time so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to but if I did need to put the critter back on my head I&#x27;m sure the tape would hold enough to finish the show even after peeling off the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the backing paper is a touch difficult but that&#x27;s necessary to keep it in place and just a little patience is all it takes to get a corner of it started after which the rest peels off with ease. Before I leave my house I put a four inch piece of tape on the wig and make sure it&#x27;s secure. Then I get about 1/4 inch of the backing paper started and fold it back tightly leaving the tab for me to grab later and put the toupee back in it&#x27;s storage pack. When I get to the show all I have to do is &amp;#34;peel~n~stick&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Okay, okay.... I am not bald. BUT, this tape works great for mounting hidden microphones (with Rode Invisilav silicone mounts). I&#x27;m sure it works well for keeping clothing and small woodland creatures in their place for other scenarios too.</li>
            <li> The tape works perfectly and is priced reasonably.  Excellent value for the money.  I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The ordering was easy and the product is fine.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this on dresses to keep my top from spilling out. The tape holds everything in place and is a great deal because it comes with so much.</li>
            <li> FOR SOME REASON IT ABSORBS SWEAT EASILY &amp; WILL LIFT.  BETTER THAN MOST</li>
            <li> not as tackie as I thought it would be it works not like I hope it would I would like it to be more tackie</li>
            <li> I have had great experience with the brand Vapon and this is an excellent price. I intend to re-order soon. Your service and products are great .</li>
            <li> Super stick to the skin, but not so much plastic pieces such as the R0DE mic invisiLav plastic attachments.</li>
            <li> I am a wig maker and i would recommend this tape for anyone look for a more secure yet comfortable fit.  This tape is perfect! It is clear strong and discrete. My client loves it</li>
            <li> Best thing we have in our production kit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick to anything!!! And not returnable!!!</li>
            <li> bought this to attach my son&#x27;s hearing aids.  works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works as I hoped--to enable multiple uses of nasal strips</li>
            <li> Good price and just the right size I wanted</li>
