            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product any more if I tried.</li>

            <li>Love it, love it, love it.....makes skin silky smooth....excellent item</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Clinique product is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly by day two my skin was noticeably improved and by a week it was like I had a new face!</li>
            <li>I loved an older Clinque Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect little size for travel.</li>
            <li>but I would like the package travel as light as plastic</li>
            <li>These jars are such a great value.</li>
            <li>I love it, is very moisturizing, easy to carry</li>
            <li>Product came unsealed, not in original package as in the photo.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a great product for winter weather or severely dry skin!</li>
            <li>Not as good as regular moisture  surge.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>There is only one con (the price) and many, many pros to this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and soaks into your skin fast and make-up goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>(I have noticeable laugh lines that I need to keep in check).</li>
            <li>These are really worth the price</li>
            <li>I have tried many many many moisturizers and tired of looking I went to macy&#x27;s and asked for a super mosturizer and they recommended this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very intense moisture but not for problem skin</li>
            <li>Good way to try this for a few months.</li>
            <li>Tends to cause breakouts on sensitive skin, like the feel of the old moisture surge better .</li>
            <li>My new favorite facial cream.  </li>
            <li>I had a little trial sample of this from a magazine, and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this for not breaking me out and really moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>Really reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This makes it glide onto the skin and soak in much quicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep one packed in my bag so ready to go when I need to have it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 51, &amp; this product really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying a full size.</li>
            <li>Strange, but it is clearly written on the little jar that it is a free sample and NOT supposed to be sold...!!!</li>
            <li>After a few seconds the moisture content to the skin does feel better.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This burned my face and made it red after the first application.</li>
            <li>Hydrates your skin well, didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and I like</li>
            <li>People with allergies or who are sensitive to scents will not be bothered by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 6 jars which all arrived in a timely, usually early, manner.  </li>
            <li>my skin is soft also I think it is helping to keep the lines away.</li>
            <li>although it does moisturize to an extent, there&#x27;s nothing special about this cream in terms of deep moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li>I used to buy loreal active daily moisture lotion for all skin types  for summer and works fine, I&#x27;ve been using that one for the longest time ever, but for winter I had to apply it up to 3 times sometimes, and no is not because I don&#x27;t drink water,believe me</li>
            <li>Otherwise, St. Ives moisturizer and Olay will do the trick, which is way less then this full size bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal not dry</li>
            <li>your skin is very dry, exfoliate first with a scrub (I like St. Ives Apricot Scrub) and then use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have eczema, my skin is dry and super dry in the winter, is sensitive and &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was desperate one night searching the internet and found some good reviews on this Clinique product.</li>
            <li>but it does have a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; feel to it at first.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, the money, and very dry skin, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY dry in the winter, and a tiny bit of this completely refreshes my skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It smells like rotten medical detergent, it has a horrible texture and although it does moisturize to an extent, there&#x27;s nothing special about this cream in terms of deep moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li> Really like this moisturizer. Hydrates your skin well, didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and I like that it&#x27;s unscented! I will definitely be buying a full size.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my sis and she used it up</li>
            <li> Product came unsealed, not in original package as in the photo. It is not to be sold separately and I leave the picts for judgement.</li>
            <li> I have used Cliniques Moisture Surge for years, and love it.  This travel-sized jar I just received seems to be a knock-off...&lt;br /&gt;Not Clinique.  It smells very strongly of alcohol or some chemical, and burns my skin. The color is also wrong. It is white...should be pink.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good moisturizer ever since I became pregnant. My oily skin suddenly dried up like a desert and I could not find anything to quench it. My skin broke out from over-dryness, as well as flaked constantly. I would seriously cry putting on my foundation because nothing could hide all my skin issues. Like pregnancy isn&#x27;t hard enough right? I was desperate one night searching the internet and found some good reviews on this Clinique product. I ordered a small trial size for $10 first, figuring it would be the same as all the others. Surprisingly by day two my skin was noticeably improved and by a week it was like I had a new face! I ordered the larger size and have been using it daily for over two months now and I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s not greasy, and soaks into your skin fast and make-up goes on smooth. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product any more if I tried. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used, and believe me, I&#x27;ve used a lot.</li>
            <li> good stuff - packaging and price great!</li>
            <li> I had a little trial sample of this from a magazine, and really liked it.  I tend to have several spots of very dry skin and I apply just the tiniest little bit of this cream every night.  It is really helping, and this little jar will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, amazing moisture.  Even over makeup!!</li>
            <li> This burned my face and made it red after the first application. I have very sensitive skin so I may be in a minority.</li>
            <li> What can I say, Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing products are the best I&#x27;ve used and this stuff is no different. It definitely works!</li>
            <li> I really like this as a moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and I used to use Olay 7 Total Effects which I found broke me out so I wanted to try something else. However, I don&#x27;t think this fixes wrinkles the way Olay did. So I started interspersing this with my Olay to limit break out but tackle wrinkles. A little goes a long way but the travel size will probably last 4-5 months if you use it about 4-6 times a week. I really like this for not breaking me out and really moisturizing my skin. However, as a student, I find this expensive with limited results in terms of wrinkles (I have noticeable laugh lines that I need to keep in check). If you have sensitive skin, the money, and very dry skin, I would recommend it. Otherwise, St. Ives moisturizer and Olay will do the trick, which is way less then this full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Really reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love it, is very moisturizing, easy to carry but I would like the package travel as light as plastic was more good quality</li>
            <li> My new favorite facial cream.  I love the fact that my skin looks healthier, and replenished.  Would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I heard this product was good for ageing but it was so sticky and felt like paste on my face.  Felt greasy.  I have used the brand before but this product was not good.</li>
            <li> I like the coolness of the product on my skin but it does have a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; feel to it at first.  After a few seconds the moisture content to the skin does feel better.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought it would be.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> After hesitating for years due to price, I finally caved and bought this from Amazon rather than Sephora. I am so glad I did. There is only one con (the price) and many, many pros to this product. Below I will explain the best parts of this product and how to best use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a gel, not a cream or lotion. This makes it glide onto the skin and soak in much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;-It is not greasy. It moisturizes my face without leaving it greasy, shiny, or feeling dirty (I have normal - slightly dry skin). My skin is VERY dry in the winter, and a tiny bit of this completely refreshes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have a scent. People with allergies or who are sensitive to scents will not be bothered by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-If your skin is very dry, exfoliate first with a scrub (I like St. Ives Apricot Scrub) and then use this.&lt;br /&gt;-If your skin is irritated or burnt, put this in the fridge for an hour or two before - it will soothe while it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY BUY THIS PRODUCT, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> These are the perfect little size for travel. I keep one packed in my bag so ready to go when I need to have it.&lt;br /&gt;The Clinique product is wonderful for dry skin. I use at home also.</li>
            <li> excellent I am very satisfied God bless you</li>
            <li> Strange, but it is clearly written on the little jar that it is a free sample and NOT supposed to be sold...!!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as regular moisture  surge. Tends to cause breakouts on sensitive skin, like the feel of the old moisture surge better .</li>
            <li> These jars are such a great value. I&#x27;ve bought 6 jars which all arrived in a timely, usually early, manner.  I am 51, &amp; this product really moisturizes my skin. I can definitely see and feel the difference.  These are really worth the price</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I only gave it one star because it has caffeine in it, which may like me keep you awake at night.</li>
            <li> Got sunburn , and used this to stop the peeling!</li>
            <li> Good way to try this for a few months. When I can i will buy this and CC Cream in larger oz size. Neither product irritates my skin or my eyes and that&#x27;s a big factor for me.</li>
            <li> I already knew this worked for my skin when I bought it.  I love how lightweight it is and it&#x27;s just a great product for winter weather or severely dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have eczema, my skin is dry and super dry in the winter, is sensitive and &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34;. I have tried many many many moisturizers and tired of looking I went to macy&#x27;s and asked for a super mosturizer and they recommended this one.&lt;br /&gt;I was running out and one day out of curiosity looked here in amazon and found it in this size, so I bought several.&lt;br /&gt;I have a cursed skin that don&#x27;t like anything, if I put something on it it gets red, if I don&#x27;t it does too grrrrr... so this one was the winner, don&#x27;t need to put a lot, otherwise It irritates the skin( and just apply once a day and before going to bed) . I used to buy loreal active daily moisture lotion for all skin types  for summer and works fine, I&#x27;ve been using that one for the longest time ever, but for winter I had to apply it up to 3 times sometimes, and no is not because I don&#x27;t drink water,believe me I do, so I finally found the holy grail of the moisturizers at a price I can afford.</li>
            <li> was what I expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams this is my favorite.  I use Peter Thomas Roth serum and then clinique moisture surge.  My skin is normal not dry so it takes a while for the moisture surge to sink in, also I only use it at night.  It takes just a little (lasts longer) my skin is soft also I think it is helping to keep the lines away. I also believe you must exfoliate every day, and every product works differently on everyone, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few moisturizers and this one works for me.</li>
            <li> I loved an older Clinque Moisturizer. I still miss it, but this one comes close to the one I used to use.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.....makes skin silky smooth....excellent item</li>
            <li> Very intense moisture but not for problem skin</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and this products wonders for thirsty, irritated skin.  The price is also unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol and my skin is still dry. Ithink this product is not for sale or this is like a sample.</li>
