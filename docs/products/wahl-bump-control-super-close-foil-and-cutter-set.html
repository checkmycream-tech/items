            <li>Perfect fit for the Wahl super close shaver!</li>
            <li>Great smooth and close shave on my head.</li>

            <li>nevermind, just incase I want to develop a better version of this type of product.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>Got to love these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now if Wahl only sold replacement batteries for their shavers, that would be awesome</li>
            <li>I have had the shaver for 5 years or more</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>have been thoroughly pleased with product and plan on recontacting vender for additional transactions.  </li>
            <li>Wahl always has top of the line products.  </li>
            <li>He likes the fact that it is corded, but, most importantly, is pleased with the smoothness and closeness of the shave -- much better than the Remington equivalent that he tried before this one...</li>
            <li>wahl is one of the top shavers for your money.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement, good price.</li>
            <li>Easy snap in replacement parts for a great razor that can be used on your head as well as face for very close, smooth shave</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment and great service.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling smooth and look very clean.</li>
            <li>It gives a noticeably better shave than the original.</li>
            <li>Seller followed up my email and was easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>it is as good as new the price is cheaper than any where ive found even barber supply places.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li>Love my Wahl shaver with it&#x27;s dynaflex custom shave and super close foil.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot here in miami and a good shave is important.  </li>
            <li>seems like a cheap foil</li>
            <li>The Wahl Bump Free Foil &amp; Cutter cuts the hairs that are missed by the Wahl Trimmer</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;BUMP FREE</li>
            <li>fit and cuts well..</li>
            <li>I thought this cutter was to fit the Wahl 7367-200 &amp; it does not.  </li>
            <li>supper close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Everything snapped on perfectly, fit like a glove, and worked like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for those of us who would bump up like no tomorrow with a regular straight razor.</li>
            <li>These are the original replacement parts; feel free to order with confidence.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good to shave your face, the cut isn&#x27;t very close.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The original lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li>the device doesn&#x27;t even match the color of the original, however i&#x27;ve not found that to be a problem.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace the original on the razor after 1.5 years.</li>
            <li>This product replaces the well-worn original.</li>
            <li>Shaves a lot closer than the original head and cutter.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives an outstanding close shave and clearly without bumps, which is very important for me.</li>
            <li>Full Site&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The foils wear out quickly and are overpriced for cheesey piece that it is.</li>
            <li>The quality of this foil is much better and a new block couldn&#x27;t hert.  </li>
            <li>Works great just thought it would be black.</li>
            <li>You can pay a lot more, a whole lot more, but you will not get a better shave with any other brand of razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order more of these again as they work on my shaver just fine.</li>
            <li>i need to order another one now shaves very close and comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth 10 stars in my book.</li>
            <li>In search of the &amp;#34;perfect shave,&amp;#34; I have tried every brand of electric razor on the market and the only one better, perhaps, than the Wahl is the Ronson which has not been available in the U.S. for years.</li>
            <li>The price was right also.</li>
            <li>Apparently I need to type three more words</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>but it matches up with it exactly.</li>
            <li>fast  shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and what I searched for.</li>
            <li>Why wasn&#x27;t I made aware of this before</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it was exactly what i needed and did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>A good product would highly recommend to shaver that bump up easy,but  I thought I was getting a black in color</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and so far no problems.</li>
            <li>Based on performance I&#x27;d certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Great for any black male that can&#x27;t use a razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, item as described,</li>
            <li>Correct item, delivered fast.</li>
            <li>It gets really close and was recommended by a friend of our who is a barber.</li>
            <li>Its actually bump free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better suited for personal use not for professional use.</li>
            <li>Installed new razor head (&amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34;) and foil in under two minutes from opening the Amazon box to tossing out the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with it, however, it could be tweaked a bit to allow the little brush that comes with it ,,,,...</li>
            <li>didnt cut well even right out of the package thought maybe it was just my razor but went back to my procter</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Now my shaver is just like new.</li>
            <li>Works like new</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and was new as they said it would be.</li>
            <li>shaver and blade but the foil on the blade can be very sensitive and crake or break.</li>
            <li>Worked  and fitted like the original and was sharp too.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought it was gonna match the color of my Bump Free Shaver, which is black.</li>
            <li>I purchased this little contraption, and now I think it is worthy of my high praise.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother who is working at beauty Salon, she says it&#x27;s miracle, it works like a magic, she has been using it for years and none of clients ever complained.</li>
            <li>Needed the foil guard because there was a tear in my old on.</li>
            <li>WAHL Professional 5 Star Series Replacement Foil and Cutter Bar Assembly (Model:7031-100)&lt;br /&gt;CBS</li>
            <li>Professional 5</li>
            <li>like the foil &amp; cutter because so far it has lived up to its title</li>
            <li>Now it costs too much for freight to ship back.</li>
            <li>Good product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>I am not able to use the shaver daily, however I can use it 3 or more times per week.</li>
            <li>Once the foil is punctured the top piece is no good.</li>
            <li>What a big difference these new parts made.</li>
            <li>It brought my shave back to new condition and a non pulling close shave again.</li>
            <li>but when you get a new razor,they always fell different</li>
            <li>It shave very close to the skin  and don&#x27;t  leave your face feeling rough.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard.</li>
            <li>The cutting blade lasts a good 9 months to a year.  </li>
            <li>The parts are quite adequate, do the job they&#x27;re intended to do, and give your electric shaver a &amp;#34;new life.&amp;#34;  As usual, a competetive price at Amazon.com.</li>

            <li> Professional 5</li>
            <li> like the foil &amp; cutter because so far it has lived up to its title</li>
            <li> Now it costs too much for freight to ship back.</li>
            <li> Good product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use the shaver daily, however I can use it 3 or more times per week.</li>
            <li> Once the foil is punctured the top piece is no good.</li>
            <li> What a big difference these new parts made.</li>
            <li> It brought my shave back to new condition and a non pulling close shave again.</li>
            <li> but when you get a new razor,they always fell different</li>
            <li> It shave very close to the skin  and don&#x27;t  leave your face feeling rough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> The cutting blade lasts a good 9 months to a year.  </li>
            <li> The parts are quite adequate, do the job they&#x27;re intended to do, and give your electric shaver a &amp;#34;new life.&amp;#34;  As usual, a competetive price at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shaver from another vendor and it didn&#x27;t last long before the foil fell apart.  </li>
            <li> I been used this item for long time ago the price is not that much different</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get at least that much use from this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just became a product that will be used me for a long time .i</li>
            <li> Only problem was I have a black one</li>
            <li> Expected a black color to match my shaves, but instead it came in sparkling brown; not a big deal, but looks tacky</li>
            <li> I broke my old foil a year ago pressing the dam thing to hard to my skin.</li>
            <li> it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> believe this fits other series beyond 4000 also.</li>
            <li> but I found the performance was no better than the regular Wahl replacement cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> Order came right on time because my old foil was in really bad shape, just what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Searched for a custom shaver replacement cartridge (black) and received a burgundy cover for a five star shaver.</li>
            <li> The foil tore after less than the month without everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> but I saving just a little I recommend to buying.</li>
            <li> It cut me a few times before I realized it.</li>
            <li> Ordered it because my current foil was broken and it came in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> Received it after a few days and got to work.</li>
            <li> If you have a Wahl 4000 or that series get these parts for a new cutting experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too bad that the batteries on the shave doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> Need at least 20 words so here they are.</li>
            <li> I use this along with Bump No More aftershave product and....no bumps on my face!!!</li>
            <li> Wears thru foil very quickly I&#x27;m not impressed with quality</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy snap in replacement parts for a great razor that can be used on your head as well as face for very close, smooth shave</li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot here in miami and a good shave is important.  The quality of this foil is much better and a new block couldn&#x27;t hert.  The price was right also. Michael says \\&quot;it works for him\\&quot;  when he shaves.  Back to the charger.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for those of us who would bump up like no tomorrow with a regular straight razor. I travel alot so one mistake I have made TWICE is just tossing the shaver in my travel bag which you will risk puncturing the foil. Once the foil is punctured the top piece is no good. It would literally cut your face if you tried to shave with it. A replacement is about 15bucks plus shipping. Dont forget to place the plastic protective cover on the shaver after using it.</li>
            <li> The Foil split after one week of use. It cut me a few times before I realized it. The original lasted 3 months. I was hoping to get at least that much use from this one. I guess not. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> Only last about 6 months for me and that&#x27;s with me only using it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> What a big difference these new parts made. It brought my shave back to new condition and a non pulling close shave again. I had changed the foil once, but never the cutter. So both together gives a great shave. If you have a Wahl 4000 or that series get these parts for a new cutting experience.&lt;br /&gt;I believe this fits other series beyond 4000 also.</li>
            <li> Great seller who delivered the replacement blade on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver and blade but the foil on the blade can be very sensitive and crake or break.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little contraption, and now I think it is worthy of my high praise. I am totally satisfied with it, however, it could be tweaked a bit to allow the little brush that comes with it ,,,,... nevermind, just incase I want to develop a better version of this type of product.    It&#x27;s a good proct, and I get a great shave with it.</li>
            <li> It works as described. I used my last foil way longer than I should have and it was time to replace.</li>
            <li> Order came right on time because my old foil was in really bad shape, just what I ordered! It works like a charm.</li>
            <li> didnt cut well even right out of the package thought maybe it was just my razor but went back to my procter</li>
            <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who is working at beauty Salon, she says it&#x27;s miracle, it works like a magic, she has been using it for years and none of clients ever complained.</li>
            <li> Seller followed up my email and was easy to work with.  This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t matter when it works.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, item as described,</li>
            <li> seems like a cheap foil</li>
            <li> Wahl is the best shaver and replacement parts are easy to get</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over a year now &amp; very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the one that came with the razer. I have not used it yet but it matches up with it exactly.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> This shaver gives an outstanding close shave and clearly without bumps, which is very important for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wears thru foil very quickly I&#x27;m not impressed with quality</li>
            <li> Great! fast  shipping!</li>
            <li> Correct item, delivered fast. The foil tore after less than the month without everyday shaving. Have not heard back from the seller to see about exchanging it.</li>
            <li> It shave very close to the skin  and don&#x27;t  leave your face feeling rough. It leaves your face feeling smooth and look very clean.</li>
            <li> Got to love these replacement heads.  Cheaper than buying a new shaver.  Too bad that the batteries on the shave doesn&#x27;t last that long.  But with a piece of paper wedged on the cord to make it a corded shaver isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if Wahl only sold replacement batteries for their shavers, that would be awesome</li>
            <li> i need to order another one now shaves very close and comfortable I would recommend this to any man with a stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> Works great just thought it would be black.</li>
            <li> Good and as advertised....it does not seem as close as the Wahl 4000 I had but when you get a new razor,they always fell different</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet.  I purchased this as a back up in case I need it in the future.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Needed the foil guard because there was a tear in my old on. This one fitted perfectly on my shaver. Am happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> The gold finish is nice but I found the performance was no better than the regular Wahl replacement cutter and foil. If you have the time, it will give you a satisfactory shave but if you&#x27;re in a hurry you might want to try another shaver.</li>
            <li> Does what one would expect.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna match the color of my Bump Free Shaver, which is black. Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> Searched for a custom shaver replacement cartridge (black) and received a burgundy cover for a five star shaver.</li>
            <li> WAHL Professional 5 Star Series Replacement Foil and Cutter Bar Assembly (Model:7031-100)&lt;br /&gt;CBS EXPRESS CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;By kevin - August 16, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I order the shaver and the replacement foil and cutter bar together,When i received the 5 star shaver i didn&#x27;t like it at all so i contacted Amazon for a return on the 5 star shaver,like always Amazon did it without a problem.Now the replacement FOIL AND CUTTER BAR is thru a third party not Amazon so i had to contact CBS EXPRESS for the return.THEY WHERE NASYY,RUDE,UNPROFESSIONAL WHEN IT CAME TO THE RETURN and it took them forever to respond to my e mail and the only reason they responded was because i call AMAZON 3 TIMES ABOUT IT AND AFTER ALL THAT THEY STILL WHOULD NOT TAKE BACK MY UNOPEN RETURN.I WOULD NEVER ORDER ANYTHING THAT&#x27;S SOLD BY CBS EXPRESS,THEY SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A GREAT COMPANY LIKE AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;WAHL Professional 5 Star Series Replacement Foil and Cutter Bar Assembly (Model:7031-100)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Account&lt;br /&gt;Your Subscribe &amp; Save Items&lt;br /&gt;1-Click Settings&lt;br /&gt;Contact Us&lt;br /&gt;Help&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com Full Site&lt;br /&gt;Not kevin?Sign Out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditions of UsePrivacy Notice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;© 1996-2013, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates</li>
            <li> The Wahl Bump Free Foil &amp; Cutter cuts the hairs that are missed by the Wahl Trimmer so I get a closer shave.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years now with no complaints.  You should replace the Foil &amp; Cutter about every 6 months to ensure a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good to shave your face, the cut isn&#x27;t very close.&lt;br /&gt;Also you can&#x27;t shave your head with it.</li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for 5 years or more the product has been wonderful but now with the bump free foil and cutter&lt;br /&gt;It just became a product that will be used me for a long time .i like the foil &amp; cutter because so far it has lived up to its title&lt;br /&gt;BUMP FREE</li>
            <li> Love my Wahl shaver with it&#x27;s dynaflex custom shave and super close foil.  It gives a great shave without irritation.  I use this along with Bump No More aftershave product and....no bumps on my face!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver. It gets really close and was recommended by a friend of our who is a barber.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the advertised product</li>
            <li> Works great. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> not a lot of frills.  the device doesn&#x27;t even match the color of the original, however i&#x27;ve not found that to be a problem.  have been thoroughly pleased with product and plan on recontacting vender for additional transactions.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Good product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Great smooth and close shave on my head.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Perfect when you want a razor close shave without the razor.  Fitment was perfect.  I have use this replacement for a couple of months with no issues.</li>
            <li> Works well- I had to replace the original on the razor after 1.5 years. I should have purchased two because I&#x27;m going to be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  ☺</li>
            <li> Wahl always has top of the line products.  A company that has been around for years and produces the best in quality.  The close screen gets the closeness of the sharpest blade razors.  The cutting blade lasts a good 9 months to a year.  It&#x27;s worth 10 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I broke the cover on my shaver and I got this.  Fits and works as advertised.  Now my shaver is just like new.</li>
            <li> Worked  and fitted like the original and was sharp too. Only problem was I have a black one and I was shipped a red one ....no big deal</li>
            <li> Its actually bump free</li>
            <li> it is as good as new the price is cheaper than any where ive found even barber supply places. great produt</li>
            <li> Great for any black male that can&#x27;t use a razor. I couldn&#x27;t be good without this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard. In search of the &amp;#34;perfect shave,&amp;#34; I have tried every brand of electric razor on the market and the only one better, perhaps, than the Wahl is the Ronson which has not been available in the U.S. for years. You can pay a lot more, a whole lot more, but you will not get a better shave with any other brand of razor.</li>
            <li> The parts are quite adequate, do the job they&#x27;re intended to do, and give your electric shaver a &amp;#34;new life.&amp;#34;  As usual, a competetive price at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  He likes the fact that it is corded, but, most importantly, is pleased with the smoothness and closeness of the shave -- much better than the Remington equivalent that he tried before this one...</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the Wahl super close shaver!</li>
            <li> Installed new razor head (&amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34;) and foil in under two minutes from opening the Amazon box to tossing out the packaging.  Works like new</li>
            <li> not complains at all, cus i get this for my grandpa shaver, and it works very good, he looks happy every time he used</li>
            <li> Excellent product, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. I am not able to use the shaver daily, however I can use it 3 or more times per week.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shaver from another vendor and it didn&#x27;t last long before the foil fell apart.  This one has already lasted longer than the one that came with the razor.  Shipped quickly and so far no problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> This product replaces the well-worn original. It gives a noticeably better shave than the original.Very happy with this purchase. Need at least 20 words so here they are.</li>
            <li> I been used this item for long time ago the price is not that much different but I saving just a little I recommend to buying.</li>
            <li> Ordered it because my current foil was broken and it came in a matter of days.  Super fast shipment and great service.</li>
            <li> Gives an excellent shave and the battery has impressive storage capacity. However, I wish was universal voltage (110-240v) instead of just domestic. Based on performance I&#x27;d certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> A good product would highly recommend to shaver that bump up easy,but  I thought I was getting a black in color</li>
            <li> The foils wear out quickly and are overpriced for cheesey piece that it is. I&#x27;ve gone through 4 in one year. It&#x27;s better suited for personal use not for professional use.</li>
            <li> excellent! it arrived sooner than expected. thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love my Wahl shaver and accessories!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement Head (foil) and cutters.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit and cuts well..&lt;br /&gt;Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again if possible.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and what I searched for.</li>
            <li> Shaves a lot closer than the original head and cutter.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was new as they said it would be. I&#x27;ll definitely order more of these again as they work on my shaver just fine.</li>
            <li> I thought this cutter was to fit the Wahl 7367-200 &amp; it does not.  Why wasn&#x27;t I made aware of this before&lt;br /&gt;you shipped it.  Now it costs too much for freight to ship back.</li>
            <li> Always quality service from this supplier</li>
            <li> Exact replacement, good price.</li>
            <li> very nice item for the price.</li>
            <li> supper close comfortable shave. wahl is one of the top shavers for your money.</li>
            <li> These are the original replacement parts; feel free to order with confidence. Apparently I need to type three more words lol.</li>
            <li> Expected a black color to match my shaves, but instead it came in sparkling brown; not a big deal, but looks tacky</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it was exactly what i needed and did exactly what it was supposed to do. I broke my old foil a year ago pressing the dam thing to hard to my skin. Received it after a few days and got to work. Everything snapped on perfectly, fit like a glove, and worked like it was supposed to. I would recommend this product to anybody needing it.</li>
            <li> It has met my expectations.</li>
