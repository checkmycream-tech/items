            <li>Great product!!  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product as one of the best to keep the curl in perms.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the best way I can describe how it feels.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>To get the best results, put it on after you&#x27;ve showered.</li>

            <li>the ultra gel made perfect curls with no frizz!</li>
            <li>I love all the DevaCurl products!!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>The plus is that this stuff wasn&#x27;t crunchy but that&#x27;s probably because the hold wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>This Gel works perfectly (I am African-American) and gives me a good hold when I need it to and it doesn&#x27;t clump up in my hair.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness and it gives me tighter, defined curls, but will probably take turns between this and my Curl Keeper.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that was recommended to me by my stylist.</li>
            <li>It works great for curly hair</li>
            <li>This gel goes great with the No Poo and One Condition shower combo.</li>
            <li>However, great product, great company</li>
            <li>Great gel.  </li>
            <li>Great for the frizzies that come with curly weather in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is a great gel that will define your curls without making them crunchy.</li>
            <li>Works GREAT</li>
            <li>gel is a great addition to the Deva Curl family.</li>
            <li>gel is a great addition to the Deva Curl family.</li>
            <li>The best product to give you a nice curl.</li>
            <li>this defining gel is great</li>
            <li>And what is really great about them</li>
            <li>This product is a great addition to  a Deva collection.</li>
            <li>Another great Deva product.</li>
            <li>I used Tigi Curl Rocks before and thought that was a great product but decided to try this.</li>
            <li>but my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>and I feel great</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>I love this gel!!</li>
            <li>Deva curl is amazing!</li>
            <li>Really nice effect on my baby-soft curls with the two together!</li>
            <li>Nice try Deva Curl, but you just don&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>but this is a pleasant grape smell.</li>
            <li>For someone like me with fine, curly hair; Diva Curl is the perfect solution for boosting the curls</li>
            <li>Amazing... great for my curls</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I have been using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34; as a styling/setting lotion for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I had to keep wetting my hands in order to get a good layer over them to put into my hair.</li>
            <li>This gel smells good and holds my curl while drying.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product, does what it is supposed to do, keeps my hair in place, wavy and elegant.</li>
            <li>I love the Devacurl line!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people, I should be paid!  </li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Love using this with the no poo and one condition from Deva Curl!</li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>Great Gel and strong hold.</li>
            <li>I got this bottle thinking it would be amazing since it&#x27;s Devacurl</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Scrunch it and let curls set, shake out, amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have been using the line for years and my hair looks amazing each and every day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Some days are still beyond help, but most days I have good hair days now.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my frizzy hair will just never be nice and curly but this product didn&#x27;t help it in any way.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are good for your hairl.</li>
            <li>and I think a good mouse from a drugstore would provide more results.</li>
            <li>She liked it, but didn&#x27;t like the build-up or smell.</li>
            <li>and I have nice curls and no frizz</li>
            <li>If you put too much of the UD gel in, your hair will be crunchy, so a dime to a quarter sized amount is perfect.</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t put anything in it, it turns into a \\&quot;fro\\&quot; because my curls are not defined on their own.</li>
            <li>But really, I&#x27;m just happy to give people some hope!  </li>
            <li>I scrunch in a nice size dollop of this product.  </li>
            <li>With the product I&#x27;m used to using, Granier Fructis Curl Shaping Gel, I get much better results in terms of definition, and it&#x27;s a good deal cheaper.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the 2 day Prime shipping is ideal</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I liked this better</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>They make help define my curls, just love love love Devacurl!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great looks just as great the second day and after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty great stuff that doesn&#x27;t get crispy.</li>
            <li>gel, when used correctly, will give you the definition and hold you need for bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very important to use this as directed.</li>
            <li>I first used CHS Curl Keeper which is very nice to reduce frizz and define my curls.  </li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the wetter your hair is the better this gel defines the curl and holds them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve a tried so many products and diffusers in an attempt to get my hair to curl without looking frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love curls.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been away from most chemical fragrances for awhile.  </li>
            <li>Using this product, it makes nice smooth waves and defined curls.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for two years and am still satisfied.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It feels light and like you putting no product on your hair, but controls naturally curly hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love what this does for my curls.  </li>
            <li>I think this depends more on hair type though, so hold may vary by person.</li>
            <li>(7 more words req for review?</li>
            <li>While I love the way the gel makes my hair look, it makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and my hair has done much better.</li>
            <li>think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>While I love the product itself, the bottle was damaged with a hole in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I could type all day about how much I love Devacurl.</li>
            <li>So I touched the gel and each time got an electric shock like I was touching a socket with something metal...</li>
            <li>Like the firmer hold better.</li>
            <li>I used the Deva One conditioner in the shower and my hair had more tangles in it after using this product than before I got in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love Ouidad&#x27;s leave in conditioner and Redken 07 styling products.</li>
            <li>It works for air drying, but I get better results with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>The lighter gel may work better.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I get so-so</li>
            <li>really love this product in combination with the Devacurl Styling Cream.  </li>
            <li>This product has a nice light floral citrus scent, not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this line.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wavy haired girls finally found their perfect match, and those with longer curls will LOVE this gel.ions to suit each of them.</li>
            <li>Wavy haired girls finally found their perfect match, and those with longer curls will LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li>Love love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair shiney and curly without putting more oil on my hair and i like that.</li>
            <li>Aveda makes a much better (but more $) product.</li>
            <li>I love this brands curl enhance spray - but not the gel.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its way better than the AnGel in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the scent of the Deva products a lot better than the Redken Curvaceous scent.</li>
            <li>Better.  </li>
            <li>This may be my go to gel now :)</li>
            <li>I think it would work better for someone with wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Love using it.</li>
            <li>my results were even better, but if you can&#x27;t afford it, just try the Gel.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better product from Devacurl.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and responds so well.  </li>
            <li>I have to use a lof of gel to get more hold.</li>
            <li>My curls have never looked, or felt better.  </li>
            <li>Devacurl has constantly been said to be the best curly hair product</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy and I love the smell of the devacurl products.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love deva curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update as I try those to give more of a comparison between products.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but none of them worked like this one......</li>
            <li>Hope this helps someone like me :-)  </li>
            <li>But soooooo much healthier for my hair!!!!</li>
            <li>Great gel - very strong hold but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>A friend who is a stylist always has beautifully defined SOFT curly hair, and I asked her so many times, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li>highly recommend you buy this with the Devacurl Styling cream and use this together for great results.  </li>
            <li>I found this gel to be just OK - it&#x27;s holding power wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>However, for my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair it works great, but then again I haven&#x27;t tried to many products that don&#x27;t work well with hers.</li>
            <li>Great for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Deva light defining gel and the Deva arc anGel and like the Ultra Defining Gel way better.</li>
            <li>I like the light defining gel better.</li>
            <li>It was deliveres early and works great on my hair</li>
            <li>The Ultra Defining Gel works much better than the Light sample I received.</li>
            <li>This is ok, but I like Deva Curl Light</li>
            <li>As far as how the gel works, it still works great, just like it did before.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural curly hair</li>
            <li>I need to experiment more with how much to use but my curls look good and have stayed frizz free with using this.</li>
            <li>Deva curl leaves my hair bouncy and full of life!  </li>
            <li>Sorry best way to describe it lol....</li>
            <li>go easy though hair can get crunchy if you over use</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold to it but doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy at all.</li>
            <li>Once my hair completely finishes drying my curls are nice a defined and shiny!</li>
            <li>Love this line, but this is the first gel in MANY that never fail to give me full, bouncy, gorgeous curls without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my niece, she loved it so much I decided to try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells just as good and is not hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li>Got this for my sister who has fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times and it seems to be fine for my 2c wavy-Botticelli curls.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, s-wave to spiral curl hair.</li>
            <li>I have 2b (wavy curly) hair that is somewhat fine.</li>
            <li>If your thinking about using these products do a quick google search to better understand the 3 step process.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it curls my hair wonderfully without leaving that hard feel, curls feel soft.</li>
            <li>Went to use it again and squeezed some gel into my palm and the gel gave me a huge electric shock again ...</li>
            <li>It Free Moisture Lock.  </li>
            <li>If you have hair like mine and are looking for something to hold curls and leave you frizz free, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>I have gone sulfate and silicone free</li>
            <li>(Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li>my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li>* Wash with cheap shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* Use a cheap leave in conditioner on my hair to comb out the tangles</li>
            <li>I then ordered the Deva travel kit which came with the Deva Light Defining Gel.  </li>
            <li>Light weight hold, no build up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never sticky or hair, it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li>Perfect for not only my curly girl but also me and my straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with a little water for a softer look - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;d used, but still not quite right.  </li>
            <li>Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel has excellent &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; without a stiff, crunchy feel.  </li>
            <li>So for longer curls, this is a great alternative to the usual Angell and Arc Angell, which as still amazing.</li>
            <li>Love Deva products, but unfortunately not a fan of this one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s straight! :)</li>
            <li>but if I can find a better, more natural, product then I&#x27;ll switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, from Pantene to TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock which kind of work, to products that don&#x27;t define my curls at all such as \\&quot;Frizz-ease\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a great gel - leaves no residue, does not make my hair crunch, and really gives me nice tight curls.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge learning curve to the Curly Girl method but when it works it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I use this and the shampoo/conditioner, as well as several of the homemade curly girl products from the book -- perfect hold for my hair, you just have to follow the directions and make sure you apply this to wet hair (not towel-dried)</li>
            <li>am in love with Devacurl products and this gel really does the trick without leaving any halo frizz.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than my Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;ALSO my sister was blessed with gorgeous wavy hair (I used to be so jealous when I was younger)</li>
            <li>I have to say, I was really expecting more of this product.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but pricing is to high!</li>
            <li>I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.</li>
            <li>It defined my curls as well as Deva Ultra Defining Gel, but it was super crunchy, and I couldn&#x27;t make my hair look good the next day without washing it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, but the hold wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Free, the Mister Right and the Care line.</li>
            <li>Happy for the first time with my curls and not trying to flat iron it every day.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin curly hair and this gel seems to work the best with my hair.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use this while my hair is sopping wet (directly out of the shower), and use the Deva Curl clips at the roots of my hair, I&#x27;ll get the best results.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>I have found that the Styling Cream and Ultra Defining gel work super</li>
            <li>Just find our how to use it correctly, and you&#x27;ll thank your lucky stars that you found this product.  </li>
            <li>It comes out very pretty.</li>
            <li>need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li>TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li>My husband ordered this product for me after I read some reviews on it which they turned out to be very helpful!!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so curly, i can&#x27;t complain about it, the best you can do is( if you don&#x27;t want to define every single curl) to put some of it in your hair and then putting it in your hair starting at your hair-ends.</li>
            <li>very thick and curly hair and Devacurl shapes my curls beautifully and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I have told several friends about the amazing curl you can get  even if you don&#x27;t have curly hair.</li>
            <li>Results aren&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>Ever since Redken stopped making their Fresh Curl Refiner, this has been my go to product.</li>
            <li>There are far better products out there.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ll bounce right</li>
            <li>The devalcurl &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34; defining gel is just right with defining the curl and keeping the freeze to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always looking for the right styling product.</li>
            <li>I also like the Mister Right spray &amp; the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try the devalcurl light defining gel... Would say this is a must if you live in a humid climate like we have in North Carolina.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly gorgeous healthy hair that is fine textured but very thick.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and hold my curls for several days.</li>
            <li>I was originally using the light defining gel, but my hair&#x27;s grown 4+ inches in the last year, so it was time to step up the hold with the ultra.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t touch your hair till its dry and them scrunch again to release the get cast (just learned about that) and your curls will be soft and defined and most importantly move!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for whoever came up with this formula!!</li>
            <li>You have to use a LOT of this (a whole palmful) for each use or it won&#x27;t have the good effects it&#x27;s supposed to, so the bottle can be emptied pretty quickly, and that hasn&#x27;t changed either, but as long as your hair is well-moisturized or you use a leave-in conditioner first, it makes nicely-formed curls that are soft once it dries</li>
            <li>My hair dresser taught me how to use it, super easy and cuts down on frizz which is a huge issue in Florida</li>
            <li>Found the DevaCurl line at my hairdresser&#x27;s former salon and whichever products she sold (not this one) worked OK.  </li>
            <li>The curls stay soft and crunch free.</li>
            <li>This size bottle should last 6 or more months.</li>
            <li>How&#x27;s this? ;&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>It lets me enjoy my naturally curly hair without being sticky or or causing build up.</li>
            <li>This product keeps the frizzes away and my natural waves are bouncy and light.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last most of the day, too.</li>
            <li>and this is the first gel that gives me volume.  </li>
            <li>I went back to Curl Rocks and love it.</li>
            <li>Despite my first instincts.</li>
            <li>I just used the no-poo and conditioner for the first time today &amp;</li>
            <li>Devacurl has really improved the ingredients in this gel!</li>
            <li>It is soft, full and never crunchy and looks great 2nd and ever 3rd day!</li>
            <li>Flip your hair back over and use a microfiber towel (something that won&#x27;t &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; the curls) to blot out some more dampness.</li>
            <li>knowing I&#x27;m supporting a company that doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li>After it dried it was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>If I use it on days with high humidity I tend to frizz up too quick.  </li>
            <li>On humid summer days, I use a little more to ensure that they stay frizz free.</li>
            <li>It took a few tries for me to figure out the best way to scrunch</li>
            <li>so I straightened my hair pretty much every day for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market</li>
            <li>My first experience with DevaCurl  was few months back when I saw a lady with beautiful curls at the car dealership</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I am still somewhat new to this product, but on the second day after washing, it usually looks the best if I use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Let your hair dry 90-95% before &amp;#34;scrunching the crunch&amp;#34; This is important!</li>
            <li>Read the reviews about how to use it or look it up on You Tube to get the most bang for your buck, because if you&#x27;re gonna towel dry your hair, you may as well just save your money  </li>
            <li>I find that the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for my not-very-curly hair.</li>
            <li>I put a full palm fulls in while still in the shower, wrapped my head in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes and then gently finger combed my hair and added a little more gel where needed.</li>
            <li>Then air dry! :-)</li>
            <li>hair is thin AND fine and it brings out the curl without flattening, greasing or drying.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>A gel light enough but also defining enough for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It was suggested that I try this gel on soaking wet hair and I must say that made a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>Will buy again, maybe in a huge package next time.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even use much of the product.</li>
            <li>I have very temperamental hair.  </li>
            <li>2 days straight  </li>
            <li>It smells really fruity and its overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely a god send.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel for four months and really like it.</li>
            <li>While I swore by Angell and Arc Angell when I had shoulder length curls, but I had to be considerably more careful with the amount gel I used as my hair grew.</li>
            <li>After No-Poo and One Condition, I blot my hair with a microfiber towel to get the excess water out, and then gently scurnch a palmful of this Gel through each section of my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li>I find this really separates my curls -</li>
            <li>and my hair looks much thicker.</li>
            <li>It did not hold the curl very well at all.</li>
            <li>I really thought that the gel must have alcohol in it...</li>
            <li>However, it really feels to me like it has alcohol in it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I never believed that products really made a difference - until I found Deva Curl -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also is really, really sticky gel.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say much</li>
            <li>i switched back to the light defining gel.  </li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This is the best gel for my naturally curly (botticelli), long, thick hair that I have found.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this gel is better for other hair types, but for my hair, it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li>I get much better curls with this than any other gel.</li>
            <li>Will be trying many other products in the DevaCurl line, so</li>
            <li>Prior to discovering the Deva product line, I was using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for ways to get more curl yet keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li>The longer my curls are, the looser they become and are more prone to being weighed down.</li>
            <li>very fine limp</li>
            <li>(My sister has longer hair, so she uses a bit of one condition in addition to no poo and more gel, whereas my mom has chin length wave and uses conditioner occassionally and less gel.)</li>
            <li>(My sister has longer hair, so she uses a bit of one condition in addition to no poo and more gel, whereas my mom has chin length wave and uses conditioner occassionally and less gel.)</li>
            <li>Ok so I was skeptical about buying this because I am in LOVE with my ArcAngel.</li>
            <li>My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and less frizzy since I started this new hair care regime.</li>
            <li>gel seemed to make my hair hard and kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, but it really kicks it up a notch with Deva in it.</li>
            <li>product left my hair soft and shiny and I&#x27;m able to always get 2 day curls, some days, 3rd day hair as well when I pineapple my hair overnight.  </li>
            <li>Most gels are to heavy.</li>
            <li>It smells like grapes which I don&#x27;t normally like</li>
            <li>I use it apply it as the bottle suggests (in wet hair, flip head and scrunch, rescrunch when dry) and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>For that extra volume, I lift my the roots of the curls on top of my head with duckbill clips and not touch it except when they are dry.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I like this gel because it is never stiff or sticky and still allows my hair to move!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The gel made my hair super dry.</li>
            <li>I have really unruly curly hair, and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that works really well in controlling frizz and defining curls.</li>
            <li>It used to have several really harmful ingredients, but they have done away with all but the synthetic fragrance, so I&#x27;m much happier with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
            <li>I went to open to smell the gel as this was my first time purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The before and after pictures are actually for real and yo can do it yourself!</li>
            <li>So, what I end up with is soft curls that are manageable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure how much us a difference there is between this and the light defining gel (I&#x27;ve been using both)</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my unruly, dry, fine, frizzy hair for almost 40 years, since I was a teen ager.</li>
            <li>Like this better then the lighter gel if you want defined curls and doesn&#x27;t dry wet.</li>
            <li>It seems like I have to use a large volume for my relatively short hair, but maybe that&#x27;s how it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>When I use it, my hair is like a rat&#x27;s nest by the end of the day - completely tangled at the ends.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my curls soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have 2C hair that loses it&#x27;s curl/wave after love second day, but this product really seems to hold my curls!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only downside is that since it&#x27;s such a light gel it won&#x27;t last longer than 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which I leave curly.  </li>
            <li>I like that my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>This product does not work as well as the product bought directly from an approved salon or Sephora.  </li>
            <li>A lot goes a pretty long way, too.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and finding products to help me control my hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my curls feeling soft or defined at all.</li>
            <li>I recommend all the DevaCurl line for women who have naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little gunky going on, but after my hair dries there aren&#x27;t any really stiff parts and the curl is good.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s not enough, and other times it feels like there is buildup, but my hair is pretty long, wavy, and sort of fine.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t towel dry your hair first, just shake it to get rid of excess water.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and when it was 3/4 down my back</li>
            <li>, helped me understand how to get the most from this product...would definitely recommend that, you don&#x27;t want to waste your money!</li>
            <li>The gel defines her waves like I had never seen before, it gives her these classic beach waves, but without the occasional halo of frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lazy about styling my kinda naturally wavy hair and have scrunched and hair sprayed for many years when I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry it straight, but frankly my hair just looked messy most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff, and if My hair gets droopy I just wet my hands and scrunch again.</li>
            <li>I have curly, fine, thick hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair between 2C-3A/B, different curl patterns throughout.</li>
            <li>that it barely does the job or</li>
            <li>Finally a product that does what it is supposed to do and rinses out completely when washing my hair.</li>
            <li>but I will probably be picking up a micro fiber towel in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have coarse naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because when I flip my hair over and scrunch my hair and then try to dry it, it gets really matted after.</li>
            <li>My hair was so bad before I couldn&#x27;t wash it more than once a week, now I am able to wash every other day.</li>
            <li>thanks to these products and the extremely patient curly hair experts at Devachan Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells and that it&#x27;s not sticky like other gels when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I take the clips out, &#x27;recast&#x27; (gently scruching the dried curls that are still crystalized from the gel) and I have soft, defined, and bouncy curls until I decide to wash it again.</li>
            <li>It felt too light, but thick at the same time.</li>
            <li>I typically use another gel but wanted to try this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>No other curling gel can hold a candle to the DevaCurl defining gel; it really adds bounce without the heavy feel of an additive to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and long and takes forever to air dry but looks much better when I use this gel.</li>
            <li>If I can let my medium length hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>I have super thick porous hair that tends to soak up product</li>
            <li>I have super thick 2c/3a hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying this if you have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Not very impressed at all, expected more than what it gives me.  </li>
            <li>I have horrible hair- very fine, erratic waves and super frizzy since I live in Florida.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product!!  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product as one of the best to keep the curl in perms.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the best way I can describe how it feels.</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> Great stuff!  </li>
            <li> To get the best results, put it on after you&#x27;ve showered.</li>

            <li> I love all the DevaCurl products!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> The plus is that this stuff wasn&#x27;t crunchy but that&#x27;s probably because the hold wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> This Gel works perfectly (I am African-American) and gives me a good hold when I need it to and it doesn&#x27;t clump up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness and it gives me tighter, defined curls, but will probably take turns between this and my Curl Keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was recommended to me by my stylist.</li>
            <li> It works great for curly hair</li>
            <li> This gel goes great with the No Poo and One Condition shower combo.</li>
            <li> However, great product, great company</li>

            <li> I used Tigi Curl Rocks before and thought that was a great product but decided to try this.</li>
            <li> but my hair looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> and I feel great</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>

            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> but this is a pleasant grape smell.</li>
            <li> For someone like me with fine, curly hair; Diva Curl is the perfect solution for boosting the curls</li>
            <li> Amazing... great for my curls</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34; as a styling/setting lotion for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep wetting my hands in order to get a good layer over them to put into my hair.</li>
            <li> This gel smells good and holds my curl while drying.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it is supposed to do, keeps my hair in place, wavy and elegant.</li>
            <li> I love the Devacurl line!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people, I should be paid!  </li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Love using this with the no poo and one condition from Deva Curl!</li>
            <li> Love these products!</li>
            <li> Great Gel and strong hold.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle thinking it would be amazing since it&#x27;s Devacurl</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Scrunch it and let curls set, shake out, amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the line for years and my hair looks amazing each and every day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Some days are still beyond help, but most days I have good hair days now.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my frizzy hair will just never be nice and curly but this product didn&#x27;t help it in any way.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are good for your hairl.</li>
            <li> and I think a good mouse from a drugstore would provide more results.</li>
            <li> She liked it, but didn&#x27;t like the build-up or smell.</li>
            <li> and I have nice curls and no frizz</li>
            <li> If you put too much of the UD gel in, your hair will be crunchy, so a dime to a quarter sized amount is perfect.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t put anything in it, it turns into a \\&quot;fro\\&quot; because my curls are not defined on their own.</li>
            <li> But really, I&#x27;m just happy to give people some hope!  </li>
            <li> I scrunch in a nice size dollop of this product.  </li>
            <li> With the product I&#x27;m used to using, Granier Fructis Curl Shaping Gel, I get much better results in terms of definition, and it&#x27;s a good deal cheaper.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the 2 day Prime shipping is ideal</li>
            <li> it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I liked this better</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> They make help define my curls, just love love love Devacurl!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great looks just as great the second day and after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty great stuff that doesn&#x27;t get crispy.</li>
            <li> gel, when used correctly, will give you the definition and hold you need for bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very important to use this as directed.</li>
            <li> I first used CHS Curl Keeper which is very nice to reduce frizz and define my curls.  </li>
            <li> Love this gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the wetter your hair is the better this gel defines the curl and holds them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a tried so many products and diffusers in an attempt to get my hair to curl without looking frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love curls.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been away from most chemical fragrances for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Using this product, it makes nice smooth waves and defined curls.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for two years and am still satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It feels light and like you putting no product on your hair, but controls naturally curly hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my curls.  </li>
            <li> I think this depends more on hair type though, so hold may vary by person.</li>
            <li> (7 more words req for review?</li>
            <li> While I love the way the gel makes my hair look, it makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and my hair has done much better.</li>
            <li> think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> While I love the product itself, the bottle was damaged with a hole in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I could type all day about how much I love Devacurl.</li>
            <li> So I touched the gel and each time got an electric shock like I was touching a socket with something metal...</li>
            <li> Like the firmer hold better.</li>
            <li> I used the Deva One conditioner in the shower and my hair had more tangles in it after using this product than before I got in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love Ouidad&#x27;s leave in conditioner and Redken 07 styling products.</li>
            <li> It works for air drying, but I get better results with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> The lighter gel may work better.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I get so-so</li>
            <li> really love this product in combination with the Devacurl Styling Cream.  </li>
            <li> This product has a nice light floral citrus scent, not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this line.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wavy haired girls finally found their perfect match, and those with longer curls will LOVE this gel.ions to suit each of them.</li>
            <li> Wavy haired girls finally found their perfect match, and those with longer curls will LOVE this gel.</li>
            <li> Love love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair shiney and curly without putting more oil on my hair and i like that.</li>
            <li> Aveda makes a much better (but more $) product.</li>
            <li> I love this brands curl enhance spray - but not the gel.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Its way better than the AnGel in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the scent of the Deva products a lot better than the Redken Curvaceous scent.</li>
            <li> Better.  </li>
            <li> This may be my go to gel now :)</li>
            <li> I think it would work better for someone with wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Love using it.</li>
            <li> my results were even better, but if you can&#x27;t afford it, just try the Gel.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better product from Devacurl.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and responds so well.  </li>
            <li> I have to use a lof of gel to get more hold.</li>
            <li> My curls have never looked, or felt better.  </li>
            <li> Devacurl has constantly been said to be the best curly hair product</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy and I love the smell of the devacurl products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love deva curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update as I try those to give more of a comparison between products.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but none of them worked like this one......</li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone like me :-)  </li>
            <li> But soooooo much healthier for my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Great gel - very strong hold but not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> A friend who is a stylist always has beautifully defined SOFT curly hair, and I asked her so many times, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> highly recommend you buy this with the Devacurl Styling cream and use this together for great results.  </li>
            <li> I found this gel to be just OK - it&#x27;s holding power wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> However, for my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair it works great, but then again I haven&#x27;t tried to many products that don&#x27;t work well with hers.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Deva light defining gel and the Deva arc anGel and like the Ultra Defining Gel way better.</li>
            <li> I like the light defining gel better.</li>
            <li> It was deliveres early and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> The Ultra Defining Gel works much better than the Light sample I received.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I like Deva Curl Light</li>
            <li> As far as how the gel works, it still works great, just like it did before.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I need to experiment more with how much to use but my curls look good and have stayed frizz free with using this.</li>
            <li> Deva curl leaves my hair bouncy and full of life!  </li>
            <li> Sorry best way to describe it lol....</li>
            <li> go easy though hair can get crunchy if you over use</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold to it but doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy at all.</li>
            <li> Once my hair completely finishes drying my curls are nice a defined and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this line, but this is the first gel in MANY that never fail to give me full, bouncy, gorgeous curls without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my niece, she loved it so much I decided to try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells just as good and is not hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister who has fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times and it seems to be fine for my 2c wavy-Botticelli curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, s-wave to spiral curl hair.</li>
            <li> I have 2b (wavy curly) hair that is somewhat fine.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about using these products do a quick google search to better understand the 3 step process.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it curls my hair wonderfully without leaving that hard feel, curls feel soft.</li>
            <li> Went to use it again and squeezed some gel into my palm and the gel gave me a huge electric shock again ...</li>
            <li> It Free Moisture Lock.  </li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine and are looking for something to hold curls and leave you frizz free, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I have gone sulfate and silicone free</li>
            <li> (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li> my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li> * Wash with cheap shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * Use a cheap leave in conditioner on my hair to comb out the tangles</li>
            <li> I then ordered the Deva travel kit which came with the Deva Light Defining Gel.  </li>
            <li> Light weight hold, no build up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never sticky or hair, it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li> Perfect for not only my curly girl but also me and my straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a little water for a softer look - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;d used, but still not quite right.  </li>
            <li> Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel has excellent &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; without a stiff, crunchy feel.  </li>
            <li> So for longer curls, this is a great alternative to the usual Angell and Arc Angell, which as still amazing.</li>
            <li> Love Deva products, but unfortunately not a fan of this one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s straight! :)</li>
            <li> but if I can find a better, more natural, product then I&#x27;ll switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, from Pantene to TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock which kind of work, to products that don&#x27;t define my curls at all such as \\&quot;Frizz-ease\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel - leaves no residue, does not make my hair crunch, and really gives me nice tight curls.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge learning curve to the Curly Girl method but when it works it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> I use this and the shampoo/conditioner, as well as several of the homemade curly girl products from the book -- perfect hold for my hair, you just have to follow the directions and make sure you apply this to wet hair (not towel-dried)</li>
            <li> am in love with Devacurl products and this gel really does the trick without leaving any halo frizz.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than my Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALSO my sister was blessed with gorgeous wavy hair (I used to be so jealous when I was younger)</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was really expecting more of this product.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but pricing is to high!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.</li>
            <li> It defined my curls as well as Deva Ultra Defining Gel, but it was super crunchy, and I couldn&#x27;t make my hair look good the next day without washing it.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, but the hold wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Free, the Mister Right and the Care line.</li>
            <li> Happy for the first time with my curls and not trying to flat iron it every day.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin curly hair and this gel seems to work the best with my hair.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use this while my hair is sopping wet (directly out of the shower), and use the Deva Curl clips at the roots of my hair, I&#x27;ll get the best results.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> I have found that the Styling Cream and Ultra Defining gel work super</li>
            <li> Just find our how to use it correctly, and you&#x27;ll thank your lucky stars that you found this product.  </li>
            <li> It comes out very pretty.</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li> TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product for me after I read some reviews on it which they turned out to be very helpful!!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so curly, i can&#x27;t complain about it, the best you can do is( if you don&#x27;t want to define every single curl) to put some of it in your hair and then putting it in your hair starting at your hair-ends.</li>
            <li> very thick and curly hair and Devacurl shapes my curls beautifully and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I have told several friends about the amazing curl you can get  even if you don&#x27;t have curly hair.</li>
            <li> Results aren&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Ever since Redken stopped making their Fresh Curl Refiner, this has been my go to product.</li>
            <li> There are far better products out there.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll bounce right</li>
            <li> The devalcurl &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34; defining gel is just right with defining the curl and keeping the freeze to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for the right styling product.</li>
            <li> I also like the Mister Right spray &amp; the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to try the devalcurl light defining gel... Would say this is a must if you live in a humid climate like we have in North Carolina.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly gorgeous healthy hair that is fine textured but very thick.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and hold my curls for several days.</li>
            <li> I was originally using the light defining gel, but my hair&#x27;s grown 4+ inches in the last year, so it was time to step up the hold with the ultra.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t touch your hair till its dry and them scrunch again to release the get cast (just learned about that) and your curls will be soft and defined and most importantly move!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for whoever came up with this formula!!</li>
            <li> You have to use a LOT of this (a whole palmful) for each use or it won&#x27;t have the good effects it&#x27;s supposed to, so the bottle can be emptied pretty quickly, and that hasn&#x27;t changed either, but as long as your hair is well-moisturized or you use a leave-in conditioner first, it makes nicely-formed curls that are soft once it dries</li>
            <li> My hair dresser taught me how to use it, super easy and cuts down on frizz which is a huge issue in Florida</li>
            <li> Found the DevaCurl line at my hairdresser&#x27;s former salon and whichever products she sold (not this one) worked OK.  </li>
            <li> The curls stay soft and crunch free.</li>
            <li> This size bottle should last 6 or more months.</li>
            <li> How&#x27;s this? ;&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> It lets me enjoy my naturally curly hair without being sticky or or causing build up.</li>
            <li> This product keeps the frizzes away and my natural waves are bouncy and light.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last most of the day, too.</li>
            <li> and this is the first gel that gives me volume.  </li>
            <li> I went back to Curl Rocks and love it.</li>
            <li> Despite my first instincts.</li>
            <li> I just used the no-poo and conditioner for the first time today &amp;</li>
            <li> Devacurl has really improved the ingredients in this gel!</li>
            <li> It is soft, full and never crunchy and looks great 2nd and ever 3rd day!</li>
            <li> Flip your hair back over and use a microfiber towel (something that won&#x27;t &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; the curls) to blot out some more dampness.</li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m supporting a company that doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li> After it dried it was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> If I use it on days with high humidity I tend to frizz up too quick.  </li>
            <li> On humid summer days, I use a little more to ensure that they stay frizz free.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries for me to figure out the best way to scrunch</li>
            <li> so I straightened my hair pretty much every day for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market</li>
            <li> My first experience with DevaCurl  was few months back when I saw a lady with beautiful curls at the car dealership</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I am still somewhat new to this product, but on the second day after washing, it usually looks the best if I use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Let your hair dry 90-95% before &amp;#34;scrunching the crunch&amp;#34; This is important!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews about how to use it or look it up on You Tube to get the most bang for your buck, because if you&#x27;re gonna towel dry your hair, you may as well just save your money  </li>
            <li> I find that the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for my not-very-curly hair.</li>
            <li> I put a full palm fulls in while still in the shower, wrapped my head in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes and then gently finger combed my hair and added a little more gel where needed.</li>
            <li> Then air dry! :-)</li>
            <li> hair is thin AND fine and it brings out the curl without flattening, greasing or drying.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> A gel light enough but also defining enough for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was suggested that I try this gel on soaking wet hair and I must say that made a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> Will buy again, maybe in a huge package next time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even use much of the product.</li>
            <li> I have very temperamental hair.  </li>
            <li> 2 days straight  </li>
            <li> It smells really fruity and its overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a god send.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for four months and really like it.</li>
            <li> While I swore by Angell and Arc Angell when I had shoulder length curls, but I had to be considerably more careful with the amount gel I used as my hair grew.</li>
            <li> After No-Poo and One Condition, I blot my hair with a microfiber towel to get the excess water out, and then gently scurnch a palmful of this Gel through each section of my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.  </li>
            <li> I find this really separates my curls -</li>
            <li> and my hair looks much thicker.</li>
            <li> It did not hold the curl very well at all.</li>
            <li> I really thought that the gel must have alcohol in it...</li>
            <li> However, it really feels to me like it has alcohol in it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I never believed that products really made a difference - until I found Deva Curl -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also is really, really sticky gel.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say much</li>
            <li> i switched back to the light defining gel.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for my naturally curly (botticelli), long, thick hair that I have found.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this gel is better for other hair types, but for my hair, it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li> I get much better curls with this than any other gel.</li>
            <li> Will be trying many other products in the DevaCurl line, so</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering the Deva product line, I was using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for ways to get more curl yet keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> The longer my curls are, the looser they become and are more prone to being weighed down.</li>
            <li> very fine limp</li>
            <li> (My sister has longer hair, so she uses a bit of one condition in addition to no poo and more gel, whereas my mom has chin length wave and uses conditioner occassionally and less gel.)</li>
            <li> (My sister has longer hair, so she uses a bit of one condition in addition to no poo and more gel, whereas my mom has chin length wave and uses conditioner occassionally and less gel.)</li>
            <li> Ok so I was skeptical about buying this because I am in LOVE with my ArcAngel.</li>
            <li> My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> My curls are more defined and less frizzy since I started this new hair care regime.</li>
            <li> gel seemed to make my hair hard and kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but it really kicks it up a notch with Deva in it.</li>
            <li> product left my hair soft and shiny and I&#x27;m able to always get 2 day curls, some days, 3rd day hair as well when I pineapple my hair overnight.  </li>
            <li> Most gels are to heavy.</li>
            <li> It smells like grapes which I don&#x27;t normally like</li>
            <li> I use it apply it as the bottle suggests (in wet hair, flip head and scrunch, rescrunch when dry) and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li> For that extra volume, I lift my the roots of the curls on top of my head with duckbill clips and not touch it except when they are dry.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I like this gel because it is never stiff or sticky and still allows my hair to move!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The gel made my hair super dry.</li>
            <li> I have really unruly curly hair, and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that works really well in controlling frizz and defining curls.</li>
            <li> It used to have several really harmful ingredients, but they have done away with all but the synthetic fragrance, so I&#x27;m much happier with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
            <li> I went to open to smell the gel as this was my first time purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The before and after pictures are actually for real and yo can do it yourself!</li>
            <li> So, what I end up with is soft curls that are manageable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure how much us a difference there is between this and the light defining gel (I&#x27;ve been using both)</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my unruly, dry, fine, frizzy hair for almost 40 years, since I was a teen ager.</li>
            <li> Like this better then the lighter gel if you want defined curls and doesn&#x27;t dry wet.</li>
            <li> It seems like I have to use a large volume for my relatively short hair, but maybe that&#x27;s how it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> When I use it, my hair is like a rat&#x27;s nest by the end of the day - completely tangled at the ends.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have 2C hair that loses it&#x27;s curl/wave after love second day, but this product really seems to hold my curls!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only downside is that since it&#x27;s such a light gel it won&#x27;t last longer than 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which I leave curly.  </li>
            <li> I like that my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as the product bought directly from an approved salon or Sephora.  </li>
            <li> A lot goes a pretty long way, too.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and finding products to help me control my hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my curls feeling soft or defined at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend all the DevaCurl line for women who have naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gunky going on, but after my hair dries there aren&#x27;t any really stiff parts and the curl is good.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s not enough, and other times it feels like there is buildup, but my hair is pretty long, wavy, and sort of fine.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t towel dry your hair first, just shake it to get rid of excess water.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and when it was 3/4 down my back</li>
            <li> , helped me understand how to get the most from this product...would definitely recommend that, you don&#x27;t want to waste your money!</li>
            <li> The gel defines her waves like I had never seen before, it gives her these classic beach waves, but without the occasional halo of frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy about styling my kinda naturally wavy hair and have scrunched and hair sprayed for many years when I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry it straight, but frankly my hair just looked messy most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff, and if My hair gets droopy I just wet my hands and scrunch again.</li>
            <li> I have curly, fine, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair between 2C-3A/B, different curl patterns throughout.</li>
            <li> that it barely does the job or</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it is supposed to do and rinses out completely when washing my hair.</li>
            <li> but I will probably be picking up a micro fiber towel in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have coarse naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because when I flip my hair over and scrunch my hair and then try to dry it, it gets really matted after.</li>
            <li> My hair was so bad before I couldn&#x27;t wash it more than once a week, now I am able to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> thanks to these products and the extremely patient curly hair experts at Devachan Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells and that it&#x27;s not sticky like other gels when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I take the clips out, &#x27;recast&#x27; (gently scruching the dried curls that are still crystalized from the gel) and I have soft, defined, and bouncy curls until I decide to wash it again.</li>
            <li> It felt too light, but thick at the same time.</li>
            <li> I typically use another gel but wanted to try this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> No other curling gel can hold a candle to the DevaCurl defining gel; it really adds bounce without the heavy feel of an additive to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long and takes forever to air dry but looks much better when I use this gel.</li>
            <li> If I can let my medium length hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> I have super thick porous hair that tends to soak up product</li>
            <li> I have super thick 2c/3a hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying this if you have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed at all, expected more than what it gives me.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible hair- very fine, erratic waves and super frizzy since I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> It is a light weight but firm control yet not too stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair can get really frizzy but this seems to tame it.</li>
            <li> My main problem with this product is that I have to use so little</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way on straight hair.</li>
            <li> So far I like this gel and all the other deva curl products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed too heavy for my very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use very much, as I have naturally thick hair.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair anymore and get CONSTANT enquiries and compliments about my curls when in public.</li>
            <li> and I scrunch, but my hair still falls flat and doesn&#x27;t hold the curl or wave.</li>
            <li> I personally scrunch mine after it&#x27;s dry - to remove the gel cast.  </li>
            <li> Product left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> and then this gel and my hair is finally how I expected it to look after I started the Deva line back in April.</li>
            <li> I use this and macadamia nut oil daily in my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> This one tends to make my hair feel heavy and not as soft.</li>
            <li> At first, this thick, sticky gel made me think that I was going to get a lot of hold for my curls, but not really.</li>
            <li> It defines the curls without weighing them down and for the first time in my life, usually without frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with other deva products for several years.  </li>
            <li> Just use it the same as you would their other gels, or try it out.</li>
            <li> We also used the same cleansing, conditioning, application and drying process as each other, so I can&#x27;t blame it on that.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t even try to blow dry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> She gave it to me because it made her hair feel really dry.</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, bi-racial hair.</li>
            <li> * Scrutch it and let it air dry for about 15 minutes to let the curls &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it defines the curls and gives hold and the hair never looks dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li> Since I have dry hair</li>
            <li> When it dried, partially naturally and partially with a diffuser, my hair was SO FRIZZY</li>
            <li> This is one of the ONLY gels that actually allows me to air dry my hair without it ending up looking like a frizzy, unkempt mess!</li>
            <li> Normally, Gel doesn&#x27;t work too well with my hair because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only curling gel that helps define my loose curs without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> I scrunch it into my wet hair and either diffuse it with the hair dryer or wrap my hair in a t-shirt to dry (called plopping).</li>
            <li> where your hair still looks wet after it is completely dry).</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if I could get away be using less gel to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> Living in a very dry climate, I never knew what my curls were going to do on any given day.  </li>
            <li> I like other products by this brand, but this one leaves my hair crunchy not soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other salon brand products, and the bottle lasts a long time (3-4 months for me).</li>
            <li> Apply to wet hair and let dry and scrunch till you can&#x27;t no mo!</li>
            <li> Fortunately no significant amount of gel was lost, so I just transferred it to an extra container.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair and it keeps the waves from going flat.</li>
            <li> I spent my morning in the ER to be a grateful recipient of a steroid shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product brings out the curl without leaving a crunchy feel or the wet look (</li>
            <li> Basically don&#x27;t wring out your hair apply the gel to wet hair and scrunch in the gel and scrunch out the remaining water.</li>
            <li> This product did not provide the body I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I need a harder holding gel.  </li>
            <li> if you feel like reviving the curls, you can wet it a bit and</li>
            <li> This product states that it is &amp;#34;ultra defining&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t help at all with my thick natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, if your hair isn&#x27;t well-moisturized before application, it will likely make your hair feel product-y and stiff like straw.</li>
            <li> else my curls go totally limp and flat.  </li>
            <li> Then turn your head upside down, pour some DevaCurl into your hands, and &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; your hair upward, trying to touch your hair as little as possible.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand of gel now for my long thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> From this purchase I am considering getting other Devacurl products.</li>
            <li> It kept my curls curled, when other products would not.  </li>
            <li> It makes me have more defined curls, where the ultra defining gel makes my hair have the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; :(</li>
            <li> You can only use a small bit</li>
            <li> I had never heard of layering products  other than using a hair spray.  </li>
            <li> When I first put the gel in my hand, I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> This product left my thick, curly hair looking dry and poofy with little curl definition.</li>
            <li> Sooo not worth the hype</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> i recently cut it (just past shoulders) and now its too heavy for my hair-</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, thick, coarse hair and had previously used Aveda and Bb and Phyllo.  </li>
            <li> It helps hold the shape of my curls, cuts down on frizz, and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> if your curls seem a little droppy on day 2, just wet your hair a little bit with some water and use a pea size amount of gel overtop</li>
            <li> Gotta say I don&#x27;t usually use gels because they tend to dry your hair out</li>
            <li> After I wash and towel dry my just past shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy, processed hair that is totally frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, maybe just get a small bottle or sample to try before buying the big bottle!  </li>
            <li> I bought this previously at my salon, but when they stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Both of them style their hair using the Curly Girl method for waves, with slight variations to suit each of them.</li>
            <li> But no matter how little I used, my hair always came out looking hard, not soft</li>
            <li> Holds tight curls, no frizz.</li>
            <li> It does define, but it seems to do so without the look of tightly wound curls or ones that look overly coifed.</li>
            <li> The day after I apply the gel, the curl is still defined, however, I sometimes still need to spritz my hair with a little water to tighten the curls.  </li>
            <li> Its so thick and dry that you can&#x27;t even spread it over your hands, let alone your hair!</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out, had to put some serious oil on it so it wouldn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out and just made it feel gunky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Than I tried the firm hold ultra defining gel.</li>
            <li> Feels like a heavy alcohol content.</li>
            <li> I hated the feeling of having it on my hands or even touching my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After scrunching hair, curls are bouncy and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out and curls were so frizzy</li>
            <li> , you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stiff and you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> In addition, the fragrance that is in there now is not nearly as strong as it used to be (it used to almost give me a headache every time I got it out).</li>
            <li> but since it does not seem to weigh down or negatively affect my hair I would probably suggest going with the ultra.</li>
            <li> I usually use in combination with the DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam, which adds volume in addition.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveda</li>
            <li> I use Curl Quencher shampoo and conditioner, Climate Control gel (if I want a softer feeling curl) or Tress Effects if I want a crunchy curl (which I usually prefer- because my hair is truly \\&quot;ultra-defined\\&quot; with Tress Effects).</li>
            <li> I paired it with a small amount of the deva conditioner (i used it as a leave-in).</li>
            <li> It is thick, curly and just overall- DIFFICULT.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small bottle!</li>
            <li> This made my hair very stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hard or crunchy either.</li>
            <li> It hardly did anything</li>
            <li> Curl sucks and is overpriced.</li>
            <li> After putting the CK on I applied the gel; immediately it was difficult to comb my soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works well and not much is needed per use.</li>
            <li> (at least not with my non-chemistry degree eyes).</li>
            <li> routine for my porous thick sometimes frizzy spiral curls is simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; curves and spirals that are about .5-1\\&quot; thick</li>
            <li> that is how frustrated I was, since I  also got tired of having to straighten it to look decent to myself.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Another weird thing that happened is that the gel would give me a little shock when I squeezed it on my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same bad results.</li>
            <li> Either it has a bad reaction to my hair or my hair isn&#x27;t curly enough yet to get te results the curly girl method suggests.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too thick and not too thin and is Curley.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this product</li>
            <li> This is seriously life changing stuff!  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with this gel..</li>
            <li> My boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his fingers out of my hair and my mother and sisters are all clamoring for my secret!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I will go back to Quidad as this product has a horrible smell</li>
            <li> When a hairstylist recommended this brand, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL - REALLY DRY.</li>
            <li> Brings out the spiral curls without that awful crunchy, wet look.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing results.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would cause breakage.</li>
            <li> is very difficult.</li>
            <li> and I got shocked again.</li>
            <li> so he tried it and got shocked too..</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is horrible-</li>
            <li> All from using these awful hair products.  </li>
            <li> The product is horrible</li>
            <li> This is one of the WORST I have tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. No bounce!</li>
            <li> Normally, Gel doesn&#x27;t work too well with my hair because it&#x27;s so thick. This Gel works perfectly (I am African-American) and gives me a good hold when I need it to and it doesn&#x27;t clump up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this gel. It&#x27;s the only one that I&#x27;ve found that really defines my curls and keeps them in place for a few days. I&#x27;ve found that the wetter your hair is the better this gel defines the curl and holds them. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hard or crunchy either.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had wavey hair.  Sometimes curly.  I&#x27;m all thumbs when it comes to styling my hair.  So I don&#x27;t even try to blow dry it anymore.  Results aren&#x27;t worth it.  I&#x27;ve a tried so many products and diffusers in an attempt to get my hair to curl without looking frizzy.  Some things worked some times.  Found the DevaCurl line at my hairdresser&#x27;s former salon and whichever products she sold (not this one) worked OK.  Better than anything else I&#x27;d used, but still not quite right.  This gel is perfect for my hair.  It defines the curls without weighing them down and for the first time in my life, usually without frizz.  Some days are still beyond help, but most days I have good hair days now.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my frizzy hair will just never be nice and curly but this product didn&#x27;t help it in any way. When I use it, my hair is like a rat&#x27;s nest by the end of the day - completely tangled at the ends.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. It dried my hair out and just made it feel gunky. I&#x27;ve also tried it in my son&#x27;s hair (he&#x27;s biracial).</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister who has fine wavy hair. She gave it to me because it made her hair feel really dry. I&#x27;ve used it 3-4 times and it seems to be fine for my 2c wavy-Botticelli curls. Haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness and it gives me tighter, defined curls, but will probably take turns between this and my Curl Keeper.</li>
            <li> Love curls. Helps curls. Curls, Curls, Curls.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. I use the cleanser and conditioner as well. Makes my hair soft and manageable. It works with curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was recommended to me by my stylist. I scrunch it into my wet hair and either diffuse it with the hair dryer or wrap my hair in a t-shirt to dry (called plopping). It leaves my curls soft, not crunchy.</li>
            <li> This gel did wonders for my curls.  I have naturally curly hair between 2C-3A/B, different curl patterns throughout. I didn&#x27;t know how to take care of my curly hair so I straightened my hair pretty much every day for about 5 years. It&#x27;s been almost a year since I&#x27;ve straightened my hair and the Deva Curl products have helped me with my transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel, when used correctly, will give you the definition and hold you need for bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very important to use this as directed. I find that if I use this while my hair is sopping wet (directly out of the shower), and use the Deva Curl clips at the roots of my hair, I&#x27;ll get the best results.  Let your hair dry 90-95% before &amp;#34;scrunching the crunch&amp;#34; This is important! Don&#x27;t touch your hair while it&#x27;s air drying.&lt;br /&gt;This product left my hair soft and shiny and I&#x27;m able to always get 2 day curls, some days, 3rd day hair as well when I pineapple my hair overnight.  if your curls seem a little droppy on day 2, just wet your hair a little bit with some water and use a pea size amount of gel overtop and they&#x27;ll bounce right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just repurchased my second bottle in a 32 oz!!</li>
            <li> A gel light enough but also defining enough for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> From this purchase I am considering getting other Devacurl products. It works great for curly hair and I didn&#x27;t even use much of the product. I&#x27;m totally sold. If you haven&#x27;t already, check out the Curly Girl Handbook.</li>
            <li> Amazing... great for my curls</li>
            <li> I am a curly girl convert!  I use this and the shampoo/conditioner, as well as several of the homemade curly girl products from the book -- perfect hold for my hair, you just have to follow the directions and make sure you apply this to wet hair (not towel-dried)...it does make a difference on the hold.  I personally scrunch mine after it&#x27;s dry - to remove the gel cast.  I watched several videos from their website and facebook, helped me understand how to get the most from this product...would definitely recommend that, you don&#x27;t want to waste your money!</li>
            <li> Item received with lid smashed off and gel had leaked all over the package. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great gel - very strong hold but not heavy at all. Gives a lot of shine and definition to my curls. I usually use in combination with the DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam, which adds volume in addition. Really nice effect on my baby-soft curls with the two together!</li>
            <li> I have 2b/2c hair.  I am always looking for ways to get more curl yet keep the frizz down.  I got this bottle thinking it would be amazing since it&#x27;s Devacurl and I had been using the Curly Girl Method for several years.  I&#x27;m disappointed in the ingredients.  When you read the Curly Girl Handbook, there is a section talking about ingredients to stay away from.  This gel has some of those ingredients.  I do like the smell and I&#x27;ve been away from most chemical fragrances for awhile.  My main problem with this product is that I have to use so little that it barely does the job or else my curls go totally limp and flat.  For me, this would probably straighten my hair if I used it following the Curly Girl method amounts.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it until the bottle is gone but if I can find a better, more natural, product then I&#x27;ll switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy, processed hair that is totally frizz.  Using this product, it makes nice smooth waves and defined curls.  Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Holds curls in place. Have been using for two years and am still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Omg this is sex for my hair! Sorry best way to describe it lol.... Girls you need this product!</li>
            <li> I use this with Deva Curl Set It Free Moisture Lock.  I prefer the gel on days with lower humidity here in Miami.  If I use it on days with high humidity I tend to frizz up too quick.  The curls stay soft and crunch free.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product and I absolutely love it. It feels light and like you putting no product on your hair, but controls naturally curly hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural curly hair.  Good buy</li>
            <li> Disappointing results.</li>
            <li> hair did not curl well</li>
            <li> This gel goes great with the No Poo and One Condition shower combo. It smells just as good and is not hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Ok so I was skeptical about buying this because I am in LOVE with my ArcAngel. However, I decided to give this a try because I was running low on ArcAngel and wanted to give this a try. I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hair two nights ago and my hair still has curls!! I have 2C hair that loses it&#x27;s curl/wave after love second day, but this product really seems to hold my curls!!&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with Devacurl products and this gel really does the trick without leaving any halo frizz. Just beautiful, bouncy, shiny curls!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments from people who had no idea I had curly hair!  Love.</li>
            <li> Great Gel and strong hold.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this away after using it twice.  I have very temperamental hair.  It is thick, curly and just overall- DIFFICULT.  I don&#x27;t think this product is horrible- it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for my hair type. If you have hair like mine and are looking for something to hold curls and leave you frizz free, this is not for you.  Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough?  I am not sure, maybe just get a small bottle or sample to try before buying the big bottle!  That is what I should have done!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Switched from Aveda Confixor liquid gel which was way too sticky and left my curls crunchy. The devalcurl &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34; defining gel is just right with defining the curl and keeping the freeze to a minimum. I have yet to try the devalcurl light defining gel... Would say this is a must if you live in a humid climate like we have in North Carolina.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stiff and you don&#x27;t need a lot. This size bottle should last 6 or more months. I have slightly wavy hair and it keeps the waves from going flat.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my curls.  I use it apply it as the bottle suggests (in wet hair, flip head and scrunch, rescrunch when dry) and it works amazing.  My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
            <li> This has been some of the best gel I have found for my curls.</li>
            <li> i use the shampoo conditioner and spray also. I wish I had found it years ago for my curly hair. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34; as a styling/setting lotion for years and loved it.  My girlfiend told me about this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is sticky in application but when upon blowdrying, it&#x27;s not sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than my Paul Mitchell so I don&#x27;t like it b/c of the sticky hands as I apply it.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market (well, not quite) I can say this &amp; DevaCurl No-Poo are my favorites.  I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GARBAGE. Its so thick and dry that you can&#x27;t even spread it over your hands, let alone your hair! I had to keep wetting my hands in order to get a good layer over them to put into my hair. If I continue to use Deva products I will be purchasing the ArcAnGel next time. The plus is that this stuff wasn&#x27;t crunchy but that&#x27;s probably because the hold wasn&#x27;t very good. I think this depends more on hair type though, so hold may vary by person.</li>
            <li> This product makes my curls pop...go easy though hair can get crunchy if you over use</li>
            <li> The gel, no-poo shampoo and conditioner make my curly, lightweight hair very happy. (7 more words req for review? How&#x27;s this? ;&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> This gel smells good and holds my curl while drying.  I love that the ingredients are good for your hairl.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed at all, expected more than what it gives me.  It hardly did anything and I think a good mouse from a drugstore would provide more results.</li>
            <li> While I love the way the gel makes my hair look, it makes it feel like straw. Another weird thing that happened is that the gel would give me a little shock when I squeezed it on my hand. It happened with the bottle I got as a gift and the one I bought for myself.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it with other deva products for several years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> For someone like me with fine, curly hair; Diva Curl is the perfect solution for boosting the curls&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received gel I ordered at this time. I have already used product. I love it. I have gone sulfate and silicone free and my hair has done much better. I have curly, dry, bi-racial hair. I use this and macadamia nut oil daily in my wet hair. My curls are more defined and less frizzy since I started this new hair care regime. I also switched to a microfiber towel. My hair was so bad before I couldn&#x27;t wash it more than once a week, now I am able to wash every other day. Happy for the first time with my curls and not trying to flat iron it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel - leaves no residue, does not make my hair crunch, and really gives me nice tight curls.  I bought this thinking I wanted the extra hold, but I think I prefer a lighter hold for the curls I want (they used the lighter hold gel during my devacurl haircut...I now realize). However, great product, great company</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive personal care system I have ever purchased!&lt;br /&gt;I used Deva Curl Low Poo, One Conditioner and the Ultra Defining Gel in my morning shower. During the day I started to feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Three hours before my flight the following morning I got out of bed to find my face swollen and blaze red. I had a rash from head to toe!&lt;br /&gt;Allergic Contact Dermatitis! WooHoo. Lucky me!!! NO this has NEVER happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid a possible medical emergency on my 7 hour flight it was determined that my vacation should be cancelled - airfare, rental car, hotels etc.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of jetting off to vacation land I spent my morning in the ER to be a grateful recipient of a steroid shot.&lt;br /&gt;The week of vacation time was spent alternately trying to scratch off the top layer of skin and slathering on lotion to combat the itch.&lt;br /&gt;I think I can safely say that this product will never enter my home again.</li>
            <li> This worked so well with my curls....  I love it.  It kept my curls curled, when other products would not.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  It lets me enjoy my naturally curly hair without being sticky or or causing build up.</li>
            <li> Apply to wet hair and let dry and scrunch till you can&#x27;t no mo! Curls definition  2 days straight  no frizz</li>
            <li> While I love the product itself, the bottle was damaged with a hole in the bottom.  Fortunately no significant amount of gel was lost, so I just transferred it to an extra container.  Makes me hesitate to order it online again, though.</li>
            <li> Love Deva products, but unfortunately not a fan of this one. The gel made my hair super dry.</li>
            <li> This does wonders for my curls. I could type all day about how much I love Devacurl. Only downside is that since it&#x27;s such a light gel it won&#x27;t last longer than 8-10 hours. But soooooo much healthier for my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this product but I received it here from Amazon prime third party seller. Out of the box the bottle gave me and electric shock. I went to open to smell the gel as this was my first time purchase and I got shocked again. So I touched the gel and each time got an electric shock like I was touching a socket with something metal... My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it either so he tried it and got shocked too.. So I left bottle alone until the next day.. Went to use it again and squeezed some gel into my palm and the gel gave me a huge electric shock again ... I have no idea what&#x27;s wrong with this gel.. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it and never had a problem with any hair product ever...</li>
            <li> Perfect-arrived on time and very happy with product</li>
            <li> Not intended for women of color. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Product left my hair dry and brittle. Sooo not worth the hype</li>
            <li> May not need the ultra defining gel but the regular one. I have long curly hair and it holds well without me having to reapply later int he day.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I ordered 2. I have told several friends about the amazing curl you can get  even if you don&#x27;t have curly hair. It leaves your hair very soft, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. Period. Scrunch it and let curls set, shake out, amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which I leave curly.  Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel has excellent &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; without a stiff, crunchy feel.  The day after I apply the gel, the curl is still defined, however, I sometimes still need to spritz my hair with a little water to tighten the curls.  That said, this is the best product for holding my curls that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the Devacurl line!  I have very fine, wavy/curly hair. This product brings out the curl without leaving a crunchy feel or the wet look (where your hair still looks wet after it is completely dry).</li>
            <li> Like the firmer hold better.</li>
            <li> I bought this previously at my salon, but when they stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon. I have ordered twice. The price is right and the 2 day Prime shipping is ideal</li>
            <li> The best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great gel.  Gotta say I don&#x27;t usually use gels because they tend to dry your hair out but this one does not.  It seems to seal in moisture somehow and that&#x27;s even after blowdrying.  My hair can get really frizzy but this seems to tame it.</li>
            <li> Ever since Redken stopped making their Fresh Curl Refiner, this has been my go to product. It goes on very light and hold my curls for several days.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut by a curl expert, and she recommended this product to me. It does it&#x27;s job so well. My boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his fingers out of my hair and my mother and sisters are all clamoring for my secret! Will buy again, maybe in a huge package next time.</li>
            <li> I have used the Deva light defining gel and the Deva arc anGel and like the Ultra Defining Gel way better. I have fine thin curly hair and this gel seems to work the best with my hair. I would recommend trying this if you have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> My first experience with DevaCurl  was few months back when I saw a lady with beautiful curls at the car dealership and I asked her what product she was using she said she was a beautician and she used DevaCurl.  Deva curl leaves my hair bouncy and full of life!  This product keeps the frizzes away and my natural waves are bouncy and light.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> My go-to product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am still somewhat new to this product, but on the second day after washing, it usually looks the best if I use it sparingly.  Sometimes it&#x27;s not enough, and other times it feels like there is buildup, but my hair is pretty long, wavy, and sort of fine.  It&#x27;s still pretty great stuff that doesn&#x27;t get crispy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly gorgeous healthy hair that is fine textured but very thick. I used the Deva One conditioner in the shower and my hair had more tangles in it after using this product than before I got in the shower. I had to comb my hair for over 10 minutes. Than I tried the firm hold ultra defining gel. Big mistake! It smells really fruity and its overpowering.  My four pm. that day my hair was a rats nest. All from using these awful hair products.  No kidding. My hair was so tangled you would have thought I was out in a windstorm all day instead of being inside.&lt;br /&gt;Deva Curl sucks and is overpriced. There are far better products out there. I love Ouidad&#x27;s leave in conditioner and Redken 07 styling products.</li>
            <li> I love all the DevaCurl products!!! This gel has great holding power and the shampoo and conditioner have done wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely a god send. I cannot believe how much it changed my curly hair. My curls started looking more scrunchy &amp; stiff from all of my previous products and straightening my hair to amazing curly q soft curls. I have finally found my product for my hair, as all of us curly haired girls can say, we&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> Great for the frizzies that come with curly weather in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Brings out the spiral curls without that awful crunchy, wet look.  Works even in humidity.  I have color-treated, thick, coarse hair and had previously used Aveda and Bb and Phyllo.  I&#x27;ve switched to Devacurl permanently!  Great fragrance.  Not sticky.  It works for air drying, but I get better results with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like the light defining gel better. It makes me have more defined curls, where the ultra defining gel makes my hair have the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; :(</li>
            <li> Best hairgel for curly hair! Recommend the entire Devacurl line....no crunchiness/wet look. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if I could get away be using less gel to get the same effect.Creates waves but not curls in my hair unlike archangel . I will stick with archangel.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel that will define your curls without making them crunchy. I like that my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> Love these products. They make help define my curls, just love love love Devacurl! I like the way it liquifies in your hands.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair bouncy and shiny.  I first used CHS Curl Keeper which is very nice to reduce frizz and define my curls.  I have 2b/2c hair, very fine limp and I have to work to encourage some of the curls.  I can understand why others are complaining about the gel. After putting the CK on I applied the gel; immediately it was difficult to comb my soaking wet hair. You can only use a small bit and I think a moisturizer or leave in is necessary.  After it dried it was gorgeous.  We are all different so what works for one may not work for others.  The lighter gel may work better.  I am undecided about that but may mix it 50/50 to see.  Before I got these chemo curls I never knew that curly hair was work.  I had never heard of layering products  other than using a hair spray.  There is a huge learning curve to the Curly Girl method but when it works it is so worth it.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so curly, i can&#x27;t complain about it, the best you can do is( if you don&#x27;t want to define every single curl) to put some of it in your hair and then putting it in your hair starting at your hair-ends.</li>
            <li> Who has very curly hair. She liked it, but didn&#x27;t like the build-up or smell. She may use it sparingly, not every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for four months and really like it. If I can let my medium length hair dry naturally I end up with perfect shiny curls.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a hairdresser friend.  I was reluctant to use it because of the price.  I have super thick porous hair that tends to soak up product so I end up using a lot.  Most of the time I get so-so results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product in combination with the Devacurl Styling Cream.  I have found that the Styling Cream and Ultra Defining gel work super together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine for my porous thick sometimes frizzy spiral curls is simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wash with cheap shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;* Use a cheap leave in conditioner on my hair to comb out the tangles&lt;br /&gt;* Then I apply Ulta Argan oil to the ends to keep them from drying out as I have Ombre highlights in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Devacurl Ultra gel and run it thru my hair&lt;br /&gt;* I use about 15 squirts of the styling cream and work it in to my hair&lt;br /&gt;* Scrutch it and let it air dry for about 15 minutes to let the curls &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use the products together I can survive the 100% Houston humidity with style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you buy this with the Devacurl Styling cream and use this together for great results.  Besides, you can always send them back with Amazon Prime if you don&#x27;t like them.  (Shout out to Amazon Prime too!)</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  It works well.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as the product bought directly from an approved salon or Sephora.  It seems as though the consistency has been altered.</li>
            <li> I have curly, fine, thick hair and I&#x27;m always looking for the right styling product. I usually use Aveda but they&#x27;re on the expensive side so I wanted to try something new. This product has a nice light floral citrus scent, not overbearing at all. It&#x27;s a little gunky going on, but after my hair dries there aren&#x27;t any really stiff parts and the curl is good. It seems to last most of the day, too.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works well and not much is needed per use.</li>
            <li> Using this with the Loo Poo and Conditioner. Works GREAT I have fine hair, s-wave to spiral curl hair. Love, love, love this line.</li>
            <li> To start, I think that any Deva Curl product are miracle products. I have been using the line for years and my hair looks amazing each and every day thanks to these products and the extremely patient curly hair experts at Devachan Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my corkicelli curly hair grew longer than I ever thought would, now almost reaching my elbows. While I swore by Angell and Arc Angell when I had shoulder length curls, but I had to be considerably more careful with the amount gel I used as my hair grew. The longer my curls are, the looser they become and are more prone to being weighed down. This gel is the solution to that. It doesn&#x27;t add weight to my curls but adds a level of definition and hold that I used to get when my hair was shorter. So for longer curls, this is a great alternative to the usual Angell and Arc Angell, which as still amazing. Just use it the same as you would their other gels, or try it out. After No-Poo and One Condition, I blot my hair with a microfiber towel to get the excess water out, and then gently scurnch a palmful of this Gel through each section of my hair. On humid summer days, I use a little more to ensure that they stay frizz free. For that extra volume, I lift my the roots of the curls on top of my head with duckbill clips and not touch it except when they are dry. I take the clips out, &#x27;recast&#x27; (gently scruching the dried curls that are still crystalized from the gel) and I have soft, defined, and bouncy curls until I decide to wash it again. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO my sister was blessed with gorgeous wavy hair (I used to be so jealous when I was younger) and she loves LOVES this gel. The gel defines her waves like I had never seen before, it gives her these classic beach waves, but without the occasional halo of frizz. My mother, who&#x27;s curls turned into waves after she started menopause, loves her hair again after using this gel. Both of them style their hair using the Curly Girl method for waves, with slight variations to suit each of them. (My sister has longer hair, so she uses a bit of one condition in addition to no poo and more gel, whereas my mom has chin length wave and uses conditioner occassionally and less gel.) It&#x27;s a pretty big hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is a great addition to the Deva Curl family. Wavy haired girls finally found their perfect match, and those with longer curls will LOVE this gel.ions to suit each of them.

            <li> This made my hair very stiff and crunchy. I was afraid that it would cause breakage. This is definitely not what my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this is the first gel that gives me volume.  Most gels are to heavy.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It was deliveres early and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.  I use it in conjunction with other Devacurl products and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I find this really separates my curls - I mix it with a little water for a softer look - LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> The best product to give you a nice curl.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out, had to put some serious oil on it so it wouldn&#x27;t feel dry. Not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> Love love love love this product. It&#x27;s so amazing. I was originally using the light defining gel, but my hair&#x27;s grown 4+ inches in the last year, so it was time to step up the hold with the ultra. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does what it is supposed to do and rinses out completely when washing my hair. Also no alcohol, parabens, silicones etc.</li>
            <li> Deva curl is amazing! If you have frizzy, unmanageable curly hair it may not be your hair but the products you are using. My hair looks great looks just as great the second day and after sleeping on it. If your thinking about using these products do a quick google search to better understand the 3 step process. Basically don&#x27;t wring out your hair apply the gel to wet hair and scrunch in the gel and scrunch out the remaining water. I have been further scrunching with a t-shirt to get out extra moisture but I will probably be picking up a micro fiber towel in the near future. Don&#x27;t touch your hair till its dry and them scrunch again to release the get cast (just learned about that) and your curls will be soft and defined and most importantly move! The before and after pictures are actually for real and yo can do it yourself! I&#x27;m still not sure how much us a difference there is between this and the light defining gel (I&#x27;ve been using both) but since it does not seem to weigh down or negatively affect my hair I would probably suggest going with the ultra.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have horrible hair- very fine, erratic waves and super frizzy since I live in Florida.  I put this on after washing and I have nice curls and no frizz and my hair looks much thicker.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is naturally wavy, but it really kicks it up a notch with Deva in it. I love that it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff, and if My hair gets droopy I just wet my hands and scrunch again.</li>
            <li> This product left my thick, curly hair looking dry and poofy with little curl definition. I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same bad results. However, for my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair it works great, but then again I haven&#x27;t tried to many products that don&#x27;t work well with hers. We also used the same cleansing, conditioning, application and drying process as each other, so I can&#x27;t blame it on that.</li>
            <li> This product states that it is &amp;#34;ultra defining&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t help at all with my thick natural curly hair.  It didn&#x27;t feel or look like I put anything on it at all.</li>
            <li> this defining gel is great it leaves my hair shiney and curly without putting more oil on my hair and i like that.</li>
            <li> The Ultra Defining Gel works much better than the Light sample I received. If you put too much of the UD gel in, your hair will be crunchy, so a dime to a quarter sized amount is perfect. I should have this bottle for a while. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not my fave... I like other products by this brand, but this one leaves my hair crunchy not soft. I have coarse naturally curly hair and this makes it feel crackly and plastic like. Aveda makes a much better (but more $) product. I love this brands curl enhance spray - but not the gel.</li>
            <li> Started using this product along with the conditioner. My curls have never looked so great!</li>
            <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t make my curls crunchy, has a yummy scent to it, and helps my curls hold their shape all day. Its way better than the AnGel in my opinion. A lot goes a pretty long way, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for my naturally curly (botticelli), long, thick hair that I have found.  Prior to discovering the Deva product line, I was using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl.  It defined my curls as well as Deva Ultra Defining Gel, but it was super crunchy, and I couldn&#x27;t make my hair look good the next day without washing it.  I then ordered the Deva travel kit which came with the Deva Light Defining Gel.  I liked it, but the hold wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough.  So I ordered the Deva Ultra Defining Gel.  Both Deva Gels do not make my hair crunchy.  And what is really great about them is I can spray my hair with boiled water with lavender essential oil the next day and the curls come back to life without having to wash my hair and reapply the gel.  Also, I like the scent of the Deva products a lot better than the Redken Curvaceous scent.</li>
            <li> The product is horrible i have culy hair and am a Quidad user.  I will go back to Quidad as this product has a horrible smell</li>
            <li> This product did not provide the body I expected.  I prefer Ouidad&#x27;s Climate Control.</li>
            <li> This product is a great addition to  a Deva collection. It is a light weight but firm control yet not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Another great Deva product. Holds tight curls, no frizz.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I like Deva Curl Light Defining Gel Better.  This one tends to make my hair feel heavy and not as soft.</li>
            <li> REVIEW UPDATE: It was suggested that I try this gel on soaking wet hair and I must say that made a huge difference!  I put a full palm fulls in while still in the shower, wrapped my head in a microfiber towel for about 15 minutes and then gently finger combed my hair and added a little more gel where needed. I now have clumpy ringlets which is what I like.  I upped the rating to 4 stars.  This may be my go to gel now :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside &#x3D; I found this gel to be just OK - it&#x27;s holding power wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had hoped for.  I have super thick 2c/3a hair and I need a harder holding gel.  I think it would work better for someone with wavy hair.  Upside &#x3D; It smells divine.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Really holds the curls without being heavy or leaving a residue.</li>
            <li> Light weight hold, no build up.</li>
            <li> This product works well with the Deva Styling cream!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product as one of the best to keep the curl in perms. I used Tigi Curl Rocks before and thought that was a great product but decided to try this. It did not hold the curl very well at all. I went back to Curl Rocks and love it.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly hair....\\&quot;S\\&quot; curves and spirals that are about .5-1\\&quot; thick and if I don&#x27;t put anything in it, it turns into a \\&quot;fro\\&quot; because my curls are not defined on their own. I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, from Pantene to TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock which kind of work, to products that don&#x27;t define my curls at all such as \\&quot;Frizz-ease\\&quot;. This is one of the WORST I have tried. When I first put the gel in my hand, I knew something was wrong. It felt too light, but thick at the same time. Despite my first instincts. i put it in my hair using the trusted \\&quot;Ouidad Rake &amp; Shake\\&quot; technique because I have already learned that scrunching isn&#x27;t enough for me. When it dried, partially naturally and partially with a diffuser, my hair was SO FRIZZY and it felt AWFUL - REALLY DRY. I really thought that the gel must have alcohol in it...I don&#x27;t see any in the ingredients list (at least not with my non-chemistry degree eyes). However, it really feels to me like it has alcohol in it, that&#x27;s the best way I can describe how it feels. It feels like it removes the moisture from my hair, and this was after putting in Deva Curl&#x27;s leave in moisturizer! I get compliments almost daily on my hair when I use Ouidad products. So, it&#x27;s back to my faithful Ouidad products! I use Curl Quencher shampoo and conditioner, Climate Control gel (if I want a softer feeling curl) or Tress Effects if I want a crunchy curl (which I usually prefer- because my hair is truly \\&quot;ultra-defined\\&quot; with Tress Effects). Nice try Deva Curl, but you just don&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it is supposed to do, keeps my hair in place, wavy and elegant. Love using it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy about styling my kinda naturally wavy hair and have scrunched and hair sprayed for many years when I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry it straight, but frankly my hair just looked messy most of the time.  A friend who is a stylist always has beautifully defined SOFT curly hair, and I asked her so many times, &amp;#34;Do you curl your hair?&amp;#34;  She just said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; almost as many times but finally spilled her secret : Deva!  I bought it a couple of months ago and have never looked back.  I never blow dry my hair anymore and get CONSTANT enquiries and compliments about my curls when in public. Read the reviews about how to use it or look it up on You Tube to get the most bang for your buck, because if you&#x27;re gonna towel dry your hair, you may as well just save your money  This is seriously life changing stuff!  Just find our how to use it correctly, and you&#x27;ll thank your lucky stars that you found this product.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people, I should be paid!  But really, I&#x27;m just happy to give people some hope!  I just used the no-poo and conditioner for the first time today &amp; my results were even better, but if you can&#x27;t afford it, just try the Gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I have very thick and curly hair and Devacurl shapes my curls beautifully and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite gel I&#x27;ve ever used! It smells like grapes which I don&#x27;t normally like but this is a pleasant grape smell. It has a strong hold to it but doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy at all. Love using this with the no poo and one condition from Deva Curl!</li>
            <li> I have really unruly curly hair, and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that works really well in controlling frizz and defining curls. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other salon brand products, and the bottle lasts a long time (3-4 months for me). I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Devacurl products are one of my favorites. I have naturally curly hair and finding products to help me control my hair is very difficult. I like this gel because it is never stiff or sticky and still allows my hair to move! It does define, but it seems to do so without the look of tightly wound curls or ones that look overly coifed. So, what I end up with is soft curls that are manageable! HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this gel!! No need to use hair spray when using this item!!! I love it I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small bottle! Luckily I only have my hair curly for summer in the winter it&#x27;s straight! :)</li>
            <li> It helps hold the shape of my curls, cuts down on frizz, and doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Devacurl has really improved the ingredients in this gel! It used to have several really harmful ingredients, but they have done away with all but the synthetic fragrance, so I&#x27;m much happier with it. In addition, the fragrance that is in there now is not nearly as strong as it used to be (it used to almost give me a headache every time I got it out). As far as how the gel works, it still works great, just like it did before. You have to use a LOT of this (a whole palmful) for each use or it won&#x27;t have the good effects it&#x27;s supposed to, so the bottle can be emptied pretty quickly, and that hasn&#x27;t changed either, but as long as your hair is well-moisturized or you use a leave-in conditioner first, it makes nicely-formed curls that are soft once it dries and you scrunch all the curls out. If you don&#x27;t use enough gel, you&#x27;ll likely have frizz and stringy, poorly-formed curls. Also, if your hair isn&#x27;t well-moisturized before application, it will likely make your hair feel product-y and stiff like straw.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too thick and not too thin and is Curley.  I use this product after I wash with a No Poo product.  After I wash and towel dry my just past shoulder length hair I scrunch in a nice size dollop of this product.  Once my hair completely finishes drying my curls are nice a defined and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have FINALLY found the Deva product that works for me!  I have tried Angell, ArcAngell, the mousse, the Set it Free, the Mister Right and the Care line. Everything seemed too heavy for my very fine, thin hair.  I have been waiting forever for my local retailer to get this product.  I used No Poo, One Condition, B&#x27;leave in and then this gel and my hair is finally how I expected it to look after I started the Deva line back in April. It is soft, full and never crunchy and looks great 2nd and ever 3rd day! Loving it!</li>
            <li> Feels like a heavy alcohol content. Doesn&#x27;t leave my curls feeling soft or defined at all. Very disappointed. I was expecting a better product from Devacurl.</li>
            <li> I never believed that products really made a difference - until I found Deva Curl - now I&#x27;m a raving fan.  My hair looks healthy and responds so well.  Living in a very dry climate, I never knew what my curls were going to do on any given day.  With DevaCurl, my curls are well defined and never frizzy regardless of he weather.  Love these products!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I will use!</li>
            <li> At first, this thick, sticky gel made me think that I was going to get a lot of hold for my curls, but not really. I have to use a lof of gel to get more hold.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My curls have never looked, or felt better.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was really expecting more of this product. Devacurl has constantly been said to be the best curly hair product but I was just disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel seemed to make my hair hard and kind of crunchy. I didn&#x27;t use very much, as I have naturally thick hair. But no matter how little I used, my hair always came out looking hard, not soft like I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is really, really sticky gel. I hated the feeling of having it on my hands or even touching my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this gel is better for other hair types, but for my hair, it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li> So far I like this gel and all the other deva curl products I&#x27;ve tried. I need to experiment more with how much to use but my curls look good and have stayed frizz free with using this. My hair is thick and long and takes forever to air dry but looks much better when I use this gel.</li>
            <li> This is one of the ONLY gels that actually allows me to air dry my hair without it ending up looking like a frizzy, unkempt mess! I recommend all the DevaCurl line for women who have naturally curly/wavy hair. To get the best results, put it on after you&#x27;ve showered. Don&#x27;t towel dry your hair first, just shake it to get rid of excess water. Then turn your head upside down, pour some DevaCurl into your hands, and &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; your hair upward, trying to touch your hair as little as possible. Flip your hair back over and use a microfiber towel (something that won&#x27;t &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; the curls) to blot out some more dampness. Then air dry! :-) It comes out very pretty.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Harmon&#x27;s until they stopped carrying the line. Since then, I was paying a fortune for it at Ulta. I am so happy that it is available at amazon at a slight discount.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat wavy/frizzy hair.  I tried the ultra-defining gel with the no-poo and conditioner to see if my hair might curl rather than just go all over the place.  These products are awesome!  It took a few tries for me to figure out the best way to scrunch/diffuse my hair but my hair looks and feels great.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy and I love the smell of the devacurl products.</li>
            <li> Like this better then the lighter gel if you want defined curls and doesn&#x27;t dry wet. Use shampoo/conditioner with gel for best results.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance. It goes on without a sticky feeling. After scrunching hair, curls are bouncy and fluffy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It seems as if I didn&#x27;t put any gel in it at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells and that it&#x27;s not sticky like other gels when I apply it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because when I flip my hair over and scrunch my hair and then try to dry it, it gets really matted after. Either it has a bad reaction to my hair or my hair isn&#x27;t curly enough yet to get te results the curly girl method suggests. However, it does work if I just apply to my hair without flipping it over and scrunching. It does define my curls and gives my hair life all day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff ... not sticky or too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin AND fine and it brings out the curl without flattening, greasing or drying.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> It was ok, but pricing is to high!</li>
            <li> Love this line, but this is the first gel in MANY that never fail to give me full, bouncy, gorgeous curls without feeling sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it curls my hair wonderfully without leaving that hard feel, curls feel soft. Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out and curls were so frizzy</li>
            <li> Perfect for not only my curly girl but also me and my straight hair.  Love the smell, love the product.  A little bit goes a long way on straight hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my niece, she loved it so much I decided to try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only curling gel that helps define my loose curs without weighing them down. My hair dresser taught me how to use it, super easy and cuts down on frizz which is a huge issue in Florida where I reside.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s also a vegan product and I feel great knowing I&#x27;m supporting a company that doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li> still  like it  for my hair .</li>
            <li> No other curling gel can hold a candle to the DevaCurl defining gel; it really adds bounce without the heavy feel of an additive to the hair.  I get much better curls with this than any other gel.</li>
            <li> Great product to make defined curls!</li>
            <li> Love deva curl. This product works wonderfully if you use the system</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  It seems like I have to use a large volume for my relatively short hair, but maybe that&#x27;s how it is supposed to be.  :)  Will be trying many other products in the DevaCurl line, so I&#x27;ll update as I try those to give more of a comparison between products.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural curly hair</li>
            <li> My favorite gel.  When a hairstylist recommended this brand, I was skeptical.  But, it&#x27;s fantastic!  I only use this brand of gel now for my long thick curly hair.  It&#x27;s never sticky or hair, it&#x27;s light weight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls and it smells nice.  I also like the Mister Right spray &amp; the conditioner.  You can buy it in stores like Target now, but it&#x27;s cheaper thru amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have 2b (wavy curly) hair that is somewhat fine. I typically use another gel but wanted to try this because of all the positive reviews. I find that the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for my not-very-curly hair. I do use a microfiber towel and I scrunch, but my hair still falls flat and doesn&#x27;t hold the curl or wave. With the product I&#x27;m used to using, Granier Fructis Curl Shaping Gel, I get much better results in terms of definition, and it&#x27;s a good deal cheaper.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. So I can&#x27;t say much</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product for me after I read some reviews on it which they turned out to be very helpful!!  I have struggled with my unruly, dry, fine, frizzy hair for almost 40 years, since I was a teen ager. I have tried so many products but none of them worked like this one...... I was on the verge to shave my head, that is how frustrated I was, since I  also got tired of having to straighten it to look decent to myself.  This product is amazing!! it defines the curls and gives hold and the hair never looks dry or frizzy. Since I have dry hair I do not like to wash it often and after a couple days, if you feel like reviving the curls, you can wet it a bit and it looks great again! Hope this helps someone like me :-)  Thanks so much for whoever came up with this formula!!</li>
            <li> I liked this better when i had longer hair- i recently cut it (just past shoulders) and now its too heavy for my hair- i switched back to the light defining gel.  I have fine, wavy hair and when it was 3/4 down my back the ultra gel made perfect curls with no frizz! I paired it with a small amount of the deva conditioner (i used it as a leave-in).</li>
