            <li>Stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This stuff is still made in the US, is even more affordable than 4711, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>DELIGHTFUL FRAGERANCE LIGHT AND PLEASANT</li>
            <li>The name refers to the fabled Fountain of Youth which was said to be located in Florida as well as the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; nature of the scent.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on Florida Water because of the great reviews, and I am thrilled that i did so.  </li>
            <li>and supposedly it brings good luck too...</li>
            <li>It also makes a good perfume.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I got this product after hearing so many great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Very glad it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, the bottle arrived in good condition with no leaks &amp; it works well for what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect and very reasonably priced here.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect remenady for a hot day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s a better value, I purchased 3 and still it was cheaper!</li>
            <li>This smell is perfect in a hot tub</li>
            <li>It does not make you smell like you are wearing perfume or cologne, it just makes you smell nice, in a way that is a bit undefinable.</li>
            <li>Nice aroma</li>
            <li>Its really nice smelling and isn&#x27;t over powering but noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent</li>
            <li>This is nice too though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice stuff to use.</li>
            <li>I like my alcohol based aftershaves fine, but this would not leave my face feeling good after a shave, as it contains no moisturizers or skin conditioners of any type: just alcohol, water, and fragrence.</li>
            <li>In the 1880s and 1890s Murray &amp; Lanman Florida Water was advertised as &amp;#34;The Richest of all Perfumes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The most Popular Perfume in the World&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light and will not ever overpower...very good.</li>
            <li>Reminds me a bit of bubble gum and musk huhu very sweet and nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Always promoted as a unisex scent, Florida Water can be used as a body splash, aftershave, skin toner, linen sprinkle, and so much more.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling, soothing, refreshing properties of Florida Water are valuable in many applications.</li>
            <li>Refreshing bay rum spice that lasts longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li>I love Florida water by Murray and Lanman</li>
            <li>I have gotten many complements and people ask me all the time what I have on.</li>
            <li>Ladies, don&#x27;t deprive yourself of this delightful scent just because it&#x27;s traditionally considered a men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s mostly just scented alcohol...</li>
            <li>Florida Water is more like Florida Swamp Water...or stagnated pond water or sewer water.</li>
            <li>one is okay, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li>what more can you want.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than some $50+</li>
            <li>Authentic Florida Water.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li>I like the Peruvian version better.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>You get a lot more than what you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li>It must be in part to the nice, light mixture of citrus and floral scents.</li>
            <li>Some people can tell better than others or are more into it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok since I don&#x27;t bother with women&#x27;s perfumes to begin with.</li>
            <li>I got the Murray and Lanman 7 1/2 ounce bottle of this stuff, and I LOVE that it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>which is better for me.  </li>
            <li>Just splash on some more.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, not heavy, Scent fades after an hour or so - great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without the familiar smell of Florida water, and of its many many uses!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light, refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>sure to buy the original, Murray &amp; Lanman&#x27;s Florida Water.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>I liked this &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; scent very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a refreshing body splash with that sweet citrus, yet manly smell.</li>
            <li>As for the Florida water itself, it is a nice product to splash on when it is hot or you want to freshen up a bit.</li>
            <li>Also nice to splash on your face - neck on hot days.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be in great use among the younger generations, so you can have a unique fragrance for pennies!</li>
            <li>Nice fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>I myself am using it as aftershave and have loved it so far!  </li>
            <li>Light fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a great facial astringent.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean scent in a cute bottle</li>
            <li>This stuff has a wonderful citrus/clove smell and is subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great to keep in an ice chest and those hot afternoons are more tolerable because we dip in and rinse a towel through this and get instant relief.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if the tradition of being lucky is true, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>I added some witch hazel and menthol to make it into a nice aftershave - I&#x27;ve heard many use this for ceremonial uses as well.</li>
            <li>As a GREAT old fashioned \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to Florida Water by my Madrina in (Espiritismo Cruzado)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good deal of cologne in the bottle for the price you pay, so I expect to be able to use it in my rituals for a long time before I have to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>Its very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>(I love the smell of lime), I add key lime essential oil (found at ebay or amazon for $4) to the bottle and give it a real good shake.</li>
            <li>If I could only choose one, I do like the 4711 even better, but this is still a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>Because Florida water is so inexpensive, and the Orange-Lavender-Clove combo is so universally pleasant, people use this for all sorts of stuff (scenting baths, scenting floors, even religious rituals), but one use</li>
            <li>Not as obtrusive or long-lasting as perfume or cologne, Florida Water is a light, refreshing tonic suitable for daily</li>
            <li>A unique historical scent with a fascinating history.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The spicy-flowery notes of Florida Water are complemented by sweet orange, lavender, and clove.</li>
            <li>Some use Florida Water to refresh their heads, to cleanse their environment, and to cool the \\&quot;atmosphere\\&quot; in their homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ridiculously cheap, $2 gets you a lifttime supply in the massive 7.5 oz bottle, and trust me it&#x27;ll be the most important weapon in your cologne collection!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, clean, &amp; unique.</li>
            <li>Its clean, fresh and full of citrus spice.</li>
            <li>In fact, if anything, it might fade just a tad too quickly for some.  </li>
            <li>My favorite use is to layer Florida Water with another scent to create something new.</li>
            <li>I passed along this new bottle hoping a friend would like it more than I did.</li>
            <li>It was first introduced for sale in 1808, an American-made version of Eau de Cologne (aka Cologne Water) originally from Cologne, Germany (K&amp;ouml;ln).</li>
            <li>The scent is different but nice.</li>
            <li>Not for everyone but worth a shot1</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it as an astringent toner, and it does make your face feel fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li>Smells more of natural botanicals.</li>
            <li>Next time I will order the Peruvian kind.</li>
            <li>I bought it for magical pursuits, mainly to clear negativity from myself and my environment.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>You want a nice feeling and a lasting feeling and it&#x27;s just not here</li>
            <li>I have always liked this fragrance, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>(I prefer the scent of 4711 to pretty much everything actually), but this is so pleasant and inexpensive</li>
            <li>/&gt;Florida water has a very pleasing citrus scent that is VERY distinct and always makes me think of a Misa, or of spending time with my muertos at my boveda.</li>
            <li>second means of using this product is by mixing it with iced water and dipping a clean rag in and wiping the neck and body for a refreshing cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;When splashed on as an aftershave it cools the skin, tonifys, and leaves your freshly shaved face feeling brisk, clean, and ready to face the day..</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m mixing it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and ships right to your house...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and classy, and adds a cheerful, positive air to your morning.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean and lively w/o being cloying.</li>
            <li>Florida Water lasts for a long time if used just as a toilette water, or can go more quickly if used around the home.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with a particular scent used in a meditation group and although this is from same supplier, this has much more citrus</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>where the pain is and it dries hot which makes the heat help the pain.</li>
            <li>This is the best kept fragrance secret ever!  </li>
            <li>and it always brings out the musk and the deep tones so much better.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of someone from my childhood, but I can&#x27;t place exactly who...</li>
            <li>I used to pay for a smaller bottle and spend more money.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like the scent of 4711 better than this</li>
            <li>When it comes to using it as an aftershave, which is something of a more recent practice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you have a drug store close then you might want to check that out first.</li>
            <li>Its a refreshing and romantic scent that makes me think of by-gone days in the sweltering hot south.  </li>
            <li>And, after doing some research, it&#x27;s also used in many religious ceremonies.</li>
            <li>I use this Florida Water during our hot Louisiana summers while playing golf.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to just about every perfume out there- even the super high priced ones.  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell.... slightly spicy and sweet at the same time.....</li>
            <li>Other people (aleyos) comment all the time on how nice I smell when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My oldest son loved it so much he uses it as his cologne everyday.  </li>
            <li>far as I&#x27;ve read and \\&quot;researched\\&quot;, it may well be the most old-school of \\&quot;old school\\&quot; aftershaves.</li>
            <li>like this cologne because of its clean and citric scent that reminds me of the first real barbershop my dad took me when I was 6 years old.</li>
            <li>Love the smell but it does not stay with you long.  </li>
            <li>Cool stuff, old stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also put a little in a hot salt bath soak to give it a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as an aftershave several times and the problem with it I faced is that: it dries up very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and refreshing, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>So, the name of the cologne is certainly fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large quantities of Florida Water were used by barbershops as cologne and aftershave.</li>
            <li>My Dad was very old school Greek and Florida Water was one of his favorite scents.</li>
            <li>as a body splash; particularly during the hot summer months in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great, is refreshing, and a little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth picking up if you are an old school shaver, I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll like it or find much use for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the early advertising itself is worth a visit to their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is very neutral but not soapy.</li>
            <li>As an all purpose spiritual cleansing liquid for everything from your b&amp;oacute;veda espiritual , candles, mixed with Holy water, psychic defence, washing your collares espiritual, spiritual cleansing baths, and many more uses than you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don;t know that it&#x27;s had any real effect on my complexion, though...</li>
            <li>product to me was very medicinal smelling</li>
            <li>and I really just didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>but smell is very subjective.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cost much moola-blah.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li>Then again, this product really isn&#x27;t marketed as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li>At the price, you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>This is really a value of a dollar guys.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something lighter, but it definitely has a more &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s around 200 years old if everything dates right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and does not stick around too long.  </li>
            <li>We also use it at the course when we host other clubs and everyone really enjoys the refreshing, cooling effects it gives.  </li>
            <li>other colognes of the era, Florida Water was valued for its refreshing and tonic nature as well as its scent, and could be used as a skin toner or as what we would now call a &amp;#34;body splash&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>i splashed some on before my workout... and people who i normally see in the gym who barely speak where smiling and having full on conversations...</li>
            <li>I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.</li>
            <li>Now, I get a bottle that is more than triple the size for less money from Amazon.</li>
            <li>it has such an apealing fragrance its mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>many years ago and use this almost daily in the spiritual sense.</li>
            <li>This is not a good smelling Florida water, the container is made of plastic and the aroma is not as fragrant as genuine Florida water, if you want real Florida water, try the genuine glass-bottled LiuShen Florida water and you will not consider buying this type of \\&quot;Florida water\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was love at first smell between me and 4711, and I was curious what an American take on the scent would be like.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this stuff....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, it smells a little wierd, but it does work.</li>
            <li>And its a little spooky since some people use it for magical rituals.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is such a relief on a hot day!  </li>
            <li>Real old school barbershop smell.</li>
            <li>The colorful label hearkens back to its beginnings; in fact, the label is little-changed from its earliest days.</li>
            <li>It has some really nice, complex notes to it.</li>
            <li>Eau De Toilette Spray 3 oz]] and have never gone out without getting at least some kind of compliment on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more alcohol heavy florida waters that are crisper as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I practice magic, and I do many bathing rituals to rid myself of unwanted negativity and to cleanse myself of lingering residual energy that others might have left behind on my person.</li>
            <li>I like it on hot days to cool myself down.  </li>
            <li>He got &#x27;hooked&#x27; on this back when he used to go to a real barbershop... and we used to be able to get it at Walgreen&#x27;s or any other drugstore.</li>
            <li>you can find this from a real store you can avoid the shipping charges and still get it dirt cheap, but if you can&#x27;t then it&#x27;s still worth paying a little extra for.  </li>
            <li>For starters, I live and play in Florida and just for kicks, I bought this as a novelty item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Certainly don&#x27;t live within the known distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>In particular I like a combination of Florida Water and Old Spice or Florida Water and my Pinaud Clubman Vanilla aftershave.</li>
            <li>Used alone this stuff is not very long lived (something generally true of splash on cologne), and unlike 4711 it is possible to over-apply this, so I don&#x27;t use Florida Water as a stand alone all-day scent.</li>

            <li>I fully expected to have to order this stuff online, but it seems like it&#x27;s an item that&#x27;s easily obtainable at your local drugstore.</li>

            <li>Also because this is a relatively old formula, it could conceivably work for either a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t think because someone else offers &amp;#34;multi pack&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but the smell is too masculine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too feminine or masculine.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to look far to find it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically the same thing but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not only do the living love this scent - the Dead do as well.</li>
            <li>Interesting scent - sweet/citrus/floral with a spice dry down (cloves and something I can&#x27;t quite place).</li>
            <li>Its simple, but classic, and it works: Orange Blossom, Lavender, and Clove.</li>
            <li>I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents.</li>
            <li>But as an hour or two scent (like say if I&#x27;m going to shower and then sleep), as a layer, or various odd uses, I think pretty much everyone should keep a bottle of Florida Water in the house.combination of Florida Water and Old Spice or Florida Water and my Pinaud Clubman Vanilla aftershave.</li>
            <li>It has a long tradition in various folk applications, from cooling aching feet and rubbing down aching muscles, to adding to bathing water, and to sprinkling about the home for a refreshing, \\&quot;just-cleaned,\\&quot; spiritually-elevated feeling.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves my face smooth after shaving, though a little bit dryer than I would like.  </li>
            <li>But as an hour or two scent (like say if I&#x27;m going to shower and then sleep), as a layer, or various odd uses, I think pretty much everyone should keep a bottle of Florida Water in the house.</li>
            <li>It is a cologne, but the fragrance does not last long, however it picks me up after my shower ;-)</li>
            <li>The scent is much stronger than I expected it to be and a bit spicy for me.</li>
            <li>It just brings me nice, but vague memories.</li>
            <li>I could of told you the first few days but sort-of forgot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, complex scent with citrus high notes and a slight spicy undertone.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived new and in expected condition.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This item is sometimes hard to find at the local stores where I live in North Carolina, but through Helathtex Dist I found it easier to obtain in the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This bottle is usually stocked with colognes and lotions from Mexico in the isle you probably skip because of the many unknown foreign brands with Spanish on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had plenty of good and bad luck without it so don&#x27;t rely too heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This stuff is still made in the US, is even more affordable than 4711, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> DELIGHTFUL FRAGERANCE LIGHT AND PLEASANT</li>
            <li> The name refers to the fabled Fountain of Youth which was said to be located in Florida as well as the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; nature of the scent.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance on Florida Water because of the great reviews, and I am thrilled that i did so.  </li>
            <li> and supposedly it brings good luck too...</li>
            <li> It also makes a good perfume.  </li>
            <li> Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I got this product after hearing so many great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Very glad it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, the bottle arrived in good condition with no leaks &amp; it works well for what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect and very reasonably priced here.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect remenady for a hot day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s a better value, I purchased 3 and still it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> This smell is perfect in a hot tub</li>
            <li> It does not make you smell like you are wearing perfume or cologne, it just makes you smell nice, in a way that is a bit undefinable.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma</li>
            <li> Its really nice smelling and isn&#x27;t over powering but noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent</li>
            <li> This is nice too though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice stuff to use.</li>
            <li> I like my alcohol based aftershaves fine, but this would not leave my face feeling good after a shave, as it contains no moisturizers or skin conditioners of any type: just alcohol, water, and fragrence.</li>
            <li> In the 1880s and 1890s Murray &amp; Lanman Florida Water was advertised as &amp;#34;The Richest of all Perfumes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The most Popular Perfume in the World&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light and will not ever overpower...very good.</li>
            <li> Reminds me a bit of bubble gum and musk huhu very sweet and nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Always promoted as a unisex scent, Florida Water can be used as a body splash, aftershave, skin toner, linen sprinkle, and so much more.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling, soothing, refreshing properties of Florida Water are valuable in many applications.</li>
            <li> Refreshing bay rum spice that lasts longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li> I love Florida water by Murray and Lanman</li>
            <li> I have gotten many complements and people ask me all the time what I have on.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t deprive yourself of this delightful scent just because it&#x27;s traditionally considered a men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s mostly just scented alcohol...</li>
            <li> Florida Water is more like Florida Swamp Water...or stagnated pond water or sewer water.</li>
            <li> one is okay, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> what more can you want.  </li>
            <li> Smells better than some $50+</li>
            <li> Authentic Florida Water.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li> I like the Peruvian version better.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> You get a lot more than what you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li> It must be in part to the nice, light mixture of citrus and floral scents.</li>
            <li> Some people can tell better than others or are more into it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok since I don&#x27;t bother with women&#x27;s perfumes to begin with.</li>
            <li> I got the Murray and Lanman 7 1/2 ounce bottle of this stuff, and I LOVE that it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> which is better for me.  </li>
            <li> Just splash on some more.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, not heavy, Scent fades after an hour or so - great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without the familiar smell of Florida water, and of its many many uses!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A light, refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li> sure to buy the original, Murray &amp; Lanman&#x27;s Florida Water.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> I liked this &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; scent very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a refreshing body splash with that sweet citrus, yet manly smell.</li>
            <li> As for the Florida water itself, it is a nice product to splash on when it is hot or you want to freshen up a bit.</li>
            <li> Also nice to splash on your face - neck on hot days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be in great use among the younger generations, so you can have a unique fragrance for pennies!</li>
            <li> Nice fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I myself am using it as aftershave and have loved it so far!  </li>
            <li> Light fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> It also makes a great facial astringent.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent in a cute bottle</li>
            <li> This stuff has a wonderful citrus/clove smell and is subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in an ice chest and those hot afternoons are more tolerable because we dip in and rinse a towel through this and get instant relief.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if the tradition of being lucky is true, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I added some witch hazel and menthol to make it into a nice aftershave - I&#x27;ve heard many use this for ceremonial uses as well.</li>
            <li> As a GREAT old fashioned \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to Florida Water by my Madrina in (Espiritismo Cruzado)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good deal of cologne in the bottle for the price you pay, so I expect to be able to use it in my rituals for a long time before I have to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Its very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> (I love the smell of lime), I add key lime essential oil (found at ebay or amazon for $4) to the bottle and give it a real good shake.</li>
            <li> If I could only choose one, I do like the 4711 even better, but this is still a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> Because Florida water is so inexpensive, and the Orange-Lavender-Clove combo is so universally pleasant, people use this for all sorts of stuff (scenting baths, scenting floors, even religious rituals), but one use</li>
            <li> Not as obtrusive or long-lasting as perfume or cologne, Florida Water is a light, refreshing tonic suitable for daily</li>
            <li> A unique historical scent with a fascinating history.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The spicy-flowery notes of Florida Water are complemented by sweet orange, lavender, and clove.</li>
            <li> Some use Florida Water to refresh their heads, to cleanse their environment, and to cool the \\&quot;atmosphere\\&quot; in their homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ridiculously cheap, $2 gets you a lifttime supply in the massive 7.5 oz bottle, and trust me it&#x27;ll be the most important weapon in your cologne collection!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, clean, &amp; unique.</li>
            <li> Its clean, fresh and full of citrus spice.</li>
            <li> In fact, if anything, it might fade just a tad too quickly for some.  </li>
            <li> My favorite use is to layer Florida Water with another scent to create something new.</li>
            <li> I passed along this new bottle hoping a friend would like it more than I did.</li>
            <li> It was first introduced for sale in 1808, an American-made version of Eau de Cologne (aka Cologne Water) originally from Cologne, Germany (K&amp;ouml;ln).</li>
            <li> The scent is different but nice.</li>
            <li> Not for everyone but worth a shot1</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it as an astringent toner, and it does make your face feel fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> Smells more of natural botanicals.</li>
            <li> Next time I will order the Peruvian kind.</li>
            <li> I bought it for magical pursuits, mainly to clear negativity from myself and my environment.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> You want a nice feeling and a lasting feeling and it&#x27;s just not here</li>
            <li> I have always liked this fragrance, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> (I prefer the scent of 4711 to pretty much everything actually), but this is so pleasant and inexpensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Florida water has a very pleasing citrus scent that is VERY distinct and always makes me think of a Misa, or of spending time with my muertos at my boveda.</li>
            <li> second means of using this product is by mixing it with iced water and dipping a clean rag in and wiping the neck and body for a refreshing cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;When splashed on as an aftershave it cools the skin, tonifys, and leaves your freshly shaved face feeling brisk, clean, and ready to face the day..</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m mixing it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and ships right to your house...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and classy, and adds a cheerful, positive air to your morning.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean and lively w/o being cloying.</li>
            <li> Florida Water lasts for a long time if used just as a toilette water, or can go more quickly if used around the home.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with a particular scent used in a meditation group and although this is from same supplier, this has much more citrus</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> where the pain is and it dries hot which makes the heat help the pain.</li>
            <li> This is the best kept fragrance secret ever!  </li>
            <li> and it always brings out the musk and the deep tones so much better.  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of someone from my childhood, but I can&#x27;t place exactly who...</li>
            <li> I used to pay for a smaller bottle and spend more money.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the scent of 4711 better than this</li>
            <li> When it comes to using it as an aftershave, which is something of a more recent practice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you have a drug store close then you might want to check that out first.</li>
            <li> Its a refreshing and romantic scent that makes me think of by-gone days in the sweltering hot south.  </li>
            <li> And, after doing some research, it&#x27;s also used in many religious ceremonies.</li>
            <li> I use this Florida Water during our hot Louisiana summers while playing golf.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to just about every perfume out there- even the super high priced ones.  </li>
            <li> Very nice smell.... slightly spicy and sweet at the same time.....</li>
            <li> Other people (aleyos) comment all the time on how nice I smell when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My oldest son loved it so much he uses it as his cologne everyday.  </li>
            <li> far as I&#x27;ve read and \\&quot;researched\\&quot;, it may well be the most old-school of \\&quot;old school\\&quot; aftershaves.</li>
            <li> like this cologne because of its clean and citric scent that reminds me of the first real barbershop my dad took me when I was 6 years old.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it does not stay with you long.  </li>
            <li> Cool stuff, old stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also put a little in a hot salt bath soak to give it a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as an aftershave several times and the problem with it I faced is that: it dries up very, very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and refreshing, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> So, the name of the cologne is certainly fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large quantities of Florida Water were used by barbershops as cologne and aftershave.</li>
            <li> My Dad was very old school Greek and Florida Water was one of his favorite scents.</li>
            <li> as a body splash; particularly during the hot summer months in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great, is refreshing, and a little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth picking up if you are an old school shaver, I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll like it or find much use for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the early advertising itself is worth a visit to their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is very neutral but not soapy.</li>
            <li> As an all purpose spiritual cleansing liquid for everything from your b&amp;oacute;veda espiritual , candles, mixed with Holy water, psychic defence, washing your collares espiritual, spiritual cleansing baths, and many more uses than you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don;t know that it&#x27;s had any real effect on my complexion, though...</li>
            <li> product to me was very medicinal smelling</li>
            <li> and I really just didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> but smell is very subjective.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cost much moola-blah.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> Then again, this product really isn&#x27;t marketed as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li> At the price, you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> This is really a value of a dollar guys.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something lighter, but it definitely has a more &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s around 200 years old if everything dates right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and does not stick around too long.  </li>
            <li> We also use it at the course when we host other clubs and everyone really enjoys the refreshing, cooling effects it gives.  </li>
            <li> other colognes of the era, Florida Water was valued for its refreshing and tonic nature as well as its scent, and could be used as a skin toner or as what we would now call a &amp;#34;body splash&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> i splashed some on before my workout... and people who i normally see in the gym who barely speak where smiling and having full on conversations...</li>
            <li> I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.</li>
            <li> Now, I get a bottle that is more than triple the size for less money from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it has such an apealing fragrance its mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> many years ago and use this almost daily in the spiritual sense.</li>
            <li> This is not a good smelling Florida water, the container is made of plastic and the aroma is not as fragrant as genuine Florida water, if you want real Florida water, try the genuine glass-bottled LiuShen Florida water and you will not consider buying this type of \\&quot;Florida water\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was love at first smell between me and 4711, and I was curious what an American take on the scent would be like.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this stuff....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, it smells a little wierd, but it does work.</li>
            <li> And its a little spooky since some people use it for magical rituals.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is such a relief on a hot day!  </li>
            <li> Real old school barbershop smell.</li>
            <li> The colorful label hearkens back to its beginnings; in fact, the label is little-changed from its earliest days.</li>
            <li> It has some really nice, complex notes to it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had more alcohol heavy florida waters that are crisper as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I practice magic, and I do many bathing rituals to rid myself of unwanted negativity and to cleanse myself of lingering residual energy that others might have left behind on my person.</li>

            <li> For starters, I live and play in Florida and just for kicks, I bought this as a novelty item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>

            <li> Used alone this stuff is not very long lived (something generally true of splash on cologne), and unlike 4711 it is possible to over-apply this, so I don&#x27;t use Florida Water as a stand alone all-day scent.</li>

            <li> Also because this is a relatively old formula, it could conceivably work for either a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t think because someone else offers &amp;#34;multi pack&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but the smell is too masculine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too feminine or masculine.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to look far to find it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically the same thing but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not only do the living love this scent - the Dead do as well.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent - sweet/citrus/floral with a spice dry down (cloves and something I can&#x27;t quite place).</li>
            <li> Its simple, but classic, and it works: Orange Blossom, Lavender, and Clove.</li>
            <li> I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents.</li>
            <li> But as an hour or two scent (like say if I&#x27;m going to shower and then sleep), as a layer, or various odd uses, I think pretty much everyone should keep a bottle of Florida Water in the house.combination of Florida Water and Old Spice or Florida Water and my Pinaud Clubman Vanilla aftershave.</li>

            <li> It is a cologne, but the fragrance does not last long, however it picks me up after my shower ;-)</li>
            <li> The scent is much stronger than I expected it to be and a bit spicy for me.</li>
            <li> It just brings me nice, but vague memories.</li>
            <li> I could of told you the first few days but sort-of forgot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, complex scent with citrus high notes and a slight spicy undertone.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived new and in expected condition.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This item is sometimes hard to find at the local stores where I live in North Carolina, but through Helathtex Dist I found it easier to obtain in the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This bottle is usually stocked with colognes and lotions from Mexico in the isle you probably skip because of the many unknown foreign brands with Spanish on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had plenty of good and bad luck without it so don&#x27;t rely too heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like 4711 it was invented before there was a completely separate market for women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s fragrances, so Florida Water has been marketed to both men and women, though its certainly not a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell, so some women might not like it for that reason.</li>
            <li> It does last a bit longer than 4711, but by modern standards this is not a strong product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last long; however, if it did then it wouldn&#x27;t be light!  </li>
            <li> was I shocked when I found it in my tiny suburban CVS, I was even more startled at the $3.89 price tag!</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, or last too long, but talk about astringent after shower and shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long, but I didn&#x27;t expect that for the price and formulation.</li>
            <li> It has a long spiritual standing.</li>
            <li> This was essentially an American take on 4711, and the formula is almost as old (4711 dates back to the late 18th century,</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m no old man, either.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff lookin&#x27; through other related stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the $50 designer colognes that supposedly will attract ladies at random; I want to wear what I consider to be a fresh smelling</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not much of anything</li>
            <li> Not very feminine, in my opinion</li>
            <li> and I have a curious cat who wanders around nosing things, so</li>
            <li> I have used other products like this that were fruity smelling</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like bay rum after a hot shave then something is wrong with you.</li>
            <li> but as others have said it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried the trick mentioned by another reviewer of adding some to some cold water and wringing out a wash cloth in that on a hot day, and it worked!</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare the product to so its hard to create a specific review.</li>
            <li> I would NOT personally recommend this for (even though its one of the commonly listed uses) is aftershave.</li>
            <li> This aftershave/cologne has a bit of a love it or hate it scent.</li>
            <li> Personal opinion doesn&#x27;t mean a lot here.</li>
            <li> Pour this bad boy into a $1 plastic spray bottle from walmart or other dollar store, you got a potion that will give you quick boost of energy to bring you out of listlessness.</li>
            <li> it looks so old-timey and weird, plus it came highly recommended as a skincare aid from a girlfriend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even carry a little spray bottle of it in my pocket</li>
            <li> However, it was a little cheaper at CVS than Amazon</li>
            <li> I wish the scent would hold a little longer, but at 5$ for 7.5 ounces who cares.</li>
            <li> This may sound insane to outsiders, but Florida Water is just an essential for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> Put some ice cubes in a bowl of water and a few drops of Florida water, soak a wash cloth in the bowl and apply to face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li> I have gotten quite a few compliments since I started wearing it.</li>
            <li> For me, Florida Water is my everyday go to item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it though for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Walked a few miles.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are dead on.</li>
            <li> I just plain like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet orange citrus base with hints of lavender and clove.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d want to be around some one that is wearing it.</li>
            <li> I sitll broke out when I got my period :/</li>
            <li> I tested a small splash on my hands</li>
            <li> so I popped it open and used some and sort of felt guilty for using it beforehand,</li>
            <li> It just vanishes and feels a pointless.</li>
            <li> It has a scent thats hard to explain.</li>
            <li> at least I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> at least your cat won&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> This is the do-everything product we latinos have kept secret for years.  </li>
            <li> but then all rules, reminders and thoughts are broken when you come in contact with whatever you had in your mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on this crazy nostalgia kick</li>
            <li> Of course if you are ordering Florida Water you know what its used for - clearing bad energy in your home or office.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My Dad was very old school Greek and Florida Water was one of his favorite scents. I always keep a bottle around. The scent is fresh and clean and lively w/o being cloying. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be in great use among the younger generations, so you can have a unique fragrance for pennies!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect remenady for a hot day. Put some ice cubes in a bowl of water and a few drops of Florida water, soak a wash cloth in the bowl and apply to face, neck and arms. You&#x27;ll feel refreshed for hours.</li>
            <li> Murray &amp; Lanman&#x27;s Florida Water (now made by Lanman &amp; Kemp-Barclay &amp; Co.) has a long history. It was first introduced for sale in 1808, an American-made version of Eau de Cologne (aka Cologne Water) originally from Cologne, Germany (K&amp;ouml;ln). The colorful label hearkens back to its beginnings; in fact, the label is little-changed from its earliest days. The company&#x27;s website features 200 years of images related to this product--the early advertising itself is worth a visit to their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spicy-flowery notes of Florida Water are complemented by sweet orange, lavender, and clove. Always promoted as a unisex scent, Florida Water can be used as a body splash, aftershave, skin toner, linen sprinkle, and so much more. Not as obtrusive or long-lasting as perfume or cologne, Florida Water is a light, refreshing tonic suitable for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling, soothing, refreshing properties of Florida Water are valuable in many applications. Perhaps the tonic nature of this cleansing scent promoted its use in various spiritual practices. It has a long tradition in various folk applications, from cooling aching feet and rubbing down aching muscles, to adding to bathing water, and to sprinkling about the home for a refreshing, \\&quot;just-cleaned,\\&quot; spiritually-elevated feeling. Some use Florida Water to refresh their heads, to cleanse their environment, and to cool the \\&quot;atmosphere\\&quot; in their homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to buy the original, Murray &amp; Lanman&#x27;s Florida Water. This inexpensive scent is wonderful to keep on hand. I tend to buy the 16 oz. size: Florida Water lasts for a long time if used just as a toilette water, or can go more quickly if used around the home.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is honestly a great product for a really great price.  It&#x27;s not so over-powerful that you feel like a piece of citrus walking around.  It has some really nice, complex notes to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had crooks and pains in my neck and have had someone massage this where the pain is and it dries hot which makes the heat help the pain. Surprisingly, this works for pain!! Def would recommend it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the best kept fragrance secret ever!  Ridiculously cheap, $2 gets you a lifttime supply in the massive 7.5 oz bottle, and trust me it&#x27;ll be the most important weapon in your cologne collection!  I mix it with everything and it always brings out the musk and the deep tones so much better.  Right now I&#x27;m mixing it with [[ASIN:B000P22UPQ Baldessarini Del Mar By Hugo Boss For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3 oz]] and have never gone out without getting at least some kind of compliment on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find this from a real store you can avoid the shipping charges and still get it dirt cheap, but if you can&#x27;t then it&#x27;s still worth paying a little extra for.  Stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! I&#x27;m no old man, either. It&#x27;s fresh, clean, &amp; unique. The smell reminds me of someone from my childhood, but I can&#x27;t place exactly who... It just brings me nice, but vague memories. I have gotten quite a few compliments since I started wearing it. I now put it on each morning &amp; plan on ordering the smaller bottle to keep with me in my backpack so I can freshen up on the go. I think this is officially the only cologne I will buy from now on... Why spend fifty plus bucks on something that makes you smell like a chick?! Be a man &amp; invest (hah!) in some good ole Florida Water!</li>
            <li> Forget the hoodoo nonsense. This is a good cologne with a nice citrusy scent; really wonderful. It&#x27;s been around forever for this very good reason. If you want to bless your house, call a priest and tell him to bring along Holy Water. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s there for.</li>
            <li> Refreshing bay rum spice that lasts longer than you would expect. Very good for after shave and summer days.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Like 4711 at 1/4 the price. Refreshing, not heavy, Scent fades after an hour or so - great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Light fruity smell.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> reminds me of my childhood! been looking all over for it!</li>
            <li> For starters, I live and play in Florida and just for kicks, I bought this as a novelty item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, I became quite fond of the scent and invigorating freshness of the cologne.  It has a sweet orange citrus base with hints of lavender and clove.  The name refers to the fabled Fountain of Youth which was said to be located in Florida as well as the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; nature of the scent.  After all, Florida means &amp;#34;Feast of Flowers.&amp;#34;  So, the name of the cologne is certainly fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large quantities of Florida Water were used by barbershops as cologne and aftershave. In the 1880s and 1890s Murray &amp; Lanman Florida Water was advertised as &amp;#34;The Richest of all Perfumes&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The most Popular Perfume in the World&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other colognes of the era, Florida Water was valued for its refreshing and tonic nature as well as its scent, and could be used as a skin toner or as what we would now call a &amp;#34;body splash&amp;#34;.  This is my number one use of Florida Water- as a body splash; particularly during the hot summer months in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second means of using this product is by mixing it with iced water and dipping a clean rag in and wiping the neck and body for a refreshing cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just aftershave.  It&#x27;s also a refreshing body splash with that sweet citrus, yet manly smell.</li>
            <li> Actually, bottle of Florida Water cost me $4.30 including tax at CVS pharmacy. I saw it at Rite Aid at $3.95+tax as well. This bottle is usually stocked with colognes and lotions from Mexico in the isle you probably skip because of the many unknown foreign brands with Spanish on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cologne because of its clean and citric scent that reminds me of the first real barbershop my dad took me when I was 6 years old. I associate the scent with what I considered to be a manly smell without that musk which makes me gag. I don&#x27;t care for the $50 designer colognes that supposedly will attract ladies at random; I want to wear what I consider to be a fresh smelling cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this bottle of cologne provide me with hours of citric freshness (I love the smell of lime), I add key lime essential oil (found at ebay or amazon for $4) to the bottle and give it a real good shake. Pour this bad boy into a $1 plastic spray bottle from walmart or other dollar store, you got a potion that will give you quick boost of energy to bring you out of listlessness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for cleanse of items. The scent is different but nice. Not sure I&#x27;d want to be around some one that is wearing it.</li>
            <li> wonderful! Always have it on hand</li>
            <li> I love Florida water by Murray and Lanman it has such an apealing fragrance its mild and not overpowering. I have gotten many complements and people ask me all the time what I have on. For me, Florida Water is my everyday go to item. Wont leave the house without it. I even carry a little spray bottle of it in my pocket so I can re apply when ever I want a pick me up.</li>
            <li> This item is sometimes hard to find at the local stores where I live in North Carolina, but through Helathtex Dist I found it easier to obtain in the price is reasonable. Thank You</li>
            <li> My wife adores this stuff. So do I. And it&#x27;s so inexpensive that I buy 3 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> I have to purchase this for my business and I used to buy this product from a different company. I used to pay for a smaller bottle and spend more money. Now, I get a bottle that is more than triple the size for less money from Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t deprive yourself of this delightful scent just because it&#x27;s traditionally considered a men&#x27;s cologne.  It&#x27;s light and classy, and adds a cheerful, positive air to your morning.  It&#x27;s like putting on your good attitude for the day!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to just about every perfume out there- even the super high priced ones.  I took a chance on Florida Water because of the great reviews, and I am thrilled that i did so.  It&#x27;s a light, complex scent with citrus high notes and a slight spicy undertone.  It does not make you smell like you are wearing perfume or cologne, it just makes you smell nice, in a way that is a bit undefinable.( Yes, I made all my friends and family give me opinions on this, because I did not want to be one of those people who makes others gag with all the perfume they are wearing, but can no longer smell.) I tried the trick mentioned by another reviewer of adding some to some cold water and wringing out a wash cloth in that on a hot day, and it worked! I can&#x27;t say if the tradition of being lucky is true, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, it smells a little wierd, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This aftershave/cologne has a bit of a love it or hate it scent. I prefer it as it has citrus notes, but also a bit of &amp;#34;classic man&amp;#34; to it. I am going to use this for a long time to come. Not for everyone but worth a shot1</li>
            <li> I just plain like this stuff.  The smell doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, or last too long, but talk about astringent after shower and shave.&lt;br /&gt;I hose off on my patio after yard work about 3 times a day, and I keep a bottle of this Florida Water on the back porch to use after each hosedown.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d have to be a guy to understand.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma but as others have said it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t last a long time. Nice fresh clean scent. Try it!</li>
            <li> Reminds me a bit of bubble gum and musk huhu very sweet and nice smell to it. It is light and will not ever overpower...very good.</li>
            <li> Its really nice smelling and isn&#x27;t over powering but noticeable. The scent is very neutral but not soapy. I keep some in my drawer at work and splash some on my neck.</li>
            <li> A light, refreshing scent.  Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t last long; however, if it did then it wouldn&#x27;t be light!  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> If you like 4711 Cologne, try this. If like Florida Water, try 4711 Cologne. This was essentially an American take on 4711, and the formula is almost as old (4711 dates back to the late 18th century, Florida Water to the early 19th century). This stuff is still made in the US, is even more affordable than 4711, and it smells wonderful. If I could only choose one, I do like the 4711 even better, but this is still a really nice smell. Its simple, but classic, and it works: Orange Blossom, Lavender, and Clove. It does last a bit longer than 4711, but by modern standards this is not a strong product. This is definitely a splash-on, and you would not use it with an atomizer. Also because this is a relatively old formula, it could conceivably work for either a man or a woman. Like 4711 it was invented before there was a completely separate market for women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s fragrances, so Florida Water has been marketed to both men and women, though its certainly not a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell, so some women might not like it for that reason. Because Florida water is so inexpensive, and the Orange-Lavender-Clove combo is so universally pleasant, people use this for all sorts of stuff (scenting baths, scenting floors, even religious rituals), but one use I would NOT personally recommend this for (even though its one of the commonly listed uses) is aftershave. I like my alcohol based aftershaves fine, but this would not leave my face feeling good after a shave, as it contains no moisturizers or skin conditioners of any type: just alcohol, water, and fragrence. I bought this because it was love at first smell between me and 4711, and I was curious what an American take on the scent would be like. Personally, I like the scent of 4711 better than this (I prefer the scent of 4711 to pretty much everything actually), but this is so pleasant and inexpensive I&#x27;ve found uses for it. My favorite use is to layer Florida Water with another scent to create something new. In particular I like a combination of Florida Water and Old Spice or Florida Water and my Pinaud Clubman Vanilla aftershave. Used alone this stuff is not very long lived (something generally true of splash on cologne), and unlike 4711 it is possible to over-apply this, so I don&#x27;t use Florida Water as a stand alone all-day scent. But as an hour or two scent (like say if I&#x27;m going to shower and then sleep), as a layer, or various odd uses, I think pretty much everyone should keep a bottle of Florida Water in the house.combination of Florida Water and Old Spice or Florida Water and my Pinaud Clubman Vanilla aftershave.

            <li> Very nice smell.... slightly spicy and sweet at the same time.....speaking of its abilities to drive away negativity....i splashed some on before my workout... and people who i normally see in the gym who barely speak where smiling and having full on conversations... it took me by surprise....i believe in its spiritual uses....</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful. I cannot describe the aroma, but it definitely has a floral note to it. It is a cologne, but the fragrance does not last long, however it picks me up after my shower ;-)</li>
            <li> Florida Water serves a dual purpose,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As an all purpose spiritual cleansing liquid for everything from your b&amp;oacute;veda espiritual , candles, mixed with Holy water, psychic defence, washing your collares espiritual, spiritual cleansing baths, and many more uses than you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As a GREAT old fashioned \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to Florida Water by my Madrina in (Espiritismo Cruzado) many years ago and use this almost daily in the spiritual sense. When it comes to using it as an aftershave, which is something of a more recent practice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Florida water has a very pleasing citrus scent that is VERY distinct and always makes me think of a Misa, or of spending time with my muertos at my boveda. Other people (aleyos) comment all the time on how nice I smell when I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When splashed on as an aftershave it cools the skin, tonifys, and leaves your freshly shaved face feeling brisk, clean, and ready to face the day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without the familiar smell of Florida water, and of its many many uses!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea el Santisimo!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff just for the label...it looks so old-timey and weird, plus it came highly recommended as a skincare aid from a girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mostly just scented alcohol...but I&#x27;ve been using it as an astringent toner, and it does make your face feel fresh and tingly. I don;t know that it&#x27;s had any real effect on my complexion, though...I sitll broke out when I got my period :/</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my cleansing rituals around my home/work/car.  My oldest son loved it so much he uses it as his cologne everyday.  It&#x27;s not too strong and does not stick around too long.  For cleansing rituals I dilute it with distilled or holy water and put into a spray bottle.  I also put a little in a hot salt bath soak to give it a nice fragrance.  However, it was a little cheaper at CVS than Amazon so if you have a drug store close then you might want to check that out first.</li>
            <li> Bought as novelty...wish I hadn&#x27;t. Florida Water is more like Florida Swamp Water...or stagnated pond water or sewer water.</li>
            <li> I use this as aftershave. Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> My grandparents are from Puerto Rico and used to keep this stuff around for all sorts of things.  They put it on bug bites, burns stings and occasionally my grandfather used it as aftershave.  I myself am using it as aftershave and have loved it so far!  The smell is great and hasn&#x27;t caused any allergy issue with anyone.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last for ever but that is not that big of an issue with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more alcohol heavy florida waters that are crisper as an aftershave.  This is the do-everything product we latinos have kept secret for years.  Can be used as an aftershave, deoderant, cologne or cleaning product.... and supposedly it brings good luck too...but I&#x27;ve had plenty of good and bad luck without it so don&#x27;t rely too heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is okay, but there are better out there. Inexpensive and ships right to your house...what more can you want.  Smells better than some $50+ USD colognes.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this. It was cheap. It&#x27;s a nice scent but it&#x27;s gone minutes later. I&#x27;ll keep it an atomizer a spray it around willy nilly.</li>
            <li> As always a wonderful product. Authentic Florida Water. Shipping was quick! And don&#x27;t think because someone else offers &amp;#34;multi pack&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a better value, I purchased 3 and still it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the glass bottle version of the product, and I knew there was the plastic container version and searched all over amazon to rty to get the glass bottle, but was unable to ever to be exactly sure who was selling what. so ordered the offering from this comapny and gpt the plastic container. at least I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it on the bathroom floor. As for the Florida water itself, it is a nice product to splash on when it is hot or you want to freshen up a bit.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have nothing to compare the product to so its hard to create a specific review. The smell is nice, the bottle arrived in good condition with no leaks &amp; it works well for what I purchased it for. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent in a cute bottle</li>
            <li> He got &#x27;hooked&#x27; on this back when he used to go to a real barbershop... and we used to be able to get it at Walgreen&#x27;s or any other drugstore. Thank heavens it&#x27;s on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it does not stay with you long.  I wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent - sweet/citrus/floral with a spice dry down (cloves and something I can&#x27;t quite place). Doesn&#x27;t last long, but I didn&#x27;t expect that for the price and formulation. I added some witch hazel and menthol to make it into a nice aftershave - I&#x27;ve heard many use this for ceremonial uses as well. I find myself reapplying in the middle of the day to get a boost.</li>
            <li> I like the Peruvian version better. Smells more of natural botanicals. This is nice too though. Next time I will order the Peruvian kind.</li>
            <li> I got this product after hearing so many great reviews about it. I assume it service its purpose but the smell is too masculine. I gave it to my brother.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to know what this stuff smelled like for ages!  Now I use it all the time! Its a refreshing and romantic scent that makes me think of by-gone days in the sweltering hot south.  I use it as an after bath splash and sometimes add it to my bath water.  It also makes a good perfume.  And its a little spooky since some people use it for magical rituals.  A unique historical scent with a fascinating history.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I bought it for magical pursuits, mainly to clear negativity from myself and my environment.  I&#x27;ve used it though for everyday wear.  It&#x27;s not too feminine or masculine.  It&#x27;s just perfect and very reasonably priced here.</li>
            <li> This stuff is such a relief on a hot day!  Great to keep in an ice chest and those hot afternoons are more tolerable because we dip in and rinse a towel through this and get instant relief.  The smell will stay in that ice chest however so we cannot use it for anything else.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought what the hell it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s worth a shot. Well I have to say that I&#x27;m hooked. I like the smell, and it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li> No issues with shipping, packaging, etc. The product arrived new and in expected condition.&lt;br /&gt;This product to me was very medicinal smelling and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it. I tested a small splash on my hands and I really just didn&#x27;t like the smell. I can see how others may like this product but smell is very subjective. Very glad it was inexpensive. I passed along this new bottle hoping a friend would like it more than I did. As a reference point I didn&#x27;t like the Clubman Osage Rub scent either. It was different than the FL Water, but both to me were medicinal and I would rather go without aftershave than to use either product.</li>
            <li> You get a lot more than what you pay for with this product. It smells awesome! And, after doing some research, it&#x27;s also used in many religious ceremonies. Nice! It must be in part to the nice, light mixture of citrus and floral scents. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> DELIGHTFUL FRAGERANCE LIGHT AND PLEASANT</li>
            <li> I found this stuff lookin&#x27; through other related stuff. Never heard of it. Certainly don&#x27;t live within the known distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about it. Read the reviews. Ordered it.. Didn&#x27;t cost much moola-blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walked a few miles. Avoided people on the street to get home to get it in the mailbox. Cool stuff, old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lemon-y, spice scent. Some people can tell better than others or are more into it. I could of told you the first few days but sort-of forgot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice stuff to use. The day I got it I didn&#x27;t need a shave so I popped it open and used some and sort of felt guilty for using it beforehand, bought/got to use as a shaving/after shave aid. Didn&#x27;t smell like I imagined it would but then all rules, reminders and thoughts are broken when you come in contact with whatever you had in your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not much of anything I \\&quot;dig\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve used it as an aftershave several times and the problem with it I faced is that: it dries up very, very quickly. In five seconds it has vanished. You want a nice feeling and a lasting feeling and it&#x27;s just not here and I don&#x27;t see any use using it as an after shave. It just vanishes and feels a pointless. You might as well not use any aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product as a re-fresher of sorts whenever I feel I want a pick-me-up or whatnot. I don&#x27;t agree with the olde timey notion that the scent is for everyone. I don&#x27;t like it that much but since I have it I feel obliged to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;ve read and \\&quot;researched\\&quot;, it may well be the most old-school of \\&quot;old school\\&quot; aftershaves. It&#x27;s around 200 years old if everything dates right. It&#x27;s worth picking up if you are an old school shaver, I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll like it or find much use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving 5 stars. Personal opinion doesn&#x27;t mean a lot here. Try it for yourself and see what works.</li>
            <li> I remember my grandmother doing her spiritial ceremonies every year, for the Saints or for the birthday of the native Indian spirit burn a cigar and smoke some and blow it on us , just an over around Puerto Rican ritual.This smell is perfect in a hot tub and I spray my house with it can&#x27;t live without it.A+</li>
            <li> The scent is much stronger than I expected it to be and a bit spicy for me. Some will like it though.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this stuff.  Its very fresh and clean.  It definitely leaves my face smooth after shaving, though a little bit dryer than I would like.  Then again, this product really isn&#x27;t marketed as an aftershave.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> You will smell like no one else.</li>
            <li> Of course if you are ordering Florida Water you know what its used for - clearing bad energy in your home or office.  Also nice to splash on your face - neck on hot days.</li>
            <li> I liked this &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; scent very much.</li>
            <li> Like a granny&#x27;s bathroom. Not offensive but not a smell I want on my body. More like a dollar store deodorizer or stale 7up.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with a particular scent used in a meditation group and although this is from same supplier, this has much more citrus</li>
            <li> I practice magic, and I do many bathing rituals to rid myself of unwanted negativity and to cleanse myself of lingering residual energy that others might have left behind on my person. One of my bath rituals called for Florida Water, so I went out to find a bottle. Let me tell you, not only was I shocked when I found it in my tiny suburban CVS, I was even more startled at the $3.89 price tag! I fully expected to have to order this stuff online, but it seems like it&#x27;s an item that&#x27;s easily obtainable at your local drugstore. Like another reviewer had mentioned, it was on the isle with the products from Mexico. Didn&#x27;t have to look far to find it either.&lt;br /&gt;It smells pretty good. I was expecting something lighter, but it definitely has a more &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent to it. Not very feminine, in my opinion but that&#x27;s ok since I don&#x27;t bother with women&#x27;s perfumes to begin with. I&#x27;m not a &#x27;flowery scent&#x27; type of girl. For some reason it makes me think of my ex-boyfriend who is a sailor and is constantly around the water. Reminds me of the smell of the ocean mixed with a spritz or two of citrus lemon fruit. I got the Murray and Lanman 7 1/2 ounce bottle of this stuff, and I LOVE that it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle. It&#x27;s going to be on my altar and I have a curious cat who wanders around nosing things, so if he knocks it over it won&#x27;t be a problem. There&#x27;s a good deal of cologne in the bottle for the price you pay, so I expect to be able to use it in my rituals for a long time before I have to buy another bottle. At the price, you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This is not a good smelling Florida water, the container is made of plastic and the aroma is not as fragrant as genuine Florida water, if you want real Florida water, try the genuine glass-bottled LiuShen Florida water and you will not consider buying this type of \\&quot;Florida water\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> For me, Florida Water is a must in my life. I do not only use it as a cologne. It has a long spiritual standing. Not only do the living love this scent - the Dead do as well. It is perfect for ancestor altars, bovedas, and as a scent to offer and wear at the cemetery when you visit. This may sound insane to outsiders, but Florida Water is just an essential for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> I use this Florida Water during our hot Louisiana summers while playing golf.  We also use it at the course when we host other clubs and everyone really enjoys the refreshing, cooling effects it gives.  I just wish it was a different scent.  The smell is a bit strong.  I have used other products like this that were fruity smelling which is better for me.  I do highly recommend this stuff....just don&#x27;t use too much of it.  It will take your breath away.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are dead on. This stuff has a wonderful citrus/clove smell and is subtle and refreshing. Definitely a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> same product---Plastic bottle--at least your cat won&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> I like Florida water a lot.  It smells great, is refreshing, and a little goes a long, long way.  I like how it smells on my husband -- it&#x27;s his signature fragrance!  I like it on hot days to cool myself down.  Give it a try -- it&#x27;s been around for generations.  It&#x27;s even mentioned in the novel, &amp;#34;Gone with the Wind.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Real old school barbershop smell. May not be to everyone&#x27;s liking but used in moderation very pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Smells just like another brand of florida water but under different name. It&#x27;s basically the same thing but much cheaper. Bought a bottle for $1.50 at nearby supermarket. Yeah ripoff. This is really a value of a dollar guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on this crazy nostalgia kick so I figured I&#x27;d try one of the oldest colognes/perfumes (it&#x27;s unisex, ya know) around.  Gotta say, this has a very pleasant smell and is not overpowering at all.  In fact, if anything, it might fade just a tad too quickly for some.  It&#x27;s cheap.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> sinply awsome in a bottle</li>
            <li> I have always liked this fragrance, especially in the summer.  It&#x27;s cool and refreshing, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  It also makes a great facial astringent.</li>
            <li> If you like bay rum, then you&#x27;ll like Florida Water. If you don&#x27;t like bay rum after a hot shave then something is wrong with you. Turn in your man card immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been on a recent kick of purchasing classic scents. It all started when my last bottle of Caswell Massey Lime aftershave ran out. I then started the hunt for more of it and other classic barbershop/old time scents.This is with out a doubt one of the finest. It has a scent thats hard to explain. Its clean, fresh and full of citrus spice. I wish the scent would hold a little longer, but at 5$ for 7.5 ounces who cares. Just splash on some more. It has an amazing cooling effect and makes you feel awesome when trying to beat the summer heat. Just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
