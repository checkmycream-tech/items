    <ol>

            <li>color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Perfect protects and evens skin, great !</li>
            <li>This has good ingredients in it, I took a point off for the color!  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect, it gives a nice bit of coverage and feels very good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for sunscreen and coverage.</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>, this is a great deal bec I have to apply EVERY 2 hours---</li>
            <li>Neutrogena BB Cream is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>this, to me, is truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and great SPF</li>
            <li>They also had a good customer service.</li>
            <li>A really good product.</li>
            <li>I am considered fair skinned among latin americans...which means I am considered medium toned to a full-blown caucasian.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s also a good alternative to Neutrogena</li>
            <li>This gives great coverage, and I love the SPF.  </li>
            <li>The fair to light Neutrogena bb cream is great.  </li>
            <li>Too light for my skin!!</li>
            <li>A great light alternative to using makup every day.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing and feels like nothing is on.</li>
            <li>all I need to do is gently blot with my fingers and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>The company uses its own sunscreens  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply as it is lightweight so you do not look &#x27;pasty&#x27; and feel as if your skin cannot breathe.</li>
            <li>The fair to light is a bit darker in color than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>Eventhough the box was unshield, the item was new and in a very good condition.</li>
            <li>Honestly, its not the best because it takes a while to even out the application and if you have dry skin then it&#x27;ll look like you have flakes on your skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than face makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I picked it up on a whim.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream with spf 30 which protect my skin from damage of the sun.</li>
            <li>I  remain satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>was I able to achieve that.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin appear healthier, with a healthy radiance.  </li>
            <li>It also adds a glowy healthy radiance.  </li>
            <li>What I can tell you for sure is that the smell is HORRID.  </li>
            <li>and it is my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>Was okay</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>However, at the end of the work day - there is more shine than I would like to have.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many BBs and CCs.</li>
            <li>have also tried Aveenos, Salma Hayek&#x27;s Nuance, Peter Roth, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB and more......</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a true medium hue in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read people had issues applying this on the skin, but with the prior step of priming my skin with neutrogena visibly even moisturizer and applying it with the eco tools BB cream brush, this is a truly brilliant product that goes on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy make-up free look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smooth and covers everything!</li>
            <li>Goes on well as a BB cream, isn&#x27;t greasy, and can easily be worn under makeup, but doesn&#x27;t seem to fade any discoloration.</li>
            <li>It lasts well all day and washes off easily at bedtime.</li>
            <li>The light to medium hue is definitely more on the light side.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth,</li>
            <li>Even BB cream light to medium</li>
            <li>which is important for the coverage of dark/red spots, otherwise (a lighter tone)</li>
            <li>It is light and lets your skin breathe.</li>
            <li>but the color was too light for me.</li>
            <li>It should, since it&#x27;s really good at blending in with your natural tone.</li>
            <li>It feels light, but avoids the need for full foundation, etc.  </li>
            <li>In the summer all full coverage products become cakey no matter how perfectly I apply it (following professional make up artist tips for oily skin and full coverage).</li>
            <li>product provides me with a unique coverage in that it actually does a good job evening</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product.  </li>
            <li>Seems to sit on top of the skin, making everything seem to blend real well.  </li>
            <li>The Light to Medium is just the right color for my medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used to try something new over and over, but finally decided to stick with what works, so I am becoming a Neutrogena girl and enjoying the products and finding them quite effective.</li>
            <li>In trying to avoid the high cost of product she uses in her video, I have been able to recreate the concept using the products mentioned (all bought either at Wal-Mart, Walgreens or Target) for a fraction of the cost:&lt;br /&gt;step 1:</li>
            <li>My skin looks just as fresh at the end of the day as I do at the start of the day...</li>
            <li>The weather right now is super hot.</li>
            <li>In addition, the cream was blended very well and quickly on my face.</li>
            <li>most days, this product is enough.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a BB cream, this follows the latest foundation trend--of foundation looking and feeling like a second skin.</li>
            <li>I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream first</li>
            <li>and it was only okay.</li>
            <li>and this product does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>consistency of this cream was exactly the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t full coverage (obviously no tinted moisturizer can truly be a full coverage) but</li>
            <li>Because the moisturizer is slightly shiny (and my skin so oily) I follow up with a quick and very light touch of setting powder in order for it to lose some excess radiance and help it set on my oily canvas of a face.  </li>
            <li>(applied 2 pea-sized drops to my entireface with Eco Tools BB cream brush--1 pea-size drop first for the whole face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a small coverage areas</li>
            <li>Gives Me a light color and moist  at the same time.</li>
            <li>If I feel like maybe there is a streak (although it really doesn&#x27;t happen at all with that brush)</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Do not care for this much at all.</li>
            <li>This product is better for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a clean brush (anything that is similar to the MAC 217 brush) in a circular motion, only lightly over each affected spot.  </li>
            <li>Was referred by a friend who swears by it, so I hope I have the same success!</li>
            <li>I have tried L&#x27;oreal bb cream previously and even the light color was far too dark for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Slightly to dark for me, but I love it nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Instead, this BB cream looks like the type of liquid foundation that comes out of a squeeze tube (so obviously not like liquid foundation that flows rather quickly out of glass bottles).  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, with Kerry Washington becoming a spokesman for them they will have more shades for olive, African American people, and other people of color!</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normal to oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad the light to medium color was recommended to me as medium to dark would have been to dark.</li>
            <li>I think that Neutrogena has created a wonderful line of products and have been singing them praises since I switched from the Oil of Olay line of products approximately a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>(i live in NY City</li>
            <li>I use a daily moisturizer first and sometimes touch up with a bit of foundation</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look like second skin, it just looked like my first skin (which wasn&#x27;t the point)</li>
            <li>First for regular skin</li>
            <li>routine with this product involves priming my skin with Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisterizer first and then applying the Visibly Even BB cream with Eco Tools Skin Perfecting Brush (for BB creams).  </li>
            <li>It smells like one of those old permanent kits I had when I was young!</li>
            <li>For some odd reason, I wasn&#x27;t finding this kind of consistency in other products.</li>
            <li>usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend AmorePacific&#x27;s CC creme for AM special occasions, L&#x27;Oreals  (white long bottle) for night</li>
            <li>This product is all you need to complete your skin routine after cleansing and toning.  </li>
            <li>To give you an idea of what my natural skin tone is on my face, try looking for the 340 (early tan)</li>
            <li>but it nearly knocks me over every morning.  </li>
            <li>It evens out my blotchy 60 year old, sun-damaged skin while looking natural.</li>
            <li>The product dissolves totally, leaving your skin looking very natural.  </li>
            <li>I use revlon color stay concealer (because I have oily skin which melts every 2 hrs unless i have a long lasting product on) only exactly where needed...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about half the price of higher quality BB cream (one that is unscented and blends in easier) -</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Mineral Foundation (gently apply thinnest layer possible using a loose bristle brush like SOHO pro highlighter brush).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trick for covering the super dark or red spots (which this cream obviously can&#x27;t do 100%) is to only touch-correct.</li>
            <li>the smell of this one is so strong and not pleasant at all</li>
            <li>mysteriously and deceivingly actually covers dark spots (from old acne) as well as red spots (from new acne) in a way that I can only describe as follows:  </li>
            <li>so I always try various new products in Sephora and other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on well as a BB cream, isn&#x27;t greasy, and can easily be worn under makeup, but doesn&#x27;t seem to fade any discoloration.</li>
            <li> A great light alternative to using makup every day. Much better than face makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried L&#x27;oreal bb cream previously and even the light color was far too dark for my fair skin.  The fair to light Neutrogena bb cream is great.  The color is perfect, it gives a nice bit of coverage and feels very good on my skin.  I use a daily moisturizer first and sometimes touch up with a bit of foundation but for weekend running around and most days, this product is enough.  I&#x27;ve only used it a short time so I don&#x27;t know if it fades dark spots or not but so far I really like it.  Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed it to have any scent at all.  I&#x27;m glad I picked it up on a whim.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time. Eventhough the box was unshield, the item was new and in a very good condition. I love this BB cream with spf 30 which protect my skin from damage of the sun. In addition, the cream was blended very well and quickly on my face. They also had a good customer service. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Would have given this a higher rating, but the smell is horrible.  It smells like one of those old permanent kits I had when I was young!</li>
            <li> Gives Me a light color and moist  at the same time.</li>
            <li> Oops. Slightly to dark for me, but I love it nonetheless. Goes on smooth, no greasy feel to it, and it leaves you feeling covered without makeup. I will get a shade lighter next time.</li>
            <li> This BB cream smells horrific I know is because of the spf but the smell of this one is so strong and not pleasant at all and it doesn&#x27;t last at all within a few hours starts to disappear and cling to the skin, if you have dry skin I do not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I think that Neutrogena has created a wonderful line of products and have been singing them praises since I switched from the Oil of Olay line of products approximately a year and a half ago.  This product does what it claims to do.  You really do not need any powder or foundation when you use it.  Even though the BB Cream is a daily moisturizer, I still moisturize, using the Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer (SPF 15).  This product is all you need to complete your skin routine after cleansing and toning.  The cream absorbs within seconds.  The product dissolves totally, leaving your skin looking very natural.  It is very easy to apply as it is lightweight so you do not look &#x27;pasty&#x27; and feel as if your skin cannot breathe. One application lasts all day! My skin looks just as fresh at the end of the day as I do at the start of the day... this, to me, is truly amazing!  The only reason why my rating is 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have only been using the product for the past 4 days. I will, however upgrade to 5 stars once I continue to be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, I am upgrading my review to 5 stars.  I  remain satisfied with this product and I have been using it for a while now. Great product!</li>
            <li> Just as I discovered this, I think Neutrogena is going to stop making it.  This gives great coverage, and I love the SPF.  It feels light, but avoids the need for full foundation, etc.  A really good product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin (worse than the worst you could imagine)...and in the summer heat my skin becomes a grease factory. So all foundations I have tried (cream, liquid or mineral powder)  intended for oily skin still require me to touch up and blot off the oil every 2 hrs or so in order to avoid looking like a make-up colored grease ball. In the summer all full coverage products become cakey no matter how perfectly I apply it (following professional make up artist tips for oily skin and full coverage). I had recently switched to medium coverage but still not thrilled with the look.  I had been trying to make my skin look like it had no make-up on and only until I used this product was I able to achieve that.  Even though it&#x27;s a BB cream, this follows the latest foundation trend--of foundation looking and feeling like a second skin. This is truly a second skin.  My skin looks amazing and feels like nothing is on. I am going to have to start getting used to the sensation of nothing on my face that this cream has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other BB creams in the past and even creating my own tinted moisturizer(by mixing full coverage foundation with moisturizer..which resulted in an awful DIY BB cream) and never really loved them.  I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream first and it was only okay. It didn&#x27;t look like second skin, it just looked like my first skin (which wasn&#x27;t the point) and then I tried garnier. First for regular skin and then--thinking i should switch to one more suited to my greasy skin--the one for oily skin (which was actually the worst BB cream I have tried).  So all these failed attempts, I found myself going back to medium coverage liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews (not from Amazon though) of this product and I wanted to give it a try.  It seemed promising.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try BB creams that gave me a noticeable amount of coverage while improving skin tone...and this product does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mysteriously and deceivingly actually covers dark spots (from old acne) as well as red spots (from new acne) in a way that I can only describe as follows:  Imagine you could remove one very very thin layer of skin to reveal a better, healthier, and less unevenly toned skin. It makes your skin appear healthier, with a healthy radiance.  It isn&#x27;t full coverage (obviously no tinted moisturizer can truly be a full coverage) but there are ways around it (which i explain below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine with this product involves priming my skin with Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisterizer first and then applying the Visibly Even BB cream with Eco Tools Skin Perfecting Brush (for BB creams).  Because the moisturizer is slightly shiny (and my skin so oily) I follow up with a quick and very light touch of setting powder in order for it to lose some excess radiance and help it set on my oily canvas of a face.  (I am guessing dry skin would soak up the shine from moisturizer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provides me with a unique coverage in that it actually does a good job evening my skin while still looking like skin.  I can&#x27;t achieve that with medium coverage foundations because they still look like a layer of something fake.  It also adds a glowy healthy radiance.  I didn&#x27;t feel it was quite like shiny particles (as other people seem to have found)...but you can add a layer of matte setting powder to remove the extra glow where you don&#x27;t want it.  If you have combination skin, then only placing some on your T zone should be enough.  Either way, use the least amount of setting powder for it, otherwise you dull it out completely (missing out on the point of added radiance as an effect of healthy looking skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this cream was exactly the one I was looking for. For some odd reason, I wasn&#x27;t finding this kind of consistency in other products. I had bought the garnier bb cream intended for oily skin and what a disappointment. I can&#x27;t complain about that product enough it seems.It was very liquid, spread horribly, covered horribly and smelled of alcohol (as if alcohol is the solution to oily skin). Instead, this BB cream looks like the type of liquid foundation that comes out of a squeeze tube (so obviously not like liquid foundation that flows rather quickly out of glass bottles).  I apply it with EcoTools Skin Perfecting Brush and it&#x27;s awesome. If I feel like maybe there is a streak (although it really doesn&#x27;t happen at all with that brush) all I need to do is gently blot with my fingers and it&#x27;s perfect.  I read people had issues applying this on the skin, but with the prior step of priming my skin with neutrogena visibly even moisturizer and applying it with the eco tools BB cream brush, this is a truly brilliant product that goes on so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick for covering the super dark or red spots (which this cream obviously can&#x27;t do 100%) is to only touch-correct. I use revlon color stay concealer (because I have oily skin which melts every 2 hrs unless i have a long lasting product on) only exactly where needed...so that the rest of the skin keeps it&#x27;s healthy make-up free look.  I apply it with a clean brush (anything that is similar to the MAC 217 brush) in a circular motion, only lightly over each affected spot.  Then if there is still a visible spot (usually the bull&#x27;s eye of the imperfection) I go back with a tiny brush (Essential Concealer Brush by e.l.f.) in the lightest, smallest strokes (almost like tapping motions).  I learned to do this by watching Lisa Eldridge video for covering acne imperfections (http://youtu.be/Jwngbzv0gbY).  In trying to avoid the high cost of product she uses in her video, I have been able to recreate the concept using the products mentioned (all bought either at Wal-Mart, Walgreens or Target) for a fraction of the cost:&lt;br /&gt;step 1: Neutrogena Visibly Even moisterizer (applied with fingers)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:Neutrogena Visible Even BB cream light to medium (applied 2 pea-sized drops to my entireface with Eco Tools BB cream brush--1 pea-size drop first for the whole face and then the second pea-sized drop for any additional areas where it was needed)&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Revlon Color Stay Concealer (touch-correcting applied only on blemished--first with imitation MAC 217 brush from Shu Uemura and then followed up by e.l.f. tiny concealer brush)&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Neutrogena Mineral Foundation (gently apply thinnest layer possible using a loose bristle brush like SOHO pro highlighter brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect for me. I read people found it too dark but being latin american I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be too dark for me. I didn&#x27;t test it before and lucked out. I am considered fair skinned among latin americans...which means I am considered medium toned to a full-blown caucasian. To give you an idea of what my natural skin tone is on my face, try looking for the 340 (early tan) revlon color stay foundation for oily skin.  If you can find that product in the store, you can get an idea of who the neutrogena BB cream tone is intended for.  I can&#x27;t presume to know how it would be on other skin tones but I think you could just try some on your wrist and see if it blends out.  It should, since it&#x27;s really good at blending in with your natural tone. Obviously it has a slightly darker tone than mine (slightly!) which is important for the coverage of dark/red spots, otherwise (a lighter tone) would only make spots stand out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this lengthy review was of some help.</li>
            <li> Too pasty!!  Can&#x27;t spread it without using Neutrogena moisture under it!  Too light for my skin!!</li>
            <li> Not sure this does what it is suppose too.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and great SPF but feels a little oily.</li>
            <li> This has good ingredients in it, I took a point off for the color!  They need to do something about the shades!  Hopefully, with Kerry Washington becoming a spokesman for them they will have more shades for olive, African American people, and other people of color!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. The tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for years is discontinued so I&#x27;m looking for a new one. This product sits on my face and doesn&#x27;t absorb and looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works yet or not.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for three weeks and don&#x27;t see a difference yet, but it may be too soon to tell.  What I can tell you for sure is that the smell is HORRID.  I thought I&#x27;d get used to it but it nearly knocks me over every morning.  Very disappointing, Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> The fair to light is a bit darker in color than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena BB Cream is a very nice product.  It&#x27;s light, smooth and covers everything! I have a few small scars on my face from surgery and this product makes them disappear.  You also don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product.  Does not measure up to the advertised claims.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite a while and it is my favorite foundation. The Light to Medium is just the right color for my medium skin tone. It protects from incidental sun exposure, which is all the exposure I get now! It evens out my blotchy 60 year old, sun-damaged skin while looking natural. It lasts well all day and washes off easily at bedtime. I used to try something new over and over, but finally decided to stick with what works, so I am becoming a Neutrogena girl and enjoying the products and finding them quite effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect protects and evens skin, great !</li>
            <li> Great for sunscreen and coverage. It is light and lets your skin breathe.</li>
            <li> Was referred by a friend who swears by it, so I hope I have the same success!</li>
            <li> Was okay but the color was too light for me.</li>
            <li> Is there a darker shade</li>
            <li> This product is okay you have to use a little at a time otherwise it gets do we and streaky .. It&#x27;s good for a small coverage areas</li>
            <li> Do not care for this much at all. Was dissapointed. Color is just a bit off and it makes my face shiny.</li>
            <li> Seems to sit on top of the skin, making everything seem to blend real well.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a problem with breakouts in all of my 67 years, and I have used a lot of products. Two days after using this, I had breakouts on my nose and cheeks. Within a day of stopping, my skin improved. It&#x27;s in the garbage! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and creamy, like sunscreen and definitely has a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent upon application.The light to medium hue is definitely more on the light side. It would be nice to have a true medium hue in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a great value. However, at the end of the work day - there is more shine than I would like to have. The weather right now is super hot. My skin is normal to oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside :  It&#x27;s about half the price of higher quality BB cream (one that is unscented and blends in easier) - so I will continue to use this product for working out and for colder weather. This product is better for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many BBs and CCs. I also have tried Korean brands known for their BBs. If you&#x27;ve been to a Japanese or Korean grocer/ beauty store then you&#x27;ll know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Aveenos, Salma Hayek&#x27;s Nuance, Peter Roth, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB and more...... (i live in NY City so I always try various new products in Sephora and other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like Neutrogena just for everyday, every two hours applications. Honestly, its not the best because it takes a while to even out the application and if you have dry skin then it&#x27;ll look like you have flakes on your skin. I usually get dry flakes when I&#x27;m treating a pimple spot, but because i have normal skin, it doesnt bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEcause I&#x27;m after skin protection that evens out skin... a regiment that has to be applied every two hours, then Neutrogena is my fave. The company uses its own sunscreens  so I know it&#x27;ll prevent wrinkles and sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;For less than $15, this is a great deal bec I have to apply EVERY 2 hours---yes, that&#x27;s dermatologically recommended times of sunscreen usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend AmorePacific&#x27;s CC creme for AM special occasions, L&#x27;Oreals  (white long bottle) for night bec it doesnt have SPF. I also like Aveeno&#x27;s tinted--That&#x27;s also a good alternative to Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I am so glad the light to medium color was recommended to me as medium to dark would have been to dark. I will be using this BB Cream from now on.</li>
