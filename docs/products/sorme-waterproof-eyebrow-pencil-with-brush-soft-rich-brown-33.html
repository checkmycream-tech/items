            <li>your eyebrows look great today.&amp;#34; He&#x27;s not the sort of fellow to say such a thing, and the fact that he noticed speaks volumes.</li>
            <li>overall, it is a great eye brow pencil.</li>
            <li>does not go on smoothly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and get just the right fine lines that you need.</li>
            <li>I suggest for anyone with med to dark hair to buy the Essence brown eyebrow pencil, it works awesome and better than any high end brow ive used..</li>
            <li>The color is very nice and natural but I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Seems like with a bit of practice, I am able to duplicate the original color of my eyebrows with this particular Sorme pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still happy with it since other &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; pencils have made my skin itch.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and performs very well.  </li>
            <li>than anything, I find this pencil easy to use and very long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Really like Sorme!!</li>
            <li>Works great and looks much more natural then some other pencils Ive tried!</li>
            <li>and if I accidentally wipe across it it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a brown that wasn&#x27;t too red or too dark and this shade is perfect for brunettes.</li>
            <li>It sharpens up easily and goes on well, making eyebrows look very natural.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered super fast and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>but it was so darn humid and hot that day</li>
            <li>except when it&#x27;s humid out... nor sure how long it really lasts ...</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I find this pencil to be very long-lasting &amp; smudge-proof once applied</li>
            <li>Thanks SO much.</li>
            <li>but I really wash face and moisturize. ...</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to be waterproof.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used in pool</li>
            <li>general, I love this pencil and will likely re-buy Sorme for some time to come!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After an exhaustive online search, I decided to try the Sorme Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil in Soft Rich Brown to pencil in and/or highlight whatever is left of my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking &amp; Waterproof.</li>
            <li>The color is not too dark or light.</li>
            <li>It was shipped and received very quickly too, within a few days.</li>
            <li>It was everything that I expected and I received it quickly .</li>
            <li>The color matches well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive, but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is the only eyebrow pencil I ever use, and Amazon is not only the only place I can find that carries it, but they carry it for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use a medium touch, doesn&#x27;t go on too thick, and if it does just use the attached brush lightly, to blend in.</li>
            <li>A little waxy but works OK with a slight hand.</li>
            <li>This product comes off very easily and is difficult to apply ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used eyebrow pencils in the past and in my opinion, this pencil is really worth</li>
            <li>pencial is very thick and cakey and does not go on smooth at all</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the BEST eyebrow pencil ever! Very natural looking &amp; Waterproof. I have bragged about this pencil in a previous review. I lost pencil October 30 while out of town. I was so upset w myself for losing it &amp; couldn&#x27;t imagine where &amp; when I lost it. I ordered another one for next day arrival when I got back home it was there as promised! November 15 I lost that pencil I am not kidding! I ordered another one which arrived as promised. This pencil is so good I wouldnt replace w a substitute! Yesterday while looking for an earring in my oversized purse I felt a pencil under the lining. A small whole which I couldn&#x27;t see but could feel was where I lost my other two Sorme eyebrow pencils! I felt like it was Cmas! So excited now I have three! Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly, but if you have oily skin, you&#x27;ll need to retouch it.  Mine lasts only for few hours.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a waterproof eyebrow pencil. I really like this one. I ordered the brown and it works great for me. It stays on until I take it off at night. I will definitely reorder this pencil .</li>
            <li> Just like any regular pencil.. Isn&#x27;t waterproof, doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks much more natural then some other pencils Ive tried!</li>
            <li> I love Sorme products and this eyebrow pencil is no exception.  Great quality, goes on easily, stays put, and the pencil last forever!  A bit more expensive, but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I ever use, and Amazon is not only the only place I can find that carries it, but they carry it for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I was very  happy to find the Sorme Eyebrow pencil since I cannot find it in the stores here.  This color was a little to dark for me even though I am a brunette but it does stay on longer and is easier to sharpen than the self sharpener ones.  I reordered this Eyebrow brush in Taupe and it is perfect you can go light or darker. I think this is an all around eyebrow pencil for everyone.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it was not really waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest product of this type that I have ever used.  It is easy to use, and performs very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting eyebrow pencil that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I only received one ;  thought I was receiving two because of this picture  although the pencil is great -lasts all day</li>
            <li> I love this pencil. The price is amazing, the look is fab, and best of all, I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it. I&#x27;ve found amazing brow pencils, but I tend to have a reaction to some chemicals in them. This one is perfect in every way. My husband even said, &amp;#34;Wow, your eyebrows look great today.&amp;#34; He&#x27;s not the sort of fellow to say such a thing, and the fact that he noticed speaks volumes. I will not use anything else now!</li>
            <li> Really like Sorme!! Swim, exercise, or just step outside in Florida humidity and products stay true!</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer and have been undergoing chemotherapy since November 2013.  Unfortunately, like so many other women, my eyelashes are nearly 100% gone and my eyebrows have thinned by at least 50%-75%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exhaustive online search, I decided to try the Sorme Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil in Soft Rich Brown to pencil in and/or highlight whatever is left of my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve used eyebrow pencils in the past and in my opinion, this pencil is really worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, I find this pencil easy to use and very long-lasting.  It sharpens up easily and goes on well, making eyebrows look very natural.  Additionally, I find this pencil to be very long-lasting &amp; smudge-proof once applied and unlike others have cited, I do not find that the pencil rubs off easily.  I especially love the Soft Rich Brown color, which intensifies when re-applied or layered.  Seems like with a bit of practice, I am able to duplicate the original color of my eyebrows with this particular Sorme pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I love this pencil and will likely re-buy Sorme for some time to come!</li>
            <li> This product comes off very easily and is difficult to apply ...you have to use a very light stroke...was very disappointed..jp</li>
            <li> hated this.. It is WAY darker then this picture and doesn&#x27;t stay on that well at all. I have bought a $2 dollar eyebrow pencil that worked better than this.. I suggest for anyone with med to dark hair to buy the Essence brown eyebrow pencil, it works awesome and better than any high end brow ive used.. I bought the Lancome taupe brow and it&#x27;s good but the cheaper Essence one stays on better.. I also suggest instead of brow gel just put on Urban Decay primer potion over your brows before you fill them in and they don&#x27;t budge even sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get used to using this eyebrow pencil, so I don&#x27;t feel I can give a fair review at this time. I will say, I&#x27;ve had others that were preferred to this one.</li>
            <li> pencial is very thick and cakey and does not go on smooth at all was very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I could not find it at the local beauty store so ordered it online.  It&#x27;s a great product goes on well, has staying power and is the right shade for my eyebrows.  The product was delivered super fast and was just what I needed. Thanks SO much.</li>
            <li> Great application.&lt;br /&gt;.. except when it&#x27;s humid out... nor sure how long it really lasts ...mine came off when washed face but I really wash face and moisturize. ...so mine came off but did last the day withaybe one touch up but it was so darn humid and hot that day</li>
            <li> this pencil lasted me a very long time. overall, it is a great eye brow pencil. though it stays on pretty well, it does tend to clump and it is a little difficult to achieve the natural, even shading on your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye brow pencil I will use. The color matches well and looks natural. It&#x27;s goes on easy and with precision.</li>
            <li> NOT AS SUBSTANTIAL AS I WOULD&#x27;VE LIKED.  I ACTUALLY DON&#x27;T USE IT.</li>
            <li> just what l wanted ,the color is also what l wanted, l am very satisfied.  just the color l was looking for.  j</li>
            <li> does not go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Showed up broken, doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and is not able to blend well.</li>
            <li> Darker brown than I expected but the quality is nice.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and don&#x27;t plan to stop using them any time soon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brown that wasn&#x27;t too red or too dark and this shade is perfect for brunettes. Also, if you use a medium touch, doesn&#x27;t go on too thick, and if it does just use the attached brush lightly, to blend in. It was shipped and received very quickly too, within a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% waterproof. I may say 60% waterproof . I liked the color.</li>
            <li> Works great and the color match is perfect. Absolutely sweat proof which is great in my line of work. very happy !</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and natural but I have very oily skin and if I accidentally wipe across it it comes right off.  The only product I have found to be truly waterproof are the Stila brow pens.  I am still happy with it since other &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; pencils have made my skin itch.</li>
            <li> It was everything that I expected and I received it quickly .</li>
            <li> A little waxy but works OK with a slight hand.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is a very good eyebrow pencil as it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; color. It&#x27;s easy to use and get just the right fine lines that you need. It&#x27;s also fast to apply which is excellent.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it. Haven&#x27;t really used in pool</li>
            <li> Long Lasting even on oily skin. The color is not too dark or light. This is the only product that I use.</li>
