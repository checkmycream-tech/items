            <li>received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It has three different temperatures so you can find the perfect one to achieve the style you want.</li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample to test and review all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you&#x27;ve never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love this blow dryer, it&#x27;s the best one</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The attachments are securely held in place, but go on and come off easily.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product..</li>
            <li>Perfectly balanced - it is not light weight</li>
            <li>It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>it has some sort of infrared light.</li>
            <li>It is not made from cheap plastic material like some hair dryers I have owned.</li>
            <li>You have to get used to the light</li>
            <li>Just received, neither of the accessories would fit on the dryer.</li>
            <li>Have had a good experience so far.</li>
            <li>and you can easily operate them without looking - also, love the infrared - it really speeds up drying time!</li>
            <li>This is a new kind of dryer for me.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool shot button that allows you to set your style in place.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great dryer.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and has a variety of settings.</li>
            <li>Love my new hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>2 months in and am satisfied so far!</li>
            <li>Drys hair fast!!</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  </li>
            <li>It also felt very cheap and didn&#x27;t feel like professional quality.  </li>
            <li>Better than my wife&#x27;s old one.</li>
            <li>and it dries my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>so it is pretty powerful</li>
            <li>dryer works really well and drys my hair really quick.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when removing from the bag was how well made this hair dryer is.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot.</li>
            <li>I really like th hair dryer!</li>
            <li>A bit heavy but quite good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so heavy that you won&#x27;t want to use it, and it&#x27;s surprisingly compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer works really fast with the diffuser attachment to dry my hair into nice curl and wave without drying it out and making it frizz.  </li>
            <li>Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting.</li>
            <li>Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>The infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This dryer works fast and seems to help contain the frizziness.</li>
            <li>What I really appreciate is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the fan on the backside of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>One review I read before purchasing did not like the red light while on the hottest setting</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>It really adds a shiny quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out.</li>
            <li>I love to wear my hair natural but hairdryers usually dry my hair out</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a professional salon dryer.</li>
            <li>I just love the sleek design and the color black also.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s on high</li>
            <li>The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I&#x27;ve used it, the easier it&#x27;s gotten.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally.</li>
            <li>cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature.</li>
            <li>I thought I could live with that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that happen with so many dryers in the past, but</li>
            <li>I really like the 3 temperature settings (high, medium and low) and having two air speeds.  </li>
            <li>Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer cut that time down significantly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it glows red when you turn the setting on high.</li>
            <li>The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair dryer comes with two different speeds, High and low.</li>
            <li>Small and powerful.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....</li>
            <li>straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz.  </li>

            <li> The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....</li>

            <li> Very heavy, didn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also since using this hair dryer I haven&#x27;t had to use my flat iron once!</li>
            <li> I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)!</li>
            <li> but, it would take to long to dry \\&quot;Salon hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it takes me forever to dry it.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died.</li>
            <li> Does the job,but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it just needs time to get broken in, or if the infrared technology just doesn&#x27;t need the high heat.</li>
            <li> so I have usually had to air dry which takes way too long.  </li>

            <li> I like the warm and cool feature! Diffuser attachment an added bonus</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer as a gift so I don&#x27;t know yet how the person is going to like it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer!!!! I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it. I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally. I can&#x27;t believe how great my hair looks after just one use! I will update my review if necessary, but if my results continue it won&#x27;t be necessary! Highly recommend this awesome dryer!!</li>
            <li> It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry \\&quot;Salon hair\\&quot;. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.</li>
            <li> Better than my wife&#x27;s old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and how it works.</li>
            <li> Great seller and great product, this hair dryer is manageable and leaves my hair perfect. The drier is a bit heavy but other than that, perfect size and it makes wonders</li>
            <li> This is a new kind of dryer for me. It has an ionizer in it or something similar to that. When the hair dryer is on there is an orange glow coming from the nozzle. I have very thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. This hair dryer cut that time down significantly. I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! 😉&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.. Save time each morning with this amazing product</li>
            <li> Perfectly balanced - it is not light weight but it feels good in your hand.  Has very nice attachments that fit well - A diffuser for my daughters curly hair and a cap that helps me straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All the buttons work well and you can easily operate them without looking - also, love the infrared - it really speeds up drying time!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:3ce786db72a405f72c6e511ec156f72d]]I have needed a hair dryer forever and finally got this one. I am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and I would have to break by hair to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed. It feels substantial in my hands, not flimsy and cheap. It comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord on this hairdryer is super long so I can move around quite a bit while drying my hair. There is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out. There is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out (this one has 2 settings). The last button is high, medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly. The infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this hair dryer and I wish I would have gotten it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Absolutely love this blow dryer. Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &amp;#34;hi - lo&amp;#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don&#x27;t know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does the job,but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer!  I love to wear my hair natural but hairdryers usually dry my hair out so I have usually had to air dry which takes way too long.  This dryer works really fast with the diffuser attachment to dry my hair into nice curl and wave without drying it out and making it frizz.  It&#x27;s perfect!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> quite quiet. Lightweight. Small and powerful. Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works great. It is heavy though.  But I look at it as an opportunity to tone my biceps.  The attachments are securely held in place, but go on and come off easily.  I really like the 3 temperature settings (high, medium and low) and having two air speeds.  When it&#x27;s on high it has some sort of infrared light. Not sure what that&#x27;s for. I have shoulder length hair that tends to frizz. This dryer works fast and seems to help contain the frizziness. What I really appreciate is that my hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the fan on the backside of the dryer.  I&#x27;ve had that happen with so many dryers in the past, but not once with this one.</li>
            <li> It is a good dryer and you cannot beat the price</li>
            <li> Have had a good experience so far. A bit heavy but quite good.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail, I opened the box and found scratches on the product! It also felt very cheap and didn&#x27;t feel like professional quality.  Ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4f23c048c7a7295c947eff8e83bb9a3e]] This MHD Infrared Blow Dryer is absolutely amazing. The first thing I noticed when removing from the bag was how well made this hair dryer is. It is not made from cheap plastic material like some hair dryers I have owned. I just love the sleek design and the color black also.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer comes with two different speeds, High and low. It has three different temperatures so you can find the perfect one to achieve the style you want. It has a cool shot button that allows you to set your style in place. It has negative IONS that help control frizz. The hair dryer also features a loop that so you can hand to store.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer works really well and drys my hair really quick.  I am super impressed with the infrared light. I have never owned a hair dryer with that option before. It leaves my hair so soft and frizz free. Also since using this hair dryer I haven&#x27;t had to use my flat iron once! My hair looks so much healthier. I definitely recommend. I was provided a free sample to test and review all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom. It is a bit heavier than she&#x27;d like but overall she loves it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I&#x27;ve used it, the easier it&#x27;s gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it glows red when you turn the setting on high. I could not use it in my salon because it was a distraction. Also, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a professional salon dryer.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get that hot. I don&#x27;t know if it just needs time to get broken in, or if the infrared technology just doesn&#x27;t need the high heat. Runs VERY quietly and its built like a tank.</li>
            <li> dries your hair very quickly,I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Very heavy, didn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my hair.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Drys hair fast!! No frizz!!</li>
            <li> I have never had a blow dryer this amazing before, I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.  The first thing I noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer....I guess that&#x27;s what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer! It&#x27;s not so heavy that you won&#x27;t want to use it, and it&#x27;s surprisingly compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you&#x27;ve never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I&#x27;ve never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting. Overall, I love this blow dryer, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars except for the buttons on the handle.  It dries my hair quickly and has a variety of settings. One review I read before purchasing did not like the red light while on the hottest setting but I actually found it helpful.  The buttons on the handle get in the way while you are holding it and I find myself changing the settings accidently way too often.  Other than that it is a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Attachments do not lock on</li>
            <li> Love my new hairdryer.  Works really well.  Only issue is were the control buttons are located, I kept turning it off accidently</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is fantastic!! My hair has never looked so good! It really adds a shiny quality. You have to get used to the light but once you do, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy this sooner! Really great product!</li>
            <li> I really like th hair dryer! It drys fast and makes my hair look great! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just received, neither of the accessories would fit on the dryer. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
