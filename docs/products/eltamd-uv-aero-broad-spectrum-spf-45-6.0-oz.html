            <li>I was reluctant at first because I have never used a spray on product</li>

            <li>I really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Since it has only physical sunscreen ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t give me any problems, plus it is much more convenient than the lotions.</li>

            <li>One star off for high price.</li>

            <li>I have liked other EltaMD products, including their tinted sunscreen for the face, but this product was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Not only did I burn on all the areas where I applied (and reapplied) this sunscreen (the parts of my body where I applied a different sunscreen were just fine), but the entire bottle was gone over the course of a long weekend in Aruba.</li>

            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like other heavy on the chemical sunscreens.</li>

            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars was because the price and the sprayer sputtered a little when the product was half full.  </li>
            <li> I attribute my soft, ginger, porcelain skin due to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> We recently used it on a vacation and it works wonderfully as long as you remember to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I used it all over and stayed out in the sun for a long time on vacation and didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends it because it has &amp;#34;zinc oxide&amp;#34; in it, MEANING it blocks EVERY SINGLE RAY OF SUN.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t typically go for an aero spray for environmental/toxic purposes, but because I am so finicky I will set that standard aside for this sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> the 6oz size seems to last me about 2 months, but I put it on my face, neck, chest, arms and hands; you may need less.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale, freckly, and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is okay only because the button is hard to push making it a little difficult to spray allover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good base!</li>
            <li> a little greasy but protects well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little pricey.</li>
            <li> becuase I was having trouble finding a sunscreen that I do not react to.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear sunblock almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, goes on easily , not greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> For the money, not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is usually out of it, so I go to Amazon and get it quicker.</li>
            <li> Seriously, try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> SERIOUS sun screen.</li>
            <li> I HATE sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I hate oily sunscreens and this isn&#x27;t oily at all.  </li>

            <li> Very easy to use.  Can&#x27;t really assess the effectiveness.  Pricey compared to many sunscreens, but recommended by a dermatologist.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to discolor clothes. One star off for high price.</li>
            <li> I wear this on days when I&#x27;m in and out of the sun; no long term exposure.  On days when I&#x27;m going to be out for prolonged periods I use a higher Spf and reapply my zinc oxide stick every couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this brand is that it&#x27;s lightweight and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent product well worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> I HATE sunscreen. The smell of it, the texture, I don&#x27;t like it on my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it. I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and found a few that I could handle...however, this EltaMD is the best I&#x27;ve ever run across. Not only does it work incredibly well, but there is practically no smell. I can spray in my hand and apply more directly to specific areas - love, love, love it. I wouldn&#x27;t typically go for an aero spray for environmental/toxic purposes, but because I am so finicky I will set that standard aside for this sunscreen!! Will be my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock. Works well.</li>
            <li> I was told to purchase this product from my Dermatologist as the best product to use while motorcycling. We recently used it on a vacation and it works wonderfully as long as you remember to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I would definitely order again from you.</li>

It does after all say &amp;#34;full body sunscreen.&amp;#34;  I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  I hate oily sunscreens and this isn&#x27;t oily at all.  It dries right away.  I am a ginger and REALLY susceptible to sunburns and this brand is amazing.  My dermatologist recommends it because it has &amp;#34;zinc oxide&amp;#34; in it, MEANING it blocks EVERY SINGLE RAY OF SUN.  Most sunscreens don&#x27;t do that, which is why they don&#x27;t work so well.  I attribute my soft, ginger, porcelain skin due to this sunscreen.  My dermatologist says the best way to stop aging is PREVENTION.  WEAR SUNSCREEN.  I&#x27;ve done that since I was a teenager (even on overcast days) and my skin has never looked better.  Seriously, try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> This is okay only because the button is hard to push making it a little difficult to spray allover.  I like that it is fragrance free and does not feel heavy. Also provides good protection. For the money, not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the spray. This is not greasy. Last in water. I spray and still rub in just to lakeside I&#x27;m all covered up. I will buy more of this Elta products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> EltaMd spf45 was recommended by a dermatologist for ultra protection from harmful rays from the sun. Worked great, dries without a sticky feel.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It&#x27;s silky and wonderful. It dries mostly clear and I just use spf powder after I let this sunscreen dry. It&#x27;s a good base! It works, it has NO parabens, and it&#x27;s good for your skin. Spray into hands and apply to face. Spray directly onto your neck, this stuff will dry nice and you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Invaluable for skin protection.  My husband and I both use it.  I have had pre-cancerous lesions burned off face and back and wish to heck I&#x27;d used this a long time ago.  Make you kids use it.  Elta is tops.  Goes on smoothly and invisibly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Worked on the entire family very well.</li>
            <li> Provides excellent protection.  Long lasting.  Easy to apply and quickly disappears from view on the skin.  My dermatologist first sold it to me and I then purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Applies easily. I used it all over and stayed out in the sun for a long time on vacation and didn&#x27;t burn. I also used it on my grandsons and they didn&#x27;t burn either.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works great!  I am allergic to chemical sunscreens and cannot wear any of the sprays available at regular stores, so it&#x27;s really nice to be able to get this product from Amazon. Since it has only physical sunscreen ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t give me any problems, plus it is much more convenient than the lotions.</li>
            <li> works great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this item a couple of times.  I find it a bit greasy and  not as easy to apply as I thot it would be.  You have to be sure to press top of can at the tip or it won&#x27;t spray at all.  I find myself spraying it on and having to  spread it around with my hand because the spray is so concentrated--which sort of defeats the purpose of my using it while I am golfing.</li>
            <li> This is the sunscreen sold by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Sprays on thick - takes a lot to rub it in, but otherwise love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love using this stuff. It goes on easy without that greasy feeling. The locking mechanism on cap makes it easy to carry in a bag without worrying about it spilling. Pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like how it goes right into your skin with no residue.  It&#x27;s just a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT COVERS AND THE FACT THAT IT TURNS CLEAR AFTER YOU SMOOTH IT ON</li>
            <li> Top of the line. SERIOUS sun screen. Recommended by my Dr. and she was right - GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Great protection and fabulous product</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by friend.  I am so glad becuase I was having trouble finding a sunscreen that I do not react to.  This not only caused no reaction, but it actually feels like moisturizer.  I highly recommend this quality product.  I also tried their spray and their regular sunscreen and both are also good.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was because the price and the sprayer sputtered a little when the product was half full.  Either way, it doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell nor does it feel sticky on your skin.  It&#x27;s an excellent quality and lasts a while.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, don&#x27;t use too much. One of the best sunblocks available. I&#x27;ve use other Elta products for years &amp; have been very satisfied. I have to wear sunblock almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This.stuff.is.amazing.  I discovered it through my dermatologist, who zapped a bunch of sun damage on the left side of my face, and then gave me the sunscreen lecture.  When I said I&#x27;d never been able to find a non-gloppy product I could apply make-up over that didn&#x27;t cost more than college, she presented me with this stuff. It&#x27;s AWESOME.  It goes on a little greasy, but magically disappears into my skin in less than a minute.  Think about that.  WOW.  I put it on, wash my hands, go make my bed, come back, and it&#x27;s make-up time!  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t burn going on and seems to form a very nice protective layer.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts from this product.  FYI the 6oz size seems to last me about 2 months, but I put it on my face, neck, chest, arms and hands; you may need less.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t cost the freakin&#x27; Earth. Hallelujah! ;)</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen alot and will order again. I was reluctant at first because I have never used a spray on product but this one works well for me and I like the consistency of it.</li>
            <li> I am giving this only 4 stars because the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work that well.  It&#x27;s really great sunblock but you have to spray it on and then spread it around.  Kinda defeats the purpose of the spray block.  But the sunscreen in it is the best!!!!  Amazing for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very good protection, one of my favorite sunblocks. A big plus is that there is no added gragrance. At last a sunblock my husband will use without nagging.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR BODY IN THIS SUMMER!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s unscented, goes on easily , not greasy feeling.  My dermatologist is usually out of it, so I go to Amazon and get it quicker.</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, and it is great!  I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> The best, my doctor recommended it as he uses it himself.</li>
