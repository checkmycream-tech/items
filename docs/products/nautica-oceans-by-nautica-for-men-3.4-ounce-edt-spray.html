            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>the item as described, even better for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice, clean scent that works all year.  </li>
            <li>It is very much warm yet also clean; with a light, powdery, airy aroma.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS FINE</li>
            <li>I got it at a great price, same as nautica voyage</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful and versatile scent that works well as an everyday spray to a date night cologne.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a new favorite!</li>
            <li>This cologne is made to be appealing and also to appeal to people who are even slightly interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  </li>
            <li>but this one is just clean.</li>
            <li>Clearly what I got was a VERY old bottle of this great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells really clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is very light, masculine, clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this cologne not lasting long etc etc, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li>Still worth getting though.</li>
            <li>This cologne is supposed to be clear and is supposed to smell better than what I received.  </li>
            <li>This was a present, arrived safe and secure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a woody/oriental type scent, more beachy and clean.</li>
            <li>The package was received on the first day it was expected and the recipient was delighted.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend, and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>While I LOVE this fragrance, i have to warn potential customers to avoid buying from this site.</li>
            <li>nautica makes great scents but they do not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Nautica really outdid itself with Oceans - the light, citrus scent with notes of sea salt and teak is masculine and energizing.  </li>
            <li>The one downside is that the initial note can be very lemony, yet still its probably the most balanced scent I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>Unlike another reviewer who said it only lasted 5 minutes for them, it lasted a long very time on the spot I sprayed it and kept smelling good until I eventually washed it off.</li>
            <li>a pretty decent scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like this smell, along with nautica voyage.</li>
            <li>THAT MUCH...</li>
            <li>I really think though that this could be a unisex perfume.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s see how much he likes it.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing...extremely oily and watery.</li>
            <li>i really like</li>
            <li>but I had tested a Nautica cologne several months earlier and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I used this cologne at social events or special engagement.  </li>
            <li>It was very fresh and this is the same way.  </li>
            <li>Different than the other Nautica I tried but just as good in scent.</li>
            <li>based which makes it less drying and better for your clothes and the environment.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I like this cologne is that it is water, and not alcohol</li>
            <li>I felt the S&amp;H was a bit high.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT IS ALMOST AS NEW BECAUSE NOBODY USES IT...</li>
            <li>BE WARNED only buy this product from a store where you can examine it first.</li>
            <li>for me it has last more than other sprays</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have noted that the scent is barely detectable, but I believe that was the goal of this cologne - not too overpowering, but still adding that extra dash of sophistication to the daily work schedule or for a nice evening out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now: its long lasting fragrance and freshness still feels like the very first day</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS VERY OILY, IT BARELY SMELLS, IT DOESNT LAST</li>
            <li>Coupled with sharp notes up to the very edge of masculine.</li>
            <li>i had half a mind to keep it myself;)</li>
            <li>THE SCENT FADES AWAY FAST, HE WEARS OTHER NAUTICA PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I hope that the company plans to re-release this scent in the near future because my supply is running low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other colognes that ended up smelling a little too sweet or musky</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had other colognes that ended up smelling a little too sweet or musky</li>
            <li> It may not last a long time after applied</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s long enough to receive compliments from others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it to be fairly long lasting for its softness.</li>
            <li> A soft, delicate fragrance, yet masculine, that isn&#x27;t offensive to those around you.</li>
            <li> so the price may have something to do with how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It uses \\&quot;green\\&quot; ingredients and even the packaging it comes in is \\&quot;greener\\&quot; than other colognes in that it is made of 30% recycled materials and can be recycled further once you are done with it.</li>
            <li> If it is not CLEAR, stay away!!</li>
            <li> Just dont blame the seller if other women start to smell your man.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal or a fake but scent does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Turned the bottle upside-down and held down the pump til all the bubbles stopped, then it started working again.</li>
            <li> It does tend to fade a little quicker than some, but otherwise recommended.</li>
            <li> Thought it was wasted but kept trying to get it to work.</li>
            <li> I could see wearing this everyday.</li>
            <li> and I was not able to find in the department stores.</li>
            <li> not sure buy again&lt;br</li>
            <li> its the sexiest smell out there without trying too hard.</li>
            <li> Pump was defective and hard to press.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t always notice it on you; but it is so delicately arousing that for another to even get a whiff, is to command intimacy.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Because the items cap was broken and was leaking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cologne does not stay with you.</li>
            <li> I dont like the fact this product is being discontinued. :(</li>
            <li> I just received my order and am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> AMAZON should be ashamed for selling this CRAP to it&#x27;s customers.</li>
            <li> , HE HATED IT AND GAVE IT TO ME...</li>

            <li> Love the cologne but the manufacturing of the bottle/pump should be redone. After using 1/8-1/4 of the product, the pump ceased to work. Thought it was wasted but kept trying to get it to work. Turned the bottle upside-down and held down the pump til all the bubbles stopped, then it started working again. I&#x27;ve been repeating this process and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> this is the best cologne out there. it lasts all day since my fiance sweats alllot the smell stays on him all day and its simply the best. its not overpowering also. its the sexiest smell out there without trying too hard. ladies, if your looking for cologne for your man, THIS IS IT! buy it you won&#x27;t regret. Just dont blame the seller if other women start to smell your man.</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift from my wife for Christmas.  It is perfect for my daily needs and has a very pleasant smell perfect for work. Not over-powering at all.</li>
            <li> HUBBY LIKES IT AND IT DOES SMELL GOOD BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT DOES NOT LAST THE SCENT FADES AWAY FAST, HE WEARS OTHER NAUTICA PRODUCTS AND IT IS FINE ,MAYBE THIS IS A LIGHTER SCENT , BUT HE IS PLEASED WITH IT AND WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> My order was recieved ahead of schedule and I was very happy that Amazon carried this product. It is my favorite cologne and I was not able to find in the department stores. This was a big dissapointment but Amazon saved the day once again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now: its long lasting fragrance and freshness still feels like the very first day</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very light, masculine, clean and fresh.

This cologne is made to be appealing and also to appeal to people who are even slightly interested in reducing their carbon footprint.

            <li> I really like this smell, along with nautica voyage. nautica makes great scents but they do not seem to last very long. I got it at a great price, same as nautica voyage so the price may have something to do with how long it lasts. Still worth getting though.</li>
            <li> I really loved this fragrance when I originally tested it in Target. Amazon had the larger size bottle for the same price, so I went for it. Unfortunately, this cologne does not stay with you. The smell is all but gone within 5 minutes of putting it on. I would return it, but fragrances are not returnable.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FRIST TIME I BOUY THIS FRAGANCE SO I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO COMPARE WITH.  BUT IT IS VERY OILY, IT BARELY SMELLS, IT DOESNT LAST THAT MUCH... I BOUGHT IT FOR MY FATHER, HE HATED IT AND GAVE IT TO ME... I GAVE IT A TRY BUT IT IS ALMOST AS NEW BECAUSE NOBODY USES IT... I WOULDNT BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> This cologne is great because it&#x27;s got a great \\&quot;clean\\&quot; almost \\&quot;crisp\\&quot; scent to it. I&#x27;ve had other colognes that ended up smelling a little too sweet or musky but this one is just clean. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this cologne not lasting long etc etc, it&#x27;s great!! lasts all day and for this price?! amazing!! get it!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased Nautica Oceans for men.  The fragrance is subtle, not overpowering.  It may not last a long time after applied but it&#x27;s long enough to receive compliments from others.  If I did not like the product, I would not have purchased it again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It smells great. Best cologne! I dont like the fact this product is being discontinued. :(</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really clean &amp; fresh. I bought it for a friend, and he likes it very much. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like someone else here, I tested this at Target. They had about 10 different fragrances to try and the others were all women&#x27;s celebrity perfumes like Mariah Carey and Liz Taylor. They had one man&#x27;s scent, Tim Mcgraw. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a  mens or womens scent but I had tested a Nautica cologne several months earlier and really liked it. It was very fresh and this is the same way.  Different than the other Nautica I tried but just as good in scent. When I got home I looked up &#x27;Nautica Oceans&#x27; and it&#x27;s for a man! I really think though that this could be a unisex perfume. Unlike another reviewer who said it only lasted 5 minutes for them, it lasted a long very time on the spot I sprayed it and kept smelling good until I eventually washed it off. Giving 5 stars, very beautiful and not overpowering. It&#x27;s definitely not a woody/oriental type scent, more beachy and clean. I could see wearing this everyday. Definitely a new favorite!</li>
            <li> Well, get timely&lt;br /&gt;The product fulfilled my expectations&lt;br /&gt;good seller&lt;br /&gt;Good fragrance&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure buy again&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> While I LOVE this fragrance, i have to warn potential customers to avoid buying from this site. I just received my order and am so disappointed. This cologne is supposed to be clear and is supposed to smell better than what I received.  Clearly what I got was a VERY old bottle of this great fragrance.  BE WARNED only buy this product from a store where you can examine it first. If it is not CLEAR, stay away!! AMAZON should be ashamed for selling this CRAP to it&#x27;s customers. And I can&#x27;t even return it!!!!</li>
            <li> Nautica really outdid itself with Oceans - the light, citrus scent with notes of sea salt and teak is masculine and energizing.  Coworkers have often complimented me on this scent, and asked what brand of cologne I was wearing.  Other reviewers have noted that the scent is barely detectable, but I believe that was the goal of this cologne - not too overpowering, but still adding that extra dash of sophistication to the daily work schedule or for a nice evening out.  For these reasons, Oceans is my scent of choice.  I hope that the company plans to re-release this scent in the near future because my supply is running low.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my brother for christmas it had arrvived just in time for me to wrap it up and throw it under the tree. It was a nice sized bottle my brothwr still has it fo this day. I didnt know how good it smelt i had half a mind to keep it myself;)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and versatile scent that works well as an everyday spray to a date night cologne.  It is very much warm yet also clean; with a light, powdery, airy aroma. Coupled with sharp notes up to the very edge of masculine. Could even be considered unisex; as I&#x27;ve noticed that it appeals to both men and women. The one downside is that the initial note can be very lemony, yet still its probably the most balanced scent I&#x27;ve ever worn. I&#x27;ve also found it to be fairly long lasting for its softness. You don&#x27;t always notice it on you; but it is so delicately arousing that for another to even get a whiff, is to command intimacy.</li>
            <li> Bought for gifts and it arrived very nice wrap already.  I haven&#x27;t given to the person yet...let&#x27;s see how much he likes it.  I felt the S&amp;H was a bit high.  Anyway...for the price you can&#x27;t bit it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Pump was defective and hard to press. Kept it anyway.</li>
            <li> The package was received on the first day it was expected and the recipient was delighted.  The price was reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal or a fake but scent does not last long at all. Not buying this again.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing...extremely oily and watery. Cheap knock off at best!!</li>
            <li> This was a present, arrived safe and secure.</li>
            <li> Because the items cap was broken and was leaking. The person that received the Cologne was happy with it and loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> a pretty decent scent.  received several compliments everytime I used this cologne at social events or special engagement.  for the price, this is a bang for the buck..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I have found a Nautica type yet, that I don&#x27;t like.  This is another great one; my hubby smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Nice, clean scent that works all year.  It does tend to fade a little quicker than some, but otherwise recommended.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about. the item as described, even better for me.  great fragance, .&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this amazing perfum.</li>
            <li> Great aroma... is soft  but very great aroma.. i really like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is water based so they used a solution that feels oily.. for me it has last more than other sprays</li>
            <li> A soft, delicate fragrance, yet masculine, that isn&#x27;t offensive to those around you.</li>
            <li> They were in stick so I purchased it, after waiting about 2-3weeks they emailed me saying they were out of stock and would I like a different one, I said no and asked for my money back. It was supposed to take 2-3 days to go back in my account its been 5 days</li>
