            <li>Not as strong as others I have ordered so it takes more to do the job.</li>
            <li>I have made face scribe, body sugar scribe, soap, and many other wonderful smelling things that spring to life with this product.</li>
            <li>Pure peppermint oil, is really good</li>

            <li>I hope I&#x27;m not jinxing myself by writing this review too soon, but as of right now this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that they chose glass over plastic (chemicals from plastic can leech out) and the dropper is a nice touch for getting the right amount and not wasting any.</li>
            <li>A definite good buy!</li>
            <li>it not only got rid of mice, it makes my house smell good!</li>

            <li>Strong scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This product is too strong.</li>
            <li>I want it for aroma therapy purposes to relax and it&#x27;s just too strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and not flimsy and works well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an issue if you are going for the cooling benefits but this oil doesn&#x27;t have a strong candy cane fragrance.</li>
            <li>Naturals Peppermint Oil has a high concentration of menthol and menthone, which lends itself to its bright minty scent.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it medically useful for headaches, tummy aches, stress, and a mood changer, but its also wonderful as part of routine beauty regiments, and even around the home for its enlightening aroma that makes peppermint loving humans smile, but rodents and pest flee!  </li>

            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve experienced some pain in my upper arm.</li>
            <li>I was offered this product for free in exchanged for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel happy on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The aroma is soothing, and I enjoy using it on my skin (diluted with jojoba oil) or in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>and I allergy free.</li>
            <li>There are certainly many other uses, peppermint is warming and is great for pains like headaches, tummy aches, nausea and fever.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>At first the smell was a little overwhelming as it is concentrated, but once diluted it is very pleasant.  </li>

            <li>This product is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be and more.</li>
            <li>By rubbing this around windows, and along corners, I have noticed a significant reduction in spiders in the room.  </li>
            <li>and of course i do use it in a tiny crockpot for fragrance and sprayed my rug with it just to make sure my home smells fresh, word to the wise one drop of oil in a oil burner or crockpot</li>
            <li>The product is also environmentally friendly and is NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I think essential oils must be made with some kind of voodoo!</li>

            <li>Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, to everyone as you are sure to find a reason to incorporate this product into your routine.  </li>
            <li>We were hoping to find something a bit more affordable than the Doterra oils and because of this products claims, being 100% pure with no fillers, we gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>For me, it doesn’t bother me since I love certain scents.</li>
            <li>But then I put a couple drops in the corners of the shower and it cleared me right up!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying essential oil and it work great</li>
            <li>*Full disclosure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full 4 oz.</li>
            <li>but when I put in my skin didn&#x27;t feel too much of cool feeling.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops of goPURE Peppermint oil in a warm bath and soaked for the last 3 nights and I am experiencing wonderful results!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite use is to keep the mice away.</li>
            <li>You need to remember to dilute it either with carrier oil like coconut, olive oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, or water.</li>
            <li>Nicely cool peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>I made a chocolate peppermint patty soap that smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>I spray outside and in side to keep the house smell good and to help keep spiders away</li>
            <li>A friend of mine purchased a very small bottle from a mall store and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>and it smells clean and fresh in the house.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>, it makes the house feel fresh and clean and puts everyone a ease.</li>
            <li>goPure made sure the actual packaging was cared for so the product didn’t break in shipping which was interesting too.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It is a very good quality Peppermint Oil as I&#x27;ve bought others in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of peppermint  oil and thus far  this is the best.</li>
            <li>Got this first free off of tomoson</li>
            <li>very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Receiving a sample for bottle for review from a brand new to me, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but kept an openmind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle, the smell is amazing, and it is great to use with other products to make natural lip balm, lotions, bath scrubs, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed extremely quickly</li>
            <li>There really aren&#x27;t too many directions on the bottle except that it should not be applied in the eyes, and that it is best to mix it with another carrier oil, such as almond, olive, or jojoba when you are using it for something other than aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>use it daily so finding one I absolutely love is a score!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a weak hydrosol at best.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>So I thank you for all your hard work making this product so pure and wonderful smelling.</li>
            <li>goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil comes in a huge 4 oz bottle with a cap.  </li>
            <li>I understand that there are certainly different varieties of herbs that grow and perhaps this is just a less potent type of peppermint plant .....or perhaps this helps prove Doterra&#x27;s claims that they really do have some of the best oils on the market!  </li>
            <li>Help overcome mild to moderate depression and anxiety by its bright, refreshing scent, which has been shown by modern research to stimulate regions of the brain, which has a direct impact on the body, emotions and mind.   </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different brands and found them to be ok,but I have to say that I did a lot of research on go pure peppermint oil and found lots of good reviews</li>
            <li>In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this wonderful pure cold pressed peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>Amazing essential oil!</li>
            <li>but i was enjoy this just way to much, let me explain it has been about a week since i got in the peppermint oil</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days my house is greatly scented with an invigorating minty scent through out.</li>
            <li>So far no bugs :-)</li>
            <li>goPure Natural includes the glass dropper, which I appreciated because it makes application so much easier, and safe packaging to ensure safe usage.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>, I did not have any success with it repelling mosq.</li>
            <li>I use it in addition to non-scented beard oils, to give my morning routine a fresh kick.</li>
            <li>This eye dropper was broken, but the quality of the oil is excellent</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>As an expecting mom I love that I can use this oil to prevent spiders and bugs from coming near where I put drops.</li>
            <li>I love using this when I have a stuffy nose or a headache because it can really clear my sinuses and get rid of my headache.</li>
            <li>If I was using it purely for the scent then it might bug me but it is very cooling and that is what matters to me most right now.</li>
            <li>goPure&#x27;s has stayed fresh throughout my use of the product.</li>
            <li>Our opinions .Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free for the purpose of product review on my blog.</li>

            <li>I have been taking the plunge on a more natural way to go about things.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil has a nice clean smell that one looks for in pure essential oils.  </li>
            <li>so im excited to test this product out will give this a week and be back with a better review on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Peppermint oil contains a high concentration of menthol, which creates a cooling sensation and reduces pain and itching better than many commercial products.  </li>
            <li>Peppermint Oil is also good to keep other bugs like ants and spiders at bay.</li>
            <li>Nice, crisp smell that I use almost daily.</li>
            <li>The bottle will last a long time, which is good news, since I love using goPure Peppermint Oil so much!</li>
            <li>What I expected was an oil with a strong, potent, peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a week and while I do still find it a little more woody scented than other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used before I don&#x27;t really mind because it works great!</li>
            <li>most can&#x27;t even begin to pronoun, with this one large bottle of just 1 all natural ingredient.  </li>
            <li>but I quickly didn&#x27;t notice much difference after living with the goPURE for awhile.</li>
            <li>A few drops inside of a quarter cup of baking soda mixed with a quarter of a cup of coconut oil and now I have a delicious mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have not seen any in our home thanks to this peppermint oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>peppermint oil arrived in a sealed bottle with a glass dropper and the oil was very clear and the light viscosity one expects of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>Yesterday my 4yr old&#x27;s head was hurting, so I used a bit of this oil topically and within 20 minutes he can running into my room super excited to tell me his head didn&#x27;t hurt any more</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like this one</li>
            <li>This essential Oils are my new favorite thing!</li>
            <li>Wow.  HUGE Bottle.  </li>
            <li>It worked pretty well and calmed the aches and pains I was experiencing.</li>
            <li>It lasted longer than some of the more commercial products.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t seem to find my diffuser, I added a couple drops to a hot bottle of water and put it on my night stand.</li>
            <li>I think it’s great because one bottle can last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>mostly use this essential oil on my hair.</li>
            <li>The aroma is very relaxing!  </li>
            <li>have used this product as an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal first aid kit.  </li>

            <li>When I first opened the bottle I was relieved that the smell was not overbearing.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use it in many different ways.</li>
            <li>Promotes overall health by encouraging healthy blood flow   </li>
            <li>in many of the ways I have described above</li>
            <li>Lord knows we don’t need one more thing to stress about, especially something like allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first use for this was for headaches, I have them and they are the bane of my existence.</li>
            <li>I placed a few drops in some of the coconut oil and gave them a good shake to mix them up.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a high quality product, came quickly.</li>
            <li>The 4-ounce bottle is large, and since the oil is so potent, I only use a drop or two at a time.</li>
            <li>Smells great, you don&#x27;t need much at all so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Create your own insect repellant:   Dab on repellant: 40-50 drops of peppermint oil to 8 oz of coconut oil (or other carrier oil)   Spray on repellant: 2-4 oz of witch</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, make sure you read up on them before using them.</li>
            <li>Overall I am thrilled with this Peppermint Oil and if you are looking for something natural</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a pretty large amount</li>
            <li>and I thought I would be smart to get it since it was so much bigger and had such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the taste and freshness but also the effect as your body absorbs it - after a heavy meal or on boated days, it helps for real and you feel relaxed and calm.</li>
            <li>So my first test of this was to see if it is really all it is supposed to be when it comes to headaches.</li>
            <li>There is no heavy sweet or chemical smell to them.</li>
            <li>Finding quality natural ingredients is important to me, so I was excited to try the goPure peppermint essential oil.  </li>
            <li>oil comes in a large 4 ounce bottle with a glass dropper wrapped separately in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>product, goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, comes in a large, amber colored glass bottle with a teal label.  </li>
            <li>large size for the money</li>
            <li>I want to know how it is made and if it really is pure.</li>
            <li>Pure peppermint oil at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>It does not contain any harmful chemicals or additives and is 100% pure peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>I was selected to review this 100% pure Peppermint Oil from GoPure Naturals on Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Therapeutic Grade A. Large 4 oz.</li>
            <li>This product has no additives, it is 100% pure mentha peperita made from peppermint leaves and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>This oil is just 100% pure peppermint oil, no harmful chemicals, no additives, no preservatives and no added fragrances ~ along with no animal testing  </li>
            <li>I just stir a couple of drops of my pure peppermint oil into a glass of water and drink.    </li>
            <li>100% Pure Peppermint Oil  </li>
            <li>It smells intensive like peppermint but still decent!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a pretty decent size and comes with a glass (yes I said glass)</li>
            <li>And thanks for making a large bottle with a glass dropper.</li>
            <li>uses all around the house so the large bottle is very economical.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price for how much you get and how little you need to use to produce the desired effect is spectacular.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a great product,  I firmly believe every home should have 100% Pure Peppermint Oil.  </li>
            <li>Also got huge hives and red burns around inside of lips.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops in my vacume filter to make my house smell amazing.</li>
            <li>It helped to keep my congestion low and made the bedroom smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not one that believes too much in homeopathic remedies, but nothing else worked, so he decided to try it</li>
            <li>It was very invigorating and helped keep me awake and alert.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product, goPURE</li>
            <li>It was very invigorating and helped keep me awake and alert.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product, goPURE</li>
            <li>this has caused me much harm.  </li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the dropper that is included</li>
            <li>depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>and it really helped.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much to get the effects i need.</li>
            <li>It is very multipurpose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is very cooling but watch out for your eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve created a muscle rub for sore muscles and it is very relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a plastic lotion pot with a lid (CeraVe was in it) that i use to mix a fragrance free lotion and several drops of the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing on aching joints and muscles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>and I think it really worked.  </li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>This stuff should include a warning, really it shouldn&#x27;t be sold at all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get anything else, this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Water and this oil won&#x27;t mix but shake your bottle and the mixture becomes milky and ready to be used -</li>
            <li>and was really strobg tasting that I could not finish my cup however using it in my diffuser to scent my house it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>My whole downstairs of my house smells like peppermint.</li>
            <li>; moments you see in commercials, haha.</li>
            <li>There is no guarantee with our reviews and we will not we be held responsible if you decide to purchase an item and</li>
            <li>i have used it with a carrier oil for headache relief and also in a lipbalm recipe it worked very well for both.</li>
            <li>We all know how much of a headache those can be, literally, I can feel the ghost like symptoms now.</li>
            <li>Just add a few drops to warm water, and yes it does relieve headaches.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very potent, and extremely long lasting.</li>
            <li>Go Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is steam distilled oil with a nice strongish mint that has a slight sweet smell,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Very pure and natural</li>
            <li>Sure took care of my upset stomach due to Vertigo.</li>
            <li>I also use this to make sure ants and other bugs stay out of my house.</li>
            <li>The original peppermint aroma that my mom initially used had faded.  </li>
            <li>So the other thing I head outstanding things about is using this as a foot soak.</li>
            <li>This is a Grade A and therapeutic Grade peppermint oil that is made out of pure, high quality peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>and then I applied this product to an open cut to clean, sterilize, and disinfect.  </li>
            <li>This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  </li>

            <li>This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li>We had a colony of small ants living under our welcome mat outside.  </li>
            <li>You can barely smell the peppermint unless you hold your nose directly over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Returned and reordering from someone that&#x27;s reviews are not made by all people that got a free bottle or discount for their opinion.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice little dropper and can&#x27;t wait to use in my home to keep the pests out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic product to have in your home for the variety of benefits it offers, but I personally used it mostly for mental clarity.</li>
            <li>It has such a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>its all natural, no weird syntactic odor.  </li>
            <li>essential sweet orange oil   20 drops goPure Naturals peppermint</li>
            <li>It is crystal clear and has an intense, pure aroma that is almost intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this product, and it’s one of my favorites in my essential oil</li>
            <li>I mainly put it in a diffuser and it works wonders for clearing up your longs/sinuses.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle for barely more than you usually pay for the tiny bottles.</li>
            <li>The oil is highly concentrated.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This seems really high quality.</li>
            <li>Use with other essential oils and carrier oil to make your own fragrance  </li>
            <li>Also used a little to freshen potpourri because I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It works very well to help clear the congestion from allergies.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it leaves a fresh mint smell in the room.  </li>
            <li>From making the dog feel fresh, to home maid facial scrub, fights migraines, reduces nausea.</li>
            <li>Most of the other oils I&#x27;ve purchased had the plastic insert inside the mouth of the bottle that regulates the flow to a drop or so at a time, so this is a little easy to get too much if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Some actually built webs right where I would spray.</li>
            <li>Being a loyal fan of White Flower Analgesic Balm for nearly all my life I decided it was time to try something new that didn’t leave my home smelling like a hospital.</li>
            <li>and I think the ants thought they had found a new home.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live this....</li>
            <li>Now they are like new and so Christmasy.</li>
            <li>Peppermint Oil is the world&#x27;s most widely used essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and apparently it was not pure - the smell and texture quickly deteriorated a week after I first used it.</li>
            <li>We state our opinions very clearly and our product reviews are just that.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the size of the bottle when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Very strong so start with a small amount!</li>
            <li>truly is a Wow factor product!  </li>
            <li>truly is a Wow factor product!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a natural bug repellant for ants, spiders, cockroaches, mosquitoes and even mice!</li>
            <li>and I usually buy up as many bath &amp; body products in peppermint as I can - body wash, hand soap, lotion, lip balm, you name it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but no flies nothing wanted to even go near this!</li>
            <li>Seem to be working so far!</li>
            <li>Gets rid of cooking smells in an apartment on hot humid days when you can&#x27;t open a window.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>It is cold pressed so it has kept all of its healing value and beautiful aroma.</li>
            <li>I am sure (and so sold in this that I am now likely to try their other products)</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>but it possibly could if consistently used.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely be buying this brand in the future when I finally run out of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The type on the labelling could use a little work, but it’s easily read and not lost in the background.</li>
            <li>My cough hasn’t been as strong so far since using it though I’m not sure how much it has impacted my cough.</li>
            <li>I sometimes also use a few drops with my shampoo for a nice cooling effect or in the shower when congested, a few drops as you run a hot shower will help clear out your nose.</li>
            <li>product is 100% pure therapeutic grade premium quality essential peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>Peppermint-Orange Salt Foot Scrub:  I love caring for my feet, and this scrub will help remove dead skin, exfoliates and smooth away the rough dry skin, while softening your feet.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pure and natural as possible.</li>
            <li>Since this is 100% pure oil, if used directly on skin, it must be diluted, either with water or a carrier oil, such coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, olive or almond oil.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time trusting companies any more.  </li>
            <li>Very high grade essential oil.</li>
            <li>I use this in a diffuser to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>Helps clear the sinuses too.</li>
            <li>Clear oil.</li>
            <li>I did also try this in my waer placing 5 drops in about 12 ouces of water as I have heard it helps with depression and was also hoping that it would help clear some of the ccongestion in my chest</li>
            <li>you’re a cautious parent like me: you’re probably searching for natural remedies that will help get rid of the sickness.</li>
            <li>I know that it can be used in a natural toothpaste &amp; I&#x27;m going to try that too.</li>
            <li>is the purest peppermint oil that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>It can be used for an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic, plus a natural disinfectant that you can use in the kitchen or around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this Peppermint Oil as I had read about using it as a natural pest control without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Some peppermint oils have a old smell.</li>
            <li>no sign of these pest anywhere thus far since using . .</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it for headache</li>
            <li>I suffer from headaches and use the oil frequently as it helps alleviate the pain instead of popping pills.</li>
            <li>Came completely sealed with a glass dropper as described.</li>
            <li>I even put a few drops in my morning coffee &amp; it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a natural air freshener or as an inhalant for stuffy noses or nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dilute it rather I placed drops directly into my window pane near the screen.</li>
            <li>Peppermint Oil is a natural way to go for remedies&lt;br /&gt;for sinus issues and headache relief.</li>
            <li>I am not a beauty professional.</li>
            <li>A natural insect and rodent repellant</li>
            <li>Add to your cleaning routine around your home and office, as peppermint oil is anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic and will help disinfect your home naturally.   </li>
            <li>I have been using goPure Natural’s</li>
            <li>I did receive a bottle complimentary for review purposes, but I&#x27;ll definitely come back to this brand once this bottle is done.</li>
            <li>So the basics are simple a few drops of this in a spray bottle rest water and goodbye bugs, ok i also went nuts inside spraying the doors the windows</li>
            <li>Since grinding does produce heat due to friction, the temperature must not rise above 120°F (49°C) and the best cold pressed oils are made at much lower temperatures.  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t quite sure what I was expecting to be completely different since I have seen a couple of other essential oils.</li>
            <li>(120 ml) amber glass bottle protects the oil from light and it comes with both a plain cap and a glass dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that’s exactly what I want from my essential oils especially since I use them on my family.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular one because it is a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a high grade essential oil!  </li>
            <li>I also tried it to clear my sinuses, a couple sniffs here and there, it didn&#x27;t do much or for very long.</li>
            <li>This is the second time we&#x27;ve purchased this product from amazon/goPure Naturals, and I&#x27;m positive it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this pure cold pressed peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>I am still new to essential oils</li>
            <li>Last week my neck was really bothering me, so I put Peppermint Oil on my temples and all over the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.  </li>
            <li>It is potent and only took a small amount to add scent to an entire batch of soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect when you have a cold or need a little energizing boost!</li>
            <li>The body is large for oil and it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I will have to find some things to do with this oil, cause a little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>Taking internally, Peppermint helps with digestive issue, as it has a high concentration of essential minerals like magnesium, potassium and calcium.  </li>
            <li>goPure Naturals offers a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I diffuse it frequently and use it topically as well.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it in spray bottle to get rid of the ants and it worked!</li>
            <li>The texture should be a barely moist salt rub.  </li>
            <li>began using essential oils at home making all natural soaps.  </li>
            <li>This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s</li>
            <li>This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s</li>
            <li>usage is a few drop in a fresh glass of water.</li>
            <li>Having the dropper makes it much easier when mixing with other things.</li>
            <li>A bit powerful, I should have used less for the vegan ice cream recipe, but not Go Pure&#x27;s issue, my heavy hand.  </li>
            <li>However, I was surprised this specific one came with an actual cap instead of just the eyedropper.</li>
            <li>When my kids are running a temperature, I combine raw coconut oil with a drop or two of goPURE Naturals peppermint essential oil and rub it on the bottom of their feet then throw on some socks and like magic it brings the fever down after an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Compared to what you&#x27;ll pay trying to pick this up from a store for a much smaller (and in my opinion less potent/natural) amount, this is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li>I am not too into holistic medicine or essentials oils as some people I know, but I am a big fan of general aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>, i took a clear spray bottle added 3 drops of the peppermint oil and the rest water and went to work spraying the outside of my tiny place, now not only did the spiders run but</li>
            <li>surprised it’s not completely used up by now</li>
            <li>when my husband sinuses are bothering him I will put a few drops in a cup of hot water and as he inhales the vapors he finds relief.</li>
            <li>I first had a tingling sensation but after a few minutes it subsided and within 15 minutes my headache was gone.</li>
            <li>It does not smell much like peppermint, and, in fact, smells like a cross between hospital disinfectant and cow manure.  </li>
            <li>I have been adding a little bit of pure peppermint oil in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research since I have heard both good and bad and figured the only way I am going to figure out whether or not this is going to work for me is to try it.</li>

            <li> add water or you will have to shut it off to add more water because it will be to strong for you to stand it.</li>

            <li> I hope I&#x27;m not jinxing myself by writing this review too soon, but as of right now this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that they chose glass over plastic (chemicals from plastic can leech out) and the dropper is a nice touch for getting the right amount and not wasting any.</li>
            <li> A definite good buy!</li>
            <li> it not only got rid of mice, it makes my house smell good!</li>

            <li> Strong scent, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This product is too strong.</li>
            <li> I want it for aroma therapy purposes to relax and it&#x27;s just too strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and not flimsy and works well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an issue if you are going for the cooling benefits but this oil doesn&#x27;t have a strong candy cane fragrance.</li>
            <li> Naturals Peppermint Oil has a high concentration of menthol and menthone, which lends itself to its bright minty scent.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it medically useful for headaches, tummy aches, stress, and a mood changer, but its also wonderful as part of routine beauty regiments, and even around the home for its enlightening aroma that makes peppermint loving humans smile, but rodents and pest flee!  </li>

            <li> my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve experienced some pain in my upper arm.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product for free in exchanged for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel happy on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The aroma is soothing, and I enjoy using it on my skin (diluted with jojoba oil) or in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> and I allergy free.</li>
            <li> There are certainly many other uses, peppermint is warming and is great for pains like headaches, tummy aches, nausea and fever.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> At first the smell was a little overwhelming as it is concentrated, but once diluted it is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> so I was more than happy to test &amp; review this Pure Peppermint Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I liked that this product offers both lid options for easy usage and travel</li>
            <li> Great Peppermint Oil with strong slightly bitter peppermint odor.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find a recipe with this product to help reduce and relieve them.  </li>
            <li> This product significantly helped control my headaches and reduced the length and occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be and more.</li>
            <li> By rubbing this around windows, and along corners, I have noticed a significant reduction in spiders in the room.  </li>
            <li> and of course i do use it in a tiny crockpot for fragrance and sprayed my rug with it just to make sure my home smells fresh, word to the wise one drop of oil in a oil burner or crockpot</li>
            <li> The product is also environmentally friendly and is NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I think essential oils must be made with some kind of voodoo!</li>
            <li> Excited for all the ways I can use it.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses, you certainly can never call it useless.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review.</li>

            <li> Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, to everyone as you are sure to find a reason to incorporate this product into your routine.  </li>
            <li> Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, to everyone as you are sure to find a reason to incorporate this product into your routine.  </li>
            <li> We were hoping to find something a bit more affordable than the Doterra oils and because of this products claims, being 100% pure with no fillers, we gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> For me, it doesn’t bother me since I love certain scents.</li>
            <li> But then I put a couple drops in the corners of the shower and it cleared me right up!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying essential oil and it work great</li>
            <li> *Full disclosure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full 4 oz.</li>
            <li> but when I put in my skin didn&#x27;t feel too much of cool feeling.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of goPURE Peppermint oil in a warm bath and soaked for the last 3 nights and I am experiencing wonderful results!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite use is to keep the mice away.</li>
            <li> You need to remember to dilute it either with carrier oil like coconut, olive oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, or water.</li>
            <li> Nicely cool peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> I made a chocolate peppermint patty soap that smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> I spray outside and in side to keep the house smell good and to help keep spiders away</li>
            <li> A friend of mine purchased a very small bottle from a mall store and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> and it smells clean and fresh in the house.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> , it makes the house feel fresh and clean and puts everyone a ease.</li>
            <li> goPure made sure the actual packaging was cared for so the product didn’t break in shipping which was interesting too.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is a very good quality Peppermint Oil as I&#x27;ve bought others in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of peppermint  oil and thus far  this is the best.</li>
            <li> Got this first free off of tomoson</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Receiving a sample for bottle for review from a brand new to me, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but kept an openmind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle, the smell is amazing, and it is great to use with other products to make natural lip balm, lotions, bath scrubs, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed extremely quickly</li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t too many directions on the bottle except that it should not be applied in the eyes, and that it is best to mix it with another carrier oil, such as almond, olive, or jojoba when you are using it for something other than aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li> use it daily so finding one I absolutely love is a score!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weak hydrosol at best.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> So I thank you for all your hard work making this product so pure and wonderful smelling.</li>
            <li> goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil comes in a huge 4 oz bottle with a cap.  </li>
            <li> I understand that there are certainly different varieties of herbs that grow and perhaps this is just a less potent type of peppermint plant .....or perhaps this helps prove Doterra&#x27;s claims that they really do have some of the best oils on the market!  </li>
            <li> Help overcome mild to moderate depression and anxiety by its bright, refreshing scent, which has been shown by modern research to stimulate regions of the brain, which has a direct impact on the body, emotions and mind.   </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands and found them to be ok,but I have to say that I did a lot of research on go pure peppermint oil and found lots of good reviews</li>
            <li> In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this wonderful pure cold pressed peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Amazing essential oil!</li>
            <li> but i was enjoy this just way to much, let me explain it has been about a week since i got in the peppermint oil</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days my house is greatly scented with an invigorating minty scent through out.</li>
            <li> So far no bugs :-)</li>
            <li> goPure Natural includes the glass dropper, which I appreciated because it makes application so much easier, and safe packaging to ensure safe usage.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> , I did not have any success with it repelling mosq.</li>
            <li> I use it in addition to non-scented beard oils, to give my morning routine a fresh kick.</li>
            <li> This eye dropper was broken, but the quality of the oil is excellent</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> As an expecting mom I love that I can use this oil to prevent spiders and bugs from coming near where I put drops.</li>
            <li> I love using this when I have a stuffy nose or a headache because it can really clear my sinuses and get rid of my headache.</li>
            <li> If I was using it purely for the scent then it might bug me but it is very cooling and that is what matters to me most right now.</li>
            <li> goPure&#x27;s has stayed fresh throughout my use of the product.</li>
            <li> Our opinions .Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free for the purpose of product review on my blog.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the plunge on a more natural way to go about things.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil has a nice clean smell that one looks for in pure essential oils.  </li>
            <li> so im excited to test this product out will give this a week and be back with a better review on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Peppermint oil contains a high concentration of menthol, which creates a cooling sensation and reduces pain and itching better than many commercial products.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint Oil is also good to keep other bugs like ants and spiders at bay.</li>
            <li> Nice, crisp smell that I use almost daily.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time, which is good news, since I love using goPure Peppermint Oil so much!</li>
            <li> What I expected was an oil with a strong, potent, peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a week and while I do still find it a little more woody scented than other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used before I don&#x27;t really mind because it works great!</li>
            <li> most can&#x27;t even begin to pronoun, with this one large bottle of just 1 all natural ingredient.  </li>
            <li> but I quickly didn&#x27;t notice much difference after living with the goPURE for awhile.</li>
            <li> A few drops inside of a quarter cup of baking soda mixed with a quarter of a cup of coconut oil and now I have a delicious mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have not seen any in our home thanks to this peppermint oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> peppermint oil arrived in a sealed bottle with a glass dropper and the oil was very clear and the light viscosity one expects of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Yesterday my 4yr old&#x27;s head was hurting, so I used a bit of this oil topically and within 20 minutes he can running into my room super excited to tell me his head didn&#x27;t hurt any more</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like this one</li>
            <li> This essential Oils are my new favorite thing!</li>
            <li> Wow.  HUGE Bottle.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well and calmed the aches and pains I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> It lasted longer than some of the more commercial products.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t seem to find my diffuser, I added a couple drops to a hot bottle of water and put it on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I think it’s great because one bottle can last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> mostly use this essential oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> The aroma is very relaxing!  </li>
            <li> have used this product as an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal first aid kit.  </li>

            <li> Love the big size bottle!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will last me practically forever.</li>
            <li> Also love to use this with oil to add it to sugar facial scrubs.  </li>
            <li> The price is higher than the one I purchased</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like my doTERRA peppermint oil and is cheaper for 8 times the size of that bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this essential oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using essential oils.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this brand from now on</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am aware of the responsibilities and implications involved in  writing reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the bottle is so big</li>
            <li> I held my breath most of the time and was out the door in minutes, but about 15 minutes later I had a severe sore throat.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle I was relieved that the smell was not overbearing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazing product that works for many different things.  </li>
            <li> My favorite carrier oil to use with this essential oil is also by</li>
            <li> Lovely mixed with lavender and Rosemary for destressing.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it in many different ways.</li>
            <li> Promotes overall health by encouraging healthy blood flow   </li>
            <li> in many of the ways I have described above</li>
            <li> Lord knows we don’t need one more thing to stress about, especially something like allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first use for this was for headaches, I have them and they are the bane of my existence.</li>
            <li> I placed a few drops in some of the coconut oil and gave them a good shake to mix them up.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a high quality product, came quickly.</li>
            <li> The 4-ounce bottle is large, and since the oil is so potent, I only use a drop or two at a time.</li>
            <li> Smells great, you don&#x27;t need much at all so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Create your own insect repellant:   Dab on repellant: 40-50 drops of peppermint oil to 8 oz of coconut oil (or other carrier oil)   Spray on repellant: 2-4 oz of witch</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, make sure you read up on them before using them.</li>
            <li> Overall I am thrilled with this Peppermint Oil and if you are looking for something natural</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a pretty large amount</li>
            <li> and I thought I would be smart to get it since it was so much bigger and had such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the taste and freshness but also the effect as your body absorbs it - after a heavy meal or on boated days, it helps for real and you feel relaxed and calm.</li>
            <li> So my first test of this was to see if it is really all it is supposed to be when it comes to headaches.</li>
            <li> There is no heavy sweet or chemical smell to them.</li>
            <li> Finding quality natural ingredients is important to me, so I was excited to try the goPure peppermint essential oil.  </li>
            <li> oil comes in a large 4 ounce bottle with a glass dropper wrapped separately in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> product, goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, comes in a large, amber colored glass bottle with a teal label.  </li>
            <li> large size for the money</li>
            <li> I want to know how it is made and if it really is pure.</li>
            <li> Pure peppermint oil at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> It does not contain any harmful chemicals or additives and is 100% pure peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I was selected to review this 100% pure Peppermint Oil from GoPure Naturals on Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Therapeutic Grade A. Large 4 oz.</li>
            <li> This product has no additives, it is 100% pure mentha peperita made from peppermint leaves and it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> This oil is just 100% pure peppermint oil, no harmful chemicals, no additives, no preservatives and no added fragrances ~ along with no animal testing  </li>
            <li> I just stir a couple of drops of my pure peppermint oil into a glass of water and drink.    </li>
            <li> 100% Pure Peppermint Oil  </li>
            <li> It smells intensive like peppermint but still decent!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pretty decent size and comes with a glass (yes I said glass)</li>
            <li> And thanks for making a large bottle with a glass dropper.</li>
            <li> uses all around the house so the large bottle is very economical.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price for how much you get and how little you need to use to produce the desired effect is spectacular.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a great product,  I firmly believe every home should have 100% Pure Peppermint Oil.  </li>
            <li> Also got huge hives and red burns around inside of lips.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in my vacume filter to make my house smell amazing.</li>
            <li> It helped to keep my congestion low and made the bedroom smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not one that believes too much in homeopathic remedies, but nothing else worked, so he decided to try it</li>
            <li> It was very invigorating and helped keep me awake and alert.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product, goPURE</li>
            <li> It was very invigorating and helped keep me awake and alert.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product, goPURE</li>
            <li> this has caused me much harm.  </li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the dropper that is included</li>
            <li> depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> and it really helped.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much to get the effects i need.</li>
            <li> It is very multipurpose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is very cooling but watch out for your eyes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve created a muscle rub for sore muscles and it is very relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a plastic lotion pot with a lid (CeraVe was in it) that i use to mix a fragrance free lotion and several drops of the peppermint.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing on aching joints and muscles.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> and I think it really worked.  </li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> This stuff should include a warning, really it shouldn&#x27;t be sold at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get anything else, this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Water and this oil won&#x27;t mix but shake your bottle and the mixture becomes milky and ready to be used -</li>
            <li> and was really strobg tasting that I could not finish my cup however using it in my diffuser to scent my house it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile.  </li>
            <li> My whole downstairs of my house smells like peppermint.</li>
            <li> ; moments you see in commercials, haha.</li>
            <li> There is no guarantee with our reviews and we will not we be held responsible if you decide to purchase an item and</li>
            <li> i have used it with a carrier oil for headache relief and also in a lipbalm recipe it worked very well for both.</li>
            <li> We all know how much of a headache those can be, literally, I can feel the ghost like symptoms now.</li>
            <li> Just add a few drops to warm water, and yes it does relieve headaches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very potent, and extremely long lasting.</li>
            <li> Go Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is steam distilled oil with a nice strongish mint that has a slight sweet smell,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Very pure and natural</li>
            <li> Sure took care of my upset stomach due to Vertigo.</li>
            <li> I also use this to make sure ants and other bugs stay out of my house.</li>
            <li> The original peppermint aroma that my mom initially used had faded.  </li>
            <li> So the other thing I head outstanding things about is using this as a foot soak.</li>
            <li> This is a Grade A and therapeutic Grade peppermint oil that is made out of pure, high quality peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> and then I applied this product to an open cut to clean, sterilize, and disinfect.  </li>
            <li> This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li> and then I applied this product to an open cut to clean, sterilize, and disinfect.  </li>
            <li> This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li> We had a colony of small ants living under our welcome mat outside.  </li>
            <li> You can barely smell the peppermint unless you hold your nose directly over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Returned and reordering from someone that&#x27;s reviews are not made by all people that got a free bottle or discount for their opinion.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice little dropper and can&#x27;t wait to use in my home to keep the pests out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic product to have in your home for the variety of benefits it offers, but I personally used it mostly for mental clarity.</li>
            <li> It has such a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> its all natural, no weird syntactic odor.  </li>
            <li> essential sweet orange oil   20 drops goPure Naturals peppermint</li>
            <li> It is crystal clear and has an intense, pure aroma that is almost intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this product, and it’s one of my favorites in my essential oil</li>
            <li> I mainly put it in a diffuser and it works wonders for clearing up your longs/sinuses.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle for barely more than you usually pay for the tiny bottles.</li>
            <li> The oil is highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This seems really high quality.</li>
            <li> Use with other essential oils and carrier oil to make your own fragrance  </li>
            <li> Also used a little to freshen potpourri because I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> It works very well to help clear the congestion from allergies.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but it leaves a fresh mint smell in the room.  </li>
            <li> From making the dog feel fresh, to home maid facial scrub, fights migraines, reduces nausea.</li>
            <li> Most of the other oils I&#x27;ve purchased had the plastic insert inside the mouth of the bottle that regulates the flow to a drop or so at a time, so this is a little easy to get too much if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Some actually built webs right where I would spray.</li>
            <li> Being a loyal fan of White Flower Analgesic Balm for nearly all my life I decided it was time to try something new that didn’t leave my home smelling like a hospital.</li>
            <li> and I think the ants thought they had found a new home.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live this....</li>
            <li> Now they are like new and so Christmasy.</li>
            <li> Peppermint Oil is the world&#x27;s most widely used essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and apparently it was not pure - the smell and texture quickly deteriorated a week after I first used it.</li>
            <li> We state our opinions very clearly and our product reviews are just that.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the size of the bottle when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Very strong so start with a small amount!</li>
            <li> truly is a Wow factor product!  </li>
            <li> truly is a Wow factor product!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a natural bug repellant for ants, spiders, cockroaches, mosquitoes and even mice!</li>
            <li> and I usually buy up as many bath &amp; body products in peppermint as I can - body wash, hand soap, lotion, lip balm, you name it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no flies nothing wanted to even go near this!</li>
            <li> Seem to be working so far!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of cooking smells in an apartment on hot humid days when you can&#x27;t open a window.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> It is cold pressed so it has kept all of its healing value and beautiful aroma.</li>
            <li> I am sure (and so sold in this that I am now likely to try their other products)</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> but it possibly could if consistently used.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely be buying this brand in the future when I finally run out of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The type on the labelling could use a little work, but it’s easily read and not lost in the background.</li>
            <li> My cough hasn’t been as strong so far since using it though I’m not sure how much it has impacted my cough.</li>
            <li> I sometimes also use a few drops with my shampoo for a nice cooling effect or in the shower when congested, a few drops as you run a hot shower will help clear out your nose.</li>
            <li> product is 100% pure therapeutic grade premium quality essential peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint-Orange Salt Foot Scrub:  I love caring for my feet, and this scrub will help remove dead skin, exfoliates and smooth away the rough dry skin, while softening your feet.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pure and natural as possible.</li>
            <li> Since this is 100% pure oil, if used directly on skin, it must be diluted, either with water or a carrier oil, such coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, olive or almond oil.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time trusting companies any more.  </li>
            <li> Very high grade essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use this in a diffuser to clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Helps clear the sinuses too.</li>
            <li> Clear oil.</li>
            <li> I did also try this in my waer placing 5 drops in about 12 ouces of water as I have heard it helps with depression and was also hoping that it would help clear some of the ccongestion in my chest</li>
            <li> you’re a cautious parent like me: you’re probably searching for natural remedies that will help get rid of the sickness.</li>
            <li> I know that it can be used in a natural toothpaste &amp; I&#x27;m going to try that too.</li>
            <li> is the purest peppermint oil that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> It can be used for an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic, plus a natural disinfectant that you can use in the kitchen or around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this Peppermint Oil as I had read about using it as a natural pest control without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Some peppermint oils have a old smell.</li>
            <li> no sign of these pest anywhere thus far since using . .</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for headache</li>
            <li> I suffer from headaches and use the oil frequently as it helps alleviate the pain instead of popping pills.</li>
            <li> Came completely sealed with a glass dropper as described.</li>
            <li> I even put a few drops in my morning coffee &amp; it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a natural air freshener or as an inhalant for stuffy noses or nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dilute it rather I placed drops directly into my window pane near the screen.</li>
            <li> Peppermint Oil is a natural way to go for remedies&lt;br /&gt;for sinus issues and headache relief.</li>
            <li> I am not a beauty professional.</li>
            <li> A natural insect and rodent repellant</li>
            <li> Add to your cleaning routine around your home and office, as peppermint oil is anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic and will help disinfect your home naturally.   </li>
            <li> I have been using goPure Natural’s</li>
            <li> I did receive a bottle complimentary for review purposes, but I&#x27;ll definitely come back to this brand once this bottle is done.</li>
            <li> So the basics are simple a few drops of this in a spray bottle rest water and goodbye bugs, ok i also went nuts inside spraying the doors the windows</li>
            <li> Since grinding does produce heat due to friction, the temperature must not rise above 120°F (49°C) and the best cold pressed oils are made at much lower temperatures.  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t quite sure what I was expecting to be completely different since I have seen a couple of other essential oils.</li>
            <li> (120 ml) amber glass bottle protects the oil from light and it comes with both a plain cap and a glass dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that’s exactly what I want from my essential oils especially since I use them on my family.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular one because it is a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a high grade essential oil!  </li>
            <li> I also tried it to clear my sinuses, a couple sniffs here and there, it didn&#x27;t do much or for very long.</li>
            <li> This is the second time we&#x27;ve purchased this product from amazon/goPure Naturals, and I&#x27;m positive it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this pure cold pressed peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I am still new to essential oils</li>
            <li> Last week my neck was really bothering me, so I put Peppermint Oil on my temples and all over the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.  </li>
            <li> It is potent and only took a small amount to add scent to an entire batch of soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perfect when you have a cold or need a little energizing boost!</li>
            <li> The body is large for oil and it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I will have to find some things to do with this oil, cause a little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Taking internally, Peppermint helps with digestive issue, as it has a high concentration of essential minerals like magnesium, potassium and calcium.  </li>
            <li> goPure Naturals offers a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I diffuse it frequently and use it topically as well.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it in spray bottle to get rid of the ants and it worked!</li>
            <li> The texture should be a barely moist salt rub.  </li>
            <li> began using essential oils at home making all natural soaps.  </li>
            <li> This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s</li>
            <li> This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s</li>
            <li> usage is a few drop in a fresh glass of water.</li>
            <li> Having the dropper makes it much easier when mixing with other things.</li>
            <li> A bit powerful, I should have used less for the vegan ice cream recipe, but not Go Pure&#x27;s issue, my heavy hand.  </li>
            <li> However, I was surprised this specific one came with an actual cap instead of just the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> When my kids are running a temperature, I combine raw coconut oil with a drop or two of goPURE Naturals peppermint essential oil and rub it on the bottom of their feet then throw on some socks and like magic it brings the fever down after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Compared to what you&#x27;ll pay trying to pick this up from a store for a much smaller (and in my opinion less potent/natural) amount, this is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li> I am not too into holistic medicine or essentials oils as some people I know, but I am a big fan of general aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> , i took a clear spray bottle added 3 drops of the peppermint oil and the rest water and went to work spraying the outside of my tiny place, now not only did the spiders run but</li>
            <li> surprised it’s not completely used up by now</li>
            <li> when my husband sinuses are bothering him I will put a few drops in a cup of hot water and as he inhales the vapors he finds relief.</li>
            <li> I first had a tingling sensation but after a few minutes it subsided and within 15 minutes my headache was gone.</li>
            <li> It does not smell much like peppermint, and, in fact, smells like a cross between hospital disinfectant and cow manure.  </li>
            <li> I have been adding a little bit of pure peppermint oil in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research since I have heard both good and bad and figured the only way I am going to figure out whether or not this is going to work for me is to try it.</li>
            <li> Cold pressed oils will keep all of their aroma, flavor, and nutritional value, which makes them superior other oils.  </li>
            <li> One is completely gone, and the other is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> and comes with a glass pipette cap that can be used in place of the flat cap it comes packaged in.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I put the oil across my lower back, down the middle of my back and across my upper back.</li>
            <li> I put several drops in their humidifiers and used several drops to rub on my two girl’s chest, which helped open the airways due to the congestion.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come back for a long time!  </li>
            <li> With this size bottle it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Cold pressed peppermint oil is made from pressing and grinding the fresh aerial parts of the peppermint plant, either using a granite millstone or stainless steel presses.  </li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with Coconut Oil and applied it directly to the rash.  </li>
            <li> It has rained so much here lately</li>
            <li> just a few drops on forehead and temples pain clears up naturally</li>
            <li> It had a small effect but nothing like the Plant Therapy peppermint that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues all summer long.</li>
            <li> He then told me about his, too.....very strange.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still not completely well.</li>
            <li> I however have not used it long.</li>
            <li> I will say this made for a strange scent combination</li>
            <li> I wanted to try as many uses of peppermint oil as I could, and got the unfortunate chance to try some of the health remedy uses when I came down with bronchitis.</li>
            <li> For all other uses, carefully dilute with water or a carrier oil such as coconut, avocado, jojoba, grapeseed, sunflower, hazelnut, macadamia, olive, or almond oil prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some the uses</li>
            <li> This has helped a lot for my teens and children due to coming home from a public school with colds.  </li>
            <li> so you will have it for a long time!</li>
            <li> Will try in other ways as needed especially when outdoors.  </li>
            <li> My reason for wanting to test this product is due to my back and shoulder aches.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help dry up my breastmilk supply</li>
            <li> Then I started to get nauseated and dizzy and my entire respiratory tract was very irritated.</li>
            <li> I just transferred over a few drops into a spray bottle, mixed a little water in it and sprayed the areas inside our home where these ants, spiders and bugs could possibly find their way in (mainly near windows, door frames, cracks, dark areas like the fireplace or closets).</li>
            <li> I do wish the dropper was plastic and not glass though, as it would be less likely damaged - and wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about replacement if it were plastic and not glass.  </li>
            <li> Why is it important to know that this oil is cold pressed?  </li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water and swished it like mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water</li>
            <li> close to my nose and take a few sniff and shortly  thereafter  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Have been rubbing a few drops of it at my temples and on the back of my neck when I get a sinus headache</li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> product came sooner than expected which is always a plus.  </li>
            <li> Since we have pets and leave our door open for our dogs to come in and out as they please, a few drop arrow the corners for spiders and mice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much, only a few drops.</li>
            <li> We put some peppermint oil on cotton balls around the garage and a few days later our mouse population is almost gone.</li>
            <li> the taste just a bit on the bitter side when not blended with anything</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as expected.  </li>
            <li> Use in my diffuser and only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> Add to a carrier oil and apply to lips to give your lips an instant “plump” look   Rinse your mouth out with a glass of water and a few drops of oil, to freshen breath   </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not left an oily mess, but just smelling like peppermints!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of peppermint. It reminds me of my grandmother. I wanted to try as many uses of peppermint oil as I could, and got the unfortunate chance to try some of the health remedy uses when I came down with bronchitis. I used it as a muscle pain reliever, a couple drops on the affected area. It worked pretty well and calmed the aches and pains I was experiencing. I also tried it to clear my sinuses, a couple sniffs here and there, it didn&#x27;t do much or for very long. But then I put a couple drops in the corners of the shower and it cleared me right up! It lasted longer than some of the more commercial products. Since I can&#x27;t seem to find my diffuser, I added a couple drops to a hot bottle of water and put it on my night stand. It helped to keep my congestion low and made the bedroom smell fantastic. I read that peppermint oil can also be used as a pest repellent, so I put some on cotton balls and placed them in our problem areas. It&#x27;ll take a while, but we&#x27;ll see if our pest problem diminishes. I&#x27;m really in love with this oil. There are so many uses, you certainly can never call it useless.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review*</li>
            <li> I’ve never used peppermint oil. When I read some of the healing properties of this product, I decided to try it. The oil is highly concentrated. I think it’s great because one bottle can last for a long time.  As soon as I received the oil, I had to use it on my daughters who were sick. I put several drops in their humidifiers and used several drops to rub on my two girl’s chest, which helped open the airways due to the congestion.  I usually use baby vapor rub and I have to reapply during the night. But with the oil I just applied once and that was sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re a cautious parent like me: you’re probably searching for natural remedies that will help get rid of the sickness. I’m happy to have used this product and I hope to use it from now on.  I was provided this product as part of a promotion; I was given the product for free in exchanged I’m proving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Since I started researching &amp; using essential oils a couple of months ago, I&#x27;ve found so many great uses for them. Peppermint is one of my favorite oils so I was more than happy to test &amp; review this Pure Peppermint Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a large 4 ounce bottle with a glass dropper wrapped separately in bubble wrap. As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell that wonderfully menthol scent of peppermint. The scent is good but not overpowering. According to the label, this peppermint oil is 100% pure steam distilled oil with no additives, no fragrance added &amp; no preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many ways to use peppermint oil. My favorite is to make a sugar scrub which I use in the shower. I also like to use this oil, along with others, in my diffuser. Almost every day I put peppermint, lemon &amp; lavender in my diffuser to help with my allergy symptoms. I also dilute peppermint oil with either jojoba oil or coconut oil to use it on my temples &amp; the back of my neck when I have a headache. I know that it can be used in a natural toothpaste &amp; I&#x27;m going to try that too.</li>
            <li> I love peppermint! I love the scent, the flavor, everything! I received a bottle of this 100% Pure Peppermint Oil to review and I love all the things peppermint oil can be used for! I use it nearly everyday for something. I keep a spray bottle with water and peppermint oil in it handy for spraying in the air to kill odors. I spray my duster and dust the wall and ceiling in my house to keep spiders from building webs up there. I use it t o wipe the window sills. I use it on my skin for itchiness, small scrapes, etc because of it&#x27;s antiseptic properties. I love the cooling sensation that comes with that too.  It is wonderful in my diffusers for aromatherapy. I just dilute in some fractionated coconut oil. This peppermint oil had worked great for all the things I have used it for. It smells great and has been working fabulously too.</li>
            <li> Love that peppermint :)</li>
            <li> **Note: This product was sent to me to facilitate my review, but the opinion expressed here is my own.**&lt;br /&gt;This is the purest peppermint oil that I have tried so far. If you are not used to peppermint oil, you might think that something was added to it because it is very strong. Peppermint oil is something that you should have in your medicine cabinet because the benefits are endless.  I love this brand because of so many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 It comes with the glass dropper that makes it easy for me to get the desired amount.&lt;br /&gt;#2 A dark glass bottle to preserve freshness.&lt;br /&gt;#3 It is so strong that I do not need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use this essential oil on my hair. I mix it with a carrier oil like castor oil for better application to my scalp. I also add it to my deep conditioner. I love the tingling sensation that I get after putting the shower cap on and sitting under the dryer.  This little miracle has helped me with itchy scalp, dandruff, indigestion, and abdominal discomfort. I will definitely buy it when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Peppermint Oil helps to reduce stress, headaches and increase alertness!  My favorite use for Peppermint Oil, is that it&#x27;s the perfect spider and ant deterrent!  Once in awhile we get ants in our home, then I make up a solution of water and Peppermint Oil, then spray it where the ants are.  They don&#x27;t come back for a long time!  You can even use Peppermint Oil as a mouse repellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one bottle of GoPure Peppermint Oil to review!  I read somewhere that Peppermint Oil was good for pain, so I thought that I would try putting it on my husband&#x27;s feet.  He has severe neuropathy!  So, every night I rub Peppermint Oil on his feet and it helps the pain, so he can sleep.  He&#x27;s not one that believes too much in homeopathic remedies, but nothing else worked, so he decided to try it and he&#x27;s sure glad he did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint Oil helps ease muscle pain, with a cooling and soothing effect.  The oil has many therapeutic uses.  It can be used for an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic, plus a natural disinfectant that you can use in the kitchen or around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use Peppermint Oil for aromatherapy and it makes your home smell AWESOME!  The aroma is very relaxing!  You can put it on your temples or the base of your neck to release stress or pain.  Last week my neck was really bothering me, so I put Peppermint Oil on my temples and all over the back of my neck.  My neck felt so much better and it made me feel so much more relaxed.  I absolutely love Peppermint Oil and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love peppermint oil, and this was a great deal!</li>

I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water and swished it like mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often suffer from headaches and migraines so I was excited to find a recipe with this product to help reduce and relieve them.  I mixed this product with Lavender Oil, and Coconut Oil.  I then applied the mixture on to my forehead and massaged the oil around the temples.  I also applied the mixture on my neck.  This product significantly helped control my headaches and reduced the length and occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from fatigue and drowsiness.  I mixed this product with Lemon Oil, and Orange Oil.  I applied the mixture to the back of my neck and then inhaled the oil residue on my hands.

This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product as an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal first aid kit.  I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water and then I applied this product to an open cut to clean, sterilize, and disinfect.  This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  I mixed ten drops of each of the following: Peppermint Oil, Lavender Oil, and Rosemary Oil. Then I added a carrier oil, Coconut Oil to the mixture.  The product felt cool and refreshing.  I did notice some immediate pain relief and less muscle tissue tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a Wow factor product!  This product can help combat nausea, zap headaches, relieve heartburn, stop itching, deter mice, cool a fever, prevent drowsiness, soothe a stomachache, freshen your breath, reduce muscle and joint pain, disinfect cuts, and so many more uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product has positively improved and impacted my life.

I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil, Lavender Oil, and Epsom Salts into a foot bath to help relax tired feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for decongestion by combining it with water and rubbing the mixture on my chest.  This product helped reduce my cold symptoms and helped me get a good night’s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product as an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal first aid kit.  I mixed a few drops of Peppermint Oil with water and then I applied this product to an open cut to clean, sterilize, and disinfect.  This product helped the cut heal quickly, cleanly, and without scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product to help ease my back, neck, and shoulder pain.  I mixed ten drops of each of the following: Peppermint Oil, Lavender Oil, and Rosemary Oil. Then I added a carrier oil, Coconut Oil to the mixture.  The product felt cool and refreshing.  I did notice some immediate pain relief and less muscle tissue tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a Wow factor product!  This product can help combat nausea, zap headaches, relieve heartburn, stop itching, deter mice, cool a fever, prevent drowsiness, soothe a stomachache, freshen your breath, reduce muscle and joint pain, disinfect cuts, and so many more uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product has positively improved and impacted my life.  This product offers so many wonderful benefits and uses.  I would absolutely recommend this product, goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil, to everyone as you are sure to find a reason to incorporate this product into your routine.  I will also continue to use this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the generous size of this bottle of oil.I use it for so many things.I use it as a natural bug repellant for ants, spiders, cockroaches, mosquitoes and even mice! I also love to use it in my diffuser, the smell helps to energize me!</li>
            <li> It smells intensive like peppermint but still decent! It comes in a convenient size and the pipette makes it really easy to apply the oil!</li>
            <li> Amazing essential oil! I make bath and body products and this works perfectly. Nice 4oz bottle with dropper!</li>
            <li> Holy cow, that&#x27;s a lot of peppermint oil.  Great for cooling off in the summer; add a few drops to a bath or to body wash.  I will have to find some things to do with this oil, cause a little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Peppermint Oil as I had read about using it as a natural pest control without harmful chemicals. Works great I will be buying more for my son and for daughter to unseat their homes.</li>
            <li> Great oil for diffusing, very calming and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I like it. it makes my skin looks smooth. I like it smell.</li>
            <li> This is a bargain at this price . The bottle is huge. We love our EO&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I read the review like your doing and they all sound great so I bought. And it is. So when I run out I well buy more. It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS OIL! I can honestly say this is some of the best peppermint oil I have purchased and I will be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily so finding one I absolutely love is a score!  Thank you for making a great product!</li>
            <li> Had a violent allergic reaction just from breathing the vapors. Caused my tongue and lips to swell and breathing was extremely difficult. Also got huge hives and red burns around inside of lips. Had to take Benedryl and use an Epi pen.  Bought it as a repellent for mice but looks like I will be returning since just breathing this has caused me much harm.  There should be cautioning listed for allergic reactions in some people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is very good peppermint oil  to use  in  Candlemaking ants soap making  ... MaryLeeParker 5/3/15</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am very pleased and will enjoy using this for some time to come.</li>
            <li> Sure took care of my upset stomach due to Vertigo.</li>
            <li> I had ants. It has rained so much here lately and I think the ants thought they had found a new home. Everything I tried did not keep them away. This works, they are gone! I also used it in an infuser in my bathroom and I love the clean smell it leaves. I mixed a few drops in oil and put in a candle warmer when I had a head cold last week and it opens me up so that I can breath again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! Great size (a lot of bang for the buck) and I really appreciate the dropper that is included</li>
            <li> Wow.  HUGE Bottle.  Get this now and be covered for years for a natural stomach bug healing agent, aromatherapy, or a bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of peppermint  oil and thus far  this is the best. Many great uses... when Im nauseated  I mix a drop with a little  coconut  oil and rub it on my wrist or just hold the bottle  close to my nose and take a few sniff and shortly  thereafter  the nausea  has subsided. I also mix it with other ingredients  for an itchy  scalp. Great product</li>
            <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Strong scent, but not overpowering. I used this in a diffuser and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I have previously left a  review of this product and I like it very much.  I especially liked the fact that a glass dropper was included with the oil.  I have been using the oil for aromatherapy and looking for other uses.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is great. I appreciate the dropper it comes with too. I used it for lip balm and it had the most wonderful flavor. Some peppermint oils have a old smell. This is not one of those. I also use this to make sure ants and other bugs stay out of my house. I add an few drops to the door frame and smear with a q-tip around the perimeter. So far no bugs :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect! Ordered for use as an insect and rodent repellant. Placed drops around the house to say good bye to mice and insects and it seems to have worked . . . no sign of these pest anywhere thus far since using . . . plus our home has a marvelous clean fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> I am not too into holistic medicine or essentials oils as some people I know, but I am a big fan of general aromatherapy. A few years ago I was turned on to using peppermint oil to help relieve headaches and migraines and I&#x27;ve been a big believer ever since. Anyone I know can tell you that one of my favorite aromas is peppermint and I usually buy up as many bath &amp; body products in peppermint as I can - body wash, hand soap, lotion, lip balm, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goPURE bottle is definitely unlike the other oils I&#x27;ve bought in the past. It&#x27;s a full 4 oz. and comes with a glass pipette cap that can be used in place of the flat cap it comes packaged in. Most of the other oils I&#x27;ve purchased had the plastic insert inside the mouth of the bottle that regulates the flow to a drop or so at a time, so this is a little easy to get too much if you&#x27;re not careful. A little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that there&#x27;s a slight difference in aroma between this brand and another brand I have. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this brand is cold pressed and I don&#x27;t know if the other brand is, but I quickly didn&#x27;t notice much difference after living with the goPURE for awhile. I did receive a bottle complimentary for review purposes, but I&#x27;ll definitely come back to this brand once this bottle is done.</li>
            <li> This has helped a lot for my teens and children due to coming home from a public school with colds.  You can use this several ways.  One is by placing in a small boiling pot of water on the stove to evaporate into the household air for everyone or in a humidifier too.  It works well in diffusers and it clears up the sinus and allergy issues that keep coming with weather changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;I received one of these in hopes of my honest thoughts and review.  All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.  There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.  This review is in the guidelines of the FTC.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t care for peppermint but this is not too strong and it works amazingly. I use a carrier oil like coconut oil. I am still new to essential oils so I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to use them. But I use a warmer with the carrier oil and it clears all my senses and it feels wonderful. This product is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be and more. Plus it&#x27;s a pretty large amount so you will have it for a long time!</li>
            <li> A huge bottle of excellent peppermint oil!  It works great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love peppermint oil and this one is 100% :). I use this to make lip balm, headache, mixed in lotion for soar muscules, and toothaches. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil, so nice for a diffuser, and it&#x27;s a big bottle too!</li>
            <li> I have 2 girls and I have been using this oil for their hair.  I dilute it and spray it into their hair each morning as peppermint is a deterrent for lice.  It leaves a nice tingle and my girls love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great, you don&#x27;t need much at all so it will last a long time.Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, excellent quality!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good in the diffuser. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Peppermint has so many household and medicinal uses, it is an excellent item to always have on hand.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I use it for so many things. Just really great!</li>
            <li> Generations of my family have always kept peppermint oil handy around the house, and there is a good reason for it.  Not only is it medically useful for headaches, tummy aches, stress, and a mood changer, but its also wonderful as part of routine beauty regiments, and even around the home for its enlightening aroma that makes peppermint loving humans smile, but rodents and pest flee!  This bottle can literally replace numerous bottles of unnatural concoctions with ingredients most can&#x27;t even begin to pronoun, with this one large bottle of just 1 all natural ingredient.  All of that for a fraction of the price.  A definite good buy!</li>
            <li> This is a Grade A and therapeutic Grade peppermint oil that is made out of pure, high quality peppermint oil. Peppermint oil has numerous benefits such as aromatherapy, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, and a natural insect and rodent repellent. Be aware, it is not to be ingested. goPure Naturals offers a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product to have in your home for the variety of benefits it offers, but I personally used it mostly for mental clarity. Peppermint oil helps to reduce stress, headaches, and increase alertness, which is what I solely used it for because I wanted to see if it would aid in troublesome areas. It’s great for defusing, which is ideal for mental clarity. And since it has gotten warmer, this was great for reducing those pesky spiders in the home. goPure Natural includes the glass dropper, which I appreciated because it makes application so much easier, and safe packaging to ensure safe usage. Overall, I am pleased with this product, and it’s one of my favorites in my essential oil collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Great peppermint oil. Huge size and cheaper price, offer better/same quality</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good oil. But I was kinda expecting a candy cane scent. Though the oil smells minty so it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> I find peppermint oil to be uplifting and it clears my mind, this oil does just that. It&#x27;s also good to keep rodents and bugs away (awesome plus). It&#x27;s not organic so I personally don&#x27;t put it on to my skin but I like to dilute it with water and spray it around the house and even in the car. 4oz. is a lot of oil and it should last months.. depending on how much you use. Very strong so start with a small amount! I appreciate that they chose glass over plastic (chemicals from plastic can leech out) and the dropper is a nice touch for getting the right amount and not wasting any. Thank you GoPureNaturals for generously giving me this peppermint oil to try for just my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a way to keep spiders out of a nursery without using chemicals.  By rubbing this around windows, and along corners, I have noticed a significant reduction in spiders in the room.  Not only does it work, but it leaves a fresh mint smell in the room.  I have also used a couple drops in a humidifier, and it has helped me get through a cold.  This is a very handy product, and I am sure I do not even use it for the majority of its intended uses!</li>
            <li> Forgive me i should have reviewed this sooner but i was enjoy this just way to much, let me explain it has been about a week since i got in the peppermint oil and well i have this spider issue here, i took a clear spray bottle added 3 drops of the peppermint oil and the rest water and went to work spraying the outside of my tiny place, now not only did the spiders run but everything else too, i never knew this but no flies nothing wanted to even go near this! So the basics are simple a few drops of this in a spray bottle rest water and goodbye bugs, ok i also went nuts inside spraying the doors the windows and of course i do use it in a tiny crockpot for fragrance and sprayed my rug with it just to make sure my home smells fresh, word to the wise one drop of oil in a oil burner or crockpot is way more than enough do not do what i did and use 4 then add water or you will have to shut it off to add more water because it will be to strong for you to stand it. Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been rubbing a few drops of it at my temples and on the back of my neck when I get a sinus headache and it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> great quality peppermint oil! large size for the money</li>
            <li> Really love this! Smells great and the dropper is excellent. So excited to learn more about oils and what they are good for.</li>
            <li> Your Peppermint oil is great. We had a mouse problem and put cotton balls laced with your oil around the back of our cabinets and no more mice. Wallah! I also like the smell in the house.</li>
            <li> very good product.  So far I&#x27;ve used it for headache and it really helped.  Also used a little to freshen potpourri because I love the scent.  Will try in other ways as needed especially when outdoors.  Worked great on insect bites too.  Stopped the itching instantly and I love the scent.  Very pure and natural so I will definitely try on anything.</li>
            <li> Awesome, smells great. Love the big size bottle!</li>
            <li> High quality oil at a great price! This is a huge bottle for barely more than you usually pay for the tiny bottles. What a great value! Smells wonderful and comes with a handy dropper to replace the cap if you&#x27;d like. Can&#x27;t wait to use this in so many applications and I&#x27;m sure it will last me practically forever.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing many good things about peppermint oil for skin, and how it is able to repel un-desired bugs. I have found the brand to be every strong and i am happy it is! I don&#x27;t have to use much to get the effects i need. 1cup of water ina spray bottle with about 10 to 15 drops of the oil sprayed around my windows and doors is definitely keeping the swarms of mosquitoes away even with the lights on. A few drops inside of a quarter cup of baking soda mixed with a quarter of a cup of coconut oil and now I have a delicious mint toothpaste. when my husband sinuses are bothering him I will put a few drops in a cup of hot water and as he inhales the vapors he finds relief.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is very multipurpose. I use it in my dyi lotion, mixed with coconut oil and cocoa butter. I put a little on a cotton ball to repel ants. It makes a great foot soak. Just add a few drops to warm water, and yes it does relieve headaches.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing !!</li>
            <li> I mixed the peppermint oil in a spray bottle with water and no more spiders!</li>
            <li> What a great product!  The bottle comes with its own dropper so it is quite convenient.  The concentration is fabulous!  This is great for using in your oil diffuser, for a great fresh scent that helps reduce stress.  I suffer from headaches and use the oil frequently as it helps alleviate the pain instead of popping pills. Also love to use this with oil to add it to sugar facial scrubs.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Very pleased with my purchase. Would buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Came completely sealed with a glass dropper as described. Very potent oil. I bought this to help dry up my breastmilk supply &amp; I haven&#x27;t felt engorged yet. I even put a few drops in my morning coffee &amp; it&#x27;s fantastic. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using over 2-3 drops per beverage unless you like feeling your eyes burn. Over all I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It is the best Peppermint Oil. The price is higher than the one I purchased but it didn&#x27;t work as well as this product has been doing this past 2 weeks. This Best Peppermint Oil has the best blended of Peppermint Oil and other oils to make this very aromatic. I used this now around the clock. It did help with my sinuses and it helps to keep mosquitoes away even with the drought. With the West Niles mosquitoes coming closer to the Bay Area I will keep buying and using this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for this huge bottle of peppermint oil.  It smells exactly like my doTERRA peppermint oil and is cheaper for 8 times the size of that bottle.  We had a colony of small ants living under our welcome mat outside.  I dropped a couple drops of this around and within 5 minutes, all of them were gone.  I also put a couple drops around our hummingbird feeder to keep ants away.  I love that I can get rid of ants and bees without feeling like I am spraying harmful chemicals around our kids and animals.  It also smells great and gets rid of my headaches. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The peppermint smells great, I did not have any success with it repelling mosq.</li>
            <li> I wish the scent would last longer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this essential oil. Peppermint oil has many benifits. I use a diffuser and it makes my apartment smell great.</li>
            <li> Works great in simmer pot.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great product.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. What I expected was an oil with a strong, potent, peppermint smell. I am quite happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this oil pure perfection smells great and company has the best customer service I will buy again works for migraine headaches just a few drops on forehead and temples pain clears up naturally</li>
            <li> This is a great peppermint oil!!! Our household uses it topically for headaches, tummy aches or digestion problems. I diffuse it around the house to get rid of germs in the air and freshen the air. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m using around house to deter ants and spiders.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
            <li> Have placed drops around the house. There is no heavy sweet or chemical smell to them. Seem to be working so far!</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle, the smell is amazing, and it is great to use with other products to make natural lip balm, lotions, bath scrubs, etc.  A little goes a long way.  The price for the size of the bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> Using it to get rid of insects and rodents!  They don&#x27;t like mint at all and I made a spray with it for around our house and garage.</li>
            <li> I love the invigorating scent of Peppermint. I use it in addition to non-scented beard oils, to give my morning routine a fresh kick. Helps keep me alert.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality pure peppermint oil.I use this in a diffuser to clear my sinuses. This oil really provides great relief and relieves sinus pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the oil</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  We use it all the time.</li>
            <li> It is peppermint oil.  No clue how they make it or if they can be trusted.  I got it for free to try and review.  I have a hard time trusting companies any more.  I want to know how it is made and if it really is pure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using essential oils. Peppermint is one of my favorite. I diffuse it frequently and use it topically as well. Yesterday my 4yr old&#x27;s head was hurting, so I used a bit of this oil topically and within 20 minutes he can running into my room super excited to tell me his head didn&#x27;t hurt any more :) I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this brand from now on</li>
            <li> This eye dropper was broken, but the quality of the oil is excellent</li>
            <li> I purchased this to ward off ants in my pantry and to rub on temples for migraines.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it in spray bottle to get rid of the ants and it worked!</li>
            <li> This product is too strong. I want it for aroma therapy purposes to relax and it&#x27;s just too strong it makes my sinuses hurt. A friend of mine purchased a very small bottle from a mall store and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product at a reasonable price. Very happy with this peppermint oil which I use with an essential oil diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma moves quickly through my apartment and makes everything smell great. Gets rid of cooking smells in an apartment on hot humid days when you can&#x27;t open a window. This was money well spent. I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> The smell is acceptable, not the best but not the worst either. You can&#x27;t always judge the quality of an essential oil by its smell anyway. Often the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; ones get that smell because of extra things being added. I use peppermint oil primarily for headaches. Peppermint usually relieves them immediately. This product did not.  It had a small effect but nothing like the Plant Therapy peppermint that I normally use. This will be my backup when I run out of my preferred oil.</li>
            <li> We bought it as a humane way to get mice out of the house (we&#x27;re trying to sell) and it appears to be working. We will stick to this method--thanks.</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is steam distilled from the leaves and stems of Mentha piperita.  It is crystal clear and has an intense, pure aroma that is almost intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil contains a high concentration of menthol, which creates a cooling sensation and reduces pain and itching better than many commercial products.  Even  few drops added to a carrier oil is very helpful for itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also used in aromatherapy and may be helpful for digestive problems.  It can be used as a natural air freshener or as an inhalant for stuffy noses or nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous 4 oz. (120 ml) amber glass bottle protects the oil from light and it comes with both a plain cap and a glass dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GoPure Naturals provided peppermint oil for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I live this....it helped my hubby and me...just a drop or 2 to tea and cramps and discomfort gone...thank you</li>
            <li> Smells good but when I put in my skin didn&#x27;t feel too much of cool feeling. I used for diffuser now. To clean the air.</li>
            <li> Potent peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Great and smells good</li>
            <li> THIS STINKS AND IS HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> Great Peppermint Oil with strong slightly bitter peppermint odor.</li>
            <li> My husband puts this oil on his chest at bedtime to help him breathe better. It works great. His doctor recommended this.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling oil. Use it for so many DIY projects.</li>
            <li> Received my peppermint oil yesterday! Omg I opened the box and was in heaven with the smell. I am obsessed with mint. I love the smell. The bottle is a pretty decent size and comes with a glass (yes I said glass) dropper!&lt;br /&gt;The product came sooner than expected which is always a plus.  The product is also environmentally friendly and is NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and the things you can do with this oil are so many. Since we have pets and leave our door open for our dogs to come in and out as they please, a few drop arrow the corners for spiders and mice. Love it.,</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil smells great. I mix it with my skin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> ***Excellent Product!! Keep up the good work goPURE!***. I was having problems with my skin, especially on my legs,feet, and ankles. i was itching, I had irritation and rashy hives. I put a few drops of goPURE Peppermint oil in a warm bath and soaked for the last 3 nights and I am experiencing wonderful results! Peppermint oil has some fantastic homeopathic uses, and I would recommend this product to anybody. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying peppermint oil for quite awhile and love it for many therapeutic and aromatherapy uses. This oil is very good quality at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great peppermint oil and great price!</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil is a must in our house.  goPure is great!  My wife uses it nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I use it for bug repellent.  I ordered multiple bottles, and one of the glass droppers was broken.  If you plan to use this dropper, you might want to purchase more than one.</li>
            <li> This smells great. Very happy with my purchase. Delivered as described by seller.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of essential oils, and am aware you can periodically get a &#x27;bad batch/bottle&#x27;.  I can only hope and guess that is the situation with the one I received or a whole lot of people are wrong!  I was using peppermint and other oils added together for use in my garden to eradicate spider mites.  My usual choice is &amp;#34;Eden Garden&amp;#34;, but this was a much larger bottle and I thought I would be smart to get it since it was so much bigger and had such good reviews.  I am not impressed, wither with the performance  of this in the garden, or in my oil diffusers  that I have for indoor use..  Unable to smell it in the air and I guess the fact that spider mites were unfazed lets me know Eden Garden is the better choice.  I am aware of the responsibilities and implications involved in  writing reviews. For me, the ability to see/read the reviews is a big part of on line VS retail store purchases.  Sometimes saving a bit is just not a good thing if you compromise quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; r</li>
            <li> The peppermint smell makes me want to put it everywhere! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is big -a good value for the money- and will be perfect to apply to my cleaning DIY spray.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  Great product</li>
            <li> Good Quality, great aroma</li>
            <li> This is very cooling but watch out for your eyes.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product. The bottle comes in a bubble wrap packaging Including an eye dropper that you can choose to use or not. I use a few drops in my vacume filter to make my house smell amazing. My absolute favorite use is to keep the mice away. Soak a cotton ball in the peppermint oil and place under the sink and around the house any where you thinks the mice are coming in. MICE HATE THE SMELL OF PEPPERMINT. using the oil has drastically decreased the number I catch in the traps.</li>
            <li> great product, great seller.</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m not jinxing myself by writing this review too soon, but as of right now this stuff is amazing. I know it has many uses, but I bought it to keep away bugs and it&#x27;s working beautifully. There&#x27;s many ways to use peppermint oil to keep bugs away, but I have an terrible fear of them and hate when there in my home so I used it in its purest form. I didn&#x27;t dilute it rather I placed drops directly into my window pane near the screen. By this time of year, my house would have bees, wasps, and the dreadful stink bug. So far...nothing!!! I could not be happier. I hope it continues all summer long. Oh and total side benefit...it makes the room smell so pretty!!!</li>
            <li> Did not expect the bottle to be as big as it is I have never tried peppermint oil so im excited to test this product out will give this a week and be back with a better review on this product. I love the fact that the bottle is so big im happy with the way it was packaged also.</li>
            <li> Nice, crisp smell that I use almost daily. Sometimes I mix it with Rosemary, or Cypress, or other scent and it smells clean and fresh in the house. I also put it on cotton and place it in the litter house.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Smells fresh.  Great price for 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Great Value Peppermint oil! Comes with a nice little dropper and can&#x27;t wait to use in my home to keep the pests out!</li>
            <li> I use peppermint oil in everything. Doesn&#x27;t take much, only a few drops.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of an article I read that spiders/insects do not like this odor.  (spraying around thresholds of the home, instead of using harsh chemicals) It&#x27;s worked well so far, and I&#x27;m very impressed!  I do wish the dropper was plastic and not glass though, as it would be less likely damaged - and wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about replacement if it were plastic and not glass.  The item was packaged well, arrived promptly and I&#x27;m happy with this product. I would recommend for insect/spider deterrent - as that was my purpose for purchasing. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got this to repel ants - and good gracious, it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> Using for part of a spider problem. And it&#x27;s working like a charm! The room also smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> as advertised essence of peppermint..........aroma is said to act as repellent for mice and insects.........don&#x27;t no if it works yet........</li>
            <li> I love this oil by goPure.  I have used it to help with headaches.  I was amazed at all of the uses.  I also use this to refresh the peppermint smell in some precious Christmas ornaments my mom made for me.  The original peppermint aroma that my mom initially used had faded.  Now they are like new and so Christmasy.</li>
            <li> This is a high grade essential oil!  I love it, and the price is fantastic, too!</li>
            <li> Generous size bottle. Smells good. I&#x27;m using it for soapmking.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It has so many uses. As an expecting mom I love that I can use this oil to prevent spiders and bugs from coming near where I put drops. I&#x27;ve used a little now and I&#x27;m planning to use it to put in the baby&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use the peppermint oil all the time. I use it when I have headaches which is quite often, and to open up the sinus etc.. we ran out and could not find one we liked. I got a bottle of gopure peppermint oil and it is wonderful. I carry a little bottle of it and put a few drops in my mouth once in a while to freshen the breath and open up the sinus. It&#x27;s a must for essential oil users. I definitely recommend this one. 5 Stars</li>
            <li> Got my Peppermint Oil in the mail last week and began using it last night.  I like the huge bottle and the dropper for dispensing.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> love all the things this product can do. It helps relax you and helps remove the unwanted bugs coming into your home.</li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t too many directions on the bottle except that it should not be applied in the eyes, and that it is best to mix it with another carrier oil, such as almond, olive, or jojoba when you are using it for something other than aromatherapy.  I receive this price on a discount price or free for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> Great product high quality</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It&#x27;s very potent, and extremely long lasting. The price for how much you get and how little you need to use to produce the desired effect is spectacular. I highly recommend it! Compared to what you&#x27;ll pay trying to pick this up from a store for a much smaller (and in my opinion less potent/natural) amount, this is an absolute steal! This is the second time we&#x27;ve purchased this product from amazon/goPure Naturals, and I&#x27;m positive it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> This is great quality and has so many uses!&lt;br /&gt;A few drops in my mouth when I have stomach issues and I always feel better!</li>
            <li> Pure peppermint oil at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> I love this in my aroma diffuser. Gives me energy.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the size of the bottle when it arrived. it came sealed with the dropper in separate packaging. It is a very good quality Peppermint Oil as I&#x27;ve bought others in the past. Having the dropper makes it much easier when mixing with other things. I&#x27;ve created a muscle rub for sore muscles and it is very relaxing and soothing. I&#x27;ve also created  our own homemade mosquito spray....it&#x27;s so nice not to smell like OFF! I&#x27;m amazed at how well it works. Peppermint Oil is also good to keep other bugs like ants and spiders at bay. I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a  discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a much higher quality essential oil. I will not be purchasing again. I feel as though I&#x27;ve thrown my money away. This is NOT peppermint essential oil it&#x27;s a weak hydrosol at best. The smell is weak and has a chemical aroma besides.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great. I have a plastic lotion pot with a lid (CeraVe was in it) that i use to mix a fragrance free lotion and several drops of the peppermint.  I use it to massage my knee and my shoulder.  Feels great!  Very soothing on aching joints and muscles.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil that has many medicinal uses as well as household uses. The peppermint scent is delicious not over powering at all. It is very pleasant. I use it to make my own muscle rub, baby rub, body scrub, mouthwash and air freshener. I sometimes also use a few drops with my shampoo for a nice cooling effect or in the shower when congested, a few drops as you run a hot shower will help clear out your nose. There are certainly many other uses, peppermint is warming and is great for pains like headaches, tummy aches, nausea and fever. When my kids are running a temperature, I combine raw coconut oil with a drop or two of goPURE Naturals peppermint essential oil and rub it on the bottom of their feet then throw on some socks and like magic it brings the fever down after an hour or two. Granted it takes longer but it does work. This is our go to essential oil brand. I have been really happy with this product it is reasonably priced. It is cold pressed so it has kept all of its healing value and beautiful aroma. It does not contain any harmful chemicals or additives and is 100% pure peppermint oil. And that’s exactly what I want from my essential oils especially since I use them on my family. You need to remember to dilute it either with carrier oil like coconut, olive oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, or water. You can basically use it with whatever oil your favorite is.  In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this pure cold pressed peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to get rid of mice which was suggested by a friend.  Great price and it not only got rid of mice, it makes my house smell good! Just recommended this to a friend and she is ordering some today.  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> mixed with water to repel wasps. worked great!</li>
            <li> totally awesome stufff</li>
            <li> This oil may be ok for some but we have been using Doterra peppermint oil and this simply doesn&#x27;t compare.  We were hoping to find something a bit more affordable than the Doterra oils and because of this products claims, being 100% pure with no fillers, we gave it a try.  The smell is just not that minty!  We have something to compare it to.  I understand that there are certainly different varieties of herbs that grow and perhaps this is just a less potent type of peppermint plant .....or perhaps this helps prove Doterra&#x27;s claims that they really do have some of the best oils on the market!  And this was mostly my husband&#x27;s opinion on this oil, not mine, to begin with, but then I could see what he was saying.  Also, I diffused this oil and got a screaming shooting pain through my head within minutes and then had a headache for hours.  I do not know if this was correlated to the oil or something else, but it was curious that the first time my husband put this on his feet at night, he woke with a terrible headache and so did I.  I didn&#x27;t know he had one until we spoke on the phone later in the morning and I complained about mine.  He then told me about his, too.....very strange.  Obviously this was our experience and again, maybe it was food related, but we hadn&#x27;t eaten anything or drank anything out of our norm, so we felt it could have been this oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying essential oil and it work great</li>
            <li> Great oil.  The scent is how I like it, strong!  It&#x27;s great to put in my humidifier and leave a refreshing and energizing scent in the air.  Helps clear the sinuses too.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Clear oil. Opens up your sinuses. Great for air fresheners and DIY toiletries</li>
            <li> Aromatherapy at it&#x27;s finest.  I&#x27;ve used this on my temples when I had a headache and I think it really worked.  I really like it a lot.  I&#x27;ve got some arts and crafts projects and I&#x27;m going to try and use this with too (making some hand scrubs, etc.).</li>
            <li> BEWARE! Do not buy this stuff. I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it or if they mixed it with something else, but I put a few drops on cotton balls to put around my home for insects before I went on vacation. I held my breath most of the time and was out the door in minutes, but about 15 minutes later I had a severe sore throat. Then I started to get nauseated and dizzy and my entire respiratory tract was very irritated. I also experienced confusion and muscle weakness. It ruined my entire vacation and I&#x27;m still not completely well. I still have nasal swelling and ear pain as well as memory problems that I hope will continue to get better. It had a very strong smell. I have used peppermint oil before and it never did anything to me. This stuff should include a warning, really it shouldn&#x27;t be sold at all. To top it off my husband went in the room, because I still won&#x27;t, and he saw 2 bugs in there. It didn&#x27;t even work to repel anything!</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I liked that it already came with dropper. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The smell is wonderful and strong. I can tell from smelling and looking at the oil it is of quality. I love the dropper that was included. It&#x27;s strong and not flimsy and works well. The body is large for oil and it will last me a long time. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the oil I received.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product amongst a few options for peppermint oil and have to say, I am sold! Don&#x27;t get anything else, this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;I used a 4 fl oz bottle in a 32 oz spray bottle (mixed with water). Water and this oil won&#x27;t mix but shake your bottle and the mixture becomes milky and ready to be used - I spray around the house for a fresh scent and an immediate insect repellent. I used to have flies coming in the  house. God knows why as my house is hyper-clean and from where they come (vent? chimney?) but I had one or two a day, enough to bug me (punt intended) making me jump to the spray chemicals. Since I stated to spray peppermint (and no more than once or twice a week), they don&#x27;t come anymore. And yes, they do seem to also repel spider as advertised as I did not spot a &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34; web for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Next usage is a few drop in a fresh glass of water. The provided glass dropper is perfect to make the measure - what a refreshing drink with immediate soothing effects! I am thrilled with the taste and freshness but also the effect as your body absorbs it - after a heavy meal or on boated days, it helps for real and you feel relaxed and calm.This brand is simply fantastic. I will buy it again I am sure (and so sold in this that I am now likely to try their other products)</li>
            <li> Not as strong as others I have ordered so it takes more to do the job. I used some for spider control, they just walked on by and it didnt bother them at all. Some actually built webs right where I would spray. Customer Service is good.</li>
            <li> We had mice in our garage.  We put some peppermint oil on cotton balls around the garage and a few days later our mouse population is almost gone. I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use peppermint oil in my house more than any others. I use lots of others,but peppermint and spearmint is still my two favorites. Anyway I&#x27;m always looking for a better oil that&#x27;s pure and natural as possible. I have tried a lot of different brands and found them to be ok,but I have to say that I did a lot of research on go pure peppermint oil and found lots of good reviews so decided to try it myself. It smells so good just as I hoped it would. I hurried up and put in my diffuser and wow! My house smelled peppermint throughout. So yes this oil is awesome! So I thank you for all your hard work making this product so pure and wonderful smelling. And thanks for making a large bottle with a glass dropper. It&#x27;s a plus for me. It came in when it was suppose to and well packed. Keep up the great work and I will definitely be ordering it again. I give you five stars for a wonderful product. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Receiving a sample for bottle for review from a brand new to me, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but kept an openmind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint oil arrived in a sealed bottle with a glass dropper and the oil was very clear and the light viscosity one expects of peppermint oil. This variety smells very sweet but also has the warmth of menthol and limonene as it&#x27;s strongest notes, the taste just a bit on the bitter side when not blended with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like this one and it&#x27;s a lot of bang for the buck, no doubt. I don&#x27;t go through a lot of peppermint but I am inclined to buy this brand when I run out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time ordering. You can barely smell the peppermint unless you hold your nose directly over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Returned and reordering from someone that&#x27;s reviews are not made by all people that got a free bottle or discount for their opinion.</li>
            <li> Very strong. Lasting smell when used in warmer.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil was exactly as advertised.  A bit powerful, I should have used less for the vegan ice cream recipe, but not Go Pure&#x27;s issue, my heavy hand.  Needless to say, but obviously need to, use sparingly!</li>
            <li> In exchange for my 100% honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of this wonderful pure cold pressed peppermint oil. After using it for a few days my house is greatly scented with an invigorating minty scent through out. I did also try this in my waer placing 5 drops in about 12 ouces of water as I have heard it helps with depression and was also hoping that it would help clear some of the ccongestion in my chest but it did not and was really strobg tasting that I could not finish my cup however using it in my diffuser to scent my house it is not overpowering.  Instead it is just perfect after placing 5 drops of it in the diffuser with 4 oz warm water and allowing it to infuse into my home leaving my place smelling wonderful.  I dont recommend this as an additive to drinks but definitely do recommend it to everyone looking for a great minty scent in their home. I cannot say I feel its impacted my mood or depression at this point but it possibly could if consistently used. I however have not used it long.</li>
            <li> Pure peppermint oil, is really good I use it for several things in my home. I use it for mice deterrent, I just use a couple of drops on cotton ball and it keeps them away. I also use it to help my stomach if I get indigestion just a couple of drops in a glass of water helps a lot. Also at night I use it to help me sleep better as well. Great product. I got this for free to review and my opinion is solely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> Great product with many uses!! I love this pure peppermint oil!! The smell is intoxicating!! I have made face scribe, body sugar scribe, soap, and many other wonderful smelling things that spring to life with this product. If you have any questions please feel free to ask!!</li>
            <li> I was selected to review this 100% pure Peppermint Oil from GoPure Naturals on Tomoson.com. This peppermint oil can be used for various purposes. You can use this oil for aromatherapy, making lotions and soaps, deodorizing your home, body aches, headaches, sinuses, colds, skin, scalp, indigestion, insect repellent as well as fleas. My reason for wanting to test this product is due to my back and shoulder aches. There are times when going up and down the stairs with laundry can be a pain. Being a loyal fan of White Flower Analgesic Balm for nearly all my life I decided it was time to try something new that didn’t leave my home smelling like a hospital. When I first opened the bottle I was relieved that the smell was not overbearing. It has such a sweet scent. I decided to opt out of using the dropper, which came with the bottle, and use a cotton swab. I put the oil across my lower back, down the middle of my back and across my upper back. I didn’t need a lot at all. After 30 seconds I could feel the peppermint oil penetrating into my skin. I lay down; smelling the aroma of the peppermint and feeling it relax my muscles. What happened after that? I fell asleep. Waking up I could still smell the peppermint. My back ache was gone. I felt well rested and relaxed. My bedroom had a pleasant odor and I was 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some other tips on how you can use this oil&lt;br /&gt;• To ingest: Stir about 2 to 3 drops of peppermint oil into a glass of water&lt;br /&gt;• To deodorize:&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix baking soda and a few drops of peppermint oil in a mason jar. How many drops of oil will depend on how potent you would like it to be. Shake well. Use this mixture on carpets. Sprinkle. Wait about 5 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness of your carpet. Vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;2. Mix 1 tablespoon vodka or vinegar, 6 tablespoons of filtered water and10-40 drops of peppermint oil. Shake well. Spray in every room. Note: You can also add lecithin which helps keep the oil separated longer.&lt;br /&gt;• Insect repellent: Mix a few drops of peppermint oil with water in a small spray bottle. Spray around your patio, deck or porch. Bring with you on camping trips, picnics or any outdoor events. Never worry about ants crawling on you again.</li>
            <li> Got this first free off of tomoson and I used it today it was amazing my skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve experienced some pain in my upper arm. Have had this off and on over the last 9 months or so.  So, I just applied two drops of peppermint oil to my arm.  It hasn&#x27;t been 2 minutes and I can feel the warmth seeping down into my muscles relieving the pain in my arm.  My husband, sitting 5 feet away at his desk working, said his nose cleared up and he can breathe better than he could just moments ago.  45 minutes later and my arm is still pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint Oil helps relieve migraine headaches. Apply a drop to each temple, and rub some on the back of your neck and you should receive instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the peppermint oil to ward off spiders.  This stuff really works.  Believe me.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every product on the market found in the Bug Killer section at my local Lowe&#x27;s.  Nothing has worked like the peppermint oil to keep spiders away.  And with all the Black Widows I have around my place, I don&#x27;t need spiders hanging out with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own re-mineralization toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve had two cavities I&#x27;ve been working real hard to get rid of since January of this year.  One is completely gone, and the other is almost gone.  I believe that the Peppermint Oil in my DIY Toothpaste is a big part of why the cavities are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a great product,  I firmly believe every home should have 100% Pure Peppermint Oil.  It is a great panacea for our health.  Peppermint Oil is the world&#x27;s most widely used essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product that works for many different things.  Very versatile.  Therapeutic Grade A. Large 4 oz. amber colored bottle with glass dropper.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the order is that the eye dropper was broken upon arrival.  I am still using the product with another dropper.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as expected.  I felt it was a great value for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Really high quality - great for so many uses. I mainly put it in a diffuser and it works wonders for clearing up your longs/sinuses.Perfect when you have a cold or need a little energizing boost!</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong with this one! I used it while we were sick with a stomach bug and it worked great! I personally use it in my diffuser. My whole downstairs of my house smells like peppermint. I was offered this product for free in exchanged for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This essential Oils are my new favorite thing! I had been wanting to get into essential oils for a while now and when this opportunity arose, I took it! I got this product for free in exchange to test and review honestly. So my favorite way to use this product is with a carrier oil. If you don&#x27;t know much about essential oils, make sure you read up on them before using them. They are extremely concentrated and could lead to severe skin irritations if not diluted correctly. You can just Google search a chart that will recommend dilution ratios. My favorite carrier oil to use with this essential oil is also by goPURE. It&#x27;s their fractionated coconut oil. It is absorbed extremely quickly so I&#x27;m not left an oily mess, but just smelling like peppermints! I put this all over my face, neck, and arms. It really smells amazing and does a great job of hydrating. I love using this when I have a stuffy nose or a headache because it can really clear my sinuses and get rid of my headache. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> The spiders stopped coming into my bathtub and my bedroom window.  It does make your house smell wonderful.  It&#x27;s a good product and serves the purpose for which I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has so many uses &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li> As the product states “the BEST peppermint oil,” I completely agree even if it sounds so egotistical. I received the product off of a promotion. I wasn’t quite sure what I was expecting to be completely different since I have seen a couple of other essential oils. However, I was surprised this specific one came with an actual cap instead of just the eyedropper. goPure made sure the actual packaging was cared for so the product didn’t break in shipping which was interesting too. I was hoping it would come with a pamphlet telling me more about how to use the peppermint oil but that was not contained in the package. I don’t usually like looking recipes or how-tos constantly. It’s more enjoyable to have it on hand with the product already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type on the labelling could use a little work, but it’s easily read and not lost in the background. The color makes me think of peppermint too; although, I’m used to peppermint being associated with the red and white striped candy. There is a small icon that is labelled with “not tested on animals” which I’m not sure how I should be taking that or if humans were impacted by the product. Or if the product was tested at all on anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don’t love peppermint, then I wouldn’t suggest buying a product that contains peppermint in the title or product. However, if you love peppermint, go for it! I’m consistently addicted to peppermint. Sometimes I use it as a fragrance on my clothes since I can’t use an actual perfume. It makes me feel happy on a daily basis. I’ve been using this specific bottle for about a month now. I’m surprised it’s not completely used up by now with how often I’ve used it. Keep in mind it’s pure peppermint which has a different scent then artificial peppermint. It’s on the stronger side. For me, it doesn’t bother me since I love certain scents. There is a chill factor with this peppermint if it is applied to the skin so it starts to feel likevicks vapor rub in a way. However it’s been helping with my allergies. My cough hasn’t been as strong so far since using it though I’m not sure how much it has impacted my cough. I’ll be looking to see how it goes in the next couple of months while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely be buying this brand in the future when I finally run out of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a high quality product, came quickly. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nicely cool peppermint oil.  its all natural, no weird syntactic odor.  I am using it on my massage oil and shampoo to add on minty sensation.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Love this! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> **Updated-I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a week and while I do still find it a little more woody scented than other peppermint oils I&#x27;ve used before I don&#x27;t really mind because it works great! If I was using it purely for the scent then it might bug me but it is very cooling and that is what matters to me most right now. I use it for a ton of different uses all around the house so the large bottle is very economical.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peppermint oil definitely has a minty feeling to it but the scent is a little woody compared to other peppermint oils that I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t an issue if you are going for the cooling benefits but this oil doesn&#x27;t have a strong candy cane fragrance. I have not tried it in culinary recipes.</li>
            <li> I am a soap maker and am very excited to use this in a peppermint foot scrub soap</li>
            <li> I had a horrible head cold recently and this stuff was like a miracle. I think essential oils must be made with some kind of voodoo! I put this in a diffuser at night, which made my bedroom smell amazing, but it also allowed me to breathe so much better and stop coughing. I’ve also mixed it with some of the fractionated coconut oil and massages it into my forehead and temples. This seems to also help with my stuffy nose and the ache associated with sinus problems. Complimentary product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent. Not overpowering. Lovely mixed with lavender and Rosemary for destressing.</li>
            <li> Bottle is huge and you get a lot for your money. Use in my diffuser and only need a few drops. With this size bottle it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Peppermint Oil. I have several brands. They are all good. I use this for headaches, sinuses, muscle aches, and tendinitis in my fingers. I bought this particular one because it is a larger bottle. I go through the little ones in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Smells divine!  Great to mix in my homemade cleaning solution to cover up the vinegar smell.  And I absolutely love that it comes with a dropper!</li>
            <li> WOW!! Great and pure product.</li>
            <li> What can I say, the oil smells delicious. Often times in the morning, I will open the cap on my way out the door to work and inhale the scent of peppermint. It&#x27;s ends up being one of those, &amp;#34;close your eyes and breathe deep&amp;#34; moments you see in commercials, haha.</li>

            <li> This is the real thing! I have bought peppermint oil at a Farmer&#x27;s Market before and apparently it was not pure - the smell and texture quickly deteriorated a week after I first used it. goPure&#x27;s has stayed fresh throughout my use of the product. It adds an invigorating addition to my lotions and soaps. I can&#x27;t imagine not having this product on hand!</li>
            <li> Love using this in my aromatherapy machine.</li>
            <li> Great peppermint scent, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle of peppermint oil! Peppermint oil is good for so many things! Great for aromatherapy, for making your own lotion, and also awesome for  ridding your house of insects, including spiders! You can just add a tablespoon or so to a sprayer bottle of water (I use a 16 ounce one I purchased at the hardware store) and spray it all around window door frames and spiders will not come into your house because spiders hate peppermint! Peppermint oil is also an anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-parasitic. There are so many uses for peppermint oil. This product has no additives, it is 100% pure mentha peperita made from peppermint leaves and it is made in the USA. It really is the Best peppermint oil! I would recommend this brand to anyone needing peppermint oil. It is made by a very reputable company!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, bottle is large, oil is great! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle! Great quality peppermint oil!</li>
            <li> This peppermint oil is wonderful!  The aroma is soothing, and I enjoy using it on my skin (diluted with jojoba oil) or in a diffuser.  It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and feels great on my skin.  For me, the peppermint aroma is energizing while also working wonders for headaches and sinus issues caused by outdoor allergies.  The 4-ounce bottle is large, and since the oil is so potent, I only use a drop or two at a time. The bottle will last a long time, which is good news, since I love using goPure Peppermint Oil so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;nt used yet, but understand is perfect for getting rid of spiders.</li>
            <li> Put it on your temples for headaches, mix with coconut oil for oil pulling, add to water for digestion.  This seems really high quality. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> At first the smell was a little overwhelming as it is concentrated, but once diluted it is very pleasant.  It works very well to help clear the congestion from allergies.</li>
            <li> Excellent Price...smells great!</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm for our household! We are doing some renovating in our home and wanted to make sure spiders, ants, and bugs would not enter through the rest of the house. I just transferred over a few drops into a spray bottle, mixed a little water in it and sprayed the areas inside our home where these ants, spiders and bugs could possibly find their way in (mainly near windows, door frames, cracks, dark areas like the fireplace or closets). Luckily, I have not seen any in our home thanks to this peppermint oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also used this to ward off ant problems my in laws have been having at their house and it has been working!  You can also put a few drops onto cotton balls as well and leave them in the problem areas/corners.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very high grade essential oil. I use it in many different ways.</li>
            <li> Go Pure Peppermint Essential Oil is steam distilled oil with a nice strongish mint that has a slight sweet smell,&lt;br /&gt;but not like candy. When I am feeling drab I put a few drops of peppermint oil on the shower floor when I take&lt;br /&gt;a shower and breath the vapor in. Add a few drops of peppermint oil to a foot bath to help tired achy feet and&lt;br /&gt;you can a tea tree oil as well to give a extra fungus punch. Peppermint Oil is a natural way to go for remedies&lt;br /&gt;for sinus issues and headache relief. In the years that I have used peppermint oil, vinegar and other essential&lt;br /&gt;oils in my cleaning routine, we have never had ants, even though crumbs get knock on the floor, teens are&lt;br /&gt;around that don&#x27;t always rinse dishes plus the dogs &amp; cat food dishes are down.  I bought this product at a&lt;br /&gt;promotional price for review &amp; testing. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews&lt;br /&gt;are honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Great for getting rid of ants in the home.Mix dish water detergent and six drops of the oil and water in a small spray bottle.When you see ants ,shake and spray.Smells wonderful and ants are gone.</li>
            <li> Helps to discourage the ant invasion.  Put it on a cotton ball in the cabinet.</li>

            <li> goPURE Naturals 100% Peppermint (Mentha Piperita) Essential Oil is a therapeutic Grade A triple purified, cold-pressed oil.  Why is it important to know that this oil is cold pressed?  Cold pressed peppermint oil is made from pressing and grinding the fresh aerial parts of the peppermint plant, either using a granite millstone or stainless steel presses.  Since grinding does produce heat due to friction, the temperature must not rise above 120°F (49°C) and the best cold pressed oils are made at much lower temperatures.  Cold pressed oils will keep all of their aroma, flavor, and nutritional value, which makes them superior other oils.  goPURE Naturals Peppermint Oil has a high concentration of menthol and menthone, which lends itself to its bright minty scent.  goPURE Naturals 100% Pure Peppermint Oil comes in a huge 4 oz bottle with a cap.  There is also an eyedropper applicator, but you can store this with the cap in place, which makes it handy for traveling.  The bottle is an amber colored glass bottle, which keeps the oil from spoiling.  This oil is just 100% pure peppermint oil, no harmful chemicals, no additives, no preservatives and no added fragrances ~ along with no animal testing  Since this is 100% pure oil, if used directly on skin, it must be diluted, either with water or a carrier oil, such coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, olive or almond oil.

I have been using goPure Natural’s 100% Pure Peppermint Oil  in many of the ways I have described above and I will be sharing a DIY foot scrub recipe with you below.

I received this product free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review</li>
            <li> I was given this for review it is an excellent product very concentrated so this bottle will last you a long time. i have used it with a carrier oil for headache relief and also in a lipbalm recipe it worked very well for both.</li>
            <li> I used the peppermint oil with water in a spray bottle to repell spiders in our basement. Nice size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Excited for all the ways I can use it. Even added some to our outdoor garbage can with baking soda to freshen it up. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Perfect, will buy again</li>
            <li> This is the nastiest smelling essential oil I have EVER smelled.  I have purchased oils from many companies and this by far the worst.  It does not smell much like peppermint, and, in fact, smells like a cross between hospital disinfectant and cow manure.  (Seriously.)  We can only conclude it has been contaminated in some way, because there is no way they are shipping this substance as is to anyone else and remaining in business.  They indicate it is an insect repellent; well, it is a people repellent, too.   My guess is it would repel anything possessing the capacity for escape.</li>
            <li> This brand of peppermint oil is one that I would recommend.  It worked wonderfully for use in making homemade soap and also for therapeutic purposes.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I woke up with a sinus headache. I diluted the peppermint oil with coconut oil and applied some to my temples and the back of my neck.  After about 15 minutes my headache was noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;I began using essential oils at home making all natural soaps.  Finding quality natural ingredients is important to me, so I was excited to try the goPure peppermint essential oil.  I used the peppermint oil to make a batch of soap. I made a chocolate peppermint patty soap that smells good enough to eat! The peppermint oil has a nice clean smell that one looks for in pure essential oils.  It is potent and only took a small amount to add scent to an entire batch of soap.&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle of oil for free through a promotion, but this review reflects my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Since, we have all been so tense and stressed around here I have been adding a little bit of pure peppermint oil in my oil warmer. It has seemed to relax everyone a little, it makes the house feel fresh and clean and puts everyone a ease. It also helps with my asthma which helped me relax a bit too, ha ya’ll don’t know how stressful it is not being able to breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, it’s about allergy season time. We all know how much of a headache those can be, literally, I can feel the ghost like symptoms now. Stuffy head, runny nose, sneezing,watery eyes, gosh and it’s so much worse with asthma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have my “preventive medicine” as I like to call it. I will continue to keep my peppermint oil in my oil warmer throughout the season to keep my family and I allergy free. Lord knows we don’t need one more thing to stress about, especially something like allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe in.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the plunge on a more natural way to go about things. For years I have been using peppermint based products so I decided to go ahead and start working with essential oils. I did a lot of research since I have heard both good and bad and figured the only way I am going to figure out whether or not this is going to work for me is to try it. With that being said I was able to receive some peppermint oil to try and give my honest review on. Now we all know I am not swayed by anything and my opinion is mine alone so here we go. I found out when looking into these oils that a carrier oil is need and I opted to use a coconut carrier oil. I will say this made for a strange scent combination but I like it. Think day at the beach with a mint chip cone in hand. OK so I’ll move on here. My first use for this was for headaches, I have them and they are the bane of my existence. So my first test of this was to see if it is really all it is supposed to be when it comes to headaches. I placed a few drops in some of the coconut oil and gave them a good shake to mix them up. Once combined I took a few drops and placed it on my temples. I first had a tingling sensation but after a few minutes it subsided and within 15 minutes my headache was gone. Now if I would of known about this years ago I could of saved a load of money on over the counter stuff. So the other thing I head outstanding things about is using this as a foot soak. Now I know that peppermint has anti-fungal properties and it is supposed to be refreshing. Well let me tell you, even if I never use this for my headaches again I will always add a few drops to the water that I soak my feet in after I have worked an event and been on my feet for 8+ hours. Overall I am thrilled with this Peppermint Oil and if you are looking for something natural this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint eo and the delivery was quick</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. I use this to help with my headaches and I spray outside and in side to keep the house smell good and to help keep spiders away* I did get this product for free to give my honest thought on it.this is my own words and thought.</li>
