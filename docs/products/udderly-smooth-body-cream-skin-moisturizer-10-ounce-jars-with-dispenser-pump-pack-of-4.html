            <li>This is wonderful for softening your hands.  </li>
            <li>&gt; The quality is excellent</li>
            <li>The cream is excellent, the dispenser is excellent and the value for the money is beyond excellent!</li>
            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>And so happy that this is Made in USA!</li>
            <li>Very good.  </li>
            <li>but I have to say that this is not going to be a very good review...</li>
            <li>Everybody loved it!</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so great if you are into knitting, crocheting, quilting, sewing, etc, because it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>I had never found these in pump form this is great for chapped skin</li>
            <li>And this 4-pack is a great deal because one 12oz jar (without a pump) costs about $6 at a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>The body cream is great.  </li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I love Udderly Smooth!!!!!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon would treat udderly smooth one of the best rated products like garbage.</li>
            <li>Both loved having their pads massaged with it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used, not to mention the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product because my mother, with advance cancer that&#x27;s impacting her skin, is able to use this to replenish moisture all over her body.    </li>
            <li>I love this cream!  </li>
            <li>My grandmother introduced this to me in my teens and my hands have never been better!  </li>
            <li>Cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>Good but not my favorite........</li>
            <li>They liked it</li>
            <li>cream is especially impressive because I tend to wash my hands frequently.  </li>
            <li>cheap and good.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very fast and great with resolving the problem.</li>
            <li>Udder Cream, is a good product, and having it available in a pump, it makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The top had several&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing I   love the most about this cream is it is not one bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love to put my finger into the jar and put  it wherever I want it without having to pump it out.  </li>
            <li>One day I ran out and remembered my shaving experience with Udder Cream of more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>I am also a fan of the pumps since they are much more hygienic.  </li>
            <li>More of a hassle then anything.</li>
            <li>Would like this better in a tube.</li>
            <li>So tell your packers to use more bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I found this product many, many moons ago in my local Walmart and have loved it ever since!!</li>
            <li>I have temperamental skin and this is the only cream that I have found that works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Ok also</li>
            <li>Would be better dispensed by a tube container.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; scent of the product was overwhelming to me.</li>
            <li>love the pump.</li>
            <li>Feels pretty good but is more of a butter feel than a lotion.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine and gave me a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry skin lotion I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>just nothing special for any of us!</li>
            <li>The product is great makes your hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, so men can use it too -</li>
            <li>Hope that fine company tells amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have ordered this item a number of times and all has been fine.</li>
            <li>The exterior of the box, was fine, not banged up at all.</li>
            <li>cream itself is ok, absorbs fast, has very light scent.  </li>
            <li>Well, with a little practice, it&#x27;s doable and provides me with the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling, just smooth softness.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for skin that cracks in the winter, and this is the most useful and practical to apply.  </li>
            <li>1 of: Udderly Smooth Body Cream Skin Moisturizer, 10-Ounce Jars with Dispenser Pump (Pack of 4)  </li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to stir it up every so often to keep the pump flowing smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not only is it very effective, it goes on smoothly and disappears into the skin in just a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Too much work!!!</li>
            <li>I like the handy pump feature on this particular.  </li>
            <li>None of them ever made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I should have looked up the ingredients beforehand, but this is full of parabens.</li>
            <li>It works good until you start getting to the last 1/4 of the container</li>
            <li>This lotion works great on hands, feet, or pretty much any body part to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin.</li>
            <li>I recently found Udderly Smooth products and fell in love, so I purchased this 4-pack to give some crafty family members as part of their Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, cant live without it.</li>
            <li>It provides for a really close shave and leaves the skin wonderfully smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love Udderly Smooth products, especially the creams.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I am able to use this on my face as well as the rest of my body with no issues.</li>
            <li>I did not like the delay or the fact that one jar the top was not tight and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li>this seems to do better then most of the other products he has used.</li>
            <li>You know, I think this stuff is superior to conventional shaving gel.</li>
            <li>it is a gentle but good moisturizer it works so well for dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Real moisture without the lingering \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling!</li>
            <li>I have never had it with a dispenser  pump before and actually like it better without the pump.  </li>
            <li>When I first discovered the udder cream, I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li>It really does rub into the skin without greasiness!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>but that is exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li>So I went back to using whatever looked OK at Walmart, but I didn&#x27;t like any of them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost whipped, goes on very light, non greasy, absorbs quickly, and extremely moisturizing and leaves your skin</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is super soft feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying the four-pack on Amazon was smart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream for several years.</li>
            <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be in a dispenser</li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make her paws smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very chapped (even to the point of bleeding)</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how well it works as a lotion because the scent was too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li>Fantiastic Price and fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it any better that other lotions</li>
            <li>I was able to buy Udderly Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer in a health food store for a long time  and then they stopped carrying it as they added other items</li>
            <li>But, at least the product helps with dry skin very good.</li>
            <li>Some other creams are effective, but have too much of a medicinal smell to apply in public, or are too greasy to use except on your way to bed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in Udderly Smooth is particularly worse than most scented lotions, but it isn&#x27;t lighter either.</li>
            <li>The viscosity of the cream is too high for it to work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for anyone who experiences severe chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>AMAZON handled the complaint beautifully, but I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem or if it&#x27;s a single instance.</li>
            <li>In fact, if I just lightly wash my hands and not scrub the back of my hands very much, the lotion seems to stay in the skin and continues to protect it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, whoever packaged the 4 units of 10 oz jars did NOT do a great job.  </li>
            <li>just started knitting and have been getting a sore/dry/cracked spot on my finger and just after the first few uses, it has made a huge difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This could be rectified by making the container more narrow.</li>
            <li>I can put this on and go right back to the computer and type on the keyboard or use my track ball mouse.</li>
            <li>It was mess to clean up!  </li>
            <li>New  $4.99</li>
            <li>After just a couple of applications my hands are now completely chap-free!  </li>
            <li>Well, not having an udder, I just used my imagination and found it to be a fine product for a wide variety of bodily</li>
            <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s a great balm for runners with nasty calloused</li>
            <li>Goes into the skin and my skin feels so  soft.  </li>
            <li>My wife remarked that my face felt as soft as the baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive nose, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>Works in to hands well, leaves them soft but not oily feeling</li>
            <li>This is a newer formula, not as good as the last formula, but still BETTER than any other product you can purchase - and isn&#x27;t as expensive either!</li>
            <li>I usually buy the 12-ounce jar, but this dispenser model fits my present uses better.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this, I was still using the straight jars with no dispenser-why was I living under a rock for so long?!  </li>
            <li>My husband is undergoing chemo treatment and his skin has gotten really scaly and dry.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me breakout either, major plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;places not closed.</li>
            <li>All was not lost, I simply cut the bag carefully at the top and extracted the jars and lids, rolled the open edge down, squeezed the spilled cream into a sealed corner, cut the corner, and squeezed the cream out like it was a pastry bag.  </li>
            <li>cream is much softer than other creams we have used</li>
            <li>Definitely not greasy or oily, once it has dried and absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first jar out of the packaging did not have the lid screwed on properly, and the bottom half fell and the cream flew everywhere.</li>
            <li>Due to chemotherapy my skin is very dry and this lotion helps very much.</li>
            <li>But the set of 4 bottles, were placed in a clear plastic bag, the item was then placed in a box, which was way to large, and it was packed, with hardly any plastic bubble wrap to keep it stored snugly in the box.</li>

            <li> Fantiastic Price and fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it any better that other lotions</li>
            <li> I was able to buy Udderly Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer in a health food store for a long time  and then they stopped carrying it as they added other items</li>
            <li> But, at least the product helps with dry skin very good.</li>
            <li> Some other creams are effective, but have too much of a medicinal smell to apply in public, or are too greasy to use except on your way to bed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in Udderly Smooth is particularly worse than most scented lotions, but it isn&#x27;t lighter either.</li>
            <li> The viscosity of the cream is too high for it to work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream for anyone who experiences severe chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> AMAZON handled the complaint beautifully, but I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem or if it&#x27;s a single instance.</li>
            <li> In fact, if I just lightly wash my hands and not scrub the back of my hands very much, the lotion seems to stay in the skin and continues to protect it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, whoever packaged the 4 units of 10 oz jars did NOT do a great job.  </li>
            <li> just started knitting and have been getting a sore/dry/cracked spot on my finger and just after the first few uses, it has made a huge difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This could be rectified by making the container more narrow.</li>
            <li> I can put this on and go right back to the computer and type on the keyboard or use my track ball mouse.</li>
            <li> It was mess to clean up!  </li>
            <li> New  $4.99</li>
            <li> After just a couple of applications my hands are now completely chap-free!  </li>
            <li> Well, not having an udder, I just used my imagination and found it to be a fine product for a wide variety of bodily</li>
            <li> Better yet, it&#x27;s a great balm for runners with nasty calloused</li>
            <li> Goes into the skin and my skin feels so  soft.  </li>
            <li> My wife remarked that my face felt as soft as the baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive nose, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Works in to hands well, leaves them soft but not oily feeling</li>
            <li> This is a newer formula, not as good as the last formula, but still BETTER than any other product you can purchase - and isn&#x27;t as expensive either!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the 12-ounce jar, but this dispenser model fits my present uses better.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I was still using the straight jars with no dispenser-why was I living under a rock for so long?!  </li>
            <li> My husband is undergoing chemo treatment and his skin has gotten really scaly and dry.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me breakout either, major plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;places not closed.</li>
            <li> All was not lost, I simply cut the bag carefully at the top and extracted the jars and lids, rolled the open edge down, squeezed the spilled cream into a sealed corner, cut the corner, and squeezed the cream out like it was a pastry bag.  </li>
            <li> cream is much softer than other creams we have used</li>
            <li> Definitely not greasy or oily, once it has dried and absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first jar out of the packaging did not have the lid screwed on properly, and the bottom half fell and the cream flew everywhere.</li>
            <li> Due to chemotherapy my skin is very dry and this lotion helps very much.</li>
            <li> But the set of 4 bottles, were placed in a clear plastic bag, the item was then placed in a box, which was way to large, and it was packed, with hardly any plastic bubble wrap to keep it stored snugly in the box.</li>
            <li> The result was that the plastic bag wasn&#x27;t kept secure from moving around inside the box, and when I saw the bag, I saw some of the Udder cream had been spilled in it, and when I opened the bag, 2 of the 4 containers, had their pump nozzle unlocked, and due to the very poor method of packing it to ship, the containers tumbled around inside the box, and an amount of the Udder Cream was pumped out by the containers not being secured very well at all.</li>
            <li> They temporarily offered a little relief but really did nothing for the cracking, dry skin on the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin and makes the skin last a long time.</li>
            <li> i had the same problem when one of the four jars arrived partially opened and the cream was all over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the jars of cream, possibly in packaging or en route, (was either dropped or handled too roughly?), had been punctured, and the cream was all over the contents of the package, of which also contained DVD&#x27;s which were then covered in hand cream...</li>
            <li> With other lotions, I would just put them on the back of my hands when I was at the computer because of the sticky, greasy stuff.</li>
            <li> just did not wow us!~</li>
            <li> As a physician who has to wash his hands or apply hand sanitizer between patients multiple times each day, my hands always become extremely chapped and dry during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has EXTREMELY dry skin</li>
            <li> soothes dry skin also.</li>
            <li> Our most recent order, however, was disastrous.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the dispenser -- the cream has to be stirred nearly every time to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I seriously doubt that I&#x27;ll order any more of it, because of the poor shipping it used.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it was that it&#x27;s hard to recognize in the mirror where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t, especially since I shave without my glasses on.</li>
            <li> I received the package with part of the contents of one jar partially dispensed.  </li>
            <li> Then it just stopped like it was empty.</li>
            <li> Two of the other three jars also had loose lids.</li>
            <li> However this bad batch at that price must be long gone so other orders are probably fine now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep my dry, northern skin from breaking in half during the winter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as some other products.  </li>
            <li> Leaves no greasey feeling on your hands like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use on any of your parts infected with cow pox.</li>
            <li> I use it all over after a night shower and my skin is still soft and not dry in the morning (our climate is very dry and cold at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only negative.</li>
            <li> This cream is not as thick as the Udder cream and there is something different about the smell.</li>
            <li> Extra thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> After half of it has been used, I had to shake it in order for the pump to work.</li>
            <li> This is less messy and absorbs quicker.</li>
            <li> I usually go for expensive body cream in Sephora but realized I was spending way too much money.  </li>
            <li> It was a little messy but got the job done.</li>
            <li> used the lotion a few times myself and like that it is not oily.</li>
            <li> A wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I used a bit to rub the bottom of my dogs paw pads which have gotten cracked and dry in our harsh California winter (dry, windy, cold).  </li>
            <li> When the pump quits working I usually just scoop it out of the jar with my hand but that can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not sting or have a harsh smell so applying it into their pads was a breeze!  </li>
            <li> No more infection.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is not as thick as the tube container.  </li>
            <li> After an hour or so there is a faint sour smell that developes that&#x27;s like spoiled dairy.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my dogs paws when they get dry from the cold.</li>
            <li> But the packaging was really bad an all 4 of them were open and leaking inside their packaging.</li>
            <li> But the pump idea&#x27;s a poor one.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this stuff and the manufacturer would not take it back.</li>
            <li> too bad the product design is not appealing.</li>
            <li> Pump is totally useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> I also noticed someone else here had a review about the bad smell.</li>
            <li> and I missed it terribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I should have looked up the ingredients beforehand, but this is full of parabens. Only negative. Otherwise the lotion is nice. Not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a packaging item. But amazon makes it so the stuff they sell can only be judged by delivery &amp; packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was held by a couple of threads on the bottom ( I broke it open with my pinky ??? ) The top had several&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;places not closed. The product was in a open bag &amp; had leaked a big pile of product all over. It&#x27;s a shame that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon would treat udderly smooth one of the best rated products like garbage. Hope that fine company tells amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to get it together. ????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep my dry, northern skin from breaking in half during the winter. I love Udderly Smooth products, especially the creams.  Real moisture without the lingering \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling!</li>
            <li> I was able to buy Udderly Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer in a health food store for a long time  and then they stopped carrying it as they added other items and I missed it terribly.  The thing I   love the most about this cream is it is not one bit greasy.  Goes into the skin and my skin feels so  soft.  I use it for a moisturizer cream after showering all the time.  I have never had it with a dispenser  pump before and actually like it better without the pump.  I love to put my finger into the jar and put  it wherever I want it without having to pump it out.  But I wanted to try the pump since I had never  had one before.  A great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry skin lotion I have ever used!! It does not leave my skin with a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slick\\&quot; feeling, just smooth softness. I can put this on and go right back to the computer and type on the keyboard or use my track ball mouse. With other lotions, I would just put them on the back of my hands when I was at the computer because of the sticky, greasy stuff. I love Udderly Smooth!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for softening your hands.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as some other products.  Has actually made some of the bumps on mine go away.  After I use it my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy, but don&#x27;t feel like I have used lotion.</li>
            <li> I received the package with part of the contents of one jar partially dispensed.  I sent a email and received no response from Amazon.com.  So I will rate pakaging &amp; customer service with a 1/2 star.    Ed Richards</li>
            <li> I got about halfway through and it stopped pumping. I can move the tube around and have it pump again, but it&#x27;s a PITA. I like the stuff, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s great. It got rid of my swimmer&#x27;s rash. But the pump idea&#x27;s a poor one. The viscosity of the cream is too high for it to work. This could be rectified by making the container more narrow.</li>
            <li> I recently found Udderly Smooth products and fell in love, so I purchased this 4-pack to give some crafty family members as part of their Christmas presents. Everybody loved it! This stuff is so great if you are into knitting, crocheting, quilting, sewing, etc, because it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your hands. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, so men can use it too - my friend is a mechanic and he loves this stuff (he also uses it on his bald head).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream for several years. I usually buy the 12-ounce jar, but this dispenser model fits my present uses better. When I first discovered the udder cream, I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. All the instructions had to do with the proper preparation and care of the udder. Well, not having an udder, I just used my imagination and found it to be a fine product for a wide variety of bodily applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one case, I read of a fellow who had shaved with it. Hmmmmm. Well, of course, I just had to try it. It worked just fine and gave me a nice smooth shave. I kept it in mind in case I ever inadvertently ran out of shaving gel some day. It happened. One day I ran out and remembered my shaving experience with Udder Cream of more than a year ago. I used it for four days until I got to the store. You know, I think this stuff is superior to conventional shaving gel. It&#x27;s amazing! It provides for a really close shave and leaves the skin wonderfully smooth and refreshed. My wife remarked that my face felt as soft as the baby&#x27;s skin. My only problem with it was that it&#x27;s hard to recognize in the mirror where you&#x27;ve shaved and where you haven&#x27;t, especially since I shave without my glasses on. Well, with a little practice, it&#x27;s doable and provides me with the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. Who would&#x27;ve ever thunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  I have tried everything for skin that cracks in the winter, and this is the most useful and practical to apply.  Some other creams are effective, but have too much of a medicinal smell to apply in public, or are too greasy to use except on your way to bed.  I am also a fan of the pumps since they are much more hygienic.  However, as others have pointed out, when they arrived in the mail the lids on 2 of the 4 jars had opened and the cream spilled all over.  All was not lost, I simply cut the bag carefully at the top and extracted the jars and lids, rolled the open edge down, squeezed the spilled cream into a sealed corner, cut the corner, and squeezed the cream out like it was a pastry bag.  It was a little messy but got the job done.</li>
            <li> Feels pretty good but is more of a butter feel than a lotion. It really shouldn&#x27;t be in a dispenser</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my boyfriend...and the dog. My boyfriend has EXTREMELY dry skin this seems to do better then most of the other products he has used. I also use this on my dogs paws when they get dry from the cold. I prefer salve with her but the socks don&#x27;t stay on her well so that stuff ends up all over my floor. This is less messy and absorbs quicker. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make her paws smooth but it does help keep them from getting too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion a few times myself and like that it is not oily. My skin is sensitive and I am able to use this on my face as well as the rest of my body with no issues. It didn&#x27;t make me breakout either, major plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the pump. It works good until you start getting to the last 1/4 of the container and then it takes a lot of beating the jar around to get it to fall so the pump can get it. More of a hassle then anything. Would like this better in a tube. When the pump quits working I usually just scoop it out of the jar with my hand but that can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will probably purchase the brand again but won&#x27;t be buying this item again because of the dispensing method.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, cant live without it. But the packaging was really bad an all 4 of them were open and leaking inside their packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a great product because my mother, with advance cancer that&#x27;s impacting her skin, is able to use this to replenish moisture all over her body.    Unfortunately, whoever packaged the 4 units of 10 oz jars did NOT do a great job.  2 units were damaged and couldn&#x27;t be salvaged!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Our family has been using it for years. Heals cracked habds in winter. soothes dry skin also.</li>
            <li> Now that I have used it for a while, I am not enthused about the pump. After half of it has been used, I had to shake it in order for the pump to work. Then it just stopped like it was empty. So I put it in a decorative pump bottle that I have and am using it that way. I had to scrape the lotion out of the jar, put it in a plastic bag, cut the corner and squeeze it into the bottle like decorating a cake. Too much work!!! I&#x27;ll stick with the tub.</li>
            <li> The product is great makes your hands soft and smooth. Leaves no greasey feeling on your hands like other lotions.The only problem I had was one of the jars was cracked in shipping.So tell your packers to use more bubble wrap.I order products from amazon all the time. When you can&#x60;t find it anywhere else you can get it at amazon.</li>
            <li> I had never found these in pump form this is great for chapped skin so I got them for myself and friends and it came on time packaged well</li>
            <li> Cream is amazing. Pump is totally useless.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great on hands, feet, or pretty much any body part to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin. I&#x27;ve found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Better yet, it&#x27;s a great balm for runners with nasty calloused feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words of caution: keep out of your eyes. it hurts. Bad. Also, don&#x27;t use on any of your parts infected with cow pox.</li>
            <li> This cream truly deserves 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my dry skin.  I use it all over after a night shower and my skin is still soft and not dry in the morning (our climate is very dry and cold at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is especially impressive because I tend to wash my hands frequently.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off and I don&#x27;t immediately feel the need to reapply it after every washing because my hands still feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started knitting and have been getting a sore/dry/cracked spot on my finger and just after the first few uses, it has made a huge difference on my skin.  It really does rub into the skin without greasiness!  It does not leave any type of residue on my project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I used a bit to rub the bottom of my dogs paw pads which have gotten cracked and dry in our harsh California winter (dry, windy, cold).  It does not sting or have a harsh smell so applying it into their pads was a breeze!  Both loved having their pads massaged with it.  I would highly recommend!!  And this 4-pack is a great deal because one 12oz jar (without a pump) costs about $6 at a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> We use it on arms, legs  mostly&lt;br /&gt; The quality is excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is much softer than other creams we have used</li>
            <li> I found this product many, many moons ago in my local Walmart and have loved it ever since!! I have temperamental skin and this is the only cream that I have found that works perfectly!  Before I bought this, I was still using the straight jars with no dispenser-why was I living under a rock for so long?!  The cream is excellent, the dispenser is excellent and the value for the money is beyond excellent!</li>
            <li> i had the same problem when one of the four jars arrived partially opened and the cream was all over.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is ok, absorbs fast, has very light scent.  Amazon was very fast and great with resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very chapped (even to the point of bleeding) hands while growing up.  My grandmother introduced this to me in my teens and my hands have never been better!  This is a newer formula, not as good as the last formula, but still BETTER than any other product you can purchase - and isn&#x27;t as expensive either!</li>
            <li> This cream is not as thick as the Udder cream and there is something different about the smell. After an hour or so there is a faint sour smell that developes that&#x27;s like spoiled dairy. I know there are no dairy products involved but that is exactly what it smells like. I could also smell it on my friend after she tried it so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be just on me. I also noticed someone else here had a review about the bad smell. Something is off and I think that&#x27;s why they sold this batch of 4 pump dispensers for $5.     I found the here on Slickdeals.[...]    However this bad batch at that price must be long gone so other orders are probably fine now. You get what you pay for.    From my order details.    1 of: Udderly Smooth Body Cream Skin Moisturizer, 10-Ounce Jars with Dispenser Pump (Pack of 4)  Sold by: Amazon.com LLC    Condition: New  $4.99</li>
            <li> We have ordered this item a number of times and all has been fine. Our most recent order, however, was disastrous. The first jar out of the packaging did not have the lid screwed on properly, and the bottom half fell and the cream flew everywhere. Two of the other three jars also had loose lids. AMAZON handled the complaint beautifully, but I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem or if it&#x27;s a single instance. Anyone?</li>
            <li> Good but not my favorite........Gave them to my daughter and daughter in law!~ They liked it Ok also just nothing special for any of us! You may like it just did not wow us!~</li>
            <li> My dad used this on his face during radiation treatment.  He swore by it!</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this stuff. Works well on dry skin and makes the skin last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Non greasy.</li>
            <li> Due to chemotherapy my skin is very dry and this lotion helps very much. I did not like the delay or the fact that one jar the top was not tight and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I have to say that this is not going to be a very good review...One of the jars of cream, possibly in packaging or en route, (was either dropped or handled too roughly?), had been punctured, and the cream was all over the contents of the package, of which also contained DVD&#x27;s which were then covered in hand cream...Yuck!  It was mess to clean up!  We are still trying to salvage the DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like the handy pump feature on this particular.  Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is not as thick as the tube container.  May be so that it will come through the pump easier.</li>
            <li> The body cream is great.  My only complaint is the dispenser -- the cream has to be stirred nearly every time to get the pump to work. Would be better dispensed by a tube container.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive nose, this product is not for you. The \\&quot;light\\&quot; scent of the product was overwhelming to me. I don&#x27;t think the fragrance in Udderly Smooth is particularly worse than most scented lotions, but it isn&#x27;t lighter either. I really don&#x27;t know how well it works as a lotion because the scent was too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I usually go for expensive body cream in Sephora but realized I was spending way too much money.  So I went back to using whatever looked OK at Walmart, but I didn&#x27;t like any of them.  Then I read about the udder cream and gave it a shot . . . This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used, not to mention the cheap price.  It&#x27;s almost whipped, goes on very light, non greasy, absorbs quickly, and extremely moisturizing and leaves your skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t get the one with dispenser pump because the pump will not work.  Get the one in a regular jar.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this stuff and the manufacturer would not take it back. It also to slippery for my use. A wasted purchase. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> So smooth. Feels great.</li>
            <li> Extra thick and creamy. Does the job at moisturizing your skin. I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to stir it up every so often to keep the pump flowing smoothly. But, at least the product helps with dry skin very good.</li>
            <li> Used this for my yeast infection. No more infection.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it any better that other lotions</li>
            <li> This lotion is super soft feeling. Works in to hands well, leaves them soft but not oily feeling</li>
            <li> i buy this to use on my skin in the winter. i would recommend it.  it is a gentle but good moisturizer it works so well for dry skin</li>
            <li> As a physician who has to wash his hands or apply hand sanitizer between patients multiple times each day, my hands always become extremely chapped and dry during the winter months.  I have tried all kinds of hand creams over the years.  None of them ever made a significant difference.  They temporarily offered a little relief but really did nothing for the cracking, dry skin on the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Udder Cream a try on the recommendation of one of my patients.  After just a couple of applications my hands are now completely chap-free!  All within just 48 hours.  I highly recommend this cream for anyone who experiences severe chapped hands.  Not only is it very effective, it goes on smoothly and disappears into the skin in just a couple of minutes.  In fact, if I just lightly wash my hands and not scrub the back of my hands very much, the lotion seems to stay in the skin and continues to protect it for a long time.  The fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming.  Definitely not greasy or oily, once it has dried and absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying the four-pack on Amazon was smart.  I keep one container by my bedside, one at work, and another in my home office.</li>
            <li> My husband is undergoing chemo treatment and his skin has gotten really scaly and dry.  This cream works wonders!  And so happy that this is Made in USA!</li>
            <li> Fantiastic Price and fast shipment.  Using for gift baskets for Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> Udder Cream, is a good product, and having it available in a pump, it makes it easy to use. However, the package itself, to ship it in the box, was a disgrace. I bought the item, as 4 individual containers, each with a pump nozzle attached to it. But the set of 4 bottles, were placed in a clear plastic bag, the item was then placed in a box, which was way to large, and it was packed, with hardly any plastic bubble wrap to keep it stored snugly in the box. The result was that the plastic bag wasn&#x27;t kept secure from moving around inside the box, and when I saw the bag, I saw some of the Udder cream had been spilled in it, and when I opened the bag, 2 of the 4 containers, had their pump nozzle unlocked, and due to the very poor method of packing it to ship, the containers tumbled around inside the box, and an amount of the Udder Cream was pumped out by the containers not being secured very well at all. Because of this, I seriously doubt that I&#x27;ll order any more of it, because of the poor shipping it used. The exterior of the box, was fine, not banged up at all. It was simply not packed for shipping, correctly.</li>
            <li> cheap and good. what else should i say about this product. love the pump. too bad the product design is not appealing.</li>
