            <li>and now I&#x27;m starting to lose that...if it was not for this stuff (and a great hair cut) then I wouldn&#x27;t be pumped.  </li>

            <li>Many thanks!</li>

            <li>AND THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN BUT LEAVES YOU WITH A HAIR STYLE FOR DAYS EVEN</li>
            <li>Been using it a very long time and couldn&#x27;t find it and very glad to purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased a large bottle of this several years ago &amp; was very pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to keep the curl in my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It holds my fine hair in wet, wind and humidity while being able to brush it out.  </li>
            <li>I like this mousse very much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I use it in place of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several years ago, but remember it to be better.  </li>
            <li>I use after damp drying and also when dry to give more lift.</li>
            <li>Plus you can also blow dry your hair after putting the mousse on in your favorite style.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the reviews on Amazon because it&#x27;s the first place I look in order to find out how real people like the product - not the advertisers.  </li>
            <li>This really is a great product for styling hair..can be used on wet or dry hair...</li>
            <li>It gives so much volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone for leading me to this mousse.</li>
            <li>This really helps with the frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spray much for it to work.</li>
            <li>You might as well use a light  hair spray and get similar results.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try it has been a real time</li>
            <li>This product really makes styling a breeze for me.  </li>
            <li>and it holds very well.  </li>
            <li>Want to have hair that is pumped sky high?  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this liquid mousse.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair and needed a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh the hair down but give manageability.  </li>
            <li>I combine this with either a curling iron or hot curlers for a longer lasting hairdo.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair and this gives it body and hold.  </li>
            <li>I reordered this because it works so well to help put body in limp, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy product on hair.</li>
            <li>My thin hair blow dries so much better, feels and looks thicker.  </li>
            <li>I really only use this product on my bangs as they don&#x27;t stay put without it, I use a small amount and then with a round brush am able to get my bangs to stay all day.</li>
            <li>Get a mister bottle of plain water &amp; spray on your hair the next day &amp; it actually reactivates as if you&#x27;re applying it the first time around.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly thin and fine.  </li>
            <li>Even when I sleep the next day my hair is still not flat.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just a little when I dry with my hot air brush</li>
            <li> Flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I put a few rollers into my dry hair; squirt on bit of liquid fix and in minutes, it&#x27;s dry and hair is ready to comb out.  </li>
            <li> Was kind of disappointed because the cost went up quite a bit from the last time I bought it here on line.</li>
            <li> Dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Spray it on, roll up and wait for it to dry in minutes.  </li>
            <li> Use on dry hair before curling.</li>
            <li> Set your hair in Rollers dry, and spritz this on.</li>
            <li> both like it because it doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every single day.  </li>
            <li> All I do is spray all over then use one of those big fat round brushes with holes and a blow dryer while rounding and rising up &amp; over.  </li>
            <li> Holds style and down weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it when styling my dry hair with a round brush &amp; a hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> Gives control and support without having buildup and does not have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Liquifix for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I spritz my (thin) hair with DiCesare Liquifix, put in curlers, have breakfast, 10 minutes later, I have Volume and Curls....</li>
            <li> I just put a very little on the palm of one hand and the rub it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> tt is quite possible that my hair could be the problem, so do not want to make an unfair statement</li>
            <li> sprayer does not work comes out in a stream hard too put in hair evenly  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a bottle of this &amp; sent it to a relative who has badly thinning hair on the crown of her head.  </li>
            <li> I am finding it harder to find and am afraid it will be unavailable soon.  </li>
            <li> so this stuff is working hard!  </li>
            <li> I still had a bottle with the sprayer because the liquid would be impossible to use without the sprayer.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> sprayer does not work comes out in a stream hard too put in hair evenly  soaks your hair in  spots .</li>
            <li> I spritz the liquifix liquid mousse after I have my hair in velcro rollers and then heat with blow dryer.  I have fine limp hair and this gives it body and hold.  I am finding it harder to find and am afraid it will be unavailable soon.  Will be stocking up.</li>
            <li> Want to have hair that is pumped sky high?  This is it!  I totally love it sooooooooooo much!  I have baby fine hair and now I&#x27;m starting to lose that...if it was not for this stuff (and a great hair cut) then I wouldn&#x27;t be pumped.  I use it and the height lasts and lasts.  All I do is spray all over then use one of those big fat round brushes with holes and a blow dryer while rounding and rising up &amp; over.  BIG HAIR for HOURS.   And I sweat!  so this stuff is working hard!  Work it baby!  LOVE THIS SPRAY!!!!!!!!    p.s. used to buy via HSN...hated the s&amp;h price...they no longer carry...found a website but it seemed funky...feel safe buying here and the \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; of the quality was great, quick delivery.  :)</li>
            <li> This really is a great product for styling hair..can be used on wet or dry hair...I really love it.  This also holds hair all day in the style you choose.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I cannot live without this liquid mousse.  It gives so much volume to your hair.  I use it when styling my dry hair with a round brush &amp; a hair dryer!  It is amazing.  The absolute best hair product ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product delivers!  My hairdresser used it on me and I had to get my own supply.  I just put a very little on the palm of one hand and the rub it into my hair.  My thin hair blow dries so much better, feels and looks thicker.  Even when I sleep the next day my hair is still not flat.</li>
            <li> Dry hair.  Flat iron.  There is no product on the market with as strong a hold.  I have tried them all.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I Use as I am drying and styling my hair.  Gives control and support without having buildup and does not have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> makes my short hair fuller and easier to style.  I use after damp drying and also when dry to give more lift.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used it years ago, and then couldn&#x27;t find it for quite awhile. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this product - it makes your set hold all day - even in humid conditions!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find some of Michael&#x27;s products out there now - wish he would appear on HSN or QVC again.</li>
            <li> The product adds body to the hair and is very easy to use.  It&#x27;s been around for many years and is still great..</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, this product is amazing.  Holds style and down weigh down your hair.  You can put your hair in rollers and spray; in just a short while your hair is set.  Plus you can also blow dry your hair after putting the mousse on in your favorite style.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased a large bottle of this several years ago &amp; was very pleased with the performance.  It performs just as DeCesare claims so I ordered a bottle of this &amp; sent it to a relative who has badly thinning hair on the crown of her head.  Then I found some YouTube videos showing her how to use it.  She was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both like it because it doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every single day.  Get a mister bottle of plain water &amp; spray on your hair the next day &amp; it actually reactivates as if you&#x27;re applying it the first time around.</li>
            <li> It was shipped without the spray pump.  Good thing I still had a bottle with the sprayer because the liquid would be impossible to use without the sprayer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product with my electric rollers for years.  I am so glad I found it again!  It really helps to keep the curl in my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this again. Have been using for years!,  Could no longer find it at the supplier I used to use</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product before but after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  I have fine, thinning hair and needed a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh the hair down but give manageability.  This does a wonderful job, have told all my friends about it and will continue to use this product!  What a great find.  I really appreciate the reviews on Amazon because it&#x27;s the first place I look in order to find out how real people like the product - not the advertisers.  Thanks to everyone for leading me to this mousse.</li>
            <li> This really helps with the frizzy hair. I have gray hair and you know how that can be. You don&#x27;t have to spray much for it to work. Makes hair smooth...love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great styling product for use with velcro rollers.  Spray it on, roll up and wait for it to dry in minutes.  I use it in place of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for three years now. Inherited it from my mother and haven&#x27;t changed since. Not a heavy product on hair. Gives hair enough volume without feeling &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. Use on dry hair before curling. Product also brushes out&lt;br /&gt; No build up.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN BUT LEAVES YOU WITH A HAIR STYLE FOR DAYS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE HUMID WEATHER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several years ago, but remember it to be better.  Perhaps Mr. Dicesare changed the formula?  You might as well use a light  hair spray and get similar results.  Of course, everything looks better  when you have a GOOD, PROFESSIONAL haircut.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and nice to know I can get it from you!  Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to order from VERONICA SHOP! Fast efficient service and follow up!&lt;br /&gt;Product from Dicesare is excellent. This product is great if you are in a rush and you want to set your hair!&lt;br /&gt;I do not like using Hot-Curlers any more since I found this. Set your hair in Rollers dry, and spritz this on. Wait&lt;br /&gt;15 minutes and you have curls just like you do with Rollers! It is for those days when you get home from work&lt;br /&gt;and you need to touch up your hair. You don&#x27;t have time to wash and set.  Give it a try it has been a real time&lt;br /&gt;safer for me. This man is a Hair Stylists for celebrities, he uses this to touch up their hair before they go on the air.</li>
            <li> product is not what I wanted, I was looking for volumizer liquid. a lot of money for a styling gel</li>
            <li> I really only use this product on my bangs as they don&#x27;t stay put without it, I use a small amount and then with a round brush am able to get my bangs to stay all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thin and fine.  This product really makes styling a breeze for me.  Just a little when I dry with my hot air brush and it holds very well.  And it lasts for several days.&lt;br /&gt;Good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it a very long time and couldn&#x27;t find it and very glad to purchase again. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used to hold the hair, especially fine hair. Makes it shine too. Can use with rollers or curling iron!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair shine and under control. Hard to find. Also helps with frizzes. Great Product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this styling product. I use it with Velcro rollers. It brushes out nicely, not stiff plus it leaves my hair with a great shine.</li>
            <li> I put a few rollers into my dry hair; squirt on bit of liquid fix and in minutes, it&#x27;s dry and hair is ready to comb out.  Best part, the curl stays in and hair can be brushed or combed out.</li>
            <li> Have been in love with this product for awhile. Hope Michael keeps it available! Glad I was still able to get it!</li>
            <li> I reordered this because it works so well to help put body in limp, fine hair.  I combine this with either a curling iron or hot curlers for a longer lasting hairdo.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it and was happy to get it.&lt;br /&gt;She says it helps her hair stay nicer longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product cuz it works!  It holds my fine hair in wet, wind and humidity while being able to brush it out.  I keep most of my shine and gain curls and body in all weather.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Please don&#x27;t ever stop it&#x27;s availability.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I&#x27;ve used Liquifix for a few years.  It gives me great volume.  I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I like this mousse very much.  However, I do not not know if it is my hair, or if the ingredients have been changed.  It does not seem to hold as strongly as it once did.  tt is quite possible that my hair could be the problem, so do not want to make an unfair statement</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Was kind of disappointed because the cost went up quite a bit from the last time I bought it here on line.</li>
            <li> I spritz my (thin) hair with DiCesare Liquifix, put in curlers, have breakfast, 10 minutes later, I have Volume and Curls.... no fuss! Excellent Product.</li>
