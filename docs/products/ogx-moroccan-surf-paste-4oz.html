            <li>Great texture, nice hold, the surf look is for those who like the matte finish, and this paste delivers.  </li>
            <li>Originally loved the texture.  </li>
            <li>good for adding texture to hair, but not a bunch of hold.</li>
            <li>The textures are cool and the smell are very nice!</li>
            <li>Great hold and love the scent.</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>- so glad I did!</li>
            <li>and I this works amazingly for me.</li>
            <li>In any kind of breeze from the wind my hair gets distorted with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair paste for years, and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>I was going to give it 4 stars, but it really is a great product, if you learn how to use it properly, thanks</li>
            <li>No need to spend more on frou frou products.</li>
            <li>Up until I tried this magical stuff-</li>
            <li>It more like pomade.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, a friend at the gym let me use some of his when I was out</li>
            <li>/&gt;this works a lot more like hair creme.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I get compliments about the look and scent of my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells great and gives my a good hold without looking like it&#x27;s a rock and gross.</li>
            <li>you can really do many styles with this paste</li>
            <li>Smells great and pretty good amount for the price you pay though the hold isn&#x27;t really that strong in my opinion as the OGX texturizing paste</li>
            <li>Overall, it is not bad product, but it isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>this is a great product and perfectly holds and styles my thick hair even in hot humid weather.  </li>
            <li>but I was looking for a good hair product that is close to a pomade or hair wax with decent hold.  </li>
            <li>This gives my hair a strong yet flexible/natural hold.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but the hold seems to strong for me.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price, as usual!</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing, very beachy!</li>
            <li>It works well with my fine , curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a certain amount of hold and a nice sheen that doesn&#x27;t appear oily.</li>
            <li>smells great, but the final effect when it dries is brittle.</li>
            <li>Medium to light hold.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be light with sea salt</li>
            <li>The smell is a clean mild scent that I love.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, its malleable, easy to work in, easy to style, and holds all day with a medium shine which gives it a natural look.</li>
            <li>It is a great value for the price and is better than other products costing 2-3 times the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to salons and pay their $30 styling pastes/gels/creams and was never really satisfied or impressed.</li>
            <li>the original though and would continue to use this if it did not separate and flake.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li>It washes out super quick too.</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn hair and this paste easily handles the task.</li>
            <li>Works well without needing too much, washes out easily and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>more of a pommade feel where it feels pliable, not stiff</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with their Moroccan oil which I love, and I should have read the product description more carefully.  </li>
            <li>I rarely finish a product of any kind, but I have come back to Surf Paste over and over again.</li>
            <li>I doubt theyre worth it anyway.</li>
            <li>finish- but so well worth it.</li>
            <li>This paste works like surf hair, but does not leave your hair feeling sticky at all - it blends right in, but still gives you body and definition.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it work better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried, it also has a very pleasant, yet subtle, smell.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very, very oily.  </li>
            <li>Works great, hard to find to buy.</li>
            <li>I was just at Bed Bath and Beyond and saw this exact product for $5.99.</li>
            <li>You would be better buying from there, especially with a 20% off coupon.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I love this product.</li>
            <li>but they jacked up the price so high that it&#x27;s no longer worth buying.</li>
            <li>Too much water and your hair gets too wet, so it takes a little fiddling to get it perfect.</li>
            <li>Can easily re-comb multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight out of the bottle, it&#x27;s very waxy and clumps</li>
            <li>Gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those people who want a beach look!</li>
            <li>so much I started ordering it online instead of switching products.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this product does not have a good hold like other &amp;#34;Surf&amp;#34; styling products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product on the other hand, I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that I don&#x27;t need to use much, but it leaves the texture of my hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li>The only thing this does it make my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>but it is quite decent.</li>
            <li>I use a small dab a little more than pea size and rub it between my hands to warm it up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>but it is also fine and super thick.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a thick cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on products such as Layrite Superhold, Layrite Original, Supershine, Axe pomade Smooth, Polish- Old Spice pomades left and right.</li>
            <li>Always use it to scrunch my hair and smells nice too, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll add a little hairspray to the front since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have found if you put a small amount in the palm of your hand and rub it against your other palm to spread it out, then add a little water to the mix, it becomes and excellent product.</li>
            <li>Hold is not stiff, crunchy or flakey.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the first day my hair can be rather flat.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product</li>
            <li>The fragrance will probably only be noticed by someone you let get REAL close to you, and he/she will like it.</li>
            <li>It has a really natural effect and my hair seems to stay cleaner longer.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I use this nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I have a lot of wild curls</li>
            <li>I doubt the pure &amp;#34;organic-ness&amp;#34; of this product, but less than a week of using other product (cheap Axe and higher priced Crew), I was dying to get back home to my OGX.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super stiff but also keeps it pretty under control literally all day long.</li>
            <li>It smells really hood and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Usually I let it dry and then comb it again, which takes out the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look and makes it appear more natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling dry and a little stiff but better than a gel.</li>

            <li> Makes my hair a little stuffer than I&#x27;d like, but decent hold.</li>
            <li> This is a sticky pomade which did not do anything for my long, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not last long</li>
            <li> and I have to keep adjusting my hair as it separates and starts to fall down to its natural position.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be too dry, so I started trying to mix in a bit of water, but that did not resolve the issue, so I had to simply toss the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product if you are looking for a flat dry matte look with minimal hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping OGX Moroccan will be around for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> (Be advised I only use hair paste on dry hair, so if you&#x27;re looking to know how well this works on wet hair, I cannot say.)</li>
            <li> I bought the other one from Organix a while back</li>
            <li> and I use this product so i can dry my hair without it getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair too dry and floppy.</li>
            <li> Every other paste I&#x27;ve ever found ended up being discontinued before too long.</li>
            <li> Then add a little sprinkle of tap water and rub together before applying to my head, otherwise it&#x27;s like putting actual paste in your hair and it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li> Then I rub it into my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered a few on Amazon, and somehow either the formulation was different or these had passed their usable life.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all flakey some other gel/pomades/pastes.</li>
            <li> Listen, I have  hard to manage, thick curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been rocking the classic side part Pomp, and Slick Back for a while now.</li>
            <li> I love the OGX Moroccan argan oil shampoo/conditioner, I hate this paste.</li>
            <li> Slight matte</li>
            <li> I usually scoop some out on my finger, smear it on my other palm and rub my hands together.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for a fraction of the cost, this does the job, and does it the same if not better than all those overpriced pomades.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my hair, leading to dandruff buildup, something I&#x27;ve never encountered before.</li>
            <li> I can always tell when I forget to use it as my curls don&#x27;t hold up as well after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of growing out a pixie, and this product helps me tame all of the little fly-aways without being greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed when I came back to purchase this product again and saw they had nearly doubled the price.</li>
            <li> the way a small amount adds a lot of control and texture to my hair without being stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> the past I have also used the Garnier Fructis surf past ( http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Fructis-Style-Texture-Paste/dp/B004ZWMDZ4/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;155GRCP882XHH64P4NGX ), which was a descent product</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, if the formula changed or what.  </li>
            <li> Not stylish.  </li>
            <li> Used to get it at Walmart, but as usual they stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> whereas pomades are usually of a transparent/translucent solid-gel type for holding comb-overs in place</li>
            <li> But lately when I apply the paste, it doesn&#x27;t absorb neatly into my hair the way it did before.  </li>
            <li> I am not new to hair products, I use a lot of different pastes etc, and this is awful.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> It has a terrible smell and it&#x27;s very oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, so putting it on can be difficult.</li>
            <li> i have thin (AND WISPY) hair.</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair and doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>

            <li> Listen, I have  hard to manage, thick curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been rocking the classic side part Pomp, and Slick Back for a while now. I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on products such as Layrite Superhold, Layrite Original, Supershine, Axe pomade Smooth, Polish- Old Spice pomades left and right. Guys out there, stop wasting your money. This product is amazing, its malleable, easy to work in, easy to style, and holds all day with a medium shine which gives it a natural look. Smells great, and wont leave your hair feeling like you&#x27;ve put a tub of superglue in it at days end. Seriously, for a fraction of the cost, this does the job, and does it the same if not better than all those overpriced pomades. Do yourself a favor and grab a tub, you wont be upset.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this paste.  It works well on my hair and doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with their Moroccan oil which I love, and I should have read the product description more carefully.  This is a sticky pomade which did not do anything for my long, coarse hair.  The fragrance was also off putting.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little stuffer than I&#x27;d like, but decent hold.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 1st container at walmart about a year ago. I have fairly short to avg. length hair. Straight out of the bottle, it&#x27;s very waxy and clumps int the hair. I have found if you put a small amount in the palm of your hand and rub it against your other palm to spread it out, then add a little water to the mix, it becomes and excellent product. It&#x27;s has a certain amount of hold and a nice sheen that doesn&#x27;t appear oily. Finish with some hair spray, and your good to go. It makes your hair appear thicker as well, which is a plus! I was going to give it 4 stars, but it really is a great product, if you learn how to use it properly, thanks</li>
            <li> smells great, but the final effect when it dries is brittle. I was looking for more of a pommade feel where it feels pliable, not stiff</li>
            <li> Medium to light hold. Gentle on scalp. Leaves hair feeling dry and a little stiff but better than a gel. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great, hard to find to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent hair styling product for the money.  I bought the other one from Organix a while back (the Citrus hair thing) and I decided to give this one a shot.  I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product ( so was I with the OGX Citrus one) and for the money, it is an excellent product.  I am not a surfer or a beach boy but I was looking for a good hair product that is close to a pomade or hair wax with decent hold.  I use Suavecito and Layrite pomades as well as American Crew pomades and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try and bought a box.  I am very impressed and it has a nice fragrance and does the job of holding and styling my hair.  The price is great and you get 4Oz of the product.  I highly recommend it and I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer of this surf paste.  Two Thumbs Up !</li>
            <li> The textures are cool and the smell are very nice! Highly recommended for those people who want a beach look!</li>
            <li> Great product. (Be advised I only use hair paste on dry hair, so if you&#x27;re looking to know how well this works on wet hair, I cannot say.) This gives my hair a strong yet flexible/natural hold. It&#x27;s strong enough that I don&#x27;t need to use much, but it leaves the texture of my hair in its natural state. It leaves no flakes or residue. I&#x27;ve been using hair paste for years, and this is the best one by far. Not only does it work better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried, it also has a very pleasant, yet subtle, smell. The fragrance will probably only be noticed by someone you let get REAL close to you, and he/she will like it. Every other paste I&#x27;ve ever found ended up being discontinued before too long. I&#x27;m hoping OGX Moroccan will be around for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> not too sticky. Spreads good in your hands.</li>
            <li> Definitely a keeper. I rarely finish a product of any kind, but I have come back to Surf Paste over and over again. I use a small dab a little more than pea size and rub it between my hands to warm it up. Then I rub it into my wet hair. My hair is wavy and I use this product so i can dry my hair without it getting frizzy. It has a really natural effect and my hair seems to stay cleaner longer. The smell is a clean mild scent that I love. A very good buy. No need to spend more on frou frou products. I doubt theyre worth it anyway.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product does not have a good hold like other &amp;#34;Surf&amp;#34; styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair too dry and floppy. It does not last long and I have to keep adjusting my hair as it separates and starts to fall down to its natural position. In any kind of breeze from the wind my hair gets distorted with this product. I would only recommend this product if you are looking for a flat dry matte look with minimal hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a replacement to &amp;#34;FX Surf Head&amp;#34; ( http://www.amazon.com/FX-Surf-Extreme-Texturizing-Paste/dp/B004KEML4A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie&#x3D;UTF8 ) as they recently changed their formula and I hear their product is now horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have also used the Garnier Fructis surf past ( http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Fructis-Style-Texture-Paste/dp/B004ZWMDZ4/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;155GRCP882XHH64P4NGX ), which was a descent product but they jacked up the price so high that it&#x27;s no longer worth buying. My search continues for a descent Surf hair product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb diggity.  Great texture, nice hold, the surf look is for those who like the matte finish, and this paste delivers.  w00t.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is the only styling product I&#x27;ll use in it. Defines my curls without getting too crispy. And it smells amazing, very beachy!</li>
            <li> love this! Hold hair great... Not sticky like gel. Nor watery like mouse... Kind of like a thick cream. Great hold and love the scent. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product and WAS a great value when the seller had this listed for $5.74 when I bought on May 16th, 2015. Was disappointed when I came back to purchase this product again and saw they had nearly doubled the price. I was just at Bed Bath and Beyond and saw this exact product for $5.99. You would be better buying from there, especially with a 20% off coupon. Overall though, I love this product. Works well without needing too much, washes out easily and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my hair, leading to dandruff buildup, something I&#x27;ve never encountered before.</li>
            <li> I have short &#x27;Anne Hathaway stole my haircut&#x27; hair- but it is also fine and super thick. I have tried many, and they have failed. Up until I tried this magical stuff- I was using &#x27;Its a 10&#x27; fiber putty which worked- but it was like toothpaste. This surf paste is awesome- I put in a schmear, and it stays where I want it to! Slight matte finish- but so well worth it. The smell is heavenly too!</li>
            <li> It has a terrible smell and it&#x27;s very oily.  I thought it would be light with sea salt but it&#x27;s very, very oily.  It more like pomade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched far and wide for a hair product that I actually like. I&#x27;ve been to salons and pay their $30 styling pastes/gels/creams and was never really satisfied or impressed. This product on the other hand, I love it. I have very stubborn hair and this paste easily handles the task. the best part is, its not greasy! You can&#x27;t beat the price either! a definite go to from now on.</li>
            <li> Good hold, pleasant smell.  I&#x27;ve use this with a leave-in conditioner on my curly shoulder-length hair.  I can always tell when I forget to use it as my curls don&#x27;t hold up as well after a few days.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much is the first day my hair can be rather flat.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Originally loved the texture.  Not sure what happened, if the formula changed or what.  But lately when I apply the paste, it doesn&#x27;t absorb neatly into my hair the way it did before.  I&#x27;ll put it on and it will have the look of dust in my hair.  Not stylish.  Just disgusting.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Used to get it at Walmart, but as usual they stopped carrying it. I like it so much I started ordering it online instead of switching products.</li>
            <li> I love the OGX Moroccan argan oil shampoo/conditioner, I hate this paste. I am not new to hair products, I use a lot of different pastes etc, and this is awful. The only thing this does it make my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and pretty good amount for the price you pay though the hold isn&#x27;t really that strong in my opinion as the OGX texturizing paste but it is quite decent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice! It&#x27;s really thick, so putting it on can be difficult. I usually scoop some out on my finger, smear it on my other palm and rub my hands together. Then add a little sprinkle of tap water and rub together before applying to my head, otherwise it&#x27;s like putting actual paste in your hair and it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out. Too much water and your hair gets too wet, so it takes a little fiddling to get it perfect. It DOES make my hair appear thicker. Usually I let it dry and then comb it again, which takes out the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look and makes it appear more natural. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! No harmful chemicals or fumes in it or from it. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super stiff but also keeps it pretty under control literally all day long. It washes out super quick too. Doesn&#x27;t get all flakey some other gel/pomades/pastes. Great for that beach look or refined bedhead look.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, a friend at the gym let me use some of his when I was out and now it&#x27;s all I buy. I can&#x27;t stand having residue in my hair and this stuff leaves none. HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pete and Terry like the product and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Have had scalp problems.  I doubt the pure &amp;#34;organic-ness&amp;#34; of this product, but less than a week of using other product (cheap Axe and higher priced Crew), I was dying to get back home to my OGX.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my scalp...but from someone who has invested A LOT in different shampoos, conditioners and scalp treatment products (all of them...seriously), this has been a hit.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps my hair semi-tamed. Cheaper than the store price at CVS and Walgreens by $2-3. A steal.</li>
            <li> This paste works like surf hair, but does not leave your hair feeling sticky at all - it blends right in, but still gives you body and definition.  Can&#x27;t find this in any store, so I thought I&#x27;d try it, since I use the Organix shampoos - so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend since it can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore. Great product for a great price, as usual!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of growing out a pixie, and this product helps me tame all of the little fly-aways without being greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way a small amount adds a lot of control and texture to my hair without being stiff or greasy. Can easily re-comb multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll add a little hairspray to the front since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> smells like you&#x27;ve been at the beach all day. sometimes i just run my hand through my hair so i can sniff my fingers and slip to a temporary oceanside lapse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this works a lot more like hair creme. it&#x27;s white in color, has consistency similar to toothpaste. good for adding texture to hair, but not a bunch of hold. i have thin (AND WISPY) hair. whereas pomades are usually of a transparent/translucent solid-gel type for holding comb-overs in place</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works well with my fine , curly hair.</li>
            <li> Used to get this at the drugstore. Ordered a few on Amazon, and somehow either the formulation was different or these had passed their usable life. The ones I ordered on Amazon would separate and become flaky in my hair as I was applying it, making it look like I had dandruff. I thought it might be too dry, so I started trying to mix in a bit of water, but that did not resolve the issue, so I had to simply toss the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the original though and would continue to use this if it did not separate and flake.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and perfectly holds and styles my thick hair even in hot humid weather.  It is a great value for the price and is better than other products costing 2-3 times the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Always use it to scrunch my hair and smells nice too, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I get compliments about the look and scent of my hair. I am mixed African American and Spanish (Spain) I have a lot of wild curls and I this works amazingly for me. Curls have hold and shine for up to 3 days. Hold is not stiff, crunchy or flakey.</li>
            <li> So I got this product at Walmart. I like the smell, but the hold seems to strong for me. I like to have movement in my hair. Overall, it is not bad product, but it isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and gives my a good hold without looking like it&#x27;s a rock and gross.</li>
            <li> Great for semi-curly hair that needs encouragement.  Shapes without looking like you&#x27;ve used anything. Not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Really great texture  you can really do many styles with this paste</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! It smells really hood and lasts a long time. Hard to beat it for the price!</li>
