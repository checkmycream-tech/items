            <li>It is pleasant</li>
            <li>It very smooth and feels good on the skin real nice bye.</li>
            <li>so I look for sales and gobble them up when I find a good deal.</li>
            <li>good one</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion, not watery or too greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Good for your skin and keeps it moist.  </li>
            <li>and this is a  really good skin cream.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a really good product.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good lotion.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells good and just feels good on.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light pleasant odor and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I borrowed lotion from a friend one day and it happened to be this, I FELL IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>It stays there for more than 24 hrs !</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion !</li>
            <li>and I find it also works amazingly well on my feet and heels.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a lotion that works and doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li>I had to buy mom her own bottle.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice mix of antioxidants and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 13 oz.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just add vanilla scented lotion, and it covers the scent nicely.</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and smells so good, not too loud just nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>I have found that I no longer need to use it every day as it moisturizes so effectively.</li>
            <li>Very good moisturizing lotion and inherently lighter albeit a tad more fragrant than the original Gold Bond lotion.</li>
            <li>It  contains a high amount of urea which is an excellent moisture-binding ingredient that also has an exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can tell you that paying more doesn&#x27;t get you any better lotion than Gold Bond!  </li>
            <li>But this one by far is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>This is a really good body lotion, rich yet does not go on greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I removed the plastic wrap and just set one of those plastic lids for cans over the top of it.</li>
            <li>I feel smooth skin after I apply this lotion!</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions</li>
            <li>I have tried so many kinds of lotion--</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin nice and flake and itch free.</li>
            <li>Smell okay too.</li>
            <li>A great daily lotion that lasts a good period of time.</li>
            <li>is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased; majorly impressed.</li>
            <li>I will reorder it when I need more.</li>
            <li>I needed more moisture for my skin and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>My favorite is another Gold Bond</li>
            <li>works better than some of my 100 dollar plus creams</li>
            <li>I would give this lotion more stars if not for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am sooo glad that I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like Cetaphil better.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this product from Gold Bond.  </li>
            <li>Kiehl&#x27;s is still my favorite, but at this price you can&#x27;t beat GoldBond.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m seriously in love with this Gold Bond lotion now.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking and feeling so much better and without having to break the bank or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my dermatologist would be amazed as well.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>You have to then unscrew the top and try to get the cream out manually.</li>
            <li>A great price for this high quality lotion that makes my skin look and feel much better after every use.</li>
            <li>no offense to any older ladies, lol.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to add that and say this lotion is still excellent stuff, but if you&#x27;re having chronic dry skin</li>
            <li>Just wanted to add that and say this lotion is still excellent stuff, but if you&#x27;re having chronic dry skin</li>
            <li>but I find this to be the best lotion ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>Not as good as advanced healing lotion by gold bond, but nice and soft hands without greasy feel.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion ever, my skin has never felt so smooth and it got rid of all the scratchy dry feelings on my hands.</li>
            <li>Easy on/easy off/easy use of product.</li>
            <li>While there is a fragrance, it does not seem to linger and becomes more of a fresh lighter soapy scent so OK for a guy to use.</li>
            <li>This gold bond has a very mild smell, if any at all once it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and light way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is very mild too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>best, the dry skin would go away for an hour or so before quickly returning.</li>
            <li>But love the clean smell and how my skin feels so smooth after application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have a favorite of the two because they both absorb quickly,</li>
            <li>Most importantly this stuff just works and my hands heal quickly</li>
            <li>The restoring lotion seems to be a teense thinner and smoother during application while the healing is a bit thicker but both go on smoothly</li>
            <li>Payed up to $13 a bottle, but found it for $7 on amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>This I thought fragrance free?</li>
            <li>Light weight and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>My grandmother loves it as it stops all itching and makes her skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using this product my skin is finally smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and leaves skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>That is how rich this lotion is.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, this lotion is very smooth and has help my skin to be much more healthy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Helped Mom&#x27;s dry skin Great</li>
            <li>It works great for my dry skin in the winter and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly as promoted - used daily, it has reduced the sagging skin and is restoring elasticity, great for use after surgery</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product line.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product line.</li>
            <li>Initially feels good on the skin, but is vecry sticky which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>However, I can not use it as the fragrance is overwhelming and very perfumey.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s reasonable priced, and it more than does the job.</li>
            <li>everything seems to work good enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>You get about 4 times as much of this as you do with the Aveeno moisturizer, and for roughly half the price- great deal!  </li>
            <li>is a ok lotion wasn&#x27;t quite what i waslooking for i have severly dry skin on my knuckles and feed still try to find the righ t kind</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and have always had issues with fairly mild but persistent acne and the resulting scarring.  </li>
            <li>So, in sum:  this lotion takes care of just about every skin concern imaginable and yet is still super affordable.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a great job preventing new acne while healing old scarring, and I think it actually has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels really good on the skin, use it on my kid that has problems with dry skin</li>
            <li>This little trick works great with the &#x27;restoring&#x27; lotion but after 2 days of letting the &#x27;healing&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my skin feel....</li>
            <li>Also, I was starting to see a couple of light lines developing on my forehead and had been trying Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives night lotion for them, but the Gold Bond restoring lotion&#x27;s been doing a much better job at keeping those at bay as well.  </li>
            <li>That is not a factor that would outweigh the improvements I have seen and felt, but worth a mention</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it is better than what I had been using  </li>
            <li>But still, a really great overall body lotion, so I am willing to live with it.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for 2 days and have seen very positive results already.  </li>
            <li>This stuff got rid of all of it right away.</li>
            <li>This stuff got rid of all of it right away.</li>
            <li>It blends right into your skin leaving no residue at all.</li>
            <li>This winter I kept the lotion right on my kitchen counter.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I did try the Gold Bond medicated (green bottle) and those are great (but thick)as well with one not so stellar exception.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it keep my skin moisturized and the dry skin did not return.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, it keep my skin moisturized and the dry skin did not return.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is amazing if you have really dry skin</li>
            <li>I sometimes think I almost look like I have leprosy, but normal for a &#x27;normal&#x27; person who has healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>I sometimes think I almost look like I have leprosy, but normal for a &#x27;normal&#x27; person who has healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>It smells like some cheap type of old lady perfume...</li>
            <li>I had several products on hand after trying so many</li>
            <li>/&gt;I went home and put more on before I went to bed, maybe 8 hours later.</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that has a refreshing, moisturized feel to the skin when applying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I went home and put more on before I went to bed, maybe 8 hours later.</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that has a refreshing, moisturized feel to the skin when applying it.</li>
            <li>After the first use, it felt SO soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>All Gold Bond products are first rate, but this is not one of my favorites ...</li>
            <li>Gold Bond coq10 has actually started healing my skin to the point that people who know me have told me my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>This stuff DOES really work!</li>
            <li>I was using the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Man what a way to waste a good, formulated lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for extra dry or cracked skin, and after bathing.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very smooth and works well to eliminate dry skin.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also pretty much odorless and don&#x27;t seem to harm clothing, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gold Bond for giving me healthier skin for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The heels of my feet are still soft and smooth, though, so the product deserves a high rating.</li>
            <li>Nothing I could find would work more than an hour or two before the dry skin returned.</li>
            <li>you will not find a better product fot dry skin .</li>
            <li>This product keeps the&lt;br /&gt;skin soft as it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Depending on how much you want to apply and how much of your body you are covering, one full pump covers both my arms, and I need about 4 for my legs for a light slathering, which is all I&#x27;ve needed to see differences in my dry shins.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the scent is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>This is not a greasy feeling lotion and while is seems to give your skin a very light sheen, it does not feel remotely sticky.</li>
            <li>Having to be so careful about touching things with my immune system</li>
            <li>and they work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>I, myself prefer real 100% shea butter, but not everyone likes the smell of that.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but really coats the skin</li>
            <li>This is much lighter.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and it helps so much keeping my skin moist.  </li>
            <li>Found this product to really give my skin needed moisture.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot stand the smell and it does not fade as the hours go by.  </li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too intense and goes away</li>
            <li>it works immediately ... leaves my skin so soft and fresh .</li>
            <li>I suffer from a bit of psoriasis, and I&#x27;ve found that the Gold Bond lotions work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer really needs to solve this problem.</li>
            <li>Title was: - best lotion for &#x27;chicken skin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is a pleasure to use and very soothing and healing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve felt and looked like a healthy, normal person.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve felt and looked like a healthy, normal person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel crappy like most other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>not only made my skin feel so soft, there is also a gentle clean smell.</li>
            <li>But about half way through the bottle you won&#x27;t be able to get any cream out of the pump.  </li>
            <li>Using the Gold Bond Ultimate Restoring Lotion has helped my hands heal up tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love using Gold Bond, even as a face moisturizer, but the scent of this particular formula  ruins it!  </li>
            <li>And to keep the top of it clean from bathroom powder and hair and such, I covered it with a small piece of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to see that Paula&#x27;s Choice rated this very highly.  </li>
            <li>I use this when I get out of the shower and it really helps calm my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>the Urea (2nd ingredient) means it also exfoliates, which is great for removing dry, dead skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten to the point that it is affecting how often and how long I go out, and having to keep a small bottle of the latest lotion in the car or my jacket for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>Old folks have skin aging problems and this is the ticket!  </li>
            <li>but it is also not slick or greasy</li>
            <li>My Docter recommended this for me, since I have SUPER DRY SKIN!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even found the shelves of Target stores to be wiped clean of this product and certainly more expensive than Amazon or Vitacost.com --</li>
            <li>so compromised I am constantly washing my hands or using those hand sanitizers that are everywhere, which pretty much feel like pouring gasoline on an open cut, so my hands are a wreck.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say if it has any lasting effect due to I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but man, when I put it on my skin feels a decade younger, soft, and..... radiant for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>If it can cure my constantly flaking dry skin, it can surely cure normal dry skin.</li>
            <li>If it can cure my constantly flaking dry skin, it can surely cure normal dry skin.</li>
            <li>Bond was the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li>Soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my old man.</li>

            <li>Because that leaves a rather sharp edge all the way around the top where I cut it, I used a kitchen spatula to scoop out the lotion and put it in a small ramekin dish</li>
            <li>One of my side effects from the chemo/radiation treatments is a prediabetic state (it also runs in my family so I may be plagued with diabetes any day now), but proper foot care was pounded into me early on by my medical team when this side effect was discovered.</li>

            <li> It has a very light pleasant odor and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I borrowed lotion from a friend one day and it happened to be this, I FELL IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> It stays there for more than 24 hrs !</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion !</li>
            <li> and I find it also works amazingly well on my feet and heels.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a lotion that works and doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> I had to buy mom her own bottle.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice mix of antioxidants and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 13 oz.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just add vanilla scented lotion, and it covers the scent nicely.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and smells so good, not too loud just nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> I have found that I no longer need to use it every day as it moisturizes so effectively.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizing lotion and inherently lighter albeit a tad more fragrant than the original Gold Bond lotion.</li>
            <li> It  contains a high amount of urea which is an excellent moisture-binding ingredient that also has an exfoliating effect.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can tell you that paying more doesn&#x27;t get you any better lotion than Gold Bond!  </li>
            <li> But this one by far is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> This is a really good body lotion, rich yet does not go on greasy.  </li>
            <li> so I removed the plastic wrap and just set one of those plastic lids for cans over the top of it.</li>
            <li> I feel smooth skin after I apply this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions</li>
            <li> I have tried so many kinds of lotion--</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin nice and flake and itch free.</li>
            <li> Smell okay too.</li>
            <li> A great daily lotion that lasts a good period of time.</li>
            <li> is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased; majorly impressed.</li>
            <li> I will reorder it when I need more.</li>
            <li> I needed more moisture for my skin and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> My favorite is another Gold Bond</li>
            <li> works better than some of my 100 dollar plus creams</li>
            <li> I would give this lotion more stars if not for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am sooo glad that I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like Cetaphil better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this product from Gold Bond.  </li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s is still my favorite, but at this price you can&#x27;t beat GoldBond.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m seriously in love with this Gold Bond lotion now.  </li>
            <li> My skin is looking and feeling so much better and without having to break the bank or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my dermatologist would be amazed as well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> You have to then unscrew the top and try to get the cream out manually.</li>
            <li> A great price for this high quality lotion that makes my skin look and feel much better after every use.</li>
            <li> no offense to any older ladies, lol.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to add that and say this lotion is still excellent stuff, but if you&#x27;re having chronic dry skin</li>
            <li> Just wanted to add that and say this lotion is still excellent stuff, but if you&#x27;re having chronic dry skin</li>
            <li> but I find this to be the best lotion ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advanced healing lotion by gold bond, but nice and soft hands without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever, my skin has never felt so smooth and it got rid of all the scratchy dry feelings on my hands.</li>
            <li> Easy on/easy off/easy use of product.</li>
            <li> While there is a fragrance, it does not seem to linger and becomes more of a fresh lighter soapy scent so OK for a guy to use.</li>
            <li> This gold bond has a very mild smell, if any at all once it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent and light way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is very mild too.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> best, the dry skin would go away for an hour or so before quickly returning.</li>
            <li> But love the clean smell and how my skin feels so smooth after application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have a favorite of the two because they both absorb quickly,</li>
            <li> Most importantly this stuff just works and my hands heal quickly</li>
            <li> The restoring lotion seems to be a teense thinner and smoother during application while the healing is a bit thicker but both go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Payed up to $13 a bottle, but found it for $7 on amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> This I thought fragrance free?</li>
            <li> Light weight and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My grandmother loves it as it stops all itching and makes her skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this product my skin is finally smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and leaves skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> That is how rich this lotion is.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, this lotion is very smooth and has help my skin to be much more healthy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Helped Mom&#x27;s dry skin Great</li>
            <li> It works great for my dry skin in the winter and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly as promoted - used daily, it has reduced the sagging skin and is restoring elasticity, great for use after surgery</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product line.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product line.</li>
            <li> Initially feels good on the skin, but is vecry sticky which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> However, I can not use it as the fragrance is overwhelming and very perfumey.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s reasonable priced, and it more than does the job.</li>
            <li> everything seems to work good enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> You get about 4 times as much of this as you do with the Aveeno moisturizer, and for roughly half the price- great deal!  </li>
            <li> is a ok lotion wasn&#x27;t quite what i waslooking for i have severly dry skin on my knuckles and feed still try to find the righ t kind</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and have always had issues with fairly mild but persistent acne and the resulting scarring.  </li>
            <li> So, in sum:  this lotion takes care of just about every skin concern imaginable and yet is still super affordable.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a great job preventing new acne while healing old scarring, and I think it actually has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> This lotion feels really good on the skin, use it on my kid that has problems with dry skin</li>
            <li> This little trick works great with the &#x27;restoring&#x27; lotion but after 2 days of letting the &#x27;healing&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my skin feel....</li>
            <li> Also, I was starting to see a couple of light lines developing on my forehead and had been trying Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives night lotion for them, but the Gold Bond restoring lotion&#x27;s been doing a much better job at keeping those at bay as well.  </li>
            <li> That is not a factor that would outweigh the improvements I have seen and felt, but worth a mention</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it is better than what I had been using  </li>
            <li> But still, a really great overall body lotion, so I am willing to live with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 2 days and have seen very positive results already.  </li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of all of it right away.</li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of all of it right away.</li>
            <li> It blends right into your skin leaving no residue at all.</li>
            <li> This winter I kept the lotion right on my kitchen counter.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I did try the Gold Bond medicated (green bottle) and those are great (but thick)as well with one not so stellar exception.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it keep my skin moisturized and the dry skin did not return.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More importantly, it keep my skin moisturized and the dry skin did not return.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is amazing if you have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I sometimes think I almost look like I have leprosy, but normal for a &#x27;normal&#x27; person who has healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I sometimes think I almost look like I have leprosy, but normal for a &#x27;normal&#x27; person who has healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> It smells like some cheap type of old lady perfume...</li>
            <li> I had several products on hand after trying so many</li>
            <li> /&gt;I went home and put more on before I went to bed, maybe 8 hours later.</li>
            <li> It is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that has a refreshing, moisturized feel to the skin when applying it.</li>

            <li> After the first use, it felt SO soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> All Gold Bond products are first rate, but this is not one of my favorites ...</li>
            <li> Gold Bond coq10 has actually started healing my skin to the point that people who know me have told me my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES really work!</li>
            <li> I was using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Man what a way to waste a good, formulated lotion.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for extra dry or cracked skin, and after bathing.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very smooth and works well to eliminate dry skin.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also pretty much odorless and don&#x27;t seem to harm clothing, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gold Bond for giving me healthier skin for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The heels of my feet are still soft and smooth, though, so the product deserves a high rating.</li>
            <li> Nothing I could find would work more than an hour or two before the dry skin returned.</li>
            <li> you will not find a better product fot dry skin .</li>
            <li> This product keeps the&lt;br /&gt;skin soft as it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on how much you want to apply and how much of your body you are covering, one full pump covers both my arms, and I need about 4 for my legs for a light slathering, which is all I&#x27;ve needed to see differences in my dry shins.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the scent is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> This is not a greasy feeling lotion and while is seems to give your skin a very light sheen, it does not feel remotely sticky.</li>
            <li> Having to be so careful about touching things with my immune system</li>
            <li> and they work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> I, myself prefer real 100% shea butter, but not everyone likes the smell of that.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but really coats the skin</li>
            <li> This is much lighter.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it helps so much keeping my skin moist.  </li>
            <li> Found this product to really give my skin needed moisture.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot stand the smell and it does not fade as the hours go by.  </li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too intense and goes away</li>
            <li> it works immediately ... leaves my skin so soft and fresh .</li>
            <li> I suffer from a bit of psoriasis, and I&#x27;ve found that the Gold Bond lotions work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer really needs to solve this problem.</li>
            <li> Title was: - best lotion for &#x27;chicken skin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is a pleasure to use and very soothing and healing.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel crappy like most other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> not only made my skin feel so soft, there is also a gentle clean smell.</li>
            <li> But about half way through the bottle you won&#x27;t be able to get any cream out of the pump.  </li>
            <li> Using the Gold Bond Ultimate Restoring Lotion has helped my hands heal up tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love using Gold Bond, even as a face moisturizer, but the scent of this particular formula  ruins it!  </li>
            <li> And to keep the top of it clean from bathroom powder and hair and such, I covered it with a small piece of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see that Paula&#x27;s Choice rated this very highly.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I get out of the shower and it really helps calm my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> the Urea (2nd ingredient) means it also exfoliates, which is great for removing dry, dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten to the point that it is affecting how often and how long I go out, and having to keep a small bottle of the latest lotion in the car or my jacket for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Old folks have skin aging problems and this is the ticket!  </li>
            <li> but it is also not slick or greasy</li>
            <li> My Docter recommended this for me, since I have SUPER DRY SKIN!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found the shelves of Target stores to be wiped clean of this product and certainly more expensive than Amazon or Vitacost.com --</li>
            <li> so compromised I am constantly washing my hands or using those hand sanitizers that are everywhere, which pretty much feel like pouring gasoline on an open cut, so my hands are a wreck.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if it has any lasting effect due to I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but man, when I put it on my skin feels a decade younger, soft, and..... radiant for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li> If it can cure my constantly flaking dry skin, it can surely cure normal dry skin.</li>
            <li> If it can cure my constantly flaking dry skin, it can surely cure normal dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bond was the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li> Soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my old man.</li>
            <li> This product works near miracles when used consistnatly.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling soft and pliable .</li>
            <li> Instead of looking like 29 year old skin, it started to look like 80 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> But after 3 weeks, my skin is also soft after applying.</li>
            <li> My quest for decent moisturing lotion began several years ago with chemo/radiation cancer treatments that literally destroyed my skin.</li>
            <li> Suddenly my skin started to sag, and look wrinkly - causing my skin to look much older.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and smoother now and not merely less</li>
            <li> I have a lot of spots and dry places on my arms and legs from the sun and this has really helped to calm all of that down.  </li>
            <li> This has become my new standard moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have the most subtle scent (not feminine or masculine or medicinal - the scent is almost not even there), they don&#x27;t leave a greasy/sticky residue, and they both provide instant relief.</li>
            <li> Most just &#x27;wet&#x27; the dry skin, but the dry skin is still there and requires a lot of scrubbing to get off.</li>

            <li> My skin is soft and I have no dry or itchy spots.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin - especially to the sun.  </li>
            <li> That is something that no other lotion or product has done for me.</li>

            <li> Dries fast and long lasting.</li>
            <li> it only takes putting on this lotion the night before to wake up to a completely healed leg.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to anybody who has dry skin issues..</li>
            <li> Because that leaves a rather sharp edge all the way around the top where I cut it, I used a kitchen spatula to scoop out the lotion and put it in a small ramekin dish</li>
            <li> One of my side effects from the chemo/radiation treatments is a prediabetic state (it also runs in my family so I may be plagued with diabetes any day now), but proper foot care was pounded into me early on by my medical team when this side effect was discovered.</li>

            <li> sparkle.&amp;#34; We&#x27;re not talking Old Spice manly but a clean neutral scent is all that is left behind.  </li>
            <li> I was using Jergens Original, but was not as moisturizing as I would like as it would dry out quickly and reapplying just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> my skin gets very dry and this is the only lotion that even by the end of the day, I am still soft.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily or any other yucky feeling, just feels soft and,</li>
            <li> This leaves my hand soft and not grease, like some other lotion may do.</li>
            <li> Initially this left my skin feeling rubbery, not soft, even though it looked MUCH younger.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that the scent is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> REALLY HELPS HEAL DRY SKIN IN JUST A FEW</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re long lasting and quite soothing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s likely being caused by wheat in your diet, and no lotion can fix that.t gets rid of the flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li> In the winter my hands (knuckles) get dry enough to crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer at night, but a few months ago I decided to try Gold Bond&#x27;s restoring lotion.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the other Gold Bond formulations are essentially the same?</li>
            <li> has a strange odour we cant tolerate and a greasy feel</li>
            <li> had keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> If I forget to bring along a trial sized bottle of lotion I often have to go home after a short while out, my skin starts flaking so badly so quickly after using any lotion (or not using lotion) that I feel uncomfortable in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than expensive $60 Wen cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe dry skin on my face for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It promised relief of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror and my dry skin was gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: September, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this lotion for months my dry skin has begun to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found out that my dry skin is caused by wheat.</li>

            <li> My  finger tips splits,  cuticles dry out and crack,  </li>
            <li> I have dry feet</li>
            <li> I apply this nightly, and my shins which have been forever dry and ashy have cleared up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin look dry after I applied it</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> It is a must have if you wash your hand a lot like me as I have twins and my hand get dry all the time</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve had dry bumpy skin all my life.</li>
            <li> After cutting wheat out of my diet my skin has started to heal and become \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, plus I&#x27;m having many other benefits, including weight loss.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable, lotions, scrubs, special moisturizers, prescription lotions, goat&#x27;s milk soap, cutting open Vitamin E capsules and rubbing on the face, using olive oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was rough and dry for years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and there is a definite improvement, since there is way less sagging - looks like a 50% improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin, and it is not thick enough for me, a bit thin for my needs.  </li>
            <li> During the winter months I tend to have very dry hands.</li>
            <li> It does go on very thick, but with how much I&#x27;m in the sun and water</li>
            <li> - wish I looked into return policy - we wont even be able to use it and will need to throw out - its that bad</li>
            <li> Beware if you are sensitive in the least.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to waste that last inch or so.</li>
            <li> I was browsing the aisle, couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked like a peel, and saw a few different types of Gold Bond lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion in a few weeks of use has hydrated and smoothed out the skin and helped immensely to reduce the instances of skin abrasions.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the coq10 a few months</li>
            <li> This restoring lotion and its brother, the &#x27;healing&#x27; lotion worked the first time and gave me not only the relief I so desperately needed but actually healed and softened my skin in just a few days.</li>

            <li> I was having my usual problems with my skin drying out already in the store, so when I got to the car I put the lotion on and was actually amazed at how soothing and moisturizing it felt immediately.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other lotions in their lineup.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the basis of other reviews.  </li>
            <li> so im gonna order and other brand</li>
            <li> since its on my desk at work 4 or 5 other co workers have started to buy it as well.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m nearing the bottom of any lotion bottle, I usually remove the pump, place the bottle upsidedown on a coffee mug that will hold the threaded cap opening a little above the base of the mug, and let the lotion dribble out at its own pace</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the Eucerin I was using for the ceramides because the Eucerin was too thick and took too long to dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;ll help protect my thin skin.</li>
            <li> a re less cluttered.  </li>
            <li> it healed my dry leg  slow healing sours.</li>
            <li> That is a little disconcerting to me.</li>
            <li> if I am just need a little moisture on my hands</li>
            <li> I have allergies so after a few times of making this mistake of rubbing my eyes after I&#x27;ve applied the medicated lotion,  I decided to forego the medicated and stick with the restoring &amp; healing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li> Both my husband and myself use it everyday.</li>
            <li> For me, it leaves a heavy, sticky residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few hand lotions with urea.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten so bad over the last 3-4 years that after I put on a moisturizing lotion and going out I would get strange looks at stores after just an hour or so, when my skin would dry out and begin to flake.</li>
            <li> Now if you have never had truly dry skin, you don&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to find a lotion that gets rid of the flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li> very heavy - take a little effort to massage in -</li>
            <li> I am stuck with it, so use it, very little of it, on my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for relief and tried about 13 different products including those containing seaweed, aloe and oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews complained about the scent -</li>
            <li> In cold temps, skin gets very dry, but a small application of this lotion once or twice a day prevents cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Used year around, Helps even in winter cold when  dry skin can be painfull.</li>
            <li> Dad is very hard to please when it comes to men&#x27;s grooming products.</li>
            <li> everything from homemade lotions to other very very expensive lotions.  </li>
            <li> I finally took my kitchen shears (for cutting chicken and bones and the like) and cut the bottom of the container off that held the remaining lotion.</li>
            <li> They can be a bit expensive</li>
            <li> However, for some weird reason it smells like a penis?</li>
            <li> At worst these other products did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I work in a job where I have to break down a lot of cardboard, and it dries out my hands something terrible.  </li>
            <li> Burns, itching, dry scaly areas that just felt awful and, at times, could be painful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got it on your hands and you touch your eyes, it is going to burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> I used to order very expensive lotion from an organic company for years.</li>
            <li> Not that it is bad, but it does compete with my perfume.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed in this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know how people can be reluctant to write a review claiming healing benefits, but I wish to state that whenever I have a cut or scab on my leg it only takes putting on this lotion the night before to wake up to a completely healed leg.  It has to be the CoQ10, it must be similar to Neosporin product. Our family loves it! Reviews are the best way, word-of-mouth are better than commercials could ever be.  I&#x27;ve even found the shelves of Target stores to be wiped clean of this product and certainly more expensive than Amazon or Vitacost.com -- that should be an indicator of just how wonderful this product is.  Be well friends.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, absorbs into skin well.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle of the stuff and will keep on ordering (subscribe and save plan).</li>
            <li> Man what a way to waste a good, formulated lotion.  I love using Gold Bond, even as a face moisturizer, but the scent of this particular formula  ruins it!  It smells like some cheap type of old lady perfume...no offense to any older ladies, lol. I am stuck with it, so use it, very little of it, on my legs and feet. I can&#x27;t use it all over b/c it is just way too perfumey.</li>
            <li> My skin gets itchy in the winter.  If i don&#x27;t put this on for a day ,i can notice. It makes skin feel great</li>
            <li> My quest for decent moisturing lotion began several years ago with chemo/radiation cancer treatments that literally destroyed my skin. Burns, itching, dry scaly areas that just felt awful and, at times, could be painful. I was desperate for relief and tried about 13 different products including those containing seaweed, aloe and oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond was the clear winner for me. This restoring lotion and its brother, the &#x27;healing&#x27; lotion worked the first time and gave me not only the relief I so desperately needed but actually healed and softened my skin in just a few days. I can&#x27;t say I have a favorite of the two because they both absorb quickly, have the most subtle scent (not feminine or masculine or medicinal - the scent is almost not even there), they don&#x27;t leave a greasy/sticky residue, and they both provide instant relief. Having to be so careful about touching things with my immune system so compromised I am constantly washing my hands or using those hand sanitizers that are everywhere, which pretty much feel like pouring gasoline on an open cut, so my hands are a wreck. The restoring lotion seems to be a teense thinner and smoother during application while the healing is a bit thicker but both go on smoothly and it seems to me that I can actually feel it penetrating the skin. I don&#x27;t seem to have to keep reapplying it throughout the day and I find it also works amazingly well on my feet and heels. I will say it is easier to apply the restoring lotion as a body lotion, say, after showering because it spreads faster, but I have used both following a shower and they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one of these two lotions in each room of the house, and both of them in the bathroom at all times. They can be a bit expensive so I look for sales and gobble them up when I find a good deal. I don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I did try the Gold Bond medicated (green bottle) and those are great (but thick)as well with one not so stellar exception. If you&#x27;ve got it on your hands and you touch your eyes, it is going to burn like crazy. I have allergies so after a few times of making this mistake of rubbing my eyes after I&#x27;ve applied the medicated lotion,  I decided to forego the medicated and stick with the restoring &amp; healing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: August 2011. When I&#x27;m nearing the bottom of any lotion bottle, I usually remove the pump, place the bottle upsidedown on a coffee mug that will hold the threaded cap opening a little above the base of the mug, and let the lotion dribble out at its own pace so I don&#x27;t have to waste that last inch or so. This little trick works great with the &#x27;restoring&#x27; lotion but after 2 days of letting the &#x27;healing&#x27; (that&#x27;s the thicker one of the two) lotion sit upsidedown on its coffee mug, it hadn&#x27;t dribbled a bit. Nada. Nuttin&#x27; honey. That is how rich this lotion is. I tried pounding it against my palm to get it started and that didn&#x27;t make any difference either. I finally took my kitchen shears (for cutting chicken and bones and the like) and cut the bottom of the container off that held the remaining lotion. Because that leaves a rather sharp edge all the way around the top where I cut it, I used a kitchen spatula to scoop out the lotion and put it in a small ramekin dish so I could get at it easier. And to keep the top of it clean from bathroom powder and hair and such, I covered it with a small piece of plastic wrap. That got bothersome, though, each time I wanted to use it so I removed the plastic wrap and just set one of those plastic lids for cans over the top of it. Easy on/easy off/easy use of product. You know the lids of which I speak, those plastic lids one can get to cover leftover dog/cat food that comes in cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: October 2011 These 2 products remain my winners even now. I had several products on hand after trying so many so I was using those on my heels/feet. One of my side effects from the chemo/radiation treatments is a prediabetic state (it also runs in my family so I may be plagued with diabetes any day now), but proper foot care was pounded into me early on by my medical team when this side effect was discovered. I had been using up all those other products on my feet but still got the bleeding cracks and scaling. The family was calling me \\&quot;lizard feet\\&quot; so that will tell you how my feet looked. U-G-L-Y! Anyway, I finally decided to try the &#x27;healing&#x27; lotion on my feet/heels. 3 days was all it took. My feet look like a 2-year-old&#x27;s feet. Soft, soft, soft. No cracks or bleeding. And they aren&#x27;t sore and don&#x27;t hurt when I walk. Nor do my heels crack open and bleed just by standing up. I cannot say enough good things about this product line. I hope you try it and have the results I have had. Not only would that make my day, I think it would make yours as well.mily so I may be plagued with diabetes any day now), but proper foot care was pounded into me early on by my medical team when this side effect was discovered.

            <li> its; watery...........BETTER THAN NOTHING!</li>
            <li> The best lotion in the market.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizing lotion and inherently lighter albeit a tad more fragrant than the original Gold Bond lotion. While there is a fragrance, it does not seem to linger and becomes more of a fresh lighter soapy scent so OK for a guy to use. It truly does improve the appearance of your skin and visibly smooths the texture. This is definitely noticeable. This has become my new standard moisturizer. This is not a greasy feeling lotion and while is seems to give your skin a very light sheen, it does not feel remotely sticky.</li>
            <li> I borrowed lotion from a friend one day and it happened to be this, I FELL IN LOVE! I will not buy anything else. It does go on very thick, but with how much I&#x27;m in the sun and water my skin gets very dry and this is the only lotion that even by the end of the day, I am still soft.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advanced healing lotion by gold bond, but nice and soft hands without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe dry skin on my face for about 10 years. Flaky skin that just keeps drying out and falling off, across my eyebrows, sides of nose, and around the mouth. I&#x27;ve seen doctors, gotten prescriptions, bought recommended over the counter lotions, all with no luck. Nothing I could find would work more than an hour or two before the dry skin returned. It&#x27;s gotten so bad over the last 3-4 years that after I put on a moisturizing lotion and going out I would get strange looks at stores after just an hour or so, when my skin would dry out and begin to flake. I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable, lotions, scrubs, special moisturizers, prescription lotions, goat&#x27;s milk soap, cutting open Vitamin E capsules and rubbing on the face, using olive oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At best, the dry skin would go away for an hour or so before quickly returning. At worst these other products did nothing for me. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that it is affecting how often and how long I go out, and having to keep a small bottle of the latest lotion in the car or my jacket for quick touch ups. If I forget to bring along a trial sized bottle of lotion I often have to go home after a short while out, my skin starts flaking so badly so quickly after using any lotion (or not using lotion) that I feel uncomfortable in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I was at a store and decided to look for some type of peel, thinking that I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. I was browsing the aisle, couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked like a peel, and saw a few different types of Gold Bond lotions. I finally decided to try the Restoring Lotion with COQ10. It promised relief of dry skin. I was having my usual problems with my skin drying out already in the store, so when I got to the car I put the lotion on and was actually amazed at how soothing and moisturizing it felt immediately. I looked in the mirror and my dry skin was gone. Now if you have never had truly dry skin, you don&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to find a lotion that gets rid of the flaky dry skin. Most just &#x27;wet&#x27; the dry skin, but the dry skin is still there and requires a lot of scrubbing to get off. This stuff got rid of all of it right away. More importantly, it keep my skin moisturized and the dry skin did not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went home and put more on before I went to bed, maybe 8 hours later. The next morning my skin was normal - not normal for me, which is so flaky in the mornings I sometimes think I almost look like I have leprosy, but normal for a &#x27;normal&#x27; person who has healthy looking skin. That is something that no other lotion or product has done for me. I&#x27;ve used it now twice a day, morning and evening, and no dry skin has come back. It is the only lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that has a refreshing, moisturized feel to the skin when applying it. I don&#x27;t know how Gold Bond has done that, but this product is a blessing for me. If it can cure my constantly flaking dry skin, it can surely cure normal dry skin. I haven&#x27;t tried the other lotions in their lineup. This one works so well for me that I don&#x27;t want to try anything else. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve felt and looked like a healthy, normal person. This is truly, for me, remarkable stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: September, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this lotion for months my dry skin has begun to return. It&#x27;s not the lotion&#x27;s fault, and it&#x27;s still the best lotion I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve found out that my dry skin is caused by wheat. Since this isn&#x27;t a review for the Wheat Belly book by Dr. Davis or a different product, I&#x27;ll just tell you to do an Amazon search for Wheat Belly. After cutting wheat out of my diet my skin has started to heal and become \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, plus I&#x27;m having many other benefits, including weight loss. Just wanted to add that and say this lotion is still excellent stuff, but if you&#x27;re having chronic dry skin it&#x27;s likely being caused by wheat in your diet, and no lotion can fix that.t gets rid of the flaky dry skin.

            <li> I feel smooth skin after I apply this lotion! It stays there for more than 24 hrs ! good one</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, not watery or too greasy. However, for some weird reason it smells like a penis?</li>
            <li> This cream is the best!  My skin was rough and dry for years.  Nothing worked.  After the first use, it felt SO soft and smooth.  It stays that way until the next day even. Payed up to $13 a bottle, but found it for $7 on amazon with free shipping.  Use it on my face too.  Better than expensive $60 Wen cream!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I really like the scent.  Nice to have a lotion that works and doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> Helped Mom&#x27;s dry skin Great</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions but I find this to be the best lotion ever for dry skin. This is my second order.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my old man. Dad is very hard to please when it comes to men&#x27;s grooming products. He won&#x27;t even share this with my mother! I had to buy mom her own bottle. It&#x27;s that good. It blends right into your skin leaving no residue at all. I, myself prefer real 100% shea butter, but not everyone likes the smell of that. This gold bond has a very mild smell, if any at all once it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as promoted - used daily, it has reduced the sagging skin and is restoring elasticity, great for use after surgery</li>
            <li> This I thought fragrance free? has a strange odour we cant tolerate and a greasy feel - wish I looked into return policy - we wont even be able to use it and will need to throw out - its that bad</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for 2 days and have seen very positive results already.  It has a very light pleasant odor and is non-greasy.  I will continue to buy this product.  I have tried so many kinds of lotion-- everything from homemade lotions to other very very expensive lotions.  But this one by far is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Both my husband and myself use it everyday. Keeps skin nice and flake and itch free. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on skin either. Smell okay too.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the basis of other reviews.  For me, it leaves a heavy, sticky residue on my skin.  This is something I can&#x27;t tolerate and I threw the product away after one use.</li>
            <li> This product works near miracles when used consistnatly.  I work in a job where I have to break down a lot of cardboard, and it dries out my hands something terrible.  My  finger tips splits,  cuticles dry out and crack,  etc.  Using the Gold Bond Ultimate Restoring Lotion has helped my hands heal up tremendously.  But  you  have  to  keep  using  it for it to keep working.</li>
            <li> Best lotion! Not greasy but really coats the skin</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for anywhere below the neck.  It  contains a high amount of urea which is an excellent moisture-binding ingredient that also has an exfoliating effect. It also has a nice mix of antioxidants and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 13 oz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  My mom introduced me to it when I moved from the South to Minnesota.  I would wear the smell as a perfume if I could.  Just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever, my skin has never felt so smooth and it got rid of all the scratchy dry feelings on my hands.</li>
            <li> Great stuff , one of the best . Sent is not overbearing , not greasy or oily . Leaves the skin feeling soft and pliable . Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> A great daily lotion that lasts a good period of time.</li>
            <li> Excellent for aging skin.</li>
            <li> It works great for my dry skin in the winter and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the Eucerin I was using for the ceramides because the Eucerin was too thick and took too long to dry. This is much lighter. My only critique is the scent. It&#x27;s not bad... it&#x27;s just a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELPS HEAL DRY SKIN IN JUST A FEW APPLICATIONS.THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT,HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL GOLD BOND PRODUCTS,POWDERS AND LOTIONS.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;ll help protect my thin skin. But love the clean smell and how my skin feels so smooth after application. It even reduces the wrinkles on my hands.</li>
            <li> My go to lotion. Dries fast and long lasting. Light weight and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My grandmother loves it as it stops all itching and makes her skin smooth.  She no longer complains of her skin itching.</li>
            <li> Feels like the perfect lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel crappy like most other lotions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased; majorly impressed.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if it has any lasting effect due to I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but man, when I put it on my skin feels a decade younger, soft, and..... radiant for lack of a better word.  Not greasy or oily or any other yucky feeling, just feels soft and, well, if youth had a feeling this is it!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see that Paula&#x27;s Choice rated this very highly.  I have eczema and it helps so much keeping my skin moist.  Old folks have skin aging problems and this is the ticket!  Good for your skin and keeps it moist.  Put it on daily!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being greasy</li>
            <li> I have dry feet and this is a  really good skin cream. I will reorder it when I need more.</li>
            <li> is a ok lotion wasn&#x27;t quite what i waslooking for i have severly dry skin on my knuckles and feed still try to find the righ t kind so im gonna order and other brand</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, non-greasy moisturizer. I can&#x27;t speak to the CoQ10, but this was recommended as a best product from another site that does reviews of beauty products and their ingredients. I apply this nightly, and my shins which have been forever dry and ashy have cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how much you want to apply and how much of your body you are covering, one full pump covers both my arms, and I need about 4 for my legs for a light slathering, which is all I&#x27;ve needed to see differences in my dry shins.</li>
            <li> This is excellent lotion.  I have been trying to find a moisturizing lotion that would last.  I was using Jergens Original, but was not as moisturizing as I would like as it would dry out quickly and reapplying just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I needed more moisture for my skin and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few hand lotions with urea.  Used to be an Rx item years ago.  It is the finest softener  and restorer on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A great price for this high quality lotion that makes my skin look and feel much better after every use.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin look dry after I applied it and it actually worked.</li>
            <li> it healed my dry leg  slow healing sours.</li>
            <li> Aging skin plus side effects of blood pressure meds make scratching and bleeding a problem on the arms.  This lotion in a few weeks of use has hydrated and smoothed out the skin and helped immensely to reduce the instances of skin abrasions.  A fan of Gold Bond powder and foot powder, was thrilled to find another excellent product from this company.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for extra dry or cracked skin, and after bathing. Not greasy and lasts through some hand washing.</li>
            <li> All Gold Bond products are first rate, but this is not one of my favorites ... I have VERY dry skin, and it is not thick enough for me, a bit thin for my needs.  My favorite is another Gold Bond product![[ASIN:B001QFCHYK Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Shea Butter Lotion 14 oz (396 g)]]</li>
            <li> What a money  and time saver!  This moisturizer can be used on hands, feet, body, face and eyes, eliminating all the expense of separate lotions.  Travel is easier, morning prep is faster, and cabinets and counters a re less cluttered.  I love how soft this makes my skin feel....and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> works better than some of my 100 dollar plus creams</li>
            <li> Found this product to really give my skin needed moisture. It seems to penetrate the upper layers of the skin well. I have pretty sensitive skin. I can use this all over without ANY itching, which is a big deal for me. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I would give this lotion more stars if not for the fragrance.  I absolutely cannot stand the smell and it does not fade as the hours go by.  If they made an unscented version, I would definitely rate this a 5.</li>
            <li> Has Q10.  Are you looking for a wrinkle diminishing lotion because the Gold Bond restoring lotion is wonderful.  I love the light scent and light way it feels on my skin.  Give it a try instead of those pricey brands.</li>
            <li> In the winter my hands (knuckles) get dry enough to crack and bleed.  As a guy I wanted a very basic lotion without a scent.  Most importantly this stuff just works and my hands heal quickly but it is also not slick or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;midnight moonrise&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;vanilla sparkle.&amp;#34; We&#x27;re not talking Old Spice manly but a clean neutral scent is all that is left behind.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Suddenly my skin started to sag, and look wrinkly - causing my skin to look much older.  Instead of looking like 29 year old skin, it started to look like 80 year old skin.  I read about this product, and decided to give it a try.  Some of the reviews complained about the scent - I just add vanilla scented lotion, and it covers the scent nicely. I am sooo glad that I ordered this.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and there is a definite improvement, since there is way less sagging - looks like a 50% improvement.  Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> Initially feels good on the skin, but is vecry sticky which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. When I put on a t shirt afterward i feel like Mr. Bean trying to wrestle into it. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can decide whether this is a pro or con: When I shower 24 hours later after application, It feels like I put it on just before I got in. Your skin feels like a slippery seal. That is a little disconcerting to me. You may like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like Cetaphil better.</li>
            <li> This is a really good body lotion, rich yet does not go on greasy.  It is soothing and the Urea (2nd ingredient) means it also exfoliates, which is great for removing dry, dead skin.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the scent is a bit strong.  It is pleasant but I would prefer an unscented option.  But still, a really great overall body lotion, so I am willing to live with it.</li>
            <li> I received this item in two days.  Hopefully it will help my skin.  Nothing else to say about the lotion.</li>
            <li> Initially this left my skin feeling rubbery, not soft, even though it looked MUCH younger. And my eyelids were no longer bloodshot after 2 days use, which was a miracle to me.  But after 3 weeks, my skin is also soft after applying. My skin must have been in dire need of this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels really good on the skin, use it on my kid that has problems with dry skin and she loves it</li>
            <li> Seems to be a really good product.  I try to use coQ10 lotions as much as possible.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a really good lotion. Would recommend to anyone looking for a body lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is great.  It is not greasy.  It moisturizes all day/night.  If it has a fragrance, it&#x27;s not noticable, so there is no conflict with perfume. I already ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Lotion feels great on my skin and also has a very pleasant, understated smell.</li>
            <li> In cold temps, skin gets very dry, but a small application of this lotion once or twice a day prevents cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It goes on nicely and leaves skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this product from Gold Bond.  The lotion is very smooth and works well to eliminate dry skin.  Fragrance is very mild too.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> you will not find a better product fot dry skin . I would and will buy this product again. I loved it.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I tend to have very dry hands. This leaves my hand soft and not grease, like some other lotion may do. since its on my desk at work 4 or 5 other co workers have started to buy it as well.</li>
            <li> Best drugstore level moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. Kiehl&#x27;s is still my favorite, but at this price you can&#x27;t beat GoldBond. Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not absorb well. Feel the slimy goo on your skin next time you take a shower. Gross.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Great product</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and smells so good, not too loud just nice.  Also, it&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and have always had issues with fairly mild but persistent acne and the resulting scarring.  I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer at night, but a few months ago I decided to try Gold Bond&#x27;s restoring lotion.  You get about 4 times as much of this as you do with the Aveeno moisturizer, and for roughly half the price- great deal!  Anyway, I&#x27;m seriously in love with this Gold Bond lotion now.  It seems to do a great job preventing new acne while healing old scarring, and I think it actually has a nice scent.  If you use it at night like I do and then wash it off in the morning, it still feels like it&#x27;s left a residual protective coating on your skin.  Also, I was starting to see a couple of light lines developing on my forehead and had been trying Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives night lotion for them, but the Gold Bond restoring lotion&#x27;s been doing a much better job at keeping those at bay as well.  So, in sum:  this lotion takes care of just about every skin concern imaginable and yet is still super affordable.  WIN!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for extremely dry skin. Works just as well as aveeno products even with eczema.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking and feeling so much better and without having to break the bank or feel greasy.  My only minor complaint is that the scent is a little strong.  Not that it is bad, but it does compete with my perfume.  That is not a factor that would outweigh the improvements I have seen and felt, but worth a mention</li>
            <li> I like how this lotion feels after it soaks in. However, I can not use it as the fragrance is overwhelming and very perfumey. Beware if you are sensitive in the least.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the BEST lotion for skin! I had extremely dry skin in the winter so I used gold bond the entire winter and it not only made my skin feel so soft, there is also a gentle clean smell. I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to anybody who has dry skin issues..you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> this is a good lotion! my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for extremely dry skin.  I got two and I gave one to my cousin for Christmas.  She sliked it also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 4 weeks.  I am very pleased with it.  It has a bit of scent which is short lived on my skin.  It is not think as are some of Gold Bond&#x27;s products...it&#x27;s not runny either.</li>
            <li> I used to order very expensive lotion from an organic company for years. I tried this stuff at the recommendation of a friend, and man.....what a difference! This is great. It smells nice, it&#x27;s reasonable priced, and it more than does the job. It&#x27;s even healed my falling apart lips. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in need of some sort of moisturizer... everything seems to work good enough so I tend to bounce around from brand to brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago I picked up the Q10 Gold Bond lotion and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it is better than what I had been using  (Palmer&#x27;s and Vaseline&#x27;s Cocoa butter formulations).  My skin looks healthier and smoother now and not merely less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too intense and goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there is aloe and shea in the ingredients... I wonder if the other Gold Bond formulations are essentially the same?</li>
            <li> I love this lotion ! it works immediately ... leaves my skin so soft and fresh . It is a must have if you wash your hand a lot like me as I have twins and my hand get dry all the time</li>
            <li> Just like the powder the lotion is wonderful.  It very smooth and feels good on the skin real nice bye.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product last Fall.  I don&#x27;t like those creams that leave a residue of that greasy feeling.  This product keeps the&lt;br /&gt;skin soft as it absorbs quickly.  This winter I kept the lotion right on my kitchen counter.  After each hand washing I put a dab on immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Also if I am just need a little moisture on my hands it&#x27;s always there to use.  One of the best skin products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, this lotion is very smooth and has help my skin to be much more healthy and comfortable.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent, as some others did.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! I have tried many different lotions and this one seems to work the best. I have found that I no longer need to use it every day as it moisturizes so effectively.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a bit of psoriasis, and I&#x27;ve found that the Gold Bond lotions work very well for me.  They&#x27;re very heavy - take a little effort to massage in - but they&#x27;re long lasting and quite soothing.  They&#x27;re also pretty much odorless and don&#x27;t seem to harm clothing, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> A lifesaver in the winter months. I use this when I get out of the shower and it really helps calm my dry, itchy skin. Almost no scent. Goes on easily and absorbs quickly. Not sticky, not greasy. Just right.</li>
            <li> The best in lotions - rejuvinating and lovely feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> Just the best body cream!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond for years now. They are all great products. However I&#x27;ve had dry bumpy skin all my life. I&#x27;ve tried every lotion out there. Gold Bond coq10 has actually started healing my skin to the point that people who know me have told me my skin is looking better. I&#x27;ve only been using the coq10 a few months but it&#x27;s worked wonders. I&#x27;m sure my dermatologist would be amazed as well. This is the only lotion I will ever use now. Thanks Gold Bond for giving me healthier skin for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I have very sensitive skin - especially to the sun.  I have a lot of spots and dry places on my arms and legs from the sun and this has really helped to calm all of that down.  It is a great moisturizer and healer.</li>
            <li> My Docter recommended this for me, since I have SUPER DRY SKIN!  I,l&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different lotions over the years.  Paid LOTS of &amp; forsome &amp; I can tell you that paying more doesn&#x27;t get you any better lotion than Gold Bond!  It&#x27;s all I ever buy now!</li>
            <li> Used year around, Helps even in winter cold when  dry skin can be painfull. Do I have 12 words yet?</li>
            <li> This stuff DOES really work!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It hydrates beautifully but it&#x27;s not greasy, plus it smells delicious.  But about half way through the bottle you won&#x27;t be able to get any cream out of the pump.  It&#x27;s very annoying.  You have to then unscrew the top and try to get the cream out manually. The manufacturer really needs to solve this problem.</li>
            <li> Title was: - best lotion for &#x27;chicken skin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I had keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried various methods of exfoliation and lotions, including prescription lactic acid lotion, and nothing worked. After a couple of weeks of using this product my skin is finally smooth. I&#x27;m not too fond of the scent, though (I prefer unscented products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle now, and guess what, my bumps came back. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or it was just a coincidence that my skin cleared up for the 6-8 weeks I was using the first bottle. Oh well, back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heels of my feet are still soft and smooth, though, so the product deserves a high rating.</li>
            <li> This product is a pleasure to use and very soothing and healing. Smells good and just feels good on. Highly recommended as a regular treatment to avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I have no dry or itchy spots. I use this product every day all over and feel great.</li>
            <li> This is amazing if you have really dry skin</li>
