            <li> I use this product and I love the way it smoothes my thick african american hair.</li>
            <li> My natural coils have relaxed and my hair looks and feels extremely brittle, even after three days and three subsequent co-washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it up with Brahmi powder, and other essential oils such as argan oit, palm red oil and coconut oil to make a 15 minutes mask/deep condidtioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not realize how protein rich the product is.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dry hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down afterwards the way that Organics did and the hair actually feels stronger afterwards too.</li>
            <li> I went to open the product , to stumble that it was dried out.</li>
            <li> My hair has been hennaed and it was very dry until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my three small kids whom all have mixed hair...  </li>
            <li> It was not as dry and was softer after I dried it.</li>
            <li> so I believe this will last at least 8-10 washes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to give this product an entirely negative review, since technically I did not use according to direction.  </li>
            <li> Dried, gooey and rough consistancy to apply to my lustrous</li>
            <li> some days, I add a little of the product into my hair to help keep my hair down.  </li>
            <li> waste of money and prompt service for a defective item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s stopping it from shedding though.</li>
            <li> I spent over $400 dollars on products because my hair of mixed texture was shedding so badly.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell HORRIBLE, it does not moisturize my dry colored hair as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> the hair was little to none!!!!</li>

            <li> I received this product today and used it right away!  I must say that I was stunned by the results.  I spent over $400 dollars on products because my hair of mixed texture was shedding so badly.  I followed the instructions.  To begin with the texture was delightful, the smell may be a bit strong for some but I loved the smell.  Smells like an Indian herb.  All the same prior to using this product, when using conditioner I could see the hair coming out in the comb.  The minuet I used this product the hair was little to none!!!! and I am not getting paid for telling you this.  It is amazing and you will be amazed by the results.  I will be stocking up!</li>
            <li> I originally used Organics Hair Mayonnaise as a deep conditioner and it worked well but when i saw this i decided to give it a shot. I have to say that i loooooove the way my hair feels after using this.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down afterwards the way that Organics did and the hair actually feels stronger afterwards too. Its a nice size jar that can last for months!!</li>
            <li> Works so so well, ive been using it once or twice a week for about a month. i noticed a huge difference and so did my stylist. she said my hair was pretty healthy and cut off less than she has before. its not some overnight miracle but it is a staple for me and i can see my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair soft and healthy. I bought it for all my friends and relatives .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use on blonde hair. It&#x27;s pretty gold</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. my local place was out so I went to order online. Prompt shipping, covered in double plastic and serran wrap. I went to open the product , to stumble that it was dried out. Dried, gooey and rough consistancy to apply to my lustrous mane.&lt;br /&gt;A waste of money and prompt service for a defective item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell HORRIBLE, it does not moisturize my dry colored hair as I had hoped. This went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Soft, Strong hair, not much more to say other then the fact that this works, and you can find it much cheaper at a local store.</li>
            <li> You have dry hair?????this product will make your hair so soft and smell real good !!! I used it first time last night ,let it in my hair over night and washed out with cool water !!! I loveeeee it !!!!! I&#x27;m planning to do a mask twice a week until I grow out my hair at where I want it !!!!</li>
            <li> nice for the hair but has a very strong smell. one can only use it over the weekend. do not use if you have to go to work even the next day.</li>
            <li> Love using this product. I mix it up with Brahmi powder, and other essential oils such as argan oit, palm red oil and coconut oil to make a 15 minutes mask/deep condidtioner.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and kept this on overnight underneath a processing cap and tshirt. When I rinsed it out, my hair was soft, silky, and smelled great. You don&#x27;t need much for it to do its job so I believe this will last at least 8-10 washes. I switch my products every other wash so this will be my Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner partner in crime :) Great as a deep conditioner, hair mask, or hot oil treatment. The results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love this product. After using it once I immediately felt a difference in my hair. It was not as dry and was softer after I dried it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do any good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product and I love the way it smoothes my thick african american hair. It is a great product to use if your hair is \\&quot;poofed and you want it to be smoothier.  My hair has been hennaed and it was very dry until I used this product.  Also my hair was trying to matt up and this product seperated the strans.  I started using the product on at night and leaving it on until morning.  It made my hair more manageable.  I am now able to comb my hair.  Before I could not comb my hair because it was so matted and tangled.  Every morning I just  wash the product out with water.  some days, I add a little of the product into my hair to help keep my hair down.  Every night I put more in.  Some  days I don&#x27;t add more if I want to wear  my hair down.  This product is great for children tangles.  I use it on my three small kids whom all have mixed hair...  just add to hair, and wash out each morning with water.  Very seldom do I use any shampoo now.  A very good product!  Love, Love, it.  Don&#x27;t take my word, try for your self.  It will make your hair very straight and easy to manage. My hair is growing and I love it!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft and detangled right away. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s stopping it from shedding though.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that is prone to dryness.

            <li> This is like hair crack. I have naturally dry hair. This works miracles!!! I even feel a change in my curl pattern after using this.. My hairs more defined...</li>
