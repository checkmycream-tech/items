            <li> Not only does the work great on skin but also great on fabrics. After ring sing off hair Dyson my hair I found d dark brown hair dye on my white rugs. I squeezed this on the rugs where they were stained the color went away Immediately! I am definitely  keeping this on hand for any hair dye drips on skin or fabrics.</li>
            <li> I could not find the product locally so I got on my computer&lt;br /&gt;and found it at Amazon.  I got the product I wanted at a great&lt;br /&gt;price and got it very quickly.  I was truly impressed with&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I have ordered products from Amazon before and have been&lt;br /&gt;happy with what I have ordered and the quick way I have gotten&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
            <li> Great product to remove hair color of your skin. I use it to remove hair color after I color my eye brows. Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. the bottle is big so it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This really works well.  I dye my hair once a month at home and always need to touch up spots on my skin here and there.  This takes the excess dye off very gently and has made this whole process so much easier for me.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Did as expected on tile stains.  Still have to work on carpet, but stains just about gone.</li>
            <li> Great unless you want dark stains around your hairline when you color your hair.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair dye off my face well.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is amazing! I use pravana vivid colors like blue, purple, green, and pravana 4n (brown) and this stuff takes off all the spots, strips, and drips that happen with doing your own hair.  It mainly smells like alcohol  but it&#x27;s not a strong smell. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or gross either. A+</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. It is the best color stain remover I have ever used. I dye my hair black so any leftover dye is extremely obvious but this does a great job of removing it. Love it!</li>

            <li> My hairdresser uses this any time I get my hair colored and the color gets on my face. Works great</li>
            <li> Works really, really well.  Would give it 5 stars if it smelled better.  Also, wish it came in smaller sizes at a lower price.  Since you only need a very small amount at a time, this bottle will probably last longer than I will live.</li>

            <li> Wipes color stains off skin effortlessly! I used it to pretreat skin around hair line, skin didn&#x27;t even stain where it was applyed.</li>
