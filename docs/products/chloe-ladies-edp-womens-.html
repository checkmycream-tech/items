            <li>I Love this parfume..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>quite disappoint to see so many flaws on the product</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>It is my favorite</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many newer fragrances but my favorite is still Karl Lagerfelds&#x27;s Chloe.  </li>
            <li>Something magical happens when it mixes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I met this perfume when i was 19 in Australia and fallen in love in 2 seconds!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>a better price than buying it at macys</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>but after I got it, I think it&#x27;s more of a 4/5 smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I thought the packaging is cute...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is authentic parfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>and i compltely fellll in love with it</li>
            <li>great product fast shiping</li>
            <li>Subtitle, elegant perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>I love perfume</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s gonna love Santa for this</li>
            <li>My and my wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Same wonderful Chloe fragrance and adorable bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I REALLY WAS SATISFY AND HAPPY</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Chloe.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and everyone around me loves the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell since my Mom wears it and couldn&#x27;t wait to get some for myself.  </li>
            <li>and she is in love with the smell</li>
            <li>It smells exotic.</li>
            <li>This 2.5 oz is the most you can get</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have the fixation I was waiting for.</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments</li>
            <li>great fragrance, classy.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the original but better for it, imo.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent of fresh floral which Chloe delivers!  </li>
            <li>Will see if the top begins to tarnish as has my original silver plated one, or if it stays shiny over time.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>not so strong smell!wonderful</li>
            <li>Beautiful smell and last all day!</li>
            <li>Nice clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Item came just as expected, quickly and  in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I got this and will definitely but again once it runs out.</li>
            <li>and yet they claim 100% genuine on their storefront comment.</li>
            <li>This company was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much, ordered it for my mom.</li>
            <li>Chloe has a nice smell and after you had it on for a while you really cant smell it unless you snuff your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Another scent you may enjoy if you like Chloe is Flora by Gucci.</li>
            <li>Floral, light, with class.</li>
            <li>bad.box is cheap .so</li>
            <li>The savings are great but unless you want the scent to last I would invest elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Such a fresh wonderful cologne, just right for all seasons.</li>
            <li>Anyway this morning when pulling the cap off the perfume, the whole thing came apart!!!</li>
            <li>I like it so much!! !</li>
            <li>Came super fast, and I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>They were quick and easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>Brand Loyalty success story!</li>
            <li>while the original packaging that I have from dept. store doesn&#x27;t even use raised logo.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re wondering if this is original, please purchase an original fragrances from the dept. store and compare it side by side, you will see the differences.</li>
            <li>worth it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Small bottle just perfect for the purse or to take when traveling.</li>
            <li>I compared my original bottle side by side to this one.</li>
            <li>This is not the original product.</li>
            <li>While it smelled a little better on the girl who recommended it to me, I&#x27;m still happy with how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it has a clean scent to it that stays for hours.</li>
            <li>Specially for the 2.5 size.</li>
            <li>They will be more than happy to give you one, I actually didn&#x27;t know that they would, so I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my perfume too sweet or too spicey.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume , deliver was fast also</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because her sampler bottle was running low, and we both loved the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>so I had a full refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so feminine and sweet.</li>
            <li>I always get many compliments from everyone of much much they like the way I smell.</li>
            <li>it was a good Christmas present for my mother</li>
            <li>It is strong at first, but quickly settles.  </li>
            <li>So fresh and unique.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love it, and every time I wear it I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>However, the perfume seemed legit, stood fragrant for the whole day, (which is really good because i have a physically demanding job) and like the title says, if this IS a fake, they did a really great job, Lol.</li>
            <li>pleased and highly receommended.</li>
            <li>that is very feminine and sophisticated without begin overwhelming  and old lady smelling.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the woman at this Sephora was great :-)  </li>
            <li>Might become her new favorite.</li>
            <li>This perfume is vmy new favorite now.</li>
            <li>Genuine new bottle in box and shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li>Sure, it smells good to me, but the amount of compliments I&#x27;ve received while wearing this perfume is almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>smell or types of light can trigger them and this smell certainly did.</li>
            <li>so excited to be able to get my favorite sent for half the price.</li>
            <li>Great everyday scent everyone always compliments me on my smell.</li>
            <li>It is a great perfume for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to get the Parfum as it last much longer giving you better value for yoru money.</li>
            <li>This is a nice middle of the road smell.  </li>
            <li>I definitely catch rose and</li>
            <li>Soft, yet confident.</li>
            <li>My wife gave it to someone who liked it, not a total loss...</li>
            <li>The perfume came quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and I am fine with that because it can come with me in my carry on luggage:) very high quality perfume that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>long lasting and beautiful scent..</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy it either directly from Amazon or from another seller and fulfilled (shipped) by Amazon if you want the real thing.</li>
            <li>Product got to me very fast.  </li>
            <li>This was my first order from you and since this order I have placed another order for the lotion for my wife and it too got to me very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience buying parfume online (retailers Yamanni) and it didn&#x27;t go so well.</li>
            <li>Very clean,light scent with a hint of fresh linen fragrance.this product will stay with you through out the day but not overpowering</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li>However, it ONLY lasts maybe an hour at most.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about perfumes (been using Eternity by Calvin Klein for 10 yrs!)</li>
            <li>Having said that, we all know that fragrances are pretty subjective</li>
            <li>Its fresh and very feminine.</li>
            <li>I love the Chloe parfum and bought it before several times at the Chloe shop.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite scent I keep going back to.  </li>
            <li>For me, Peony oil works VERY well with my skin type!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly how it was described and I received it in two days.</li>
            <li>Its the real deal ladies!</li>
            <li>and they were and exact match.</li>
            <li>i use several Estee Lauder perfumes, but Chloe is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>the liquid in the bottle was much more of a yellow color and did not smell like Chole.</li>
            <li>One of my students, first grader, said that I smelled pretty.</li>
            <li>It is not exactly the kind of perfum I usually like, but it will be perfect for some specific moments.</li>
            <li>not exactly what I&#x27;ve expected,it smells just like some kind of soap after use it for a while.</li>
            <li>More like toilet water than eau du parfum spray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought from Amazon LLC so I figured I&#x27;d get the real deal, but unfortunately not</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell but at the same time it is elegant and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>But it turned out to be the same product that I would normally purchase for much more at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Crisp, clear, fresh, soapy floral.</li>
            <li>this is my second time by Chloe this fragrance is outstanding elect to be known the first bottle I bought a small bottle that I put the big bottle</li>
            <li>Chloe is fresh, clean, vibrant, and a lil spicy which will stay on you skin and clothes the entire day.</li>
            <li>Absolutely this parfum.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It starts out smelling like Chloe, but the scent dissipates much sooner than the Chloe I purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very distinctive even with me having no sense of smell.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it at Ulta or Sephora</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t care so much.</li>
            <li>Very distinguishable.</li>
            <li>Very please with my perfume</li>
            <li>I have received tons of compliments, and I absolutely adore the fragrance.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>No need to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely one of the scents I enjoy wearing often.</li>
            <li>Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong, nor does it linger as long.</li>
            <li>Please can you help me straighten this out and can I please have the original scent if I send this back to you?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m requesting a new bottle for Christmas this year!</li>
            <li>The plastic wasnt torn just loose, there was no glue and everything was fine.</li>
            <li>Been wearing Chloe for years but now that the price is so high in retail stores, I cannot afford it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I spray this on my left arm and the one purchased at Macy&#x27;s on my right arm...</li>
            <li>Brand new in package still had the cellophane wrapper and description card in 6 languages.</li>
            <li>Chloe New for Women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ChloeChloe New for Women.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Chanel #5 which she loves, I&#x27;ve now added a new scent to add to my gift list</li>
            <li>, I thought it might be a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li>very classy (if that can be bottled....)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Eau de parfum over the eau de toilette, plus it lingers far longer.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and last all day long.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $!</li>
            <li>Came sealed, with serial number coded onto the bottle, little Chloe insert, one spritz of the EDP is MORE than enough (as in the scent is strong vs being watered down).  </li>
            <li>; I got it for a bit more than half of what they wanted for a bottle of the same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent was watered down, didnt smell like the original at all.</li>
            <li>The financial transaction was straight forward.</li>
            <li>and we compared it to my old bottle</li>
            <li>Note: Did NOT purchase from Amazon, purchased directly from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>surprised me, because I did like the perfume that got sent to me.</li>
            <li>This one has the information printed directly onto the bottle itself on the bottom instead of the clear Coty label.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive my product as early as i did despite the date given to be delivered.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but probably fake.</li>
            <li>First time I purchased but definitely will not be the last.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried about buying it online for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>but when I got the product I could see immediately that this is the real thing... the same smell and the same package, made in France.</li>
            <li>I can triangulate her general location in the building now on scent alone.</li>
            <li>and it barely lasts 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>My old bottle from Macy&#x27;s would last all day.</li>
            <li>This was certainly money well spent!</li>
            <li>The one from Sephora lasts for over a day, but this one fades within an hour and has a slight rubbing alcohol smell when first sprayed.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts for 30 seconds and doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell the same as the real Chloe.</li>
            <li>Every parfum that uses peony (I&#x27;m sure there is a percentage that I am not aware of, it is just a common denominator I found) lasts all day on me.  </li>
            <li>a few hours later the scent was undetectable on my left arm and lasting on my right.</li>

            <li> Shipped on time and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li> quite disappoint to see so many flaws on the product</li>

            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many newer fragrances but my favorite is still Karl Lagerfelds&#x27;s Chloe.  </li>
            <li> Something magical happens when it mixes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I met this perfume when i was 19 in Australia and fallen in love in 2 seconds!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> a better price than buying it at macys</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> but after I got it, I think it&#x27;s more of a 4/5 smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I thought the packaging is cute...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is authentic parfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> and i compltely fellll in love with it</li>

            <li> I love perfume</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s gonna love Santa for this</li>
            <li> My and my wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Same wonderful Chloe fragrance and adorable bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I REALLY WAS SATISFY AND HAPPY</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Chloe.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and everyone around me loves the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell since my Mom wears it and couldn&#x27;t wait to get some for myself.  </li>
            <li> and she is in love with the smell</li>
            <li> It smells exotic.</li>
            <li> This 2.5 oz is the most you can get</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have the fixation I was waiting for.</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments</li>
            <li> great fragrance, classy.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original but better for it, imo.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent of fresh floral which Chloe delivers!  </li>
            <li> Will see if the top begins to tarnish as has my original silver plated one, or if it stays shiny over time.</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> not so strong smell!wonderful</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and last all day!</li>
            <li> Nice clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Item came just as expected, quickly and  in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got this and will definitely but again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> and yet they claim 100% genuine on their storefront comment.</li>
            <li> This company was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, ordered it for my mom.</li>
            <li> Chloe has a nice smell and after you had it on for a while you really cant smell it unless you snuff your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Another scent you may enjoy if you like Chloe is Flora by Gucci.</li>
            <li> Floral, light, with class.</li>
            <li> bad.box is cheap .so</li>
            <li> The savings are great but unless you want the scent to last I would invest elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Such a fresh wonderful cologne, just right for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Anyway this morning when pulling the cap off the perfume, the whole thing came apart!!!</li>
            <li> I like it so much!! !</li>
            <li> Came super fast, and I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> They were quick and easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Brand Loyalty success story!</li>
            <li> while the original packaging that I have from dept. store doesn&#x27;t even use raised logo.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re wondering if this is original, please purchase an original fragrances from the dept. store and compare it side by side, you will see the differences.</li>
            <li> worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Small bottle just perfect for the purse or to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> I compared my original bottle side by side to this one.</li>
            <li> This is not the original product.</li>
            <li> While it smelled a little better on the girl who recommended it to me, I&#x27;m still happy with how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it has a clean scent to it that stays for hours.</li>
            <li> Specially for the 2.5 size.</li>
            <li> They will be more than happy to give you one, I actually didn&#x27;t know that they would, so I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my perfume too sweet or too spicey.  </li>
            <li> Love this perfume , deliver was fast also</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because her sampler bottle was running low, and we both loved the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> so I had a full refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so feminine and sweet.</li>
            <li> I always get many compliments from everyone of much much they like the way I smell.</li>
            <li> it was a good Christmas present for my mother</li>
            <li> It is strong at first, but quickly settles.  </li>
            <li> So fresh and unique.  </li>
            <li> Clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love it, and every time I wear it I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> However, the perfume seemed legit, stood fragrant for the whole day, (which is really good because i have a physically demanding job) and like the title says, if this IS a fake, they did a really great job, Lol.</li>
            <li> pleased and highly receommended.</li>
            <li> that is very feminine and sophisticated without begin overwhelming  and old lady smelling.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the woman at this Sephora was great :-)  </li>
            <li> Might become her new favorite.</li>
            <li> This perfume is vmy new favorite now.</li>
            <li> Genuine new bottle in box and shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li> Sure, it smells good to me, but the amount of compliments I&#x27;ve received while wearing this perfume is almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> smell or types of light can trigger them and this smell certainly did.</li>
            <li> so excited to be able to get my favorite sent for half the price.</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent everyone always compliments me on my smell.</li>
            <li> It is a great perfume for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to get the Parfum as it last much longer giving you better value for yoru money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice middle of the road smell.  </li>
            <li> I definitely catch rose and</li>
            <li> Soft, yet confident.</li>
            <li> My wife gave it to someone who liked it, not a total loss...</li>
            <li> The perfume came quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and I am fine with that because it can come with me in my carry on luggage:) very high quality perfume that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> long lasting and beautiful scent..</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy it either directly from Amazon or from another seller and fulfilled (shipped) by Amazon if you want the real thing.</li>
            <li> Product got to me very fast.  </li>
            <li> This was my first order from you and since this order I have placed another order for the lotion for my wife and it too got to me very fast.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience buying parfume online (retailers Yamanni) and it didn&#x27;t go so well.</li>
            <li> Very clean,light scent with a hint of fresh linen fragrance.this product will stay with you through out the day but not overpowering</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> However, it ONLY lasts maybe an hour at most.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about perfumes (been using Eternity by Calvin Klein for 10 yrs!)</li>
            <li> Having said that, we all know that fragrances are pretty subjective</li>
            <li> Its fresh and very feminine.</li>
            <li> I love the Chloe parfum and bought it before several times at the Chloe shop.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent I keep going back to.  </li>
            <li> For me, Peony oil works VERY well with my skin type!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly how it was described and I received it in two days.</li>
            <li> Its the real deal ladies!</li>
            <li> and they were and exact match.</li>
            <li> i use several Estee Lauder perfumes, but Chloe is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> the liquid in the bottle was much more of a yellow color and did not smell like Chole.</li>
            <li> One of my students, first grader, said that I smelled pretty.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly the kind of perfum I usually like, but it will be perfect for some specific moments.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I&#x27;ve expected,it smells just like some kind of soap after use it for a while.</li>
            <li> More like toilet water than eau du parfum spray.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought from Amazon LLC so I figured I&#x27;d get the real deal, but unfortunately not</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell but at the same time it is elegant and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> But it turned out to be the same product that I would normally purchase for much more at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Crisp, clear, fresh, soapy floral.</li>
            <li> this is my second time by Chloe this fragrance is outstanding elect to be known the first bottle I bought a small bottle that I put the big bottle</li>
            <li> Chloe is fresh, clean, vibrant, and a lil spicy which will stay on you skin and clothes the entire day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely this parfum.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It starts out smelling like Chloe, but the scent dissipates much sooner than the Chloe I purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very distinctive even with me having no sense of smell.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it at Ulta or Sephora</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t care so much.</li>
            <li> Very distinguishable.</li>
            <li> Very please with my perfume</li>
            <li> I have received tons of compliments, and I absolutely adore the fragrance.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> No need to use too much of it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely one of the scents I enjoy wearing often.</li>
            <li> Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong, nor does it linger as long.</li>
            <li> Please can you help me straighten this out and can I please have the original scent if I send this back to you?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m requesting a new bottle for Christmas this year!</li>
            <li> The plastic wasnt torn just loose, there was no glue and everything was fine.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Chloe for years but now that the price is so high in retail stores, I cannot afford it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I spray this on my left arm and the one purchased at Macy&#x27;s on my right arm...</li>
            <li> Brand new in package still had the cellophane wrapper and description card in 6 languages.</li>
            <li> Chloe New for Women.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ChloeChloe New for Women.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Chanel #5 which she loves, I&#x27;ve now added a new scent to add to my gift list</li>
            <li> , I thought it might be a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li> very classy (if that can be bottled....)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Eau de parfum over the eau de toilette, plus it lingers far longer.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and last all day long.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your $!</li>
            <li> Came sealed, with serial number coded onto the bottle, little Chloe insert, one spritz of the EDP is MORE than enough (as in the scent is strong vs being watered down).  </li>
            <li> ; I got it for a bit more than half of what they wanted for a bottle of the same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent was watered down, didnt smell like the original at all.</li>
            <li> The financial transaction was straight forward.</li>
            <li> and we compared it to my old bottle</li>
            <li> Note: Did NOT purchase from Amazon, purchased directly from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> surprised me, because I did like the perfume that got sent to me.</li>
            <li> This one has the information printed directly onto the bottle itself on the bottom instead of the clear Coty label.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive my product as early as i did despite the date given to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but probably fake.</li>
            <li> First time I purchased but definitely will not be the last.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying it online for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> but when I got the product I could see immediately that this is the real thing... the same smell and the same package, made in France.</li>
            <li> I can triangulate her general location in the building now on scent alone.</li>
            <li> and it barely lasts 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> My old bottle from Macy&#x27;s would last all day.</li>
            <li> This was certainly money well spent!</li>
            <li> The one from Sephora lasts for over a day, but this one fades within an hour and has a slight rubbing alcohol smell when first sprayed.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts for 30 seconds and doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell the same as the real Chloe.</li>
            <li> Every parfum that uses peony (I&#x27;m sure there is a percentage that I am not aware of, it is just a common denominator I found) lasts all day on me.  </li>
            <li> a few hours later the scent was undetectable on my left arm and lasting on my right.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, you can tell the bottle doesn&#x27;t have flat bottom on the inside to contain the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> It happen to be fake but it came very close to it being real</li>
            <li> Anyone can tell easily by the brand imprinted on the silver bezel but unfortunately mine didn&#x27;t have it</li>
            <li> The smell from the bottle you shipped only last for 30 minutes and also different from previous one.  </li>
            <li> The smells lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chloe for a long time.</li>
            <li> Got this scent a couple years ago for christmas, as I usually try a new scent each year.  </li>
            <li> This is an imitation of the original Chloe and it smells horrible and very cheap.</li>
            <li> so I could warn other men to second guess themselves if they&#x27;re planning on purchasing this for their lady friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the expensive side but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I tried other fragrances but always go back to Chloe at the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think it&#x27;s good but not great compared to some out there.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my birthday and am so disappointed with it, my sons have always liked this on me</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon at less of that pricey for the big bottle!</li>
            <li> Ive bought this perfume before at sephora (the price alone why i tried amazon) and the bottom of the box had a strange cut out of the barcode that I dont remember seeing on the other one i bought, admittedly i never checked either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not real.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> So disappointed it is better</li>
            <li> At first, I was scared to order here thinking it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> I hesitated ordering this perfume on line after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> this is the first time that I buy it through amazon, I read some reviews about fake products and got a bit worried...</li>
            <li> of the other terrible reviews seem to be more concerned with whether or not they&#x27;re getting a counterfeit fragrance, completely glossing over the fact that this reeks.</li>
            <li> Pretty frustrated that I spent $80 on perfume and the smell doesnt last.  </li>
            <li> Seems watered down.</li>
            <li> All of this leads me to believe that this may be a watered down version or a knock off.</li>
            <li> She loves this perfume, as a small amount lasts for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and I pay half of the price compared to a department store.</li>
            <li> Def not an imitation!</li>
            <li> The logo is not a clean looking and using emboss (raised letter)</li>
            <li> The item that I received is NOT ORIGINAL Chlo&amp;eacute; parfume.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about receiving a fake product, but the product I received was genuine; it smells identical to the sampler she has and lasts just as long, without starting to smell nasty later on after application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only small gripe I had has to do with shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter also likes this fragrance, and she usually does not like any fragrances I use.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nothing like the Chloe I&#x27;ve bought in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure however this fragrance is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  fake one I can only smell for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance on a co worker and she told me she got it at Sephora for $90 for a small bottle ...</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> I filed a formal complaint with the seller almost a week ago.</li>
            <li> We usually buy it at Saks for $110+, but can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> 100% legit was skeptical because it&#x27;s half the price but purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li> I regret not believing that review now.&lt;br /&gt;The delivered perfum smells totally different and so bad.</li>
            <li> Was not the real item very disappointed</li>
            <li> The plastic covering the box was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> But when i received the bottle from Amazon.com, the plastic was broken and the perfume was stuck inside the box as if it was glued in there.</li>
            <li> the package insert - is a bad imitation of Chloe.</li>
            <li> The perfume was stuck to the box with a weird glue.</li>
            <li> I thought it was weird</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is fake or what is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> stars cos its expensive $85 for 1.7ml...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to buy perfumes as they are too expensive</li>
            <li> I find this disturbing.</li>
            <li> It was fake.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Valentina by Valentino, which unfortunately Sephora does not sell; however, that is how I found this gem.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> and I was kinda worried, I would receive a fake bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> but i got late!! :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so expensive!  </li>
            <li> I doubted that you may ship fake product to me, and that is very very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is a bad copy from the packaging and the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> This is fake and smells awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the \\&quot;Chloe\\&quot; perfume I received this time.</li>
            <li> and I absolutley hate it and won&#x27;t use it!  </li>
            <li> Before buying this on this shop, I read the terrible review.</li>
            <li> My bf thinks Im insane because I am giddy over this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Came super fast, and I love this perfume! Brand Loyalty success story!</li>
            <li> Just received this today, I love it and at a great price! I&#x27;m so happy I got this and will definitely but again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful scent. Be sure to buy it from Amazon as they have the best pricing.  Also make sure to get the Parfum as it last much longer giving you better value for yoru money.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves this perfume, as a small amount lasts for a very long time.  Also, I found that it was cheaper for me to purchase this online than purchasing it at a local department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small gripe I had has to do with shipping. Despite prime shipping, the product took about 5-7 days to arrive.</li>
            <li> Like,like,like.... I Love this parfume..It smells amazing.It&#x27;s just what I wanted and at a much better price than buying it in a department store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this perfume. Shipped on time and lasts for most of the day. Definitely recommend, and is cheaper than in-store department pricing!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience buying parfume online (retailers Yamanni) and it didn&#x27;t go so well. The item that I received is NOT ORIGINAL Chlo&amp;eacute; parfume. It is a bad copy from the packaging and the bottle itself. The packaging has misspelling on the ingredients and the french words. The logo is not a clean looking and using emboss (raised letter) while the original packaging that I have from dept. store doesn&#x27;t even use raised logo. Upon opening the box, you can tell the bottle doesn&#x27;t have flat bottom on the inside to contain the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite disappoint to see so many flaws on the product and yet they claim 100% genuine on their storefront comment. So if you&#x27;re going to buy this to save money, go a head, but remember no one knows what they put inside the bottle. They can&#x27;t even pay attention to detail the packaging and bottle. But if you&#x27;re wondering if this is original, please purchase an original fragrances from the dept. store and compare it side by side, you will see the differences.</li>
            <li> It is great. It was a gift to my brother and he loved it .</li>
            <li> THANK YOU!!! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. fair price</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume after smelling it at Dillards.  I loved it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the department store price.  I found the best price on the Eau De Parfum 2.5 ounces at Amazon.  It is strong at first, but quickly settles.  It smells awesome.  I don&#x27;t like my perfume too sweet or too spicey.  This is a nice middle of the road smell.  I get tons of complements.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another bottle for my mom.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Wife loves it. Might become her new favorite.</li>
            <li> I wear Chloe regularly.  I was a little worried about buying it online for such a cheap price, I thought it might be a cheap imitation. But it turned out to be the same product that I would normally purchase for much more at the mall.  I&#x27;m happy with the product. The financial transaction was straight forward. The product was delivered within the time frame set by the seller. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Item came just as expected, quickly and  in perfect condition. Brand new in package still had the cellophane wrapper and description card in 6 languages. Beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, smells great!</li>
            <li> This company was fantastic. They were quick and easy to deal with. Great product and easy to communicate with. A+ amazon seller.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;+</li>
            <li> MY wife likes it but very strong</li>
            <li> Love this perfume , deliver was fast also</li>
            <li> Beautiful original scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two \\&quot;Chloe Chloe\\&quot; perfume from you and also from Amazon.com LLC this year. However, after I ran out of the bottle from Amazon.com LLC, I opened the one shipped from you. The bottle has something different, the bottom of the bottle from you does NOT have serial number--but the one from Amazon LLC has it. The smell from the bottle you shipped only last for 30 minutes and also different from previous one.  I doubted that you may ship fake product to me, and that is very very disappointing. We could provide the photo of the two bottles---they shall be totally the same! I wish this is your supplier that shipped pirated product to you, and we get it finally. Please let me know how to handle this problem.</li>
            <li> Very clean,light scent with a hint of fresh linen fragrance.this product will stay with you through out the day but not overpowering</li>
            <li> This perfume is so far one of the best i&#x27;ve ever got. It has a strong smell but at the same time it is elegant and it lasts all day long. You can wear it day or night.</li>
            <li> Absolutely this parfum. It is my favorite, I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love it, and every time I wear it I get so many compliments. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. My girlfriend had it on and I had to buy it! I was also VERY pleased with the purchase made on Amazon with this seller. Excellent transction. Shipped promptly and no flaws in product.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time!!! Product got to me very fast.  Well packaged and my wife was soooo happy. This was my first order from you and since this order I have placed another order for the lotion for my wife and it too got to me very fast. I will be back, but next time for me.</li>
            <li> The plastic covering the box was broken when I received it. The perfume was stuck to the box with a weird glue. I thought it was weird but maybe because of the heat the glue melted and got stuck on the perfume. Anyway this morning when pulling the cap off the perfume, the whole thing came apart!!! I think this perfume has been modified or something, but now I can&#x27;t return it for security reasons! This is not what a $77 perfume should look like!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells amazing. But when i received the bottle from Amazon.com, the plastic was broken and the perfume was stuck inside the box as if it was glued in there. The smell is exactly what it should be. However, it ONLY lasts maybe an hour at most. I&#x27;ve used this perfume at department stores and it always lasts all day. I don&#x27;t know if this is fake or what is wrong with it. But I can&#x27;t return it either. Pretty frustrated that I spent $80 on perfume and the smell doesnt last.  SHOULD have bought it from nordstrom or macy&#x27;s instead.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the \\&quot;Chloe\\&quot; perfume I received this time. Unfortunately, it is not real.  Everything - the perfume itself, the box, the package insert - is a bad imitation of Chloe. The fragrance lasts for 30 seconds and doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell the same as the real Chloe. I filed a formal complaint with the seller almost a week ago. No response. Will be looking for my money back from Amazon now. Stay away from this seller.</li>
            <li> Meeted expectations!!!! Well boxed, delivered on time, i received some perfume samples as well, and coupons. Great deal!!! :-D</li>
            <li> Crisp, clear, fresh, soapy floral. I definitely catch rose and white florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not your mother&#x27;s or grandmother&#x27;s Chloe. Nothing like the original but better for it, imo.</li>
            <li> This perfume is vmy new favorite now. Got it from a girlfriend for my birthday and i love it. I am very fussy about perfumes (been using Eternity by Calvin Klein for 10 yrs!) but this one catches my senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars cos its expensive $85 for 1.7ml...worth it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE my bottle of Chloe! The smell is so captivating! Genuine new bottle in box and shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many newer fragrances but my favorite is still Karl Lagerfelds&#x27;s Chloe.  Something magical happens when it mixes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Got this scent a couple years ago for christmas, as I usually try a new scent each year.  Turns out, EVERYWHERE I wore this, people were complimenting me asking what perfume I wear!  I was asked in elevators, meeting rooms, and parties!  Sure, it smells good to me, but the amount of compliments I&#x27;ve received while wearing this perfume is almost unbelievable.  I&#x27;m requesting a new bottle for Christmas this year!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but probably fake. The one from Sephora lasts for over a day, but this one fades within an hour and has a slight rubbing alcohol smell when first sprayed. Would rate one star, but added one because it still smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought from Amazon LLC so I figured I&#x27;d get the real deal, but unfortunately not</li>
            <li> I met this perfume when i was 19 in Australia and fallen in love in 2 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;smell&#x27;s so gorgeous... perfect!</li>
            <li> Very very very nice parfurm !!! The smell is so nice !!! I could smell from 500 milles.....&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for younger woman !!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! Bought it at Macy&#x27;s but Amazon seems to be providing the best deal and cheapest deal.</li>
            <li> I like it so much!! !my favorite!!! You should try!! but i got late!! :( i want to get lotion too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Heady, wonderful smell which men for some reason really, really like. I&#x27;m not complaining. My daughter also likes this fragrance, and she usually does not like any fragrances I use.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I&#x27;m going to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nothing like the Chloe I&#x27;ve bought in the past and I absolutley hate it and won&#x27;t use it!  What happened to the formula you used to use?  I got this as a gift for my birthday and am so disappointed with it, my sons have always liked this on me and we compared it to my old bottle and everyone knows it&#x27;s not the same. I&#x27;m not one to buy perfumes as they are too expensive so I wait for my birthday or Christmas to get it always hoping one of them will get it for me and they haven&#x27;t for about 3 yrs. so this yr when they asked what I wanted I actually told them and they sent for it for me and then I get this stuff that has no resemblance to scent it used to be.  Please can you help me straighten this out and can I please have the original scent if I send this back to you?</li>
            <li> Wife loves this perfume, and so do I! 😍</li>
            <li> container leaked, but I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this perfume and I loved it!! It cost her around $125.00 in the store. I decided to buy if for myself and saved money from buying through Amazon. I will purchase it again when I run out.....love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It&#x27;s just what I wanted and at a much better price than buying it in a department store!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Everything perfect! Smell, packaging, size, purchase, shipping awesome!</li>
            <li> The best smelling perfume ever!  Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> this is my second time by Chloe this fragrance is outstanding elect to be known the first bottle I bought a small bottle that I put the big bottle I don&#x27;t think I bought from the same company I&#x27;m not sure however this fragrance is awesome buy you some.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Chloe for years but now that the price is so high in retail stores, I cannot afford it. Specially for the 2.5 size. I was worried that It would be a counterfeit and not smell the same but when I smelled it, there was no difference. I am happy!</li>
            <li> Best gift ever! Such a fresh wonderful cologne, just right for all seasons.</li>
            <li> 100% legit was skeptical because it&#x27;s half the price but purchased from Amazon directly no third party and all is well. Did spray test and now 8 hours later I still smell Chloe scent and its same as my tester bottle from sephora</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back on forth on several fragrances and always come back to Cloe.  A definite yes.</li>
            <li> Delightful. Great bargain.</li>
            <li> It was excellent and it was delivered on time!! Thanks</li>
            <li> loved it. a better price than buying it at macys</li>
            <li> It starts out smelling like Chloe, but the scent dissipates much sooner than the Chloe I purchased at Macy&#x27;s. I spray this on my left arm and the one purchased at Macy&#x27;s on my right arm... a few hours later the scent was undetectable on my left arm and lasting on my right.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, excellent lasting power. Will definitely continue using.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and last all day!</li>
            <li> When I smelled it at the store it was 5/5 for me but after I got it, I think it&#x27;s more of a 4/5 smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think it&#x27;s good but not great compared to some out there. Having said that, we all know that fragrances are pretty subjective so go with what works for you. I still got compliments with it...&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I thought the packaging is cute...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is authentic parfume. It&#x27;s  fake one I can only smell for 5 minutes and then it&#x27;s gone no matter how and where I spray it. So disappointed it is better I get one from any store.</li>
            <li> Nice clean fresh scent.  First time I purchased but definitely will not be the last.  Have gotten many many compliments!</li>
            <li> My favorite parfum EVER!  We usually buy it at Saks for $110+, but can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!  It had original packaging, no damage and contents were of good quality.  Very happy - will buy AGAIN!</li>
            <li> One of my best friends started wearing this. It&#x27;s very distinctive even with me having no sense of smell. I couldn&#x27;t stand to be within 5 feet of her. I can triangulate her general location in the building now on scent alone. Not that she over applied it; the fragrance is just that rowdy. So rowdy in fact, I had to ask her what it was so I could warn other men to second guess themselves if they&#x27;re planning on purchasing this for their lady friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the other terrible reviews seem to be more concerned with whether or not they&#x27;re getting a counterfeit fragrance, completely glossing over the fact that this reeks. I find this disturbing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Liked it so much, ordered it for my mom.</li>
            <li> I cant complain,it was a gift for my gf and it came on time,just in time,good stuff</li>
            <li> Perfect. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Chloe New for Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5-Ounces&lt;br /&gt;ChloeChloe New for Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5-Ounces&lt;br /&gt;Chloe - very good</li>
            <li> Was not the real item very disappointed</li>
            <li> If you are thinking to get it.. just go ahead.. long lasting and beautiful scent.. I always feel good when I wear this perfume.. Go ladies and enjoy being more beautiful with this perfume</li>
            <li> While I Was in singapore, it seemed like this was THE scent of women everywhere there and i compltely fellll in love with it that everytime i went to ION on orchard road, i HAD to stop in and spray it on myself and keep going! it&#x27;s a great scent...very classy (if that can be bottled....) and lasts for hours. LOVE THE PERFUME!</li>
            <li> Seems watered down. I used to buy this scent from Amazon and the smell would linger on me for hours. I didn&#x27;t wear this scent for almost a year and decided to order it on here because I missed it--- I douse myself in it and it barely lasts 15 minutes. Highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> great product fast shiping</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because her sampler bottle was running low, and we both loved the smell of this perfume. Some people complain about receiving a fake product, but the product I received was genuine; it smells identical to the sampler she has and lasts just as long, without starting to smell nasty later on after application. Just make sure you buy it either directly from Amazon or from another seller and fulfilled (shipped) by Amazon if you want the real thing. So much cheaper than buying it at Ulta or Sephora; I got it for a bit more than half of what they wanted for a bottle of the same volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it smells like honey, lychees, and has a floral quality. Soft, yet confident. Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Subtitle, elegant perfume. One of the best on the market</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Its fresh and very feminine. It&#x27;s my goto perfume! It&#x27;s on the expensive side but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> You have to get it. Everybody will notice that sensual smell. Chloe for women is for you. Just get it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she loved it. I love the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> I love the Chloe parfum and bought it before several times at the Chloe shop.Before buying this on this shop, I read the terrible review. But I didn&#x27;t care so much. I regret not believing that review now.&lt;br /&gt;The delivered perfum smells totally different and so bad. I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this shop forever!!</li>
            <li> It was fake. The scent was watered down, didnt smell like the original at all. Extremley dissapointed especially after the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the price. This is a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Critic</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent everyone always compliments me on my smell. perfect for work, a date, girls night i just love it and never tire of the smell</li>
            <li> Chloe has a nice smell and after you had it on for a while you really cant smell it unless you snuff your clothes.  It not like the one you buy at Hudson, Macy or any perfume store.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I&#x27;ve expected,it smells just like some kind of soap after use it for a while.I think I&#x27;ll not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent I keep going back to.  So fresh and unique.  Very distinguishable.</li>
            <li> Note: Did NOT purchase from Amazon, purchased directly from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me tell you how I found this amazing scent.  I went to a fantastic Sephora where I spoke with a woman who was incredibly knowledgeable on scents.  I was looking for Valentina by Valentino, which unfortunately Sephora does not sell; however, that is how I found this gem.  I love perfume and I love the scent of fresh floral which Chloe delivers!  It is also very helpful if you know which scents/notes work best for your pH.  For me, Peony oil works VERY well with my skin type! Every parfum that uses peony (I&#x27;m sure there is a percentage that I am not aware of, it is just a common denominator I found) lasts all day on me.  Just 1 or 2 sprays and all day I smell of Chloe!  I even found that the next day the scent lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a shot, if you have a Sephora close to you ask them for a sample!  They will be more than happy to give you one, I actually didn&#x27;t know that they would, so I was pleasantly surprised!  Seriously, the woman at this Sephora was great :-)  Another scent you may enjoy if you like Chloe is Flora by Gucci.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly how it was described and I received it in two days.</li>
            <li> Its the real deal ladies! I bought the one that was sold and shipped from Amazon so I cant attest the one sold by third parties but the one from Amazon is perfect!    I compared the box and bottle to the one I purchased from Sephora for double the price and they were and exact match. The perfume is perfect! Im so excited to be able to get my favorite sent for half the price. My bf thinks Im insane because I am giddy over this. :)    For those of you who have never used Chloe before it is a powdery rose sent that is very feminine and sophisticated without begin overwhelming  and old lady smelling. It is a great perfume for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The perfume came quickly and exactly as described.  I get so many compliments on it!  I definitely recommend it and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I used to have this years ago and decided to purchase it via amazon. I was not disappointed at all. Chloe is fresh, clean, vibrant, and a lil spicy which will stay on you skin and clothes the entire day.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell and I pay half of the price compared to a department store. At first, I was scared to order here thinking it&#x27;s fake but I was wrong, it&#x27;s the same thing! 😄</li>
            <li> Perfume will smell different on everyone because of how it interacts with your body chemistry.  While it smelled a little better on the girl who recommended it to me, I&#x27;m still happy with how it smells on me.  Floral, light, with class.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s gonna love Santa for this</li>
            <li> Very please with my perfume</li>
            <li> I love Chloe! I have received tons of compliments, and I absolutely adore the fragrance. This was certainly money well spent!</li>
            <li> not authentic.smells bad.box is cheap .so as a&lt;br /&gt;bottle.</li>
            <li> My and my wife&#x27;s favorite scent. Great for any time of day. Highly recommend the Eau de parfum over the eau de toilette, plus it lingers far longer.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly the kind of perfum I usually like, but it will be perfect for some specific moments. I guess it is a matter of getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Small bottle just perfect for the purse or to take when traveling. Same wonderful Chloe fragrance and adorable bottle. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent. The product was just as described and the person I gave it to was very happy.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and I was kinda worried, I would receive a fake bottle of perfume. I&#x27;m glad to say I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s way cheaper to buy it from here then off of Sephora&#x27;s website. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance on a co worker and she told me she got it at Sephora for $90 for a small bottle ... I found it on Amazon at less of that pricey for the big bottle!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same perfume that is sold in dept stores. The scent doesn&#x27;t last. My old bottle from Macy&#x27;s would last all day. This one maybe an hour. The savings are great but unless you want the scent to last I would invest elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It happen to be fake but it came very close to it being real but I have a friend that knows all about and pointed it out to me that it is indeed a counterfeit. Anyone can tell easily by the brand imprinted on the silver bezel but unfortunately mine didn&#x27;t have it so I had a full refund.</li>
            <li> MET DESCRIPTION AND I GOT IT ON TIME I REALLY WAS SATISFY AND HAPPY IT WAS THE WAY THEY DESCRIBE IT! THANKS</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh smell. Long lasting. No need to use too much of it. I am extremely happy with this perfume!</li>
            <li> i use several Estee Lauder perfumes, but Chloe is my favorite.  I get lots of compliments when I wear Chloe.</li>
            <li> Our daughter wanted this and she is happy.  Just what she asked for.</li>
            <li> Amazing. The scent is very mild and last all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear that literally gets swoons from everyone. Strangers walk up to me to compliment how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;If I need something, I wear this perfume and I get it. Hallelujah.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting to come in the mail, but It def. surprised me, because I did like the perfume that got sent to me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents. I LOVE Chloe. I&#x27;ve only purchased it at department stores but I wanted to leave a review about the perfume here. It&#x27;s so feminine and sweet. I wear it to work, out to dinner, it&#x27;s definitely one of the scents I enjoy wearing often.</li>
            <li> This is fake and smells awful. Not even like Chloe. Do not waste your $!</li>
            <li> i love it! highly recommended</li>
            <li> THE WIFE LOVES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and everyone around me loves the way it smells.  I always get many compliments from everyone of much much they like the way I smell. Which in reality it&#x27;s this perfume.</li>
            <li> Very good, I very like it.</li>
            <li> not so strong smell!wonderful</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It&#x27;s not boring and very enjoyable. You only need to spray 2 times and it will last you throughout the entire day. Perfect find.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Always get compliments on it!!!</li>
            <li> great fragrance, classy.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent. I have been buying Chanel #5 which she loves, I&#x27;ve now added a new scent to add to my gift list</li>
            <li> Suspiciously like a knock off. I compared my original bottle side by side to this one. This one has the information printed directly onto the bottle itself on the bottom instead of the clear Coty label. The ink was smeary, and the last digits of the product id number were blocked out with gold marker. The cellophane in which the box was wrapped was *not* sealed.  The scent is not as strong, nor does it linger as long. More like toilet water than eau du parfum spray.  All of this leads me to believe that this may be a watered down version or a knock off. Will see if the top begins to tarnish as has my original silver plated one, or if it stays shiny over time.</li>
            <li> I hesitated ordering this perfume on line after reading the other reviews.  I received it, the packaging was perfect and the perfume was exactly what I wanted.  The smells lasts all day long.  I fell in love with the smell since my Mom wears it and couldn&#x27;t wait to get some for myself.  Once again Amazon came through with what I wanted and the best deal around.</li>
            <li> I got this item for my mom on her birthday and she is in love with the smell and so am I.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive my product as early as i did despite the date given to be delivered.  Loved being able to wear it for the weekend and got lots of compliments:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased and highly receommended.</li>
            <li> Yes, I will be smelling excellent thanks to this perfume. It smells exotic. This 2.5 oz is the most you can get and I am fine with that because it can come with me in my carry on luggage:) very high quality perfume that lasts for a long time. This is a very good price for a perfume that retails for $130 at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent of this and it made my eyes tear and made me choke!!! My wife gave it to someone who liked it, not a total loss...</li>
            <li> Just as I know and love it !</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have the fixation I was waiting for.</li>
            <li> This was NOT actual Chole perfume - the liquid in the bottle was much more of a yellow color and did not smell like Chole. I would have returned had I not instantly thrown the box away, I didn&#x27;t think I would be scammed. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chloe for a long time. I tried other fragrances but always go back to Chloe at the end.&lt;br /&gt;it has a clean scent to it that stays for hours. this is the first time that I buy it through amazon, I read some reviews about fake products and got a bit worried... but when I got the product I could see immediately that this is the real thing... the same smell and the same package, made in France.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells terrific.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. One of my students, first grader, said that I smelled pretty. Sweet!</li>
            <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
            <li> So... after reading countless reviews and initially being scared to death that i was being scammed (especially that returns werent allowed), I finally got my perfume in the mail. The plastic wasnt torn just loose, there was no glue and everything was fine. I checked the invoice and it said it was shipped with Amazon LLC so I took the review that mentioned that into consideration. Ive bought this perfume before at sephora (the price alone why i tried amazon) and the bottom of the box had a strange cut out of the barcode that I dont remember seeing on the other one i bought, admittedly i never checked either. However, the perfume seemed legit, stood fragrant for the whole day, (which is really good because i have a physically demanding job) and like the title says, if this IS a fake, they did a really great job, Lol. very happy</li>
            <li> It is very unique, crisp, light, perfect for summer.  There is nothing out there like this.</li>
            <li> it was a good Christmas present for my mother and she loved it</li>
            <li> this is a fake. the smell is nothing like what I tried on in department stores. DONT&#x27; BUY</li>
            <li> Ordered from fragrancenet.  Came sealed, with serial number coded onto the bottle, little Chloe insert, one spritz of the EDP is MORE than enough (as in the scent is strong vs being watered down).  Def not an imitation!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance right now it smells incredible I wear it well everyone asks me what I am wearing when I am working.</li>
            <li> This is not the original product. This is an imitation of the original Chloe and it smells horrible and very cheap. It actually gave me a headache. Im prone to migraines....... smell or types of light can trigger them and this smell certainly did.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes I have ever worn it&#x27;s just so expensive!  So I can&#x27;y buy it all the time.  But it lasts all day on you and I get many compliments</li>
            <li> Loved it and payed half the price I am so happy I will never buy from the retail stores again!!!!!!</li>
