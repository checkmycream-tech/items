            <li>thank you for a great buying experience!</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>This polish is great!</li>
            <li>its versatile and beautiful and looks great over ANY color.</li>
            <li>Great accent polish.</li>
            <li>Attractive way to add dimension to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I was able to find it again!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for a bit of understated sparkle.</li>
            <li>I loved this series of OPI nail polishes .</li>
            <li>OPI is always a good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful alone or as a top coat.</li>
            <li>The perfect glitter polish, Love it:)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>This is a great glitter nail polish that gives a nice coat of glitter without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this polish and get compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li>you own nail polish.</li>
            <li>One of my top 3 favorite glitters.</li>
            <li>Love this glittery polish.</li>
            <li>I love this shade...</li>
            <li>I used it by itself and it peeled off my nails, but on top of another color it stays well.</li>
            <li>I love this sparkle over another color or just by itself.  </li>
            <li>It looks awesome over pastels but also deep colors.</li>
            <li>Each one is more beautiful than the next</li>
            <li>The light grey layered with the glitter is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty on top of light colors and between squishy jelly polishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so delicate and the perfect color for a NYC ballet collection.  </li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear it without another color underneath, but I&#x27;m sure it would look pretty on its own.</li>
            <li>but instead, it&#x27;s more of a sparkly top coat for brightening a simple manicure.</li>
            <li>You will need 3 coats of the grey though to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>This was a special item at the time it was first released</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty, but don&#x27;t expect dense glitter coverage with this one....</li>
            <li>It was also cute over the top of my red and blue nail polish on the 4th of July to give a somewhat starry effect.</li>
            <li>but i guess it&#x27;s ok either way, but i was just hoping for something different.</li>
            <li>Hmmmmm, the larger &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; do not come off easily, even w/acetone polish remover.  </li>
            <li>, if you have a fine dotting tool, you can place the larger sizes of glitter manually for added effect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They dont seem to chip as fast either.</li>
            <li>There is a lot more silver glitter in this nail polish than I expected</li>
            <li>I think I would like this more if it was all one size of glitter or the other (preferably the finer of the two), though it&#x27;s a plus that the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up as many of the larger ones as the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Very light sparkles, so delicate and pretty.</li>
            <li>You spend a few dollars more at Ulta</li>
            <li>But they always have new collections out there, so if you haven&#x27;t tried OPI, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love this one so much because it is a delicate silver shimmer.</li>
            <li>and this one is so lovely and delicate.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle shimmer/glitter polish, but I wish it were easier to get the big glitters on the brush.</li>
            <li>Love the subtle shades.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not much of a fan of the big glitter chunks (aka &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34;).</li>

            <li> from photos on the same product but different seller, i thought it would be very concentrated with sparkles, and it could be just used as a base.</li>
            <li> You can use it over anything or just wear it plain.,</li>
            <li> Even after turning the bottle upside down it&#x27;s difficult to get the big pieces.</li>
            <li> Also a subtle way to wear glitter,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and hate the (1) color I received.</li>

            <li> One of my top 3 favorite glitters. I love this one so much because it is a delicate silver shimmer. It is so pretty on top of light colors and between squishy jelly polishes. I highly recommend this one because it isn&#x27;t a heavy glitter.</li>
            <li> The perfect glitter polish, Love it:)</li>
            <li> Took me years to discover OPI and I wish I had sooner. Dries fast, hard to the touch, slick and fun. I went online to buy the different colors that were part of the Ballet package they sold a year or two back. Love the subtle shades. But they always have new collections out there, so if you haven&#x27;t tried OPI, highly recommended. This is why the salons use it ... only I bring my fav color now myself.</li>
            <li> I think I would like this more if it was all one size of glitter or the other (preferably the finer of the two), though it&#x27;s a plus that the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up as many of the larger ones as the smaller ones. I do like that, if you have a fine dotting tool, you can place the larger sizes of glitter manually for added effect. Great accent polish.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle shimmer/glitter polish, but I wish it were easier to get the big glitters on the brush. Even after turning the bottle upside down it&#x27;s difficult to get the big pieces. It&#x27;s still pretty, but don&#x27;t expect dense glitter coverage with this one....it&#x27;s good for a bit of understated sparkle.</li>
            <li> Attractive way to add dimension to you own nail polish. Also a subtle way to wear glitter, In my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this glittery polish. So flattering to nails &amp; polish. You can use it over anything or just wear it plain.,</li>
            <li> This is a great glitter nail polish that gives a nice coat of glitter without being overwhelming. I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear it without another color underneath, but I&#x27;m sure it would look pretty on its own. I like to pair this with a couple coats of &amp;#34;My Pointe Exactly&amp;#34; underneath. It was also cute over the top of my red and blue nail polish on the 4th of July to give a somewhat starry effect. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this shade...its versatile and beautiful and looks great over ANY color. I tried it at the nail salon and had to have it. thank you for a great buying experience!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> According to the picture, thought I was going to receive the set of OPI NYC ballet shades \\&quot;collection\\&quot;, not just one of the shades.  Very disappointed and hate the (1) color I received.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this polish and get compliments every time I wear it! Great buy! You spend a few dollars more at Ulta</li>

            <li> A definite must have! It&#x27;s beautiful alone or as a top coat. I also got one for my mom as a gift.</li>
