            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mac Studio Finish Concealer for more than 10 years now, and I&#x27;m still impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>This is as perfect a concealer as I have found and a good value, so you can buy more than one shade if need be.</li>
            <li>Have always loved and used MAC cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>loved him very&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Saw good reviews that convinced me to try.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t cake and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing; it covers everything.</li>
            <li>The NW25 is a warm light-medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are 15 shades available in warm and cool tones, so I could find a perfect match.</li>
            <li>Small but great, works real good and blend through my skin.</li>
            <li>&amp; I think I will love it,</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>This concealer was perfect at concealing my very dark circles, which no other concealer I&#x27;ve found has ever been able to perfectly do.</li>
            <li>The fine lines show much more because of the dryness of it.</li>
            <li>I am asian and this product works great for me.i am sure i will order more of this.</li>
            <li>The coverage is more full and it is also easier to apply than a liquid concealer.</li>
            <li>I think it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it can wear of easily in the hot weather</li>
            <li>Originally I was after a concealer to be a shade lighter than my skin to help brighten the eyes area</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I have used so far.</li>
            <li>but i hope it worth the prize.</li>
            <li>cause it would get gone pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I use a concealer only to cover dark circles under my eyes and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colour NW25 is good for me, it has a bit of an orange tint to it and it seems to work well with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I received in time and I&#x27;m used to wear this make-up, so I really like it!</li>
            <li>so glad i can finally order this on line</li>
            <li>First Mac product im going to use.</li>
            <li>Tried it after i post my first review.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Color, attractive and natural and gentle under dark circles&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I tried using it under my eyes, but because I have very rosy cheeks, this doesn&#x27;t exactly match well with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the SPF, as I tan easily, so 15 minutes outdoors in the summer can result in untanned spots on my face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a brush you might need to warm it a little bit before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first MAC product and high end concealer</li>
            <li>I like this concealer and was lucky enough to pick the correct color the first time.</li>
            <li>I just think that a price is fair but should be less than in MAC Store, but it&#x27;s the same!!!</li>
            <li>there are better ones on the market for much less $&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I can just put a bit on my finger, put it under my eye and quickly blend it in with my fingers or a wet sponge.</li>
            <li>It blends seamlessly with skin, even without foundation.</li>
            <li>apparently this was delivered and then one of my daughter&#x27;s confiscated it...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce my dark circles.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone with dark spots/scars and blemishes!</li>
            <li> but when I actually tried a lighter shade on, it looked rather grey.</li>
            <li> I also find it a bit too dry for using under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Is NW25 the same color as what they show in the picture above, because it looks a little too dark.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from blemishes, freckles or dark circles that are hard to conceal, then I highly, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wanted a concealer that would stay where I put it and that would be heavy enough to cover a \\&quot;beauty mark\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> One downside is that it was a little bit smaller than I would have hoped but a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> It will cover acne, scars, and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,  item is to small, it is the size of a quarter and the concealer does not cover up as I expected.</li>
            <li> It is too dry and dark for a concealer...and very small amount....</li>
            <li> It also takes the rosiness out of my cheeks if I put a little on each one, on the days</li>
            <li> my face seems a little too flushed.</li>
            <li> The concealer comes in a practical little pot with no excess packaging.</li>
            <li> then it is as pictured ; i haven&#x27;t tried it yet but its small as a quarter</li>
            <li> I tried liquid concealers (not MAC) in the past and they just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> I got it for the inside area of my eyes by my nose and usually concealer seems to cake up for me there.</li>
            <li> I will tell you this though; when I use it on the very few pimples that I ever get.</li>
            <li> I also hate that it&#x27;s sooo expensive but in my opinion it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Mac make up you can never go wrong with.</li>
            <li> but I purchased the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> and i know now not to get this again unless i need it badly.</li>
            <li> A lil disappointed for the size</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product but it can wear of easily in the hot weather but it&#x27;s perfect for hiding blemishes</li>
            <li> Is NW25 the same color as what they show in the picture above, because it looks a little too dark. And its not giving me an option for a different color.&lt;br /&gt;(Rated cuz I had to) &amp; I think I will love it, just need to know about the color.</li>
            <li> Mac make up you can never go wrong with. This concealer was perfect at concealing my very dark circles, which no other concealer I&#x27;ve found has ever been able to perfectly do. If you suffer from blemishes, freckles or dark circles that are hard to conceal, then I highly, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Have always loved and used MAC cosmetics.  They are excellent in every aspect.</li>
            <li> I received in time and I&#x27;m used to wear this make-up, so I really like it! I just think that a price is fair but should be less than in MAC Store, but it&#x27;s the same!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, thanks. C. Payne</li>
            <li> this is not the color it says it is. very disappointed</li>
            <li> i purchased this product thinking it was going to bigger then it is as pictured ; i haven&#x27;t tried it yet but its small as a quarter ; i don&#x27;t know how anyone could use this as all over foundation cause it would get gone pretty quickly but i don&#x27;t think i paid 20 bucks for it maybe 16 and i know now not to get this again unless i need it badly.</li>
            <li> Good product but I purchased the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> I tried using it under my eyes, but because I have very rosy cheeks, this doesn&#x27;t exactly match well with the rest of my face. I get a bit of raccoon eyes. Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce my dark circles. I also find it a bit too dry for using under the eyes. The fine lines show much more because of the dryness of it. I will tell you this though; when I use it on the very few pimples that I ever get. It literally dries them up within a day or so! It also takes the rosiness out of my cheeks if I put a little on each one, on the days my face seems a little too flushed. Have been using it for years. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mac Studio Finish Concealer for more than 10 years now, and I&#x27;m still impressed by this product. I wanted a concealer that would stay where I put it and that would be heavy enough to cover a \\&quot;beauty mark\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t care for. I tried concealers in pots and tubes and wands from various cosmetic companies. I tried Dermablend. This is better. The Studio Finish Concealer can be applied with a brush, sponge, or finger. I use a sponge-tipped applicator to get it just where I want. It blends seamlessly with skin, even without foundation. It never cakes. There are 15 shades available in warm and cool tones, so I could find a perfect match. The NW25 is a warm light-medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is perfect and adheres well to skin. Lightweight yet opaque. It&#x27;s water-resistant (not water-proof) and fragrance-free. The concealer comes in a practical little pot with no excess packaging. The latch and hinge on the pot never break. It will cover acne, scars, and dark spots. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the SPF, as I tan easily, so 15 minutes outdoors in the summer can result in untanned spots on my face. The sunscreen is Octinoxate 5% and Titanium Dioxide 2%, for those who may be concerned about allergens. Each pot contains 7 grams (0.24 oz). This is as perfect a concealer as I have found and a good value, so you can buy more than one shade if need be.</li>
            <li> apparently this was delivered and then one of my daughter&#x27;s confiscated it...I guess i will just have to order another....love this product.</li>
            <li> I use a concealer only to cover dark circles under my eyes and this product is perfect. I tried liquid concealers (not MAC) in the past and they just didn&#x27;t cut it so I decided to try this cream concealer. I think it makes a huge difference. The coverage is more full and it is also easier to apply than a liquid concealer. I can just put a bit on my finger, put it under my eye and quickly blend it in with my fingers or a wet sponge. If you&#x27;re using a brush you might need to warm it a little bit before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colour NW25 is good for me, it has a bit of an orange tint to it and it seems to work well with dark circles under my eyes. Originally I was after a concealer to be a shade lighter than my skin to help brighten the eyes area but when I actually tried a lighter shade on, it looked rather grey. So if you can, try the shades before you buy one online but the product itself is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US shoppers, this product is sold for $17 on MAC website and in their stores so don&#x27;t overpay!!!</li>
            <li> so glad i can finally order this on line&lt;br /&gt;love it!!</li>
            <li> This concealer works great! I got it for the inside area of my eyes by my nose and usually concealer seems to cake up for me there. This doesn&#x27;t cake and I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this concealer and was lucky enough to pick the correct color the first time. Seems to last all day. Better than anything I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved him very&lt;br /&gt;Lasts&lt;br /&gt;Color, attractive and natural and gentle under dark circles&lt;br /&gt;But its price-Ghali&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mac</li>
            <li> Good product. Great for using to outline the brow area. However, go to Mac&#x27;s website and order. It&#x27;s much cheaper with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Just got it today. First Mac product im going to use. Saw good reviews that convinced me to try. Im going to start using  It today and see how it works for me. Follow up comments will be posted after results. A lil disappointed for the size but i hope it worth the prize. Amazon the best.    Tried it after i post my first review. Small but great, works real good and blend through my skin. I am asian and this product works great for me.i am sure i will order more of this. Any mac products.</li>
            <li> It is too dry and dark for a concealer...and very small amount....there are better ones on the market for much less $&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This was my first MAC product and high end concealer and I love it! The coverage is amazing; it covers everything. I have acne scars and redness and it is not noticeable at all when Im wearing this! One downside is that it was a little bit smaller than I would have hoped but a little bit does go a long way. I also hate that it&#x27;s sooo expensive but in my opinion it&#x27;s definitely worth it and I would highly recommend it to anyone with dark spots/scars and blemishes!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,  item is to small, it is the size of a quarter and the concealer does not cover up as I expected.</li>
