            <li>Love this shampoo for normal hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo, as I have heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li>But, for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for fine  curly hair.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the price, so I may use this as my \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; shampoo when I want my hair to look extra good</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I tries this shampoo after reading about it in Rachel Zoe&#x27;s new book and found it to be light &amp; pleasant for my fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Not only that, it seems like a lot more hair falls out.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated and foams well, so worth the price.</li>
            <li>I used this with the conditioner of the same line, and the conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li>I have gotten better results from a drugstore shampoo for a fourth of the price I paid for this.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product through Birchbox.</li>
            <li>I had been an avid Panteen user before this because I didn&#x27;t think that spending that much more money would really net me results.</li>
            <li>I purchased online this time after my first one ran out</li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li>Clean, light, lustrous hair without stripping or dry scalp.</li>
            <li>They were responsible , I really recommend you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kerastase products in the past (Chroma in the fuchsia bottle) and was hoping this product would help my fine hair have a bit more volume and shine however, this was not the case.  </li>
            <li>Remember this is only for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was using Kerastase Chroma Captive shampoo for colored hair and decided I would like the volume this one promised.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Too much emullison.  </li>
            <li>Took too much time to get it rinsed out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really think peoples hair types just vary.</li>
            <li>took awhile to ship, but feels like the real deal</li>
            <li>Expensive, but the best I have tried so far (and</li>
            <li>It says it is for fine long hair, which is what I have, so I was hoping it would make my hair thicker or fluffier or</li>
            <li>I have long (to my waist), fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than your typical smoothing shampoos, which can sometimes flatten.</li>
            <li>This product, while ridiculously expensive does give great results.</li>
            <li>I rotate this with a cheaper option to make it last longer, but it is really worth it to me</li>
            <li>This shampoo (I have the entire line) is essential in creating smooth, voluminous locks.</li>
            <li>I went back to the Kerstase Chroma Captive shampoo and still use the Cristalliste Conditioner</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clear shampoo and conditioner now for long strands and that seems to be working very well, opposed to this.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair that tends to be oily and is past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it was in my head until several friends told me my har was looking espically shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel a lot lighter and it does not dry my scalp out like a lot of the other shampoos.</li>

            <li> It also did not help detangle at all--something it does not advertise it does, but something that should be an integral part of any shampoo designed for long hair.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product, it provides great shine and softness to the hair, even in the worst hair day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of this shampoo because I always feel like I have to use a lot, and my hair feels dry after using this product</li>
            <li> She needed to wash her hair every day and use blow dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is definitely not worth the price (any price), and I would definitely never buy this product again.</li>

            <li> Instead, my hair was left feeling limp and kindof greasy.</li>
            <li> (I have fine strands, thick hair, dirty blonde, about halfway down my back).</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>

            <li> It did not smooth my hair--instead it weighed it down and made it almost greasy.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel limp.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair, striped it of any moisture.</li>
            <li> : this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had so much trouble finding shampoo that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try it and it completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible shampoo I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it fell flat.</li>

            <li> I have fine blonde hair that tends to be oily and is past my shoulders.  I was using Kerastase Chroma Captive shampoo for colored hair and decided I would like the volume this one promised.  I was very disappointed.  The shampoo dried out my hair and made it appear rough.  I even bought the Cristalliste Conditioner to go with it and it didn&#x27;t help enough to offset the dryness the shampoo caused.  Also, it seemed to affect my hair color and stripped it.  I went back to the Kerstase Chroma Captive shampoo and still use the Cristalliste Conditioner and they work great together.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo!! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have the perfect hair type for this product - fine and long. This shampoo (I have the entire line) is essential in creating smooth, voluminous locks.

            <li> I did buy this as I saw some good reviews on this. However, after spending so much on it, I was quite disappointed. When I use this product, it seems like it&#x27;s stripped my hair of all essential oils and vitamins. Not only that, it seems like a lot more hair falls out. I do use the conditioner for this as well and it makes my hair feel limp. For the money, it&#x27;s just not worth it. I have been using Clear shampoo and conditioner now for long strands and that seems to be working very well, opposed to this.</li>
            <li> There is a sudden upswing in using salictic acid in products for hair and skin- problem is I&#x27;m allergic- can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a good product cause it make my scalp itch horribly!  was going to throw it away- friend said they&#x27;d take it...</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible shampoo I have ever purchased. Dried out my hair, striped it of any moisture. Left it feeling course and brittle. AVOID!!! Stick to good brands like Shu Uemura!</li>

            <li> Too much emullison.  Took too much time to get it rinsed out of my hair.  Stripped the color from my hair way faster than non-sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li> Another great Kerastase product at a very fair price.  Buying health and beauty products on Amazon is the only way to go.  Works great!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product and it works well when used with the conditioner. Highly recommend for fine  curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, as I have heard such great things about it. Unfortunately it fell flat. Literally.

I used this with the conditioner of the same line, and the conditioner is okay. Bottom line: this is a waste of money.

            <li> I have had so much trouble finding shampoo that works for my hair. I have hair close to my waist and it gets so tangled and weighed down. This shampoo totally helps. It really makes my hair feel a lot lighter and it does not dry my scalp out like a lot of the other shampoos. It also does not make it greasy, which some have done as well. The only down fall is the cost. So spendy. But, for me it is worth it. I want to keep my hair gorgeous. I don&#x27;t know how people had such bad experiences.

            <li> I love this shampoo and for convenience/cost level I purchased online this time after my first one ran out I had gotten from salon. This was a totally different product - looked the same from the outside but when you opened the bottle it didn&#x27;t smell the same - I should have stopped there but I decided to try it and it completely dried out my hair. After doing some research I found out that buying from a salon dealer vs. going onto amazon or buying from grocery store is completely different and NOT WORTH the change in cost. I have now gone back to a salon that carries it and will continue to do so. I feel this is such an awful scam and when I went to the salon and mentioned this they said sadly it happens all the time and people are not getting what they purchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent Results! My mother loved it. Fine and oil hair. She needed to wash her hair every day and use blow dry. Her hair was damaged.&lt;br /&gt;With this shampoo and conditoner , she washes her hair every two days and her hair still keep the shine and better, no oil. She loved the combo kerastase (shampoo, conditioner and serum)</li>
