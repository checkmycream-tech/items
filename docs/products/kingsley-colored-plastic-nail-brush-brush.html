            <li>Great for mechanics.</li>

            <li>I love this nailbrush!  </li>
            <li>I liked NOTHING ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li>My buys think it is great fun to scrub their fingers in the bath!</li>
            <li>Maybe its just plastic, but good molding processes are not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li>Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The best fingernail brush so far.</li>
            <li>This one is close and I will buy one or two more.</li>
            <li>These are good, strong brushes that clean out all kinds of dirt and grime.</li>
            <li>; I thought I would get more than one brush for the price...wish I&#x27;d had option to choose color, too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an ok brush.  </li>
            <li>I only give the item 4 stars because I wish you could choose your color, but I&#x27;m very happy with the color they gave me.</li>
            <li>I had one just like it and needed another, so I&#x27;m glad to have found these.</li>
            <li>This is a nice nail brush with a unique top nail brush.</li>
            <li>Simply the best design to really clean those nails.</li>
            <li>Work great, two row of brushes clean very well.</li>
            <li>I know they hold up, and I was glad to find them available.  </li>
            <li>I was happy when I received the natural color by chance.</li>
            <li>These little brushes are great for scrubbing all that good dirt out from under your nails.  </li>
            <li>I love having clean hands and nails.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased a Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail Brush which I keep on the sink, also for easy access.  </li>
            <li>but as it turns out, this is a pretty nice one.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to choose the colors that are available, either.  </li>
            <li>I bought several, wrapped each with a bar of good gardener&#x27;s soap, and gifted my gardening friends as the season got underway.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>These are cheap and they don&#x27;t clean your nails.</li>
            <li>My nails have never looked better and if I wasn&#x27;t married</li>
            <li>it - chicks dig clean fingernails.</li>
            <li>Great little nail brush with firm bristles perfect for cleaning under your nails.</li>
            <li>mine arrived was clear and not at all nice looking........</li>
            <li>Color selection is just fun.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck with a cheap plastic white brush.</li>
            <li>but when I received them they was a brush with no little brush on top.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the top of the brush get deep under the nails to really get your fingernails clean.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So, to be honest, I thought I was buying all 5 nail brushes for this price (My fault, i did not read carefully)</li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>the bristles are quite soft, which is nice for the larger brush and getting grime off your hands.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend these fingernail brushes to improve your relationships with women.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for another.</li>
            <li>Really gets the grease out from under your fingernails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It showed it had the little brushes on top when I ordered them as you see in the picture</li>
            <li>The brushes are ok, but for some reason all the bristles turn very dark</li>
            <li>I put this on a shelf in the shower for easy access, as I did with my last one, (different brand).  </li>
            <li>The brush is made exactly like the one I lost except for one thing: the smaller brush on top is not as hard as I would like.  </li>
            <li>since plastic is clear - it&#x27;s all visible but we can&#x27;t do anything about</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles a soft and work well with longer nails.</li>
            <li>That means you have to angle your fingers a few millimeters to clean under your nails.</li>
            <li>That single row of bristles on the back is angled just so, and if you bend your fingers under and run your nails back and forth, those bristles get right under your nails (and mine are pretty short) and leave no trace of dirt.  </li>
            <li>They last pretty long...</li>
            <li>The brush on the back of the handle is too far away from the handle.</li>
            <li>cannot go wrong; if you need them for work or for your shop they WILL disappear because they are really nice.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Gets under the nails and all around.  I hope they work this will a year from now. Tom</li>
            <li> The nail side of the brush could and should be stronger.  I&#x27;m in the garden every day this time of year and found myself spending just as much time trying to clean my nails as it took for me to get them dirty!  There&#x27;s no way to choose the colors that are available, either.  I ordered 3, and got three different colors.</li>
            <li> The brush is made exactly like the one I lost except for one thing: the smaller brush on top is not as hard as I would like.  Except for that, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> The best fingernail brush so far. I wish the single row of bristles were a little closer to the plastic. I had the best brush for 20 years and have yet to find a comparable one. This one is close and I will buy one or two more.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - chicks dig clean fingernails. Since getting these brushes, I keep getting compliments from women of all ages. These are good, strong brushes that clean out all kinds of dirt and grime. My nails have never looked better and if I wasn&#x27;t married I&#x27;d have a date every night. I really recommend these fingernail brushes to improve your relationships with women.</li>
            <li> Made in Tiawan (remember when it was  Formosa?) Very good quality fingernail brush.  This one will last a while.  Hey! Maybe its just plastic, but good molding processes are not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li> These little brushes are great for scrubbing all that good dirt out from under your nails.  Color selection is just fun.  That single row of bristles on the back is angled just so, and if you bend your fingers under and run your nails back and forth, those bristles get right under your nails (and mine are pretty short) and leave no trace of dirt.  I&#x27;ve owned one just like it for years, so I know they hold up, and I was glad to find them available.  I bought several, wrapped each with a bar of good gardener&#x27;s soap, and gifted my gardening friends as the season got underway.  Brought some smiles!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but the bristles are too soft and the angle of the nail bristles is awkward.  I ordered a different brush to replace it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush !!! My buys think it is great fun to scrub their fingers in the bath!</li>
            <li> So, to be honest, I thought I was buying all 5 nail brushes for this price (My fault, i did not read carefully) but as it turns out, this is a pretty nice one. So far, so good. But I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for another.</li>
            <li> Expensive; I thought I would get more than one brush for the price...wish I&#x27;d had option to choose color, too.</li>
            <li> Over priced JUNK! The add is written to fool you too! I liked NOTHING ABOUT IT. I would have sent it back but the box got thrown away.</li>
            <li> Soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Totally misrepresented</li>
            <li> thought i bought multiple pieces, ended up being only one. oh well. it&#x27;s starting to turn black at tips (ones inserted into the body) - since plastic is clear - it&#x27;s all visible but we can&#x27;t do anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(hey amazon! what&#x27;s with the minimum words requirement for the reviews! I wrote everything I needed to MINUS ONE word and you won&#x27;t let me publish it??? LAME!)</li>
            <li> these nail brushes are excellent quality! cannot go wrong; if you need them for work or for your shop they WILL disappear because they are really nice.</li>
            <li> Good brush for cleaning under fingernails.  It is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok brush.  the bristles are quite soft, which is nice for the larger brush and getting grime off your hands.  the smaller brush for nails works, but it is a bit difficult to get under the nails especially in the corners because of how soft the bristles are.</li>
            <li> Simply the best design to really clean those nails. One side is slightly angled which makes all the difference! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Received a white brush that was very different from what was pictured and described. The brand name is the same. I thought it was a fluke, and was told by an Amazon customer service agent to re-order with confidence. The second brush was the same. Really a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Exactl what I was looking for in a nail brusk</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this nailbrush!  Sorry I didn&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li> Work great, two row of brushes clean very well.</li>
            <li> these are perfect stocking stuffers!  I love having clean hands and nails.  I can&#x27;t imagine life without them.  They last pretty long...I think it would be good to change them out ever 6 months or as needed.</li>
            <li> Great little nail brush with firm bristles perfect for cleaning under your nails. I was happy when I received the natural color by chance. I only give the item 4 stars because I wish you could choose your color, but I&#x27;m very happy with the color they gave me.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a while back.  They  are wonderful.  When these wear out, I will purchase these again.  I have these in the kitchen, bathroom and outside (yard work).</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok, but for some reason all the bristles turn very dark</li>
            <li> Not colored....mine arrived was clear and not at all nice looking........</li>
            <li> This is a nice nail brush with a unique top nail brush. The bristles a soft and work well with longer nails.</li>
            <li> I put this on a shelf in the shower for easy access, as I did with my last one, (different brand).  In a couple of weeks it turned black with mildew and I had to throw it out.  That never happened to me before.  I also purchased a Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail Brush which I keep on the sink, also for easy access.  It&#x27;s perfect!  I would not buy the Kingsley again, but I will stick with the Tweezerrman.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Bought these for our gardening team here at work.  The bristles on the top of the brush get deep under the nails to really get your fingernails clean.  Can only find regular nail brushes locally without the slanted bristles.  Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The brush on the back of the handle is too far away from the handle. That means you have to angle your fingers a few millimeters to clean under your nails. I had better luck with a cheap plastic white brush.</li>
            <li> Not as stiff as I expected the bristles to be.  But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and they don&#x27;t clean your nails. I sent them back. It showed it had the little brushes on top when I ordered them as you see in the picture but when I received them they was a brush with no little brush on top.  Amazon needs to change the picture because your not getting what it shows.</li>
            <li> Really gets the grease out from under your fingernails. Great for mechanics.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for.  I had one just like it and needed another, so I&#x27;m glad to have found these.</li>
            <li> Item shipped was not the one described in the picture.  Shipped a single sided nail brush.</li>
