            <li>Proactive works to prevent acne and you have to use it daily for best results.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It scrubs better than both neutrogena acne wash and st Ives acne scrub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of sebhorric dermatitis/ excema where my pores become clogged.</li>
            <li>Not as many over the counter options are available for body as there is for faces.</li>
            <li>Wakes me up with the refreshing clean minty smell.</li>
            <li>This works great, is very effective in keeping skin clear &amp; does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li>My daughter uses the Deep Cleansing wash more than anything else, and we are very pleased to find this available by itself.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re already using this product, I would recommend you stop right away!</li>
            <li>Good for a deep cleansing wash in the shower..</li>
            <li>What worked best is spraying my back with 90% rubbing alcohol several times a day or whenever I got a chance  and sun bathing  </li>
            <li>Screw top with no pump or any other way to easily get the toothpaste consistency scrub out.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve tried many products, topical solutions and nothing works as well as this product.</li>
            <li>funny thank goodness.</li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>This cleanser REALLY works.</li>
            <li>but whoa, it really smells it.</li>
            <li>I love how I can feel the medication working down in my pores.</li>
            <li>Decent value for a product that works well.  </li>
            <li>would not buy again, has pretty much the same ingredients as over the counter acne medications, which are much cheaper in price.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend can&#x27;t live without it..</li>
            <li>Cannot get enough of this stuff...have reviewed it so much already.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my acne went away completely.</li>
            <li>I order this for my husband, he has sensitive skin that is prone to acne</li>
            <li>The deep cleaning wash has an abrasive grainy texture which I really like.</li>
            <li>and I am over 50 years old.</li>
            <li>old daughter.</li>
            <li>Face was breaking out with little red pimples and cleared it up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the 3step system before and it worked amazing, but I was pretty disappointed with this body wash.</li>
            <li>You only need a little to cover a large area.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Proactive does work, but only if you use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Proactive is too gentle for my tough skin</li>
            <li> and it will be even harder to get rid of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but no irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> and this makes any product money well spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick blue paste with microbeads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have typical &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But these little bottles is how they get u to keep buying their stuff which dont work that well for everybody.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was too harsh of a chemical</li>
            <li> If you all together try to stop using it, your acne will come back way worse than before</li>
            <li> However, I stopped using this product for about a week and in that small period of time, my acne came back and it was 10x worse than before.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because I thought that the brand was all about false advertising.</li>
            <li> I never had bad acne, I just got a few pimples on my chest here and there.</li>
            <li> But, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teen  has terrible breakouts on her forehead.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but nothing else that I have tried works.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and it smells weird.</li>
            <li> Because I was desperate, I bought another bottle in attempt to get ride of all the nasty pimples.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My girlfriend can&#x27;t live without it..great product</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a sample from Proactiv. Tried it and was wowed by it, its very refreshing and has cleared my acne by about 98%. I use it every morning! Wakes me up with the refreshing clean minty smell. I love how I can feel the medication working down in my pores. I hope Proactiv never gets rid of this one.</li>
            <li> Decent value for a product that works well.  Not as many over the counter options are available for body as there is for faces.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the Deep Cleansing wash more than anything else, and we are very pleased to find this available by itself. This works great, is very effective in keeping skin clear &amp; does not dry out your skin. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised, and works great.</li>
            <li> Cannot get enough of this stuff...have reviewed it so much already.</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly,thanks . It is a very good deal</li>
            <li> Use this every day in the shower.  Great to remove oils and sweat from face or body.</li>
            <li> would not buy again, has pretty much the same ingredients as over the counter acne medications, which are much cheaper in price. waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was too harsh of a chemical</li>
            <li> I tried it just now and it felt like the best shower I&#x27;ve ever took.</li>
            <li> Please do not use proactive products!!! I never had bad acne, I just got a few pimples on my chest here and there. After using this product, my acne went away completely. However, I stopped using this product for about a week and in that small period of time, my acne came back and it was 10x worse than before. Because I was desperate, I bought another bottle in attempt to get ride of all the nasty pimples. But, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactive does work, but only if you use it every single day. If you skip a day, you will break out. If you all together try to stop using it, your acne will come back way worse than before and it will be even harder to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already using this product, I would recommend you stop right away!</li>
            <li> I was looking for the bigger bottle of Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash</li>
            <li> This cleanser REALLY works. My teen  has terrible breakouts on her forehead. Proactive is the only product that clears her acne.</li>
            <li> Works great. Any idea where I can get the body lotion?</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but no irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> I order this for my husband, he has sensitive skin that is prone to acne and we&#x27;ve tried many products, topical solutions and nothing works as well as this product. My husband loves it, it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and even though it&#x27;s high priced, you get what you pay for, if he&#x27;s happy then I&#x27;m happy, besides his skin looks much better and this makes any product money well spent.</li>
            <li> Proactive works to prevent acne and you have to use it daily for best results.The deep cleaning wash has an abrasive grainy texture which I really like. This product is helpful in the shower to use on your chest or back in addition to your face. It is expensive but nothing else that I have tried works. I have had acne since I was a teenager and I am over 50 years old. I am happy there is a product that can control my acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li> Cleaned up my sons acne on his back, I will buy again</li>
            <li> Good for a deep cleansing wash in the shower.. Its doesn&#x27;t  effect the rest of your routine.</li>
            <li> Screw top with no pump or any other way to easily get the toothpaste consistency scrub out. It also has an odor I do not care for. I know it&#x27;s medicated but whoa, it really smells it. My wife said that it doesn&#x27;t make me smell funny thank goodness. It is very gritty. I don&#x27;t personally see any difference and I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great :)</li>
            <li> I use this as a face wash and it is awesome. It lasts a lot longer than the smaller facial cleanser which is part of the 3 step system and saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for the acne on my back.  What worked best is spraying my back with 90% rubbing alcohol several times a day or whenever I got a chance  and sun bathing  Proactive actually didn&#x27;t help at all  It didn&#x27;t even lather</li>
            <li> Great deal, husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with the pump. For the price it should come with one. Works and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  Good price, too!</li>
            <li> This really does work! And I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Works great!!  Bought it for my 9 yr. old daughter. Face was breaking out with little red pimples and cleared it up quickly. Once a day use works great.</li>
            <li> Good for my skin. If u have an oily skin, this profuct is good for u</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product. Very satisfied with ordering &amp; delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I have noticed a difference on my skin. I was very skeptical at first because I thought that the brand was all about false advertising. I was wrong. It&#x27;s a thick blue paste with microbeads. You only need a little to cover a large area.  It scrubs better than both neutrogena acne wash and st Ives acne scrub. My skin is improving. I don&#x27;t have typical &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s more of sebhorric dermatitis/ excema where my pores become clogged.</li>
            <li> PROACTIV IS THE BEST LINE OF SKIN PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO DATE.  THEY SIMPLY WORK !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3step system before and it worked amazing, but I was pretty disappointed with this body wash. It didn&#x27;t help at all after 3 weeks of using it I saw NO difference and it smells weird.</li>
            <li> proactive is overrated imo but the wash is Ok. Def overpriced but this 90 day bottle should be the 30 day and the 90 day should be bigger. But these little bottles is how they get u to keep buying their stuff which dont work that well for everybody. Proactive is too gentle for my tough skin</li>
