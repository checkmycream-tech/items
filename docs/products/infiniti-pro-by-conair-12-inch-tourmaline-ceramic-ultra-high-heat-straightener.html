            <li>Amazon is amazing with their customer service, so if you would happen to get a defective one (plates don&#x27;t align or whatever) you won&#x27;t need to worry.</li>
            <li>Mine also came with the heat protective cover/storing case, which is handy.</li>

            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my needs (short hair, not curly).</li>
            <li>I and even going to buy more to give as gifts for friends.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase any more Conair products.</li>
            <li>I broke my last pair of this size and these were a great replacement! :)</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>So glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>so I could straighten more of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>Just got the Conair Infiniti and i just LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>this iron does that,  and more</li>
            <li>all smiles :).</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase, so far so good!</li>
            <li>The flat iron is perfect!</li>
            <li>Very sweet design on it too :)  </li>
            <li>Easy on/off button&lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to put away</li>
            <li>It heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had almost given up on them, but when I turned them down to 419 degrees, it was perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I would have preferred it go lower, since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>Heats up in seconds and works great on short hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair and can get close to the root which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had the Conair Infiniti iron in the 1&amp;#34;, and enjoy it for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for short hair or getting in close to roots.  </li>
            <li>Such a great tool, I bought another for my mom.</li>
            <li>4 months later still works great according to her.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for my new short hair!</li>
            <li>The half inch gets really close to the scalp and is great for styling, but what I love most is</li>
            <li>Amazon will make it right!</li>
            <li>It makes styling my short do nice and easy...</li>
            <li>Gives my kitchen a clean fresh pressed look.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take any effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to do the front and top and can&#x27;t get it too close to my ears.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I have many high end brands.  </li>
            <li>Just received my flat iron.. couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I dont know why, but I enjoy collecting flat irons and blow dryers to see what kind of results they will produce.  </li>
            <li>By the way i never wrote a review on this site, it&#x27;s serious LOL &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Fast heat-up and super smooth plates.</li>
            <li>I have fine, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I use the lowest heat setting and I have very thick curly hair and this works perfect and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, but its fine and really thick, I have used the most excpensive irons before and I by far like this one the best!  </li>
            <li>Very handy, thin, different temperatures available, gets warm very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>All I have to do is keep a fresh trim</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, I like it</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to any one, and the price was right as well.</li>
            <li>A quick search on Amazon for Conair (love their products), and minutes later it was on order.</li>
            <li>Two things that would make this iron pretty perfect: I wish the exterior didn&#x27;t get as hot as it does, but also keep in mind the high temp I need to use on it because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist that has purchased several 1/2 inch flat irons, some priced over $100, this straightener is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve purchased for the price!</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised that my hair got so straight and stayed that way (mostly) through a night of sweaty dancing.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me get my hair done quick.  </li>
            <li>Next, make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair or protective oil before ironing and the day after because the day after you use the iron (and this goes for most irons), your hair will look unhealthy,</li>
            <li>This is such a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I get gorgeous straight hair and can even play with other styles like curling and beach waves with it as well.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how it works on thicker hair at higher temperatures.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using the highest setting when I first got this straightener because I thought of Conair as a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand which would need to be turned all the way up to work.</li>
            <li>and I get the items so fast!</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews might cause you to be skeptical, but no item is ever 100% perfect.</li>
            <li>, it does get really hot.</li>
            <li>This iron does a great job straightening my very coarse hair and also gets close enough to get the roots really straight too.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>I love this Conair flat iron.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot really fast and does wonders on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does and very well.</li>
            <li>With the right heat protecting spray this does wonders for smoothing out hair that is normally frizzy and/or puffy.</li>
            <li>It has different heat settings and it&#x27;s easy to turn on/off and see what temp you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>just overall easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair super straight and soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great 1/2 inch flat iron, hard to find a full size, not mini/travel size one.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair, it works great, as good as a  very expensive flat irons..</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>a CHEAP SOLUTION FOR SHORT HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Heats  fast too.</li>
            <li>- I got the pink one :)</li>
            <li>really got my hair bone straight from  root to tips.</li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and shiny as if I had a relaxer.</li>
            <li>It really saves money</li>
            <li>My curly hair is now stick straight</li>
            <li>and I really like to look at these before purchase.  </li>
            <li>Pluged it in and it heated up so fast</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair, so I wanted to use the iron to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and just wanted a shorter cut and not so much a &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; style.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, tight curls.</li>
            <li>Straightening my hair is so much more easier, the thin plate makes it easy to style your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves even my clients whos hair is natural bone straight as if they have a relaxer!</li>
            <li>Not too hot, never burn myself, the cord does not twist (that was a problem with my old one);</li>
            <li>I was looking for a slim flat iron to use for hard to get to short hair (like around the face) and it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li>..obviously the high heat.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li>I also wish the handle was a little more streamlined</li>
            <li>The kind that hardly move when you shake your head.</li>
            <li>Have a short cut and wanted to maintain a fresh salon look.</li>
            <li>It especially helps get my parting right.</li>
            <li>But I also enjoy the wavy curls on occasion and the 1&amp;#34; was a little too large for the length of my hair to give me that look.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it for the rest of my hair as well (I have long hair), just quickly going over some areas that need fixing.</li>
            <li>All the new terms to prevent dryness and damage.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that can get down to the root and that was light to replace my very first flat iron.</li>
            <li>Some of the very ends of my hair weren&#x27;t curled properly (user issue) but all I did with those was take that part and curl it under with the very end of the iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always so hard to select a good flat iron..</li>
            <li>I only heat it up to 390 and that&#x27;s plenty hot for me</li>
            <li>the settings are hot enough to curl my hair,  and not burn it.  </li>
            <li>It works better than some of the more expensive flat</li>
            <li>was equivalent to my higher priced flat iron</li>
            <li>May be good  for personal use, no good  for a  professional.</li>
            <li>a straightener and my 1 inch flat iron wasn&#x27;t going to work on my super short hair</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product but the temperature increments are weird.</li>
            <li>I cut off my waist-length hair to a pixie cut and because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t touched my old chi hair straightener since this arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional stylist...</li>
            <li>What a complete piece of rubbish......</li>
            <li>It straight the short hair!!</li>
            <li>Takes multiple passes to get straight hair.</li>
            <li>The curls look absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>It has made it MUCH ezier to flatten my bangs and the back part of my hair in a snap.  </li>
            <li>The plates are smooth an narrow.</li>
            <li>So confusing which one will be the better selection..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not all that surprised).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we all have different hair that responds better or worse to various flat irons</li>
            <li>Love the pink and is a sturdy product that seems like it will last long without any complaints</li>
            <li>I really like that there is a grip on the tip of the flat iron that allows for a tighter press on the hair.</li>
            <li>This one is full length making it a little easier to handle.  </li>
            <li>Oh, &amp; what girl doesn&#x27;t like pink ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already bought a new one from a different maker</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and holds on to the extra short hair at my neck amd ears (I have a pixie cut).</li>
            <li>The auto shut of and stand are a major plus too.  </li>
            <li>my hair is really shiny after I use it and is still straight the next morning meaning I have to use it less</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give it five stars because you need to  hold the iron as hard as possible to make sure it closes (presses) properly.  </li>
            <li>The plates did not closed evenly.</li>
            <li>Having short hair, I NEEDED the 1/2&amp;#34; width &#x27;blade&#x27; ...and the &#x27;handle&#x27; is longer than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I am African-American and just recently cut all of my hair off and went natural.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot enough to straighten 4a hair however it&#x27;s no higher end type that you would buy at folica.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron died!!  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased it to flat iron my edges because I am natural and my edges are frizzy and puffy often.  </li>
            <li>The size and shape of it were hard for me to find in the more expensive brands, but this absolutely fit the bill in order to curl and spike my short hair and even my sides which are very short.</li>
            <li>I had only seen the narrow width offered in more expensive brands and my hair is not difficult enough to justify that expense.</li>

            <li> May sure you use a heat protecting spray on your hair before use!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Amazon is amazing with their customer service, so if you would happen to get a defective one (plates don&#x27;t align or whatever) you won&#x27;t need to worry.</li>
            <li> Mine also came with the heat protective cover/storing case, which is handy.</li>

            <li> I broke my last pair of this size and these were a great replacement! :)</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> So glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> so I could straighten more of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Just got the Conair Infiniti and i just LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> this iron does that,  and more</li>
            <li> all smiles :).</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the purchase, so far so good!</li>
            <li> The flat iron is perfect!</li>
            <li> Very sweet design on it too :)  </li>
            <li> Easy on/off button&lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to put away</li>
            <li> It heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on them, but when I turned them down to 419 degrees, it was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it go lower, since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds and works great on short hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair and can get close to the root which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had the Conair Infiniti iron in the 1&amp;#34;, and enjoy it for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for short hair or getting in close to roots.  </li>
            <li> Such a great tool, I bought another for my mom.</li>
            <li> 4 months later still works great according to her.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my new short hair!</li>
            <li> The half inch gets really close to the scalp and is great for styling, but what I love most is</li>
            <li> Amazon will make it right!</li>
            <li> It makes styling my short do nice and easy...</li>
            <li> Gives my kitchen a clean fresh pressed look.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take any effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only able to do the front and top and can&#x27;t get it too close to my ears.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I have many high end brands.  </li>
            <li> Just received my flat iron.. couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I dont know why, but I enjoy collecting flat irons and blow dryers to see what kind of results they will produce.  </li>
            <li> By the way i never wrote a review on this site, it&#x27;s serious LOL &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fast heat-up and super smooth plates.</li>
            <li> I have fine, mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I use the lowest heat setting and I have very thick curly hair and this works perfect and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but its fine and really thick, I have used the most excpensive irons before and I by far like this one the best!  </li>
            <li> Very handy, thin, different temperatures available, gets warm very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is keep a fresh trim</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, I like it</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to any one, and the price was right as well.</li>
            <li> A quick search on Amazon for Conair (love their products), and minutes later it was on order.</li>
            <li> Two things that would make this iron pretty perfect: I wish the exterior didn&#x27;t get as hot as it does, but also keep in mind the high temp I need to use on it because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist that has purchased several 1/2 inch flat irons, some priced over $100, this straightener is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve purchased for the price!</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised that my hair got so straight and stayed that way (mostly) through a night of sweaty dancing.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me get my hair done quick.  </li>
            <li> Next, make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair or protective oil before ironing and the day after because the day after you use the iron (and this goes for most irons), your hair will look unhealthy,</li>
            <li> This is such a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I get gorgeous straight hair and can even play with other styles like curling and beach waves with it as well.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how it works on thicker hair at higher temperatures.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using the highest setting when I first got this straightener because I thought of Conair as a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand which would need to be turned all the way up to work.</li>
            <li> and I get the items so fast!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews might cause you to be skeptical, but no item is ever 100% perfect.</li>
            <li> , it does get really hot.</li>
            <li> This iron does a great job straightening my very coarse hair and also gets close enough to get the roots really straight too.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair flat iron.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot really fast and does wonders on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does and very well.</li>
            <li> With the right heat protecting spray this does wonders for smoothing out hair that is normally frizzy and/or puffy.</li>
            <li> It has different heat settings and it&#x27;s easy to turn on/off and see what temp you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> just overall easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair super straight and soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great 1/2 inch flat iron, hard to find a full size, not mini/travel size one.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair, it works great, as good as a  very expensive flat irons..</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> a CHEAP SOLUTION FOR SHORT HAIR.  </li>
            <li> Heats  fast too.</li>
            <li> - I got the pink one :)</li>
            <li> really got my hair bone straight from  root to tips.</li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and shiny as if I had a relaxer.</li>
            <li> It really saves money</li>
            <li> My curly hair is now stick straight</li>
            <li> and I really like to look at these before purchase.  </li>
            <li> Pluged it in and it heated up so fast</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair, so I wanted to use the iron to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and just wanted a shorter cut and not so much a &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; style.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, tight curls.</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair is so much more easier, the thin plate makes it easy to style your hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves even my clients whos hair is natural bone straight as if they have a relaxer!</li>
            <li> Not too hot, never burn myself, the cord does not twist (that was a problem with my old one);</li>
            <li> I was looking for a slim flat iron to use for hard to get to short hair (like around the face) and it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> ..obviously the high heat.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li> I also wish the handle was a little more streamlined</li>
            <li> The kind that hardly move when you shake your head.</li>
            <li> Have a short cut and wanted to maintain a fresh salon look.</li>
            <li> It especially helps get my parting right.</li>
            <li> But I also enjoy the wavy curls on occasion and the 1&amp;#34; was a little too large for the length of my hair to give me that look.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it for the rest of my hair as well (I have long hair), just quickly going over some areas that need fixing.</li>
            <li> All the new terms to prevent dryness and damage.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that can get down to the root and that was light to replace my very first flat iron.</li>
            <li> Some of the very ends of my hair weren&#x27;t curled properly (user issue) but all I did with those was take that part and curl it under with the very end of the iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always so hard to select a good flat iron..</li>
            <li> I only heat it up to 390 and that&#x27;s plenty hot for me</li>
            <li> the settings are hot enough to curl my hair,  and not burn it.  </li>
            <li> It works better than some of the more expensive flat</li>
            <li> was equivalent to my higher priced flat iron</li>
            <li> May be good  for personal use, no good  for a  professional.</li>
            <li> a straightener and my 1 inch flat iron wasn&#x27;t going to work on my super short hair</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product but the temperature increments are weird.</li>
            <li> I cut off my waist-length hair to a pixie cut and because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t touched my old chi hair straightener since this arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist...</li>
            <li> What a complete piece of rubbish......</li>
            <li> It straight the short hair!!</li>
            <li> Takes multiple passes to get straight hair.</li>
            <li> The curls look absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> It has made it MUCH ezier to flatten my bangs and the back part of my hair in a snap.  </li>
            <li> The plates are smooth an narrow.</li>
            <li> So confusing which one will be the better selection..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that surprised).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we all have different hair that responds better or worse to various flat irons</li>
            <li> Love the pink and is a sturdy product that seems like it will last long without any complaints</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a grip on the tip of the flat iron that allows for a tighter press on the hair.</li>
            <li> This one is full length making it a little easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> Oh, &amp; what girl doesn&#x27;t like pink ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought a new one from a different maker</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and holds on to the extra short hair at my neck amd ears (I have a pixie cut).</li>
            <li> The auto shut of and stand are a major plus too.  </li>
            <li> my hair is really shiny after I use it and is still straight the next morning meaning I have to use it less</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give it five stars because you need to  hold the iron as hard as possible to make sure it closes (presses) properly.  </li>
            <li> The plates did not closed evenly.</li>
            <li> Having short hair, I NEEDED the 1/2&amp;#34; width &#x27;blade&#x27; ...and the &#x27;handle&#x27; is longer than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American and just recently cut all of my hair off and went natural.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot enough to straighten 4a hair however it&#x27;s no higher end type that you would buy at folica.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron died!!  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased it to flat iron my edges because I am natural and my edges are frizzy and puffy often.  </li>
            <li> The size and shape of it were hard for me to find in the more expensive brands, but this absolutely fit the bill in order to curl and spike my short hair and even my sides which are very short.</li>
            <li> I had only seen the narrow width offered in more expensive brands and my hair is not difficult enough to justify that expense.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this flat iron, but the plates simply dont meet without you having to use pressure on the handle (I find this problem with MANY flat irons, unfortunately, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no different than any flat iron you can purchase at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this flat iron to anyone with unruly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Overall despite the added work of manually clamping the flat iron, it does the job of straightening and smoothing hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron only lasted 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Once you learn different techniques, you can use this on long or short hair.</li>
            <li> It is just as good, if not better than any expensive straightener I have encountered.</li>
            <li> I had the 1 inch version of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This works well as flat irons go.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say that this flat iron did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up fast and is one of the very few that has adjustable heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a God send!</li>
            <li> This Flat iron is the bomb!</li>
            <li> However this flat iron works wonders on long hair which is the reason I did not return this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont care for is the fact that the pink paint is starting to fade..</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t keep your fingers on the outer sides for too long.</li>
            <li> Ordering something fulfilled by Amazon is the way to go, will receive on time if not earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because my 1 inch wide one didn&#x27;t quite work as well on my short hair (pixie style).</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife who has at least 5 other flat irons and is very particular about her hair.</li>
            <li> Other 1/2 in straighteners heat only to 400 degrees</li>
            <li> but without the sharp angle from front to back.</li>
            <li> AND IT CAME A DAY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED!  </li>
            <li> did like the 1/2 inch width, and the long length (I returned it already, but think it was about 4 inches, based on my comparing it to my other flat iron).  </li>
            <li> However, I have had other flat irons that lasted&lt;br /&gt;for years.  </li>
            <li> I have hair all the way down my back</li>
            <li> and I could not find a flat iron that was small enough to grad the shortest part of my hair</li>
            <li> Its not \\&quot;wet and go</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot as I&#x27;m not sure I will keep my hair short.</li>
            <li> Thin enough for short hair.</li>
            <li> Temp controls, too, for short, thick treated hair (and other types).  </li>
            <li> So I decided to shop Amazon (instead of going to an expensive shop to find what I now desperately needed, and would have paid a LOT more for such a product, and perhaps not even find a 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am african amercian with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The plates do not meet properly without you holding down on the end which makes it difficult to straighten really short hairs.</li>
            <li> and that means less damage.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to fry the little hair that I do have.</li>
            <li> , I wish the wand was a little shorter</li>
            <li> I just wish the wand was a little shorter</li>
            <li> I use this flatiron probably everyday.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this straightner (narrow shaft) because it allows me to get close to my ears and other places that were hard to tackle with a wider product.</li>
            <li> Finding a 1/2 inch flat iron in stores is next to impossible</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and curly, difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, it gets those hard to reach places like roots and straightens.</li>
            <li> I have right-above-the-shoulder-length, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, any iron is not really good to use on hair every day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even worse in the summer</li>
            <li> or you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> When I twist the iron around, I have to move my hands, so unfortunately, my hair falls out of the iron.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase it and don&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I burned my hair, and the smell was awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works awesome. Heats up super fast. I cut off my waist-length hair to a pixie cut and because my hair is naturally curly I needed a straightener and my 1 inch flat iron wasn&#x27;t going to work on my super short hair so I got this and it worked out great. Heats up in seconds and works great on short hairstyles. My hair has since grown out but I still use it almost every day. Have had no issues whatsoever. It has different heat settings and it&#x27;s easy to turn on/off and see what temp you&#x27;re using. Mine also came with the heat protective cover/storing case, which is handy. You can put it in the sleeve and stick it back in the drawer without worrying about burning something else inside the drawer. I really like this.</li>
            <li> Broke after about 2 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we all have different hair that responds better or worse to various flat irons but this one hasn&#x27;t worked well for anyone who has tried it at my house. It&#x27;s really no different than any flat iron you can purchase at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair in a short layered bob.  This iron worked wonders for the short layers.  One pass was all that was needed.  Worked as well as my $75.00 iron.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love it!! I have really short hair (a pixie cut) and I needed something that would straighten everything. I have a one inch straightener that I used to get my bangs but wouldn&#x27;t work on the rest of my head. This straightener heats up fast and is one of the very few that has adjustable heat settings to choose from. Other 1/2 in straighteners heat only to 400 degrees and I don&#x27;t want to fry the little hair that I do have. This was perfect. Arrived before the shipping date and came with a heat shield that the straightener can sit in which is a life saver. Haven&#x27;t touched my old chi hair straightener since this arrived. I use the lowest heat setting and I have very thick curly hair and this works perfect and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Highly recommend! Oh, &amp; what girl doesn&#x27;t like pink ;)</li>
            <li> I have fine, mostly straight hair. I like the size of this straightner (narrow shaft) because it allows me to get close to my ears and other places that were hard to tackle with a wider product. I had only seen the narrow width offered in more expensive brands and my hair is not difficult enough to justify that expense. I am super- happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a teeny tiny travel size straightener, so even though this looks like a platypus, I dove in!  It&#x27;s great for the price, it&#x27;s not a Chi, but you&#x27;re not paying for a Chi, so manage your expectations!  Has been great to use so far, and I am really happy with it!</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again. Gets hot enough to straighten 4a hair however it&#x27;s no higher end type that you would buy at folica. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s temperature was equivalent to my higher priced flat iron but still I would recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. .I need to by another one before it get popular and the price goes up..I&#x27;m a professional stylist...and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> What a complete piece of rubbish......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occluded heating up after three uses.  Don&#x27;t purchase it and don&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not burn the hair and  keeps the hair from reverting back to a frizz. I would totally recommend this flat iron to anyone with unruly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener has been great.  I needed a thinner straightener to use on my pixie cut.  This one is full length making it a little easier to handle.  It gets really hot really fast and does wonders on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent,  It works. It&#x27;s amazing! It straight the short hair!! I recommend it to everyone! ! The heat is great!!</li>
            <li> I just got a pixie cut and this flatiron works perfectly! It took me a while to find one but this is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus +&lt;br /&gt;1. Comes with a stand&lt;br /&gt;2. Heats up in about 15-30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;3. Temperature changes (highest is 455)&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy on/off button&lt;br /&gt;5. Easy to put away (has a wrap to hold wires together)</li>
            <li> Hello!  :)  I have right-above-the-shoulder-length, thick, curly hair. Therefore, I have to use the hottest or second-to-hottest temperature on the dial.  Two things that would make this iron pretty perfect: I wish the exterior didn&#x27;t get as hot as it does, but also keep in mind the high temp I need to use on it because of my thick hair. It&#x27;s manageable though. You just can&#x27;t keep your fingers on the outer sides for too long. Next, make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair or protective oil before ironing and the day after because the day after you use the iron (and this goes for most irons), your hair will look unhealthy, yeah like it was mistreated/scorched..obviously the high heat. So just get a good conditioning system going. Otherwise for quick styling, this iron is great. Very sweet design on it too :)  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Takes multiple passes to get straight hair. I&#x27;ve already bought a new one from a different maker</li>
            <li> I had the 1 inch version of this flat iron. I bought this to use on my shorter hair styles. It heat up very quickly. It has 4 heat settings 335, 365, 419, and 465 degrees . I use the the second one 365 degrees. It straightens my hair quickly. May sure you use a heat protecting spray on your hair before use!  It works better than some of the more expensive flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener. The ceramic plates don&#x27;t catch on my hair at all. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take any effort.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product but the temperature increments are weird. Increments end in 9, like 419°. I also wish the handle was a little more streamlined but it gets the job done.  Works great on short hair and can get close to the root which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Did not like. The plates did not closed evenly.</li>
            <li> a CHEAP SOLUTION FOR SHORT HAIR.  it is  what it is you get what u pay for. May be good  for personal use, no good  for a  professional.</li>
            <li> Nice iron for the price.  Heats up fast and holds on to the extra short hair at my neck amd ears (I have a pixie cut). I only heat it up to 390 and that&#x27;s plenty hot for me so I can&#x27;t say how it works on thicker hair at higher temperatures.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a God send! It is just as good, if not better than any expensive straightener I have encountered. I have moderately coarse AA hair cut into a pixie, and it works wonders. The size and shape of it were hard for me to find in the more expensive brands, but this absolutely fit the bill in order to curl and spike my short hair and even my sides which are very short. I LOVE the rounded edges. These heat up to 455 degrees, but please dont use that setting unless you want to start a bonfire. I made the mistake of using the highest setting when I first got this straightener because I thought of Conair as a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand which would need to be turned all the way up to work. I burned my hair, and the smell was awful. I had almost given up on them, but when I turned them down to 419 degrees, it was perfect!!! Don&#x27;t be deterred by the price, it is a quality tool.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and decided to give it a try this morning. I LOVE it. I recently got my hair cut and it&#x27;s sort of a bob shape, but without the sharp angle from front to back. I&#x27;m older and just wanted a shorter cut and not so much a &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; style. I had the Conair Infiniti iron in the 1&amp;#34;, and enjoy it for straightening my hair. It&#x27;s fast and does a fantastic job. But I also enjoy the wavy curls on occasion and the 1&amp;#34; was a little too large for the length of my hair to give me that look. A quick search on Amazon for Conair (love their products), and minutes later it was on order. Being a Prime member saves a lot of leg-work for me and I get the items so fast! This 1/2&amp;#34; iron just gave me some of the prettiest wavy curls and it took me a total of perhaps 10-15 minutes! The curls look absolutely natural. Some of the very ends of my hair weren&#x27;t curled properly (user issue) but all I did with those was take that part and curl it under with the very end of the iron. I would not hesitate to buy this if you are in the market, but on the fence about it. Some of the reviews might cause you to be skeptical, but no item is ever 100% perfect. You will find manufacturing defects occasionally with anything. Amazon is amazing with their customer service, so if you would happen to get a defective one (plates don&#x27;t align or whatever) you won&#x27;t need to worry. Amazon will make it right! Chances are, however, that won&#x27;t even happen. I love this Conair flat iron.</li>
            <li> Just received my flat iron.. couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. It arrived in 3 days ..amazon is  awesome with  there delivery time..the iron lived up to all my expectations..I have short fine hair, it works great, as good as a  very expensive flat irons..I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great 1/2 inch flat iron, hard to find a full size, not mini/travel size one. Heats  fast too. Ordering something fulfilled by Amazon is the way to go, will receive on time if not earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been living up to what it says it can do for you hair. I had no problems it heating or anything else. I am glad I made the purchase, so far so good!</li>
            <li> Best straightening iron I have ever owned but watch it, it does get really hot. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone&#x27;s hair could handle the highest setting.</li>
            <li> This Flat iron is the bomb! I initially purchased it to flat iron my edges because I am natural and my edges are frizzy and puffy often.  However it did not work for that. The plates do not meet properly without you holding down on the end which makes it difficult to straighten really short hairs. However this flat iron works wonders on long hair which is the reason I did not return this flat iron. With the right heat protecting spray this does wonders for smoothing out hair that is normally frizzy and/or puffy. Overall despite the added work of manually clamping the flat iron, it does the job of straightening and smoothing hair.</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Adjustable heat settings and comes with a great holder so u dont have to struggle to keep it on the countertop. Perfect size for my new short hair!</li>
            <li> Love the pink and is a sturdy product that seems like it will last long without any complaints</li>
            <li> My old flat iron died!!  So I decided to shop Amazon (instead of going to an expensive shop to find what I now desperately needed, and would have paid a LOT more for such a product, and perhaps not even find a 1/2&amp;#34; blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH my!  What a great find!  Having short hair, I NEEDED the 1/2&amp;#34; width &#x27;blade&#x27; ...and the &#x27;handle&#x27; is longer than my old one.  It has made it MUCH ezier to flatten my bangs and the back part of my hair in a snap.  Temp controls, too, for short, thick treated hair (and other types).  I love that the cord does not twist (swivel end).  And it came with a holding piece to rest it in.  AND IT CAME A DAY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED!  thanx Conair!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but its fine and really thick, I have used the most excpensive irons before and I by far like this one the best!  The half inch gets really close to the scalp and is great for styling, but what I love most is my hair is really shiny after I use it and is still straight the next morning meaning I have to use it less and that means less damage.  I suggest Ion straightening spray from sallys its the best Ive ever found and there doesnt seem to be a need to use the highest setting I think I use the middle one.  The auto shut of and stand are a major plus too.  I would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this straightener.  I am African-American and just recently cut all of my hair off and went natural.  This iron does a great job straightening my very coarse hair and also gets close enough to get the roots really straight too.  Plan to purchase a second one as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Great product for short hair or getting in close to roots.  Use it every day with no complaints. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist that has purchased several 1/2 inch flat irons, some priced over $100, this straightener is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve purchased for the price! It leaves even my clients whos hair is natural bone straight as if they have a relaxer! I will be purchasing another pair just for back up! Good buy!!</li>
            <li> I love this iron. It does exactly what it says it does and very well. Just remebr to use a heat protecting oil on your hair or you will be sorry. Plus, any iron is not really good to use on hair every day. I use this once or twice a week , afther I  wash and drymy hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs (short hair, not curly). Very handy, thin, different temperatures available, gets warm very quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed. Have a short cut and wanted to maintain a fresh salon look. This does the trick without gauging my purse. Gives my kitchen a clean fresh pressed look. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a slim flat iron to use for hard to get to short hair (like around the face) and it&#x27;s perfect for what I need. It has adjustable temperatures but I only need the lowest setting. I sometimes use it for the rest of my hair as well (I have long hair), just quickly going over some areas that need fixing. I would recommend this product. Also I like the color - I got the pink one :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I wanted something that can get down to the root and that was light to replace my very first flat iron. This met both of my requirements. I get gorgeous straight hair and can even play with other styles like curling and beach waves with it as well. I and even going to buy more to give as gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> This flat iron only lasted 3 months.  I received it on 8/7/14 and yesterday, 11/12, it stopped working.  It would not heat up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this product.  I will say that when it worked, it worked well.  However, I have had other flat irons that lasted&lt;br /&gt;for years.  3 months is not acceptable to me.  I will not purchase any more Conair products.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron. I have 4a 4b hair type and this iron really got my hair bone straight from  root to tips. It left my hair smooth and shiny as if I had a relaxer.</li>
            <li> This was a guilt for my daughter. She tells me it works quite well for her.</li>
            <li> Very good iron.  Leaves your hair super straight and soft. Didn&#x27;t give it five stars because you need to  hold the iron as hard as possible to make sure it closes (presses) properly.  Besides that, it gets those hard to reach places like roots and straightens.</li>
            <li> I tried this item for the first time yesterday and they are AMAZING!! They straighten the hair and makes great curls! I broke my last pair of this size and these were a great replacement! :)</li>
            <li> This is such a great flat iron.  I have many high end brands.  I dont know why, but I enjoy collecting flat irons and blow dryers to see what kind of results they will produce.  This on is so good.  I am african amercian with thick curly hair. Its not \\&quot;wet and go hair\\&quot; either.  I really like that there is a grip on the tip of the flat iron that allows for a tighter press on the hair. I have had it for about a month now and at school or at work people ask me if I went and got my hair done.  It really saves money and I get really good results.  All I have to do is keep a fresh trim and Im good to go!</li>
            <li> The flat iron is perfect! Thin enough for short hair. Fast heat-up and super smooth plates. Such a great tool, I bought another for my mom.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because my 1 inch wide one didn&#x27;t quite work as well on my short hair (pixie style). Straightening my hair is so much more easier, the thin plate makes it easy to style your hair. It especially helps get my parting right.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, tight curls. The kind that hardly move when you shake your head. So I was surprised that my hair got so straight and stayed that way (mostly) through a night of sweaty dancing. My hair was actually a bit shinier after I straightened it too, so that was a plus. No frizz or burn either.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use , would recommend!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly.  My curly hair is now stick straight &amp; I&#x27;m loving it.  And it&#x27;s in my signature color, which makes it all the more perfect.</li>
            <li> I use this flatiron probably everyday. It gets super hot, I like it, I wish the wand was a little shorter but that&#x27;s okay I&#x27;ve learn how to master this straightener.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife who has at least 5 other flat irons and is very particular about her hair. 4 months later still works great according to her.</li>
            <li> This works well as flat irons go.  No complaints and the price was good.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot as I&#x27;m not sure I will keep my hair short.</li>
            <li> I have really short hair so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Finding a 1/2 inch flat iron in stores is next to impossible and I really like to look at these before purchase.  However, mine had died, I needed one, so I bit the bullet and ordered this Conair.  I love it!!!  I use it for curling; it works great.  Not too hot, never burn myself, the cord does not twist (that was a problem with my old one); just overall easy to use.  So glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and curly, difficult to manage.  This straightener has graded heat settings which I like.  It does a great job on my hair.  I just wish the wand was a little shorter so I could straighten more of my hair.  I&#x27;m only able to do the front and top and can&#x27;t get it too close to my ears.</li>
            <li> I have hair all the way down my back and it works great</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair and it&#x27;s even worse in the summer so I needed something that would help fight the frizz. This straightener heats up very quickly and is easy to use. I&#x27;m very pleased with the Conair Infiniti Pro Tourmaline Ceramic Ultra-High Heat 1/2&amp;#34; Straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener has been a life saver.  I recently cut my hair short again, after reading reviews I decided to give this a try.  I already had a chi and another $100 straightener, but they were 1 inch.  This has really helped me get my hair done quick.  I am truly happpyyyyyy!!! I recommend this product. By the way i never wrote a review on this site, it&#x27;s serious LOL &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It heats quickly and evenly. The plates are smooth an narrow. It makes styling my short do nice and easy... And can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and I like the heat protector/stand</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. Great inexpensive iron. Once you learn different techniques, you can use this on long or short hair. I used it on an inverted bob that turned out awesome.</li>
            <li> Good Product.&lt;br /&gt;Worked well.&lt;br /&gt;Still in service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always so hard to select a good flat iron.. All the new terms to prevent dryness and damage. So confusing which one will be the better selection.. Not to mention I&#x27;ve never been a fan of conair.. But I have to say that this flat iron did not disappoint. The only thing I dont care for is the fact that the pink paint is starting to fade.. But no problem because the iron still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just got the Conair Infiniti and i just LOVE it.  Pluged it in and it heated up so fast i was amazed.  I have a pixie cut and I could not find a flat iron that was small enough to grad the shortest part of my hair this iron does that,  and more the settings are hot enough to curl my hair,  and not burn it.  Would recommend this to any one, and the price was right as well. all smiles :).</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this flat iron, but the plates simply dont meet without you having to use pressure on the handle (I find this problem with MANY flat irons, unfortunately, so I&#x27;m not all that surprised).  I have stick straight hair, so I wanted to use the iron to curl my hair.  When I twist the iron around, I have to move my hands, so unfortunately, my hair falls out of the iron.  Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the 1/2 inch width, and the long length (I returned it already, but think it was about 4 inches, based on my comparing it to my other flat iron).  I think the lowest temp setting was probably about 340.  I would have preferred it go lower, since my hair is fine.</li>
