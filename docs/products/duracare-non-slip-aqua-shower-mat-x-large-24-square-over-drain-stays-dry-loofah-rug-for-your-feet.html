            <li>one was a little bit too large for my &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34;-sized shower; but my daughter-in-law has a LARGE tub/shower, so I gave this one to her and bought a smaller one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far does not mildew or collect mold (and it is not suppose to) like regular bath mats do!</li>

            <li> Fits the apt shower great on feet</li>
            <li> I was a.ways beside t in wanting to buy these but I have two, one for the shower and one for the bathtub/shower combo.  The water does drain through it beautifully and easy to clean loose hairs off of with just a paper towel  and they are machine washable too.  So far does not mildew or collect mold (and it is not suppose to) like regular bath mats do!</li>
            <li> I wash mine in the washer with laundry soap and it comes clean easily.  It also never slips around.  This product is wonderful, its like having a pedicure daily.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works exactly as I wanted, better than actual loofah..holds up much better, but all the good qualities of actual loofah! I have my elderly mum living with me and I don&#x27;t worry anymore about her slipping and falling in the shower, also, I&#x27;m able to get my feet cleaner, easier ( I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;barefoot contessa&amp;#34; around the house, so my feet can get really funky!)</li>
            <li> I love this shower mat.  It feels GREAT on the feet, the water drains through it easily, and it has &#x27;suckers&#x27; on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t slip. Easy to hang up to dry (not reallly necessary, but we live in a VERY humid area, so take extra precautions against mildew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was a little bit too large for my &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34;-sized shower; but my daughter-in-law has a LARGE tub/shower, so I gave this one to her and bought a smaller one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that the loofah feels GREAT on the feet? *smile*</li>

            <li> Excellent mat.  Comfortable on the feet.  Drains well.  Provides good, safe footing.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> The description for this rug says it won&#x27;t slip and does stain or mildew.  I used this rug for one month and in that month I fell multiple times due to the rug slipping in the shower and even when cleaned regularly this mat got so disgusting.  It had thick mildew in just days after washing.  So overall not to happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish it was bigger but is nice under foot and easy to rinse. Wish suction cups worked better though</li>

            <li> The good news is that this mat feels great under my feet and it&#x27;s easy to pick up to clean. The bad news is that it&#x27;s easy to pick up and it slides around on the shower floor because the suction cups don&#x27;t work. I have to be careful to step on it the way you walk on ice -- stepping straight down with no forward momentum.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with my DuraCare Non-Slip Aqua Shower Mat X-large.  No slipping or sliding in the shower--great grips.  My feet have never felt so good while showering.  Would highly recommend this product.  The 24&amp;#34; square was perfect for the walk-in shower!  Love It!</li>
            <li> Drains get and  makes my feet feel good</li>
            <li> I wish there was a larger size!</li>
            <li> The best shore floor protection product I&#x27;ve used that provides me complete confidence, security, and safety while showering. It is so comfortable to stand on and I never worry about slipping. It&#x27;s also very easy to care for. The DuraCare Non Slip Shower Mat is a must have item for all seniors and anyone who has loss of sensation in their feet. Outstanding product and would definitely order this item again.</li>
