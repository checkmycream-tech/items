            <li>Great product, great price, great service!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with all my purchase</li>
            <li>The orange essence Cartier is great for summer, but I am a cologne</li>
            <li>Also feels great in the summer after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
            <li>Keeps you with a good mood and feeling all day.</li>
            <li>&gt; A great tip for cologne users is to put your favorite sent in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>it is very good and also it original</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and arrived in time</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is my summer favorite cologne to wear.</li>
            <li>I have to put a lot more to get some smell out of it.</li>
            <li>The smell is so sexy tho.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and very clean smell.  </li>
            <li>but when your body heats up the smell gets strong</li>
            <li>Not so strong like the one I got once</li>
            <li>Great price same as the one u can get in any Cartier store&lt;br /&gt;I will get the orange too</li>
            <li>would buy this again as its a clean light smell</li>
            <li>, I feel cheated, I want my money, or the original product for which paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is also nice because you can buy two for the price of one and that gives you the opportunity to buy more fragrances and have a collection because with this fragrance you can actually mix it with others to get a unique smell that not everyone might have.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good cologne but little light.</li>
            <li>I will only buy it from NM because I have paid a lot for fakes and it seems to be a popular brand to be counterfeited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it more than most of my other colognes.</li>
            <li>Cartier is the real thing, if not, I can not tell.</li>
            <li>It accommodates tall bottles very well.</li>
            <li>It will last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>I think this is a replica or a really old one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long at full strength</li>
            <li>I chose to be a classic fragrance which I used for several years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this cologne is not for everyone,  it does have a strong citrus/greenish(woodsy outdoor) smell to it that people can either love or hate</li>

            <li> It was supposed to be a concentrate yet the smell didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Cartier stays for a long long long time!</li>
            <li> but i prefer other fragance of cartier like declaration, dont have enought personality, in three hours the smell dont fell.</li>
            <li> This product is not original, I ordered this product and the fragrance does not remain even 5 minutes</li>
            <li> so I have a small wine fridge under my vanity with a tempered glass shelf in place of the bottle holders.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>

            <li> Excellent product at a great price</li>
            <li> Buy buy the price is awesome for the size of cartier.buybuybuy</li>
            <li> This is my summer favorite cologne to wear. If you work in a environment where you interact with a lot of people then this is the cologne for you. The price is also nice because you can buy two for the price of one and that gives you the opportunity to buy more fragrances and have a collection because with this fragrance you can actually mix it with others to get a unique smell that not everyone might have.&lt;br /&gt;BUT this cologne is not for everyone,  it does have a strong citrus/greenish(woodsy outdoor) smell to it that people can either love or hate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with all my purchase</li>
            <li> I always buy this same cologne from Amazon.  This one smells strange, not the same than the ones I bought before and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I have to put a lot more to get some smell out of it.</li>
            <li> it is very good and also it original</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this often.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and very clean smell.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne often but this is my go to.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long at full strength but when your body heats up the smell gets strong again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again as its a clean light smell</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites to wear. I use it more than most of my other colognes. My favorite of all is Creed Green Irish Tweed, but at $300.00 a bottle at NM,I use it a little less often. I will only buy it from NM because I have paid a lot for fakes and it seems to be a popular brand to be counterfeited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cartier is the real thing, if not, I can not tell. Would buy from this seller again. The orange essence Cartier is great for summer, but I am a cologne junkie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A great tip for cologne users is to put your favorite sent in the refrigerator. It will last a whole lot longer. I read this in Details magazine so I have a small wine fridge under my vanity with a tempered glass shelf in place of the bottle holders. It accommodates tall bottles very well. Also feels great in the summer after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
            <li> great mens perfume my wives loves it on me!!</li>
            <li> This product is not original, I ordered this product and the fragrance does not remain even 5 minutes, I feel cheated, I want my money, or the original product for which paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fraud.</li>
            <li> IS fres woodly but i prefer other fragance of cartier like declaration, dont have enought personality, in three hours the smell dont fell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good cologne but little light. It&#x27;s not bad for the price at all. The smell is so sexy tho.</li>
            <li> I chose to be a classic fragrance which I used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;It is the product shipped meets specified by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and seller, criterior quality.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a concentrate yet the smell didn&#x27;t last long. I think this is a replica or a really old one. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not so strong like the one I got once</li>
