            <li>It also has a very nice odor.</li>
            <li>But not the best volume I&#x27;ve ever had-- kerastase&#x27;s volumizing mousse is better--</li>

            <li>If your hair is baby fine like mine, you will love this product!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best foam for fine hair...</li>
            <li>Smells good though.</li>
            <li>Good volume.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Now I need to find a good hairspray.</li>
            <li>Redken products are always a good buy.</li>
            <li>good but not too</li>
            <li>One or two pumps (if you have longer hair like me) is all I need for good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had a good bit of humidity control</li>
            <li>This product is great for my baby fine hair and always arrives as promised in great packaging.</li>
            <li>Great solution for very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for adding body to fine air!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled because anything that makes hair look better (and this does a great job at it)</li>
            <li>My hairstylist introduced me to it, and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>It holds up for most of the day!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this!  </li>

            <li>I have fine hair and this product works great to make my hair look and feel fuller.  </li>
            <li>works great on fine hair</li>
            <li>This works great for really fine hair.  </li>
            <li>very nice on the hair but not as strong a hold as I wished.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>light and great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I will be getting another bottle soon, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>And always always ALWAYS do your research if you&#x27;re concerned about this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I like the results from Nexxus Mousse</li>
            <li>I have very straight  baby-fine, never colored or permed hair and thought this product would be ideal for me.</li>
            <li>Very easy to wash from hair .</li>
            <li>Your hair will look super full and hold a great style when you use this pump foam styling product!</li>
            <li>, I have a fair amount of hair, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I am 54 and have very fine, thinning hair that is both permed for body and colored</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Great delivery time without paying higher cost.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair issues!</li>
            <li>He loved this mouse so much that he asked me to buy more!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you are looking to find a great hair volumizer!  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I work to make sure it is spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I find that the more I use, the better results I get when blowdrying.</li>
            <li>It really is better than mouse.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better results with cheaper things though.  </li>
            <li>I like Got 2B mousse better</li>
            <li>and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I love the Skindeep Database that EWG put together.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of products in an attempt to improve the appearance of my hair, to give it more &#x27;fullness&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a quite miracle, but, I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - my hairdresser recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Used this product for many years</li>
            <li>so I would expect this product to do more than it did.</li>
            <li>it sometimes looks even better.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, &amp; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it did an ok job.  </li>
            <li>I like Redken number 10 better for volume.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Plus better.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does have a lovely tea smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you Redken :-)</li>
            <li>and I thought it was just ok.</li>
            <li>Yeah sure it&#x27;s there,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mousses, gels.</li>
            <li>This one is about as good as it gets for my particular kind of hair,.</li>
            <li>I bought the Body-Full shampoo first and loved it, so</li>
            <li>a lot more cheap and worked twice better than this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for fine hair!</li>
            <li>Works ok for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>naturally I thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years &amp; it makes my baby fine blonde hair full &amp; wonderful!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking full and done all day!</li>
            <li>However, I had a TON of body and it was eventually easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this Redken Body Full Volumizing Foam for Baby FIne hair and decided I&#x27;d try one more.  </li>
            <li>Too Sticky for my fine hair</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Works well on fine hair</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>for baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s the hair foam for me.</li>
            <li>you have baby fine hair (my curse)</li>
            <li>Thickens and adds body to fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who has baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this adds the body it lacks.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a product that will give my extremely fine hair body.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length baby fine hair</li>
            <li>results are fabulous and I love my hair for the first time in 42 years!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and you have been looking for a product that really works to give your hair a lift - this is it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, I&#x27;ll find the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and tried it for my super fine hair.</li>
            <li>it was NOT in its original packing.</li>
            <li>Love this product and works really well on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll play around with it a little more, and hopefully I find the right amount, and perfect the whole application process thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic and does exactly what it claims ... if I could afford it, I would purchase it by the case!</li>
            <li>It works great on fine hair, giving it a lift without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>This is also a good price for the product - which seems like it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I put Redken Body Full in my hair and section it off with clips into 3 parts.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t feel the product in my hair, it&#x27;s just bouncier and really full looking.  </li>
            <li>This product hands down is the absolute BEST I have ever found too</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m using it so quickly though</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make it more of those things, but it DOES give it lots of body and THAT makes my hair look better overall.</li>
            <li>Good value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Leaves straight, fine  hair silky but volumized and full.  </li>
            <li>this really works on  my baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I have sparse baby fine hair, and even my co-workers noticed how much volume I now have..</li>
            <li>I have baby fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but there was a difference...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is either great or a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li>Best product found for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh herbs.  </li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product for thin hair</li>
            <li>It has a nice lasting scent also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a replacement for the old Redken Root Lifter that was discontinued.</li>
            <li>is worth the money.</li>
            <li>more than most other reviewers say they use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone with unruly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using this foam to try and find the right amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li>a mousse that is just the right consistency</li>
            <li>Made my hair kind of greasy, which is the exact opposite of what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This product is great for fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good mousse, use two pumps and my hair feels thicker and not sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have curly fine hair that just does whatever it wants whenever it wants to.</li>
            <li>expensive but works great, I used to buy this as a spritz which I think works better</li>
            <li>(Redkin if I have it), not the leave-in kind, but I leave it in anyway, and I then use three pumps of this bodifier, then dry with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This foam, no matter how much or little I use, seems not to do anything good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is very limp and has no volume on its own.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with this and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Solid volumizer, one star off because I like more volume.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love that it gives body without stiffness...</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>First I put in some hair conditioner</li>
            <li>I literally caught myself saying, for the first time in my life, that I like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li>With the right amount, it does great on my hair, and for someone with  coarser hair that can take heavier products,  it think it  would work even better with less fear of it being too heavy.</li>
            <li>Price is too high and if you have long hair like me you need more foam so it can run out quick</li>
            <li>Might be worth a try, but I don&#x27;t highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel super full of product which I like, but I don&#x27;t grab for it daily</li>
            <li>This first time, I used too much - my hair got so \\&quot;thick,\\</li>
            <li>I use this everyday that I have my hair down and it is great!</li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li>My baby fine hair needs body and extra volume.</li>
            <li>Works well with extra fine hair</li>
            <li>my fellow fine haired ladies, I would definitely recommend trying something else.</li>
            <li>It really gives my fine blonde hair some bounce and volume.  </li>
            <li>good product, hard to get in stores.</li>
            <li>it works better than other similar products and is easy to use etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight as a pin.</li>
            <li>But, like one reviewer said, don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair when air drying.</li>
            <li>really make my hair look thicker &amp; gives it so much volume (&amp;</li>
            <li>I did not use too much either.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin/thinning hair and this product does help with volume</li>
            <li>This cost&#x27;s way too much for the end results.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use to much as if you do</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and really like how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like t his product</li>
            <li>This is one of the products that really adds volume.</li>
            <li>I really like this product .</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is drier, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>This really did make my hair look thicker and helped to hold the style with body.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thinning (I&#x27;m 73) but still (more or less) brown (ok, some grey).</li>
            <li>I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and I struggle to find a product that will give it some body without making it look weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s even thinner on top due to age.</li>
            <li>Very light, does not weight hair down.  </li>
            <li>OK, this really does work, maybe a little too well.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, I need to figure out the right amount to use.  </li>
            <li>same as above, user of this for many years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair everyday, so this may be why I have had this last for so long, but you really don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all to get great results of much fuller and thicker looking hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does the job of giving it a little more volume.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well and looks very natural, not stiff or chalky.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product that actually changes the texture of my hair and makes it easy to style.  </li>
            <li>More pumps just gave me stiff ends and stringy hair, but nothing in the way of volume.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it brought me back to my junior high days of spray gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new number one product for styling.  </li>
            <li>Make my fine/thin hair super dry &amp; tangly.</li>
            <li>And the bottle seems to empty rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of volumizing hair products and this one is the only one I have found so far that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the more common ones as my scalp is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am in my early forties.</li>
            <li>Hair is still soft but manageable.</li>
            <li>I  suspect I got someone&#x27;s old return.</li>
            <li>I find that is the case ONLY if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>I like the look of soft flowy and silky hair.</li>
            <li>This is gentle on my skin but still actually adds volume.</li>
            <li>I have fine, mostly straight shoulder-length hair that I blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>Light product that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but not as much volume as expected.</li>
            <li>I have very thick but very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Have very fine, thin, \\&quot;aging\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair look full (and a bit stiff)</li>
            <li>my initial disappointment turned to joy.</li>
            <li>I have super baby-fine hair and have trouble styling and maintaining a hair style.</li>
            <li>It is not bad and does give my hair some volume, but it is super hard to determine how much to put on, because if I put on too much it really weighs my hair down, and if I put on too little, it does nothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but it works great and a bottle will last a reasonably long time.</li>
            <li>This product adds fullness like no other.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the first volumizing product that has ever worked for my hair, and I have tried just about everything there is out there, from cheap to expensive, from shampoos to mousses to gels and sprays.  </li>
            <li>I really did not add volume to my hair like the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>Um, actually very thin patchy hair that is also fine and stick straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair a few inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li>After trying all kinds of products, expensive or non-expensive, I&#x27;ve finally found one that really works on my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I find it hard to manage after using it, and I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my clean wet hair and then blow dry on high and then style as usual.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair that goes past the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li>Worth the little bit extra, when you use professional products, you tend to use less.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, and this product gives me volume that makes my hair look and feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have thin baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair, and this product gives me a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and have always had thin, baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s too much for my hair and just doesn&#x27;t seem to ever get dry when I&#x27;m blow-drying and other times</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to other baby boomers with this problem!  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great for voluminizing and no residue.</li>
            <li> This is great.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very nice odor.</li>
            <li> But not the best volume I&#x27;ve ever had-- kerastase&#x27;s volumizing mousse is better--</li>
            <li> Best product for my baby fine hair that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If your hair is baby fine like mine, you will love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best foam for fine hair...</li>
            <li> Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Good volume.</li>
            <li> but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Now I need to find a good hairspray.</li>
            <li> Redken products are always a good buy.</li>
            <li> good but not too</li>
            <li> One or two pumps (if you have longer hair like me) is all I need for good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a good bit of humidity control</li>
            <li> This product is great for my baby fine hair and always arrives as promised in great packaging.</li>
            <li> Great solution for very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for adding body to fine air!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled because anything that makes hair look better (and this does a great job at it)</li>
            <li> My hairstylist introduced me to it, and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> It holds up for most of the day!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and this product works great to make my hair look and feel fuller.  </li>
            <li> works great on fine hair</li>
            <li> This works great for really fine hair.  </li>
            <li> very nice on the hair but not as strong a hold as I wished.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> light and great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will be getting another bottle soon, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> And always always ALWAYS do your research if you&#x27;re concerned about this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I like the results from Nexxus Mousse</li>
            <li> I have very straight  baby-fine, never colored or permed hair and thought this product would be ideal for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to wash from hair .</li>
            <li> Your hair will look super full and hold a great style when you use this pump foam styling product!</li>
            <li> , I have a fair amount of hair, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and have very fine, thinning hair that is both permed for body and colored</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Great delivery time without paying higher cost.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair issues!</li>
            <li> He loved this mouse so much that he asked me to buy more!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you are looking to find a great hair volumizer!  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I work to make sure it is spread throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I find that the more I use, the better results I get when blowdrying.</li>
            <li> It really is better than mouse.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better results with cheaper things though.  </li>
            <li> I like Got 2B mousse better</li>
            <li> and I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I love the Skindeep Database that EWG put together.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products in an attempt to improve the appearance of my hair, to give it more &#x27;fullness&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a quite miracle, but, I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff - my hairdresser recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Used this product for many years</li>
            <li> so I would expect this product to do more than it did.</li>
            <li> it sometimes looks even better.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, &amp; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but it did an ok job.  </li>
            <li> I like Redken number 10 better for volume.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Plus better.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does have a lovely tea smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you Redken :-)</li>
            <li> and I thought it was just ok.</li>
            <li> Yeah sure it&#x27;s there,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mousses, gels.</li>
            <li> This one is about as good as it gets for my particular kind of hair,.</li>
            <li> I bought the Body-Full shampoo first and loved it, so</li>
            <li> a lot more cheap and worked twice better than this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Works ok for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> naturally I thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years &amp; it makes my baby fine blonde hair full &amp; wonderful!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking full and done all day!</li>
            <li> However, I had a TON of body and it was eventually easy to style.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this Redken Body Full Volumizing Foam for Baby FIne hair and decided I&#x27;d try one more.  </li>
            <li> Too Sticky for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Works well on fine hair</li>
            <li> It is fine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> for baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s the hair foam for me.</li>
            <li> you have baby fine hair (my curse)</li>
            <li> Thickens and adds body to fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this adds the body it lacks.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a product that will give my extremely fine hair body.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length baby fine hair</li>
            <li> results are fabulous and I love my hair for the first time in 42 years!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and you have been looking for a product that really works to give your hair a lift - this is it!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, I&#x27;ll find the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and tried it for my super fine hair.</li>
            <li> it was NOT in its original packing.</li>
            <li> Love this product and works really well on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll play around with it a little more, and hopefully I find the right amount, and perfect the whole application process thing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and does exactly what it claims ... if I could afford it, I would purchase it by the case!</li>
            <li> It works great on fine hair, giving it a lift without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This is also a good price for the product - which seems like it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I put Redken Body Full in my hair and section it off with clips into 3 parts.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t feel the product in my hair, it&#x27;s just bouncier and really full looking.  </li>
            <li> This product hands down is the absolute BEST I have ever found too</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using it so quickly though</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make it more of those things, but it DOES give it lots of body and THAT makes my hair look better overall.</li>
            <li> Good value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves straight, fine  hair silky but volumized and full.  </li>
            <li> this really works on  my baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I have sparse baby fine hair, and even my co-workers noticed how much volume I now have..</li>
            <li> I have baby fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but there was a difference...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is either great or a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> Best product found for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh herbs.  </li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product for thin hair</li>
            <li> It has a nice lasting scent also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a replacement for the old Redken Root Lifter that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> is worth the money.</li>
            <li> more than most other reviewers say they use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone with unruly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using this foam to try and find the right amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li> a mousse that is just the right consistency</li>
            <li> Made my hair kind of greasy, which is the exact opposite of what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good mousse, use two pumps and my hair feels thicker and not sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have curly fine hair that just does whatever it wants whenever it wants to.</li>
            <li> expensive but works great, I used to buy this as a spritz which I think works better</li>
            <li> (Redkin if I have it), not the leave-in kind, but I leave it in anyway, and I then use three pumps of this bodifier, then dry with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This foam, no matter how much or little I use, seems not to do anything good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is very limp and has no volume on its own.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with this and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Solid volumizer, one star off because I like more volume.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love that it gives body without stiffness...</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li> First I put in some hair conditioner</li>
            <li> I literally caught myself saying, for the first time in my life, that I like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> With the right amount, it does great on my hair, and for someone with  coarser hair that can take heavier products,  it think it  would work even better with less fear of it being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Price is too high and if you have long hair like me you need more foam so it can run out quick</li>
            <li> Might be worth a try, but I don&#x27;t highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel super full of product which I like, but I don&#x27;t grab for it daily</li>
            <li> This first time, I used too much - my hair got so \\&quot;thick,\\</li>
            <li> I use this everyday that I have my hair down and it is great!</li>
            <li> My hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li> My baby fine hair needs body and extra volume.</li>
            <li> Works well with extra fine hair</li>
            <li> my fellow fine haired ladies, I would definitely recommend trying something else.</li>
            <li> It really gives my fine blonde hair some bounce and volume.  </li>
            <li> good product, hard to get in stores.</li>
            <li> it works better than other similar products and is easy to use etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight as a pin.</li>
            <li> But, like one reviewer said, don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair when air drying.</li>
            <li> really make my hair look thicker &amp; gives it so much volume (&amp;</li>
            <li> I did not use too much either.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin/thinning hair and this product does help with volume</li>
            <li> This cost&#x27;s way too much for the end results.</li>
            <li> You do not need to use to much as if you do</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and really like how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like t his product</li>
            <li> This is one of the products that really adds volume.</li>
            <li> I really like this product .</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is drier, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> This really did make my hair look thicker and helped to hold the style with body.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning (I&#x27;m 73) but still (more or less) brown (ok, some grey).</li>
            <li> I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and I struggle to find a product that will give it some body without making it look weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s even thinner on top due to age.</li>
            <li> Very light, does not weight hair down.  </li>
            <li> OK, this really does work, maybe a little too well.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, I need to figure out the right amount to use.  </li>
            <li> same as above, user of this for many years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair everyday, so this may be why I have had this last for so long, but you really don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all to get great results of much fuller and thicker looking hair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does the job of giving it a little more volume.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well and looks very natural, not stiff or chalky.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product that actually changes the texture of my hair and makes it easy to style.  </li>
            <li> More pumps just gave me stiff ends and stringy hair, but nothing in the way of volume.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it brought me back to my junior high days of spray gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new number one product for styling.  </li>
            <li> Make my fine/thin hair super dry &amp; tangly.</li>
            <li> And the bottle seems to empty rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of volumizing hair products and this one is the only one I have found so far that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the more common ones as my scalp is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am in my early forties.</li>
            <li> Hair is still soft but manageable.</li>
            <li> I  suspect I got someone&#x27;s old return.</li>
            <li> I find that is the case ONLY if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> I like the look of soft flowy and silky hair.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on my skin but still actually adds volume.</li>
            <li> I have fine, mostly straight shoulder-length hair that I blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> Light product that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but not as much volume as expected.</li>
            <li> I have very thick but very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Have very fine, thin, \\&quot;aging\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair look full (and a bit stiff)</li>
            <li> my initial disappointment turned to joy.</li>
            <li> I have super baby-fine hair and have trouble styling and maintaining a hair style.</li>
            <li> It is not bad and does give my hair some volume, but it is super hard to determine how much to put on, because if I put on too much it really weighs my hair down, and if I put on too little, it does nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it works great and a bottle will last a reasonably long time.</li>
            <li> This product adds fullness like no other.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the first volumizing product that has ever worked for my hair, and I have tried just about everything there is out there, from cheap to expensive, from shampoos to mousses to gels and sprays.  </li>
            <li> I really did not add volume to my hair like the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> Um, actually very thin patchy hair that is also fine and stick straight.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair a few inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li> After trying all kinds of products, expensive or non-expensive, I&#x27;ve finally found one that really works on my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to manage after using it, and I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my clean wet hair and then blow dry on high and then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair that goes past the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> Worth the little bit extra, when you use professional products, you tend to use less.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and this product gives me volume that makes my hair look and feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have thin baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair, and this product gives me a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and have always had thin, baby fine hair</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s too much for my hair and just doesn&#x27;t seem to ever get dry when I&#x27;m blow-drying and other times</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to other baby boomers with this problem!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how full and thick my hair looks!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my thin hair feel much fuller and seems to keep my usually oily hair from turning so, so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This works even when I flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product really does help add body to my regularly thin and limp hair when used right before blow drying and curling.</li>
            <li> If you have baby fine or thin hair, this is the product to buy!</li>
            <li> It felt like I had too much product in my hair and my hair looked dull.</li>
            <li> I have thin / fine hair and have used half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is a long time to struggle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched hairdressers about 6 months ago</li>
            <li> I decided to help EWG out and put all those long ingredients in their database.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and never can get volume.  </li>
            <li> and I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> even the next day (I wash my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> but you need to use a very small amount , if you use to much your hair will feel like glue</li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> Then blow dry and style.  </li>
            <li> Both times after use my hair was dry, frizzy and brittle.</li>
            <li> However, you really need to wash it out of your hair by the 2nd day as it leaves a residue behind</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off thinking that the bottle is smaller because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to the roots of my wet hair and blow dry</li>
            <li> I think it adds a little extra volume when I add it to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I then blow dry each section with a round brush, starting with the bottom section and working upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same results, maybe a little thicker with the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is expensive for my taste, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product really adds volume to thin hair.</li>
            <li> and I achieved a salon look in a minimal amount of time.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of it as well.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the other reviewers have, but I HAVE baby hair</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find any other information online about what it contained.</li>
            <li> You only use a small amount also.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel a little filmy, like when you use a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair dull and coarse.</li>
            <li> This product really does give volume to baby-fine hair which I, unfortunately, have.</li>
            <li> Use small amounts only ,or it can be too heavy, and a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> &quot; the volume was thick and I could actually work well with my style.</li>
            <li> product gives my hair volume and hold without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT feel sticky or weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either</li>
            <li> it will weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> that weighs the hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair but three squirts of this foam and my hair is thicker and much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot and it is slightly cheaper buying it here than in the salon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slight.</li>
            <li> It can be a little \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; but just wash your hands after</li>
            <li> It seemed to leave my hair a little oily.</li>
            <li> I put this in damp hair, blow-dry upside down, style, spray and I am done!</li>
            <li> Rarely do I give a bad review but this as costly as it is IMO di nothing,</li>
            <li> I use Redken when my hair is damp and again after I&#x27;ve dried it with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> of the comments talk about it being sticky or too heavy.....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a few times</li>
            <li> I used a minimal/moderate amount, blow dried scrunching a bit and then used a curling iron</li>
            <li> Theres not many products that I can use that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or sticky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Too stiff.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a little frizzy -- but it usually always is, regardless.</li>
            <li> Does feel like a film on the hair but just a little bit!</li>
            <li> Use very little after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a subtle lift and grip without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> but it was a humid day and my hair held the body and style longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> Worked well with volumizing my thin hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I could hardly getting a pick through it while blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to work so hard to get it evenly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-works</li>
            <li> In fact, I hardly notice a difference whether I use it or don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It Is the least affective of any product I have used and am using.</li>
            <li> This works also for thick hair, giving me volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> Hope that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is being phased out.  </li>
            <li> I mean,</li>
            <li> Very small amount</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> it makes it way worse too</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and without this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy with this foam.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thin and sparse.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I have a bob cut &amp; I use approximately 6 squirts and then blow-dry.  </li>
            <li> sometimes my hair falls out in clumps after washing &amp; combing it, NOT GOOD)!!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this Redken product and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> It is in my opinion is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> so I may be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the reviews for this product lead me astray.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m crazy because I want an all-natural mousse, but I like to do my research.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, and very poor quality, my hair after 20 minutes looked  awful</li>
            <li> and I could not tell a difference.  :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product dries your hair out bad!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair is straight as a pin. Finally a volumizer that works on MY hair!</li>
            <li> Have very fine, thin, \\&quot;aging\\&quot; hair.  Highly recommend to other baby boomers with this problem!  But, like one reviewer said, don&#x27;t use too much.  I have short hair and made the mistake of using three pumps....looked like my head exploded even after just air drying! This is also a good price for the product - which seems like it will last quite a while. Definitely am buying again.</li>
            <li> Great for adding body to fine air! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I bought this product in August 2013 and I have not used it all up! I have very fine hair a few inches past my shoulders and I only need to use two pumps when I blowdry my hair. I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair everyday, so this may be why I have had this last for so long, but you really don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all to get great results of much fuller and thicker looking hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you are looking to find a great hair volumizer!  It really doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair when air drying. It needs the blowdryer/heat to activate the product.</li>
            <li> Too Sticky for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and this product gives me volume that makes my hair look and feel thicker.  It&#x27;s hard to find in my area.  Hope that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is being phased out.  It&#x27;s too good for that!</li>
            <li> OK, this really does work, maybe a little too well.  I have very long, fine hair that goes past the middle of my back.  Apparently, I need to figure out the right amount to use.  This first time, I used too much - my hair got so \\&quot;thick,\\&quot; I could hardly getting a pick through it while blow drying.  It also made my hair feel a little filmy, like when you use a dry shampoo.  However, I had a TON of body and it was eventually easy to style.  I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, I&#x27;ll find the right amount.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I swear I must have some of the finest/thinnest hair around (&amp; do too some medication I have too take it makes it way worse too the point sometimes my hair falls out in clumps after washing &amp; combing it, NOT GOOD)!! This product hands down is the absolute BEST I have ever found too really make my hair look thicker &amp; gives it so much volume (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried just about everything). You only need a small amount of it as well. It can be a little \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; but just wash your hands after, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I have baby-fine hair and this is the only product that actually changes the texture of my hair and makes it easy to style.  My hairstylist introduced me to it, and I love it!</li>
            <li> this really works on  my baby fine hair</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and you have been looking for a product that really works to give your hair a lift - this is it!!!  I apply it to the roots of my wet hair and blow dry and I have that lift all day.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li> Terrific. It delivers.</li>
            <li> Best product for my baby fine hair that I have ever used. I have baby fine hair. I have struggled with this since I started styling my hair. I am in my early forties. This is a long time to struggle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched hairdressers about 6 months ago and she suggested this product. What a world of difference this has made in my life. I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair. I feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives my hair volume and hold without weighing it down. I do use more than most other reviewers say they use. I use about 6-8 pumps. I work to make sure it is spread throughout my hair. If I don&#x27;t, I tend to only put it on the parts I can see in front. I find that the more I use, the better results I get when blowdrying. My hair does NOT feel sticky or weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine consists of washing and conditioning my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Everpure shampoo and conditioner. I put Redken Body Full in my hair and section it off with clips into 3 parts. I then blow dry each section with a round brush, starting with the bottom section and working upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results are fabulous and I love my hair for the first time in 42 years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I have very thick hair. It makes your hair very manageable and soft. It really is better than mouse. It is a great product that helps with styling.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sticky. My hair is short and fine. Can&#x27;t use it. I had used another redeem product for thickening before and it was great. This was not. I did not use too much either.  Very small amount if product. Still too sticky</li>
            <li> Great product Great service</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find it at my salon anymore,,even after I asked about it, so looked on line.  It works well, I have a fair amount of hair, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my baby fine hair and always arrives as promised in great packaging.</li>
            <li> very nice on the hair but not as strong a hold as I wished.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have thin hair and without this I have no body at all. This is the only product I put in my hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> I actually thought this was a different product and my initial disappointment turned to joy. The effect is immediate. Hair styles like a pro and looks luxurious. My hair not only looks &amp; feel thicker, it is! I give it a 10.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I could not tell a difference.  :(</li>
            <li> Gives your hair lift and body without the stiffness and stickiness of some products.  Hair is still soft but manageable.</li>
            <li> This is ok. I read the reviews and tried it for my super fine hair. I would say this is so so and probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It is not bad and does give my hair some volume, but it is super hard to determine how much to put on, because if I put on too much it really weighs my hair down, and if I put on too little, it does nothing. Might be worth a try, but I don&#x27;t highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would not say this is an &#x27;instant bodifier&#x27;.  I have thin / fine hair and have used half the bottle.  I am not impressed with this Redken product and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d purchase it again.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with volume and that&#x27;s why I bought it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at ALL. Make my fine/thin hair super dry &amp; tangly. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Works well on fine hair</li>
            <li> This is probably the first volumizing product that has ever worked for my hair, and I have tried just about everything there is out there, from cheap to expensive, from shampoos to mousses to gels and sprays.  I have baby fine hair that is very limp and has no volume on its own.  I use Redken when my hair is damp and again after I&#x27;ve dried it with a blow dryer.  I think it adds a little extra volume when I add it to dry hair.  Anyway, it gives me great volume and I like it because I don&#x27;t end up having to tease my hair because it already looks like I did! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either, I can&#x27;t feel the product in my hair, it&#x27;s just bouncier and really full looking.  This product is great; will keep buying and hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy with this foam.  It is definitely not a styling foam so don&#x27;t make that mistake.  Sometimes it&#x27;s too much for my hair and just doesn&#x27;t seem to ever get dry when I&#x27;m blow-drying and other times it&#x27;s like I haven&#x27;t put anything on my hair at all. I bought the Body-Full shampoo first and loved it, so naturally I thought this would be great.  I&#x27;ll continue using this foam to try and find the right amount for my hair.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll add a follow up review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> It is fine. Works ok for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair but three squirts of this foam and my hair is thicker and much easier to manage. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but there was a difference... I&#x27;ve gotten better results with cheaper things though.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel super full of product which I like, but I don&#x27;t grab for it daily like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I have very thin/thinning hair and this product does help with volume</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Some volume. Allergic</li>
            <li> Great product for my fine hair</li>
            <li> This makes my hair dull and coarse. This cost&#x27;s way too much for the end results. Buy something else.Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Best product found for thin hair. Use very little after shampooing. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very light, does not weight hair down.  Pleased with this and use it daily.  Very easy to wash from hair .</li>
            <li> It dissolved into &amp;#34;nothingness&amp;#34; and has no effect whatsoever in adding volume. It also creates a film that makes hair sticky. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair kind of greasy, which is the exact opposite of what I was hoping for. The hunt continues...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best volume phones I have ever used. My hair is extremely thin and sparse. It does the job of giving it a little more volume.  It is in my opinion is extremely expensive. The price has gone up over the last year.  And the bottle seems to empty rather quickly.  Because of this I am giving it four stars.  Otherwise it would get fives</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work well for me. It seemed to leave my hair a little oily. I like Got 2B mousse better</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do well with my hair.  I find it hard to manage after using it, and I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li> Well rated for allergens on EWG web site.  Doesn&#x27;t smell, good product, hard to get in stores.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple years now and I really do love it.  It really gives my fine blonde hair some bounce and volume.  You do not need to use to much as if you do it will weigh your hair down.  I apply it to my clean wet hair and then blow dry on high and then style as usual.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This does a great job and delivers the results it promises.  Smells like fresh herbs.  Good value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My baby fine hair needs body and extra volume. This product works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and I like it!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Good volume. But not the best volume I&#x27;ve ever had-- kerastase&#x27;s volumizing mousse is better-- but it does a good job. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky. Solid volumizer, one star off because I like more volume.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on baby fine hair.  I have no idea what the other reviewers have, but I HAVE baby hair and this definitely does nothing.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! If you have baby fine or thin hair, this is the product to buy! Your hair will look super full and hold a great style when you use this pump foam styling product! I can&#x27;t get over how full and thick my hair looks! Does feel like a film on the hair but just a little bit! Doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or anything! It&#x27;s the best product for fullness, I&#x27;ve ever tried! I can&#x27;t be without it now! Buy it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> same as above, user of this for many years. Worth the little bit extra, when you use professional products, you tend to use less.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF EWG&#x27;S SKINDEEP&#x27;S RATING ON IT, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I love the Skindeep Database that EWG put together. I use it all the time. BUT it can be incorrect sometimes. Like for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because EWG rated this product as a zero and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. There was no way a big corporation like Redken could get a zero from EWG. EWG listed no information about the ingredients and I couldn&#x27;t find any other information online about what it contained. Maybe I&#x27;m crazy because I want an all-natural mousse, but I like to do my research. So I bought it. After I received it in the mail, I looked at the ingredients. It does contain parabens. In fact, IT RATES A 9! I decided to help EWG out and put all those long ingredients in their database. If you&#x27;re wondering, here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aqua/water/eau, amp-acrylates/allyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene glycol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, phenoxyethanol, decyl glucoside, potassium dimethicone peg-7 panthenyl phosphate, methylparaben, parfum/fragrance, polyacrylate-3, benzophenone-4, limonene, linalool, maltodextrin, hydrolyzed soy protein, citronellol, hydroxypropyltrimonium hydrolyzed wheat protein, butylphenyl methylpropional, amyl cinnammal, hexyl cinnamal, oleth-10, geraniol, disodium cocoamphodipropionate, gossypium herbaceum/cotton extract, octylacrylamide/acrylates/butylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer, lecithin, phosphoric acid, polyquaternium-10, ethylparaben, disodium edta&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one of those people who freak out about parabens or whatever, but I wanted the ingredients out there and for people who might be concerned about this to know. I am going to still try the product, but only on occasion, like when my husband takes me on dates and what not. I hope this review helps someone out. And always always ALWAYS do your research if you&#x27;re concerned about this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> Could not livewihout thi product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning (I&#x27;m 73) but still (more or less) brown (ok, some grey). I have tried a number of products in an attempt to improve the appearance of my hair, to give it more &#x27;fullness&#x27;. This Redkin product does the job! It&#x27;s not a quite miracle, but, I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> This product really does give volume to baby-fine hair which I, unfortunately, have. I haven&#x27;t found a product that does the job as well and I have tried lots of them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have thin baby fine hair. I researched products for my type of hair and tried this one. This product works great for me.  Now I need to find a good hairspray.</li>
            <li> It does what it says...body...yes..lots...for baby fine hair.  It lasts till you wash it out.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Citrusy aroma does not linger in hair.  Whew.  Smelly products give me a headache.  Definitely makes my thin hair feel much fuller and seems to keep my usually oily hair from turning so, so quickly.  THAT is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product for thin hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - my hairdresser recommended it.  I have thin, fine hair, and this product gives me a lot of volume.  I use about one pump and the bottle has lasted me probably 6 months.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing products and this one is the best so far. I can definitely tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I feel like I&#x27;m using it so quickly though and I only use it every other day. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. This came today,  it was NOT in its original packing. I  suspect I got someone&#x27;s old return. I will NEVER use this vendor again!</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and this product works great.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to get great results</li>
            <li> Gives my hair body without flaking</li>
            <li> All Redken products are awesome including this volumizing foam.  I have fine hair and this product works great to make my hair look and feel fuller.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product adds fullness like no other.  I wish it would add some shine as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Volumizing for quite some time.  It is one of the best products for my hair.</li>
            <li> works great on fine hair</li>
            <li> Redken products are always a good buy. I have very thick but very fine hair. This voluminizer works great and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Used this product for many years</li>
            <li> Thanks.  I really like this product.  It adds body without weight.  I had a hard time finding just what I needed.  I believe that this is it.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.  Love this product and works really well on baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is baby fine like mine, you will love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I really did not add volume to my hair like the other reviews said. I have thin hair so I would expect this product to do more than it did.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is expensive for my taste, it&#x27;s worth it.  I have a bob cut &amp; I use approximately 6 squirts and then blow-dry.  It makes your hair look full (and a bit stiff) even the next day (I wash my hair every other day). On the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair it sometimes looks even better.  It has a nice lasting scent also. I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a replacement for the old Redken Root Lifter that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> After trying all kinds of products, expensive or non-expensive, I&#x27;ve finally found one that really works on my baby fine hair.  It is an excellent product, &amp; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and really like how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the comments talk about it being sticky or too heavy.....I find that is the case ONLY if you use too much.  It works well.</li>
            <li> I have sparse baby fine hair, and even my co-workers noticed how much volume I now have..it works best when applying to the bottom hair of damp hair and than blow-dry</li>
            <li> This product really does help add body to my regularly thin and limp hair when used right before blow drying and curling.</li>
            <li> This product really adds volume to thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair and this was recommended by my stylist. Unfortunately she never has it, but Amazon does:)  Keeps my hair looking full and done all day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and does exactly what it claims ... if I could afford it, I would purchase it by the case!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s the hair foam for me. The package arrived promptly and everything looked perfect.</li>
            <li> I am not sold that this is the best product but it did an ok job.  I like Redken number 10 better for volume.</li>
            <li> This product dries your hair out bad!!  I used it once and will never use it again!  I like the look of soft flowy and silky hair. If you like this type of look as well, do not use this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or heavy. It is a 5-Star Redken product. I just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This works great for really fine hair.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it works great and a bottle will last a reasonably long time.</li>
            <li> This product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smells good but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;-pumps out a mousse that is just the right consistency so I don&#x27;t have to work so hard to get it evenly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-works VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;-lasts a long time. One or two pumps (if you have longer hair like me) is all I need for good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t dry out my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have baby fine hair (my curse), this will give you volume without losing shine and it will give it even if your hair is longer. A great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> light and great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for thinning hair.  It gives hair lots of volume without any stickiness.  It also has a very nice odor.</li>
            <li> I have always used root boost but found this and ordered through amazon.  It&#x27;s my new number one product for styling.  I rub into my roots around my head and comb through then use another products for texture and this helps with that.  Then blow dry and style.  Definite volume and texture.  Will be a regular product for me and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found to help make my hair look fuller. I put it on before using mousse &amp; gel.</li>
            <li> It works great on fine hair, giving it a lift without weighing it down.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great as always</li>
            <li> Works well with extra fine hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product to use - does what it advertises.  Thickens and adds body to fine hair.  However, you really need to wash it out of your hair by the 2nd day as it leaves a residue behind that weighs the hair down.  It also smells awesome like melons.  Yum.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about this product. Very expensive, and very poor quality, my hair after 20 minutes looked  awful no volume at all. I had purchase a different brand, a lot more cheap and worked twice better than this.</li>
            <li> I have super baby-fine hair and have trouble styling and maintaining a hair style. This stuff helps. It is supposed to be a foam but it comes out of the bottle as a liquid so I may be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I really like t his product it works better than other similar products and is easy to use etc. after washing hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, love almost every Redken product I buy.  This works even when I flat iron my hair.  I use the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and have always had thin, baby fine hair and now it&#x27;s even thinner on top due to age. This is a good mousse, use two pumps and my hair feels thicker and not sticky or weighed down. I have short hair and it lasts months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has baby fine hair.  Um, actually very thin patchy hair that is also fine and stick straight.  He loved this mouse so much that he asked me to buy more!  It has worked very well and looks very natural, not stiff or chalky.  I&#x27;m thrilled because anything that makes hair look better (and this does a great job at it) is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great solution for very fine hair.  Works fantastic.  I love it.  My hairdresser told me about this product and she uses it on my hair when I get it cut.</li>
            <li> Great product for volumizing hair along with the matching shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time without paying higher cost. Works well but as a thickener and bodifyer. Would recommend product and seller again if if you&amp;#34;re looking for something to hold your style, not so great but isn&#x27;t made for that. My mistake. I would defiantly use seller again (and product for what it was meant for which it works well).</li>
            <li> I have very straight  baby-fine, never colored or permed hair and thought this product would be ideal for me. I used it twice and then returned it. Both times after use my hair was dry, frizzy and brittle. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the products that really adds volume. I buy A LOT of volumizing products and can say this is the one that definitely works.</li>
            <li> Works great for my wavy hair!!! One of the best products that I have tried. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot and it is slightly cheaper buying it here than in the salon. I use it daily and love that it gives body without stiffness...</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this adds the body it lacks.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a year.  Sometimes my store doesn&#x27;t have it, but Amazon always does.  At the best price, too.</li>
            <li> This works also for thick hair, giving me volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> This is the best foam for fine hair...it performs as advertised! I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair issues!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and I struggle to find a product that will give it some body without making it look weighed down and greasy.  This is great!  It gives my hair a subtle lift and grip without weighing it down.  Also, the smell is wonderful!  I highly recommend to anyone with unruly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a product that will give my extremely fine hair body. This was NOT it. Waste of money. It Is the least affective of any product I have used and am using. Rarely do I give a bad review but this as costly as it is IMO di nothing,</li>
            <li> I really like this product . Use small amounts only ,or it can be too heavy, and a bit sticky. With the right amount, it does great on my hair, and for someone with  coarser hair that can take heavier products,  it think it  would work even better with less fear of it being too heavy.Theres not many products that I can use that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or sticky. This one is about as good as it gets for my particular kind of hair,. Leaves straight, fine  hair silky but volumized and full.  Lasts and Lasts!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday that I have my hair down and it is great! I have fine hair but you would never know that if I didn&#x27;t tell you! I put this in damp hair, blow-dry upside down, style, spray and I am done! It holds up for most of the day! Even looks fuller once the day is done and my hair is &#x27;done&#x27; for the day! Won&#x27;t need to touch up if you go out after work! LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Too stiff. I have very thin hair anyway - and although it holds well - I end up losing hair trying to style it - or even the next day when I wash it.</li>
            <li> expensive but works great, I used to buy this as a spritz which I think works better but I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore. Price is too high and if you have long hair like me you need more foam so it can run out quick so that&#x27;s the reason why I gave it 4 not 5 stars</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine and thin hair. It was recommended to me by someone and it&#x27;s great. You only use a small amount also.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel thicker</li>
            <li> Love it! Worked well with volumizing my thin hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise. The results did not continue, and I&#x27;m back to the flatness of before. In fact, I hardly notice a difference whether I use it or don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a few times and I just don&#x27;t see what everyone is raving about.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?  I have fine, mostly straight shoulder-length hair that I blow dry with a round brush.  Two pumps didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  More pumps just gave me stiff ends and stringy hair, but nothing in the way of volume.  It smells nice, but I like the results from Nexxus Mousse Plus better.  This stuff does have a lovely tea smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years &amp; it makes my baby fine blonde hair full &amp; wonderful! Thank you Redken :-)</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length baby fine hair and I thought it was just ok. I only used 2 pumps and started at the roots. It felt like I had too much product in my hair and my hair looked dull. It may us it up here and there but doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works well but you need to use a very small amount , if you use to much your hair will feel like glue</li>
            <li> I read countless reviews on Amazon to find a volumizer to replace my Kevin Murphy volumizing mousse. Unfortunately, the reviews for this product lead me astray. This foam, no matter how much or little I use, seems not to do anything good for my hair. What I do notice is that it makes my hands feel so sticky and my hair looks crunchy. The first time I used it, it brought me back to my junior high days of spray gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my fellow fine haired ladies, I would definitely recommend trying something else.</li>
            <li> Light product that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but not as much volume as expected.</li>
            <li> Best product out there.  Great for voluminizing and no residue.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine and straight hair. This product gave my hair texture and volume. I have tried a lot of volumizing hair products and this one is the only one I have found so far that really works for me.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  I have very thin, fine hair and never can get volume.  When I put this in my hair \\&quot;unbelievably\\&quot; the volume was thick and I could actually work well with my style. I will be getting another bottle soon, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see the volume. I mean, Yeah sure it&#x27;s there, but it&#x27;s slight. And I&#x27;ve been using about 4 pumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run it through my damp hair, root to tips after brushing it out. Sometimes I blowdry, sometimes airdry. Same results, maybe a little thicker with the hairdryer. I just don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not working for me. I&#x27;ll play around with it a little more, and hopefully I find the right amount, and perfect the whole application process thing. Maybe that&#x27;s where the problem lies?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. I have curly fine hair that just does whatever it wants whenever it wants to. Using this product, however, gave it lots of body. Maybe my hair is drier, I can&#x27;t really tell. Maybe it&#x27;s a little frizzy -- but it usually always is, regardless. This product doesn&#x27;t make it more of those things, but it DOES give it lots of body and THAT makes my hair look better overall. I have just below shoulder-length hair. First I put in some hair conditioner (Redkin if I have it), not the leave-in kind, but I leave it in anyway, and I then use three pumps of this bodifier, then dry with a blow dryer. I literally caught myself saying, for the first time in my life, that I like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> One of the best volumizers I&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t use the more common ones as my scalp is sensitive. This is gentle on my skin but still actually adds volume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is either great or a waste of money and time.  This is great.  I&#x27;ve tried so many mousses, gels. sprays and pastes in both the salon and discount store priced catergories.  I&#x27;ve given up on all because they didn&#x27;t work or they left my hair and scalp feeling sticky or greasy.  I read the reviews on this Redken Body Full Volumizing Foam for Baby FIne hair and decided I&#x27;d try one more.  I am so glad I bought this!  I am 54 and have very fine, thinning hair that is both permed for body and colored, it&#x27;s shorter and cut in layers.  I used a minimal/moderate amount, blow dried scrunching a bit and then used a curling iron and I achieved a salon look in a minimal amount of time.  This really did make my hair look thicker and helped to hold the style with body.  It had a good bit of humidity control also though I can&#x27;t say that I can promise that for everyone but it was a humid day and my hair held the body and style longer than usual.  I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, about twice a week and this kept  my hair looking fuller during the interim.  I will buy this again.  Don&#x27;t be put off thinking that the bottle is smaller because a little goes a long way.  This from the &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34; era!</li>
