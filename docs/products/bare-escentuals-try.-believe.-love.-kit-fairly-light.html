            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would cover as it is so light</li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use</li>
            <li>It worked out fine because I needed some travel size products.</li>
            <li>My fault for not reading fine print</li>
            <li>The product was fine</li>
            <li>As I know bare minerals is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, works great a little smaller than i would have liked but all in all great buy will continue to buy</li>
            <li>Color fairly light.  </li>
            <li>Hassle free.</li>
            <li>also really enjoy the brushes.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this I decided to give her a shot to go liquid makeup free.  </li>
            <li>Concealer Brush or Light Stroke</li>
            <li>coverage of blemishes for being so light</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, the matte powder is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t image in how light the lighter one is.</li>
            <li>Veil Finishing Powder in Original (size:</li>
            <li>After about a month I still have almost both of the foundation containers still full.</li>
            <li>and i have the full size set for home.</li>
            <li>The delivery came quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m as white as they come, freckly with blue eyes and this shade was perfect.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the medium color this time the fairly light.</li>
            <li>Now my foundation stays on strong for much longer.</li>
            <li>Amazing the difference that extra step makes.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>I use a foundation under it and use the Bare essentials powder on top.  </li>
            <li>Love bare minerals.</li>
            <li>more prominent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals line.  </li>
            <li>This lasts so much longer!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time with the mineral veil, though.</li>
            <li>kit did not come with directions on which to put on first or how to put it on so just had to you</li>
            <li>First of all, this took FOREVER to get to me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and am very dissappointed with this!  </li>
            <li>First, it comes with NO instructions on how to apply.  </li>
            <li>My only complain is that I wish the containers held a bit more powder</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>light, I can barely feel it on my skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I love the product Iam 60 years old and want to use less makeup  but still hide a few wrinkles lol</li>
            <li>, It looked really powdery on my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like you have too much makeup on because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get stuck in all the creases like a heavier powder will.  </li>
            <li>Feel I paid too much for the amount received.</li>
            <li>but it really covers.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>It is all just shades of beige, but I have a light yellow tint in my skin.</li>
            <li>After a fews days of use, you figure out how much product to use and the application become much quicker.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how many reviews say the kit only lasted a week or 2.  </li>
            <li>Most other foundations, do.</li>
            <li>So I personally used liquid foundation all my life, and had heard so many things about Bare Minerals years ago</li>
            <li>For $10 more I could have bought almost half a years worth of bare minerals foundation somewhere else.</li>
            <li>looks really natural!!</li>
            <li>Love this little 30 day kit for my purse</li>
            <li>but I tried it and like it, and normally would&#x27;ve never bought the full-size.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re applying the makeup right, this kit should last over a month.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try some new make up</li>
            <li>I ordered this with amazon prime two day shipping and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li>My expectation is that it would be in new condition and it just clearly did not meet that expectation.</li>
            <li>I paid nearly 50$ for this product.</li>
            <li>We have bought these kits before for the same price but got atleast twice as much makeup than came in this kit.</li>
            <li>Unfortuanatly after i bought it i developed mrsa in my sinus&#x27;s had nothing to do with the make</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s compact enough to not take up much cabinet space.</li>
            <li>Young or old.</li>
            <li>but the purchase was completely misleading.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it highly to  even younger women that does not want to get in a rountine of liquid foundation and find out&lt;br /&gt;in  </li>
            <li>Been using Bare Minerals for 3 years now!</li>
            <li>She is a little reluctant, but once I explained the routine, she was willing to give it a shot, and she loves it too!  </li>
            <li>foundations (Original SPF 15 Foundation (size: small) and Matte SPF 15 Foundation (size:</li>
            <li>LOVE bare minerals but not happy with this company</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Kit.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Bare Minerals before.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for traveling as I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years.  </li>
            <li>I paid fifty bucks including shipping for a months work of bare minerals as well as two mini brushes.</li>
            <li>Love these products, they just need to be bigger , the sample sizes are WAY too small and won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>For me, Bare Essentials is not enough.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re truly trying bareMinerals for the first time, then I recommend using it with blush or bronzer; otherwise, the color will probably be too pasty or pale for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this starter set&#x27;s job has been fulfilled, because I have found at least two products that I will buy in full size next time!</li>

            <li> It is actually cheaper than the Neutrogena when you consider how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> But this kit will not last you very long.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that this is a VERY small set.</li>
            <li> Best alternative if your sick, and tired of plastering yourself with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending it back and ordering loose powder by itself.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it I was so excited, but as soon as I opened the package I was beyond angry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time BE user, and adore all their coverage products.</li>
            <li> Mineral makeup goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long</li>
            <li> Save the small containers for future traveling-otherwise, you have to bring an entirely separate makeup bag just for your mineral</li>
            <li> Also, the outside of the packaging was a little worn.</li>
            <li> Applies as expected, lasts in the heat.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I was never able to find a makeup product that didn&#x27;t make me feel like a cake monster...until I tried bare minerals.</li>
            <li> But, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i would never use any other make up for my face</li>
            <li> I used these in the past but switched to a similar product by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> loose powder can be messy.</li>
            <li> Once I opened the box to inspect the product itself, I was a little more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> very small pieces , thought they were bigger for the price</li>
            <li> The make up feels a little heavier than I was expecting</li>
            <li> The items were clearly still sealed and had not been opened, however, they were wrapped in this weird tissue paper.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of wear it moves into the lines on your face.</li>
            <li> A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I get what others say in the previous reviews - this kit is really, REALLY small.</li>
            <li> The size of the kit for a 30 day trial was way, way, way to small of an amount.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, nothing about this stated it was a starter kit and that the makeup containers would be the small size that they were.</li>
            <li> Brushes are small .</li>
            <li> so I just got this small 30 day kit.</li>
            <li> This set is a 30 day trial so its small products.</li>
            <li> days late, but the box the makeup came in didn&#x27;t even match the picture of what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> af ew years ifs thick on the skin and clogging your pores ,and making wrinkles look</li>
            <li> Sizes are very small.  </li>
            <li> I looks like you have old fashioned base makeup on.  </li>
            <li> Now my skin has broken out in acne, I think the makeup caused it.</li>
            <li> Sent me the wrong shade and won&#x27;t exchange.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Not happy about that!!!!</li>
            <li> and this make up isnt to bad...</li>
            <li> It drys out my skin really bad, the colors don&#x27;t match my skin tones.</li>
            <li> So these colors just make me look sick.</li>
            <li> I thought I had read the description of the product thoroughly, but when I received it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be warned that once you order it, it is ours, or you will have to pay the S&amp;H charges for the return.  :(  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i loved it, it makes my face look completly clean and smooth. i would never use any other make up for my face i am in love with it people cant even tell i have it on it looks really natural!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be a mini version of everything I got.  its like a sample kit too over priced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this product for a while. I followed the instructions and applied the makeup, It looked really powdery on my face.</li>
            <li> The size of the kit for a 30 day trial was way, way, way to small of an amount.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> For me, Bare Essentials is not enough.  I use a foundation under it and use the Bare essentials powder on top.  It doesn&#x27;t look like you have too much makeup on because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get stuck in all the creases like a heavier powder will.  My mom also tried it while she was up and she also really liked it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time,  however I did not know it was a travel size. It worked out fine because I needed some travel size products. Applies as expected, lasts in the heat. Not so great for photos. It was not packaged well this time, and the boxes were smashed inside.</li>
            <li> Not only did the package come 3+ days late, but the box the makeup came in didn&#x27;t even match the picture of what I thought I was ordering. Not to mention, nothing about this stated it was a starter kit and that the makeup containers would be the small size that they were. Definitely not with the 50$ I paid for it. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works great a little smaller than i would have liked but all in all great buy will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Kit.  Color fairly light.  the item is just as pictured and the one shopped.  Hassle free. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product is a 30 day trial kit which cost maybe 25$ in store! I paid nearly 50$ for this product. LOVE bare minerals but not happy with this company WHAT SO EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter in law. I would be embarrassed to give it to her. Everything is teeny tiny. I am sending it back. I have bought Bare Minerals before.  This is overpriced.</li>
            <li> I get what others say in the previous reviews - this kit is really, REALLY small. But, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had this for over a month now and haven&#x27;t even come close to running out of foundation.</li>
            <li> Feel I paid too much for the amount received. Brushes are small . My fault for not reading fine print</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these products this is certainly a great way to try them. I used these in the past but switched to a similar product by Neutrogena. I recently decided to go back because I felt like I was constantly buying the Neutrogena. I ordered this set about a month ago and I was right. This lasts so much longer!  It is actually cheaper than the Neutrogena when you consider how long it lasts. After about a month I still have almost both of the foundation containers still full. I use it daily so this product is definitely a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy the brushes.</li>
            <li> very small pieces , thought they were bigger for the price</li>
            <li> I love it. It feels great on my face, and I like the way it looks. The delivery came quickly.</li>
            <li> have used these for years - good product</li>
            <li> I got this try kit because I wanted the smaller sizes to use in a travel bag. Loved that it came with mini sized brushes, too. I&#x27;m a long time BE user, and adore all their coverage products. Medium coverage. With the bisque, I find almost any of my imperfections can be covered. And non of these products aggravate my acne. Most other foundations, do. It&#x27;s my first time with the mineral veil, though. Now I love BE even more! Amazing the difference that extra step makes. Now my foundation stays on strong for much longer.</li>
            <li> Great item, good price.</li>
            <li> Sent me the wrong shade and won&#x27;t exchange.</li>
            <li> Love these products, they just need to be bigger , the sample sizes are WAY too small and won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would cover as it is so light but it really covers. I have melasma and it covers the discoloration so well.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I had expected. I thought I had read the description of the product thoroughly, but when I received it I was disappointed. The product is a one month trial size so it is smaller then I had envisioned. Also, the outside of the packaging was a little worn. The corner of the box was folded and some of the ink was worn off. Once I opened the box to inspect the product itself, I was a little more disappointed. The items were clearly still sealed and had not been opened, however, they were wrapped in this weird tissue paper. It was obvious that someone had opened the box and handled the product. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have minded if this item was for me, but I bought this as a gift for someone. My expectation is that it would be in new condition and it just clearly did not meet that expectation. The product was fine but overall this did not meet my expectations. I would not buy it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love bareMinerals. Good package if you are unsure of the color you need. But this kit will not last you very long.</li>
            <li> Been using Bare Minerals for 3 years now! absolutely love it.. can&#x27;t go a without it. Love this little 30 day kit for my purse and i have the full size set for home. MUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> To start off with I received a different kit than I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I called and instead of switching out the kits they wanted me to pay the difference bc the kit I wanted had gone up in price&lt;br /&gt;The color of the concealer was different than the color of the makeup</li>
            <li> Got this for my soon to be mother in law. She really likes it. She doesn&#x27;t do anything for herself, so I got this for her because she deserves it.</li>
            <li> So I personally used liquid foundation all my life, and had heard so many things about Bare Minerals years ago I decided to try it.  I am SO glad I did!! I do not use ANYTHING else, and have been trying to give my daughter samples here and there to see how she liked it, so when I saw this I decided to give her a shot to go liquid makeup free.  She is a little reluctant, but once I explained the routine, she was willing to give it a shot, and she loves it too!  Great makeup, shipped fast, that is good for your skin!!! Why are you waiting to buy this?</li>
            <li> For a sample this is a great price!  I loved that it came wih brushes as well... love love love!</li>
            <li> I loved how fast my order came in and, I love love love the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for traveling. Tip: Save the small containers for future traveling-otherwise, you have to bring an entirely separate makeup bag just for your mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is only designed to have a 30 day supply.  Mineral makeup goes a long way.  I&#x27;m surprised at how many reviews say the kit only lasted a week or 2.  Mine has lasted well over a month.  If you&#x27;re applying the makeup right, this kit should last over a month. Go to the actual bareminerals website to find out how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with:&lt;br /&gt;2 foundations (Original SPF 15 Foundation (size: small) and Matte SPF 15 Foundation (size: small)&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Veil Finishing Powder in Original (size: small)&lt;br /&gt;SPF 20 Concealer in Bisque (size: petite)&lt;br /&gt;Mini Full Flawless Face Brush&lt;br /&gt;Mini Concealer Brush or Light Stroke Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside to this collection is that it doesn&#x27;t include blush or bronzer. If you&#x27;re truly trying bareMinerals for the first time, then I recommend using it with blush or bronzer; otherwise, the color will probably be too pasty or pale for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used bareMinerals for years and love it! This kit is a great introduction to the makeup and is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some new make up and this make up isnt to bad...Like the coverage and color. wish tho it came with some instruction tho</li>
            <li> It drys out my skin really bad, the colors don&#x27;t match my skin tones. The first time I tried the medium color this time the fairly light. It is all just shades of beige, but I have a light yellow tint in my skin. So these colors just make me look sick. After a few hours of wear it moves into the lines on your face. Now my skin has broken out in acne, I think the makeup caused it.</li>
            <li> Love the product &amp; this was a perfect way to get started inexpensively. It does not come with the &amp;#34;warmth,&amp;#34; so you have to purchase that separately. This is an awesome product. I&#x27;ll never use regular makeup again!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long and I was skeptical so I just got this small 30 day kit. A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing coverage of blemishes for being so light&lt;br /&gt;Very light, I can barely feel it on my skin&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit did not come with directions on which to put on first or how to put it on so just had to you tube it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try it sooner!</li>
            <li> I ordered this with amazon prime two day shipping and it arrived a day early! I decided to try this product wanting to get away from liquid foundations and to control oiliness and it works great. After a fews days of use, you figure out how much product to use and the application become much quicker. This set is a 30 day trial so its small products. If you have oily skin, the matte powder is FANTASTIC. Also, I&#x27;m as white as they come, freckly with blue eyes and this shade was perfect. I can&#x27;t image in how light the lighter one is.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for traveling as I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years.  Sizes are very small.  Perfect for traveling or if you need a set to keep in your office.  Also would be a good choice for trying if you&#x27;ve never used this product.</li>
            <li> We have bought these kits before for the same price but got atleast twice as much makeup than came in this kit. May have been our fault for not reading but I think it was misleading.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals&#x3D; Perfect product. Best alternative if your sick, and tired of plastering yourself with liquid foundation. Now that I found this, I vow to never again return to liquid!</li>
            <li> First of all, this took FOREVER to get to me. When I finally got it I was so excited, but as soon as I opened the package I was beyond angry. Nowhere in the product description does it say how TINY these are. Not only will these NOT last a month like the product description says, I doubt they&#x27;ll last even two weeks. I&#x27;m sending it back and ordering loose powder by itself. Not worth the hassle in my opinion. Plus I&#x27;m out $6 for shipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortuanatly after i bought it i developed mrsa in my sinus&#x27;s had nothing to do with the make up.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Had to throw out all my make up. I will definatly be buying the bigger kit soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and am very dissappointed with this!  First, it comes with NO instructions on how to apply.  I had to look this up on line.  Second the coverage is not what is advertised.  I looks like you have old fashioned base makeup on.  I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was never able to find a makeup product that didn&#x27;t make me feel like a cake monster...until I tried bare minerals. I love it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FROM A GREAT SUPPLIER......THANKS</li>
            <li> I love this starter kit! The colors fit perfectly to my skin and are pigmented so wonderfully! My skin still has room to breathe and it glows. My only complain is that I wish the containers held a bit more powder but it is a starter kit and contains everything you need! Great if you just want to give it a try and aren&#x27;t sure which color to get. Love this makeup!!!</li>
            <li> Great price to try these products. I like that it includes the regular sized concealer brush and two types of foundation (matte and regular). I never thought I would use matte but I tried it and like it, and normally would&#x27;ve never bought the full-size. I actually just keep all the products in the box it came in and store it that way b/c it&#x27;s compact enough to not take up much cabinet space. I think this starter set&#x27;s job has been fulfilled, because I have found at least two products that I will buy in full size next time!</li>
            <li> Love bare minerals. I will never use another brand of mineral make up again! It does a wonderful job! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the product Iam 60 years old and want to use less makeup  but still hide a few wrinkles lol and this produt does that..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it highly to  even younger women that does not want to get in a rountine of liquid foundation and find out&lt;br /&gt;in  af ew years ifs thick on the skin and clogging your pores ,and making wrinkles look more prominent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> As I know bare minerals is a very nice product. Just be aware that this is a VERY small set. Mini is for sure. Kind of like a travel set.</li>
            <li> Covers anything and everything. Everyone will love this product. Young or old. So grab some and look how amazing your flaws look when they vanish</li>
            <li> I love, love BareMinerals and have been useing it for years.  Wanted to get this as a gift for xmas, then found out someone else already did (after I ordered it). So I jumped on before it was even shipped to cancel the order and this seller would/will not cancle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be warned that once you order it, it is ours, or you will have to pay the S&amp;H charges for the return.  :(  Not happy about that!!!!</li>
            <li> The make up feels a little heavier than I was expecting but It has fairly good coverage.  I do suggest the pressed powder version if you are a woman on the go...loose powder can be messy.</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals line.  This is a great &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; product.  Be aware that the sizes are quite small, and so is the brush.  This is exactly what I wanted.  Good for travel.</li>
            <li> In no way did the description indicate that this kit was a one month trial size. I paid fifty bucks including shipping for a months work of bare minerals as well as two mini brushes. For $10 more I could have bought almost half a years worth of bare minerals foundation somewhere else. I love the product itself and I love how it works but the purchase was completely misleading. I got ripped off..</li>
