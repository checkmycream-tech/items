            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I naturally went to Wal-Mart for these, and not carrying them, they feature alternative companies, which is a good idea.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Sincerely, john...</li>
            <li>Adequate number in packet.</li>
            <li>They apply easily and they really work well</li>
            <li>They were great for a few days.  </li>
            <li>They look great and really work for preventing slipping in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>Stick really well and have a good surface to keep me from slipping.  </li>
            <li>First one came off two days after installing.</li>
            <li>I really wanted flower shapes</li>
            <li>I talked with some very helpful people who helped me through the checkout process.</li>
            <li>so I could cover the whole tub.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend this pack for anyone looking for inexpensive, very functional tub non-skid stickers.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a little bit of a better color, but received exactly what was pictured.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li>high hopes</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and sticking like no other.  </li>
            <li>These are not easy to find any more</li>
            <li>These little stars seem to work just fine for us.</li>
            <li>Just the other day, 2 of the wavy stickers pulled up, but the blue stars that came in this pack are still sticking strong.</li>
            <li>So far, they have stuck to the tub well.</li>
            <li>Works well in bathtub for my 4 yr and 1-1/2 yr old.</li>
            <li>These decals really stuck to the tub after properly cleaning the bottom of the tub.</li>
            <li>There are a few left, but most came off within 10 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 7 large stars and 7 little stars that you separate from one another, and I would have needed 2 packs to fill the tub with the pattern I wanted, but I had just bought one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They were very easy to apply to the tub, just follow the directions for a long-lasting application.  They look great and really work for preventing slipping in the tub.  Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> First one came off two days after installing. The rest were off by two weeks.</li>
            <li> We could not find this type of product at a local store anymore. So far, they have stuck to the tub well. I prefer this type of product to a bath mat. The tub is still easy to clean and I don&#x27;t have to hang the bath mat on the wall to dry.</li>
            <li> Recently rented an older house with porcelain tubs and slipped in the shower a few times.  Bougt these and followed installation instructions to the letter.  They were great for a few days.  There are a few left, but most came off within 10 days.  Crappy product!!</li>
            <li> These are not easy to find any more so I was happy to see them &amp; they were just perfect. Good quality , sticking well .</li>
            <li> I read the two reviews about these not sticking so I thought I better include a review. I bought these about 7 months ago when my baby started standing in the bathtub and I was worried he was going to slip. I initially put them in his plastic bathtub and had some left over and put them in the regular tub as well. I have not had any issue with them coming off yet! Great product and I am getting another package now that my son is so mobile in the bathtub now and I can&#x27;t get him not to stop walking around :)</li>
            <li> Great in the shower!  Stick really well and have a good surface to keep me from slipping.  They look nice, too.  Good deal for the price, too.</li>
            <li> Didnt like this product at all..Did what the directions said, let them dry and stick for a couple of days before using the shower and once I got in the shower and turned on the water, all the appliques, moved all over the floor of the shower stall.. So I just put them on the back splash walls for a decoration. I didnt like this product at all, but I did like the star shaped.</li>
            <li> came off after a week.</li>
            <li> no good wont stay on tile</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase. I followed the instructions (waited the amount of time required) and didn&#x27;t have any problems with them peeling off. They&#x27;re still in place and not even the edges are curling up.</li>
            <li> 14 decals are advertised, but only 7 are included. You pop out the inside for the additional 7. However,my package only contained 6.</li>
            <li> Work well on our tile in the shower.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for and sticking like no other.  I like &#x27;em...</li>
            <li> Thanks, these are excellent. They apply easily and they really work well and they last well. Thank you. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these! I used two packs of them to make one of our bathroom tub slip-free. There are 2 different sizes of stars, so the pics you see are actually a thick outline and a smaller star inside of it.</li>
            <li> only last a short time in the tub even tho i cleaned tub and used alcohol wipes befor sticking them down. think product sat on the shelf too long paper backing looked discolored when i recieved package.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 months all stars fell off.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Color as pictured.  Was hoping for a little bit of a better color, but received exactly what was pictured.  Works well in bathtub for my 4 yr and 1-1/2 yr old.</li>
            <li> Great item...sticks to the tub and is a life saver!</li>
            <li> Product only stayed stuck on the tub surface for 17 days before beginning to peel off. Only one has survived. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Price was right.</li>
            <li> I really wanted flower shapes but you didn&#x27;t offer them so we went with the stars. I haven&#x27;t actually put them down yet,as they are going on our houseboat and we have shut it down for the winter. I am sure they will look and do just great and spruce up the bathroom also. Thank you. I could not find these in any store.</li>
            <li> I have had these stickers in my bumpy-bottom vinyl shower for 5 months now, and every one is still stuck firmly.  I followed the directions exactly, especially thoroughly cleaning the surface.  After I stuck them on I firmly pressed each one with my fingers to get out any bubbles.  None of them have loosened up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 14 pieces include the 7 larger star outlines and 7 smaller punch out star-shaped centers. I&#x27;m ordering another set to fill in more area.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these. Cleaned, rinsed, and dried my tub thoroughly. Placed appliques and waited 24 hours as directed by the instructions on the package. They worked great for three days. Since then they&#x27;ve been peeling up. I lose one or two every time I shower. Out of 28 appliques only six remain. Back to the drawing board!  :(</li>
            <li> These decals do provide some safety in my shower but I don&#x27;t feel they do enough. Cute star design. Adequate number in packet.</li>
            <li> Initially, when I went on the site, I found my product, but couldn&#x27;t find the checkout tab. In frustration, I sent a nasty email to the office and decided to shop somewhere else. They responded immediately and were so apologetic and helpful, I decided to call. I talked with some very helpful people who helped me through the checkout process. My hat is off and a deep bow to the personnel who helped me and ALSO to the managament folks who hired these people. Truly, a company asset ! I chose these decals because of the design, color, pricing...I liked them when I spotted them. Once they were down in a definite&lt;br /&gt;pattern, I was very impressed. My cleaning lady did the pattern-layout, as I have acute COPD, am on oxygen 24/7 and tire easily. She is very artistic and did a tremendous job ! Before the decals, I used a tub mat with small suction cups, which was a hazzard waiting to happen. I naturally went to Wal-Mart for these, and not carrying them, they feature alternative companies, which is a good idea. Let Wal-Mart do their advertising for them.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product and this company over anything else, to everyone. Thanks, Sincerely, john...</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I would prefer to buy them anytime I need them. It&#x27;s awesome, it&#x27;s worth your money, I think it&#x27;s great, you might too. Buy it buy it buy it!</li>
            <li> As advertised, They worked very well and look good too. Gives grip even in the slickest shampoos, soaps, etc. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a tee, yet in about 2 weeks they started peeling! less than a month total all were gone.&lt;br /&gt;had high hopes because at 1st seemed like it was going to be perfect for my needs but it ended in disappointment:(</li>
            <li> These decals really stuck to the tub after properly cleaning the bottom of the tub. Stick them in perfect design or scatter casually and they will look great.</li>
            <li> These little stars seem to work just fine for us. It&#x27;s 7 large stars and 7 little stars that you separate from one another, and I would have needed 2 packs to fill the tub with the pattern I wanted, but I had just bought one. I actually already had a few remainders from a different pack of wavy stickers, so I supplemented the 14 of these stars with 4 of the wavy ones so I could cover the whole tub. I put all of them in the tub on the same day and they&#x27;ve gotten regular use for several months now. Just the other day, 2 of the wavy stickers pulled up, but the blue stars that came in this pack are still sticking strong. I&#x27;m planning to purchase another pack of these to fill in the gaps and I&#x27;d recommend this pack for anyone looking for inexpensive, very functional tub non-skid stickers.</li>
            <li> Very poor waste of money and time to order. They so not stick.</li>
            <li> I have used these before and still have half of them intact in the bathtub.</li>
