            <li>seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but i&#x27;ve received a pack of three feet creams instead of hands</li>

            <li>Works great even the Healthy feet.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and well worth it.</li>
            <li>He said it worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried over the years!  </li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s has truly made my life better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These two are a perfect combo, It doesn&#x27;t matter which one&#x27;s used first, but use them both.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the stuff!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Realy, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>She loved both products and so I have opted to order some more for her.</li>
            <li>I own a farm and the work</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the improvement in my winter worn hands.  </li>
            <li>not a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect some kind of resolution...</li>
            <li>I really am pleased and will be purchasing more to keep her happy.</li>
            <li>He said he really liked that it isn&#x27;t oily, and it surprisingly light for how very effective it is.  </li>
            <li>Healthy Feet Cream is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best products for hands and feet that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>No one has tried the foot lotion yet, but if it&#x27;s even half as good as the hand cream, we know it will be great stuff!</li>
            <li>My hands feel so much better since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I love O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Husband love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product too and have started to use it all the time, which is why I was shopping for a value pack.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the hand cream, I still haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream</li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream...</li>
            <li>However, the feet cream worked best and faster, but I believe it is because my hands are constantly being abused by work and weather.  </li>
            <li>My hands have healed better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have tried many of the products on the market that claim to help with dryness and NONE</li>
            <li>so buy what ever one is cheaper at the time :)</li>
            <li>The foot creme was a bonus, but boy, am I glad I got both.</li>
            <li>They both LOVE it</li>
            <li>the feet cream is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Foot cream is also just ok</li>
            <li>Much better than lotions.  </li>
            <li>it really works great</li>
            <li>love this hand lotion... wont use anything else again</li>
            <li>In retrospect don&#x27;t know why I bought the Healthy feet cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I did notice that the price is so much better here on Amazon that at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Much better than the water based lotions  </li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream ::</li>
            <li>I love both the hand and the foot cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to make it go away,  just prevents the dryness from advancing,  but much better results than the top lotion brands</li>
            <li>This cream erases many sins on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Bought for the wife as a stocking stuffer and she could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s working hand and Healthy feet</li>
            <li>I bought these just hoping they would help the dryness ( which would help with the cracking as well), but they have done so much more - the chemo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with both of these creams.  </li>
            <li>It is the best for dry &amp; cracked skin!</li>
            <li>Working great so far.</li>
            <li>O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Hand and Foot cream worked better and faster than any prescription medicines that I had filled from doctors.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I used the products and liked it so much we had to order more.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect a strong smell.</li>
            <li>My love&#x27;s hands were nice, soft, and healthy after just 2 - 3 nights of applications.</li>
            <li>He was super stoked!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nurse and my hands are always so dry, and with all the great reviews I thought I would love this.</li>
            <li>Love the working hands, not crazy about the feet stuff...</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free</li>
            <li>More than worth the price.</li>
            <li>The foot cream is wonderful but the hand leaves you feeling sticky not smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried every cream or lotion available.  </li>
            <li>These are truly miracle cremes---my hands and feet are noticeably better when I wake up after putting this stuff on right before bed.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was very light</li>
            <li>My feet feel like they were freshly pedicured!  </li>
            <li>Great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for dry cracked fingers.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t have cracked skin anymore as long as I use this product would recommend to everyone love love love this</li>
            <li>It is good for the healing, but not a long term solution.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry hands and feet!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon resolved the shipping error and made things right - 5 Stars to Amazon for customer service!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough how great this stuff really is!</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned this is the best product for cracking and dry skin on the hands ever made..</li>
            <li>shopping for the product, I of course head right to Amazon to see what was available.  </li>
            <li>This is by far and away the best product for very dry, cracking, splitting skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super, super picky about lotions and how my hands feel after.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>A little high priced ; however, a good value as it works!!</li>
            <li>easy ordering - fast delivery</li>
            <li>Not greasy and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it really does help fix chapped &amp; cracked hands!!</li>
            <li>I am hoping this is the first winter that my fingers don&#x27;t crack and split like in years past---OW!</li>
            <li>I also love that the lid has bumps that make it easy to open.</li>
            <li>If not for this, our hands would appear to be mostly muscle and bone tissue, and no one would come near us.  </li>
            <li>but it immediately is absorbed into the area.</li>
            <li>It is the only hand cream I have found to be effective.</li>
            <li>Even my kids like it and now trust that any discomfort is temporary and worth it.  </li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and have found this to be the only successful remedy.</li>
            <li>Hands don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling, but I put this on right before bed.</li>
            <li>My brother-in-law and sister and their daughter liked these so much, that my initial purchase was quickly taken away.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for rough dry skin on fingertips</li>
            <li>And so far O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s feels great on my dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>I was not given the option to \\&quot;view/file a claim,\\&quot; to report the missing item (I am able to do this with most purchases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is much thicker and works nearly as well as petroleum jelly, better than petroleum jelly if you have a habit of rubbing it off.</li>
            <li>I like the O&amp;#34;ekeeffe&amp;#34;s very much.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s creams are quite effective.</li>
            <li>I find OKeeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream is ideal to use for dry, cracking hands in the ultra dry climate of Colorado.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>and he also really likes it!</li>
            <li>We love the product however we have since found it at a lower price in stores locally</li>
            <li>which was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Pack\\&quot; was about $8 more than buying the jars individually.  </li>
            <li>Used it on the second night and if by magic my hands were healed.</li>
            <li>enjoyed the hand cream enough that I tried the foot cream as well.</li>
            <li>I would have tried it there first.</li>
            <li>Fixes cracked hands fast!</li>
            <li>Just use it at bedtime, as it is pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li>First ingredient is water.</li>
            <li>It is a more solid cream</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>They called again the second morning and pronounced the cream a miracle because their hands were feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this foot cream and starting to see results with hand cream.</li>
            <li>I still feel the same about the size of the product &amp; the pricing though; I was expecting a better \\&quot;bang for the buck.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I suffer from extremely dry skin and eczema, and I have tried every lotion under the sun but had never had such amazing results until I started using this product!</li>
            <li>We keep on buying more as needed, because they work so well on our dry hands and cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>I work in food service and wash my hands many times in a day.as a result they wore dry and cracked.working hands reversed this in no time at all.</li>
            <li>Nice to have two people in our lives from separate sides of the family to give the same review at the exact same time!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>It really is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>Used for years, works very well.</li>
            <li>Healed my cracked fingers fast.</li>
            <li>Rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My feet take a real beating.  </li>
            <li>It is not a greasy feeling, I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li>I expected something more.</li>
            <li>My wife said that these are really helping her hands and feet</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for my hands which tend for the skin to crack in the cold weather.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>I found that either will also work on your feet very well.  </li>
            <li>Helps cracks heal and moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this and really likes it.</li>
            <li>The foot cream works very well also.</li>
            <li>this stuff helps them from becoming dry and cracked..</li>
            <li>This cream works better than any other lotion or cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>Much better than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>During the winters in NH I developed severe dry cracked hands that didn&#x27;t seem to get better with any moisturizing lotion or cream, until I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Finally my hands are crack free and soft ahhhhhh</li>
            <li>Both called the next morning and said their hand were starting to feel better already overnight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different foot care products over the years but this one is the only one that&#x27;s virtually eliminated the cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more shortly, but only use about 1 container each year for the three of us.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.l</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s home health nurse recommended it highly though, so maybe it works for some but not others.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes my feet feel better after a long day of working in boots.</li>
            <li>Right now I am using it as maintenance to keep the problem from coming back.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and do not wear shoes unless I have to.  </li>
            <li>Rapid to quick response for dry or cracking hands.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hands and fingers very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when after a couple of days of using Working Hands that the problem with dryness and splitting&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always seen O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s - finally decided to give it a try and the stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I started using it morning and night, and within about 2 weeks, my hands were completely healed!</li>
            <li>Although I have found the ingredients are exactly the same in each</li>
            <li>This is the first product that we have used that works, to prevent dryness and eliminates cracks former around finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cream (completely odorless, however they manage that!)</li>
            <li>Sinks into skin quickly and leaves no grease.</li>
            <li>The hand cream was fantastic at healing split and cracked hands and the foot cream repaired dry heels after only a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li>Most just give a little oily moisturizing, but this product is different!  </li>
            <li>really well I&#x27;m constantly washing bar glasses this lotion once you put on</li>
            <li>No dried out, cracked and bleeding feet anymore.  </li>
            <li>It has restored my hands and feet to their smooth feeling and not so cracked &amp; dried.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Really helped my hands, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>If left along, it really helps the healing process.</li>
            <li>Neither had the painful cracks in their hands and were able to work with them like they hadn&#x27;t been able to for several months.  </li>
            <li>It is available in stores with only a little price increase.</li>
            <li>Hands and feet were very cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li>It really works for dry and cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Since using working hands everyday the condition of my hands have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>This stuff really hold my dry hands at bay!</li>
            <li>&quot; They should clearly state the size of the product container rather than only posting photos of items that appear larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that heals his skin promptly and keeps his hands &amp; feet moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>My husband has had dry hands for so long and it was causing so much itch.</li>
            <li>And the instructions are right - a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>We have tried many other products with little to no success.  </li>
            <li>This product stings a bit when going onto truly raw, dry hands, but once they are healed, maintenance is painless, just a little before bed keeps things soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Well worth trying, especially if you are hard on your hands and feet like I am.</li>
            <li>The humidity in my house was high enough in the winter for the water vapor to condense on the roofing nail tips and drip down on the attic floor and ceiling sheetrock.  </li>

            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but i&#x27;ve received a pack of three feet creams instead of hands</li>
            <li> Good Value.</li>
            <li> Nice feel to it and very effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent results and quickly for my dried/chapped hands and heels.  </li>
            <li> works great love this stuff....</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it is great as well.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great even the Healthy feet.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and well worth it.</li>
            <li> He said it worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried over the years!  </li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s has truly made my life better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These two are a perfect combo, It doesn&#x27;t matter which one&#x27;s used first, but use them both.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Realy, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> She loved both products and so I have opted to order some more for her.</li>
            <li> I own a farm and the work</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the improvement in my winter worn hands.  </li>
            <li> not a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect some kind of resolution...</li>
            <li> I really am pleased and will be purchasing more to keep her happy.</li>
            <li> He said he really liked that it isn&#x27;t oily, and it surprisingly light for how very effective it is.  </li>
            <li> Healthy Feet Cream is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best products for hands and feet that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> No one has tried the foot lotion yet, but if it&#x27;s even half as good as the hand cream, we know it will be great stuff!</li>
            <li> My hands feel so much better since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I love O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Husband love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product too and have started to use it all the time, which is why I was shopping for a value pack.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the hand cream, I still haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream...</li>
            <li> However, the feet cream worked best and faster, but I believe it is because my hands are constantly being abused by work and weather.  </li>
            <li> My hands have healed better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many of the products on the market that claim to help with dryness and NONE</li>
            <li> so buy what ever one is cheaper at the time :)</li>
            <li> The foot creme was a bonus, but boy, am I glad I got both.</li>
            <li> They both LOVE it</li>
            <li> the feet cream is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Foot cream is also just ok</li>
            <li> Much better than lotions.  </li>
            <li> it really works great</li>
            <li> love this hand lotion... wont use anything else again</li>
            <li> In retrospect don&#x27;t know why I bought the Healthy feet cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I did notice that the price is so much better here on Amazon that at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Much better than the water based lotions  </li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream ::</li>
            <li> I love both the hand and the foot cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to make it go away,  just prevents the dryness from advancing,  but much better results than the top lotion brands</li>
            <li> This cream erases many sins on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Bought for the wife as a stocking stuffer and she could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s working hand and Healthy feet</li>
            <li> I bought these just hoping they would help the dryness ( which would help with the cracking as well), but they have done so much more - the chemo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with both of these creams.  </li>
            <li> It is the best for dry &amp; cracked skin!</li>
            <li> Working great so far.</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Hand and Foot cream worked better and faster than any prescription medicines that I had filled from doctors.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I used the products and liked it so much we had to order more.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect a strong smell.</li>
            <li> My love&#x27;s hands were nice, soft, and healthy after just 2 - 3 nights of applications.</li>
            <li> He was super stoked!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nurse and my hands are always so dry, and with all the great reviews I thought I would love this.</li>
            <li> Love the working hands, not crazy about the feet stuff...</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free</li>
            <li> More than worth the price.</li>
            <li> The foot cream is wonderful but the hand leaves you feeling sticky not smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried every cream or lotion available.  </li>
            <li> These are truly miracle cremes---my hands and feet are noticeably better when I wake up after putting this stuff on right before bed.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was very light</li>
            <li> My feet feel like they were freshly pedicured!  </li>
            <li> Great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for dry cracked fingers.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t have cracked skin anymore as long as I use this product would recommend to everyone love love love this</li>
            <li> It is good for the healing, but not a long term solution.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hands and feet!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon resolved the shipping error and made things right - 5 Stars to Amazon for customer service!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough how great this stuff really is!</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best product for cracking and dry skin on the hands ever made..</li>
            <li> shopping for the product, I of course head right to Amazon to see what was available.  </li>
            <li> This is by far and away the best product for very dry, cracking, splitting skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super, super picky about lotions and how my hands feel after.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> A little high priced ; however, a good value as it works!!</li>
            <li> easy ordering - fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it really does help fix chapped &amp; cracked hands!!</li>
            <li> I am hoping this is the first winter that my fingers don&#x27;t crack and split like in years past---OW!</li>
            <li> I also love that the lid has bumps that make it easy to open.</li>
            <li> If not for this, our hands would appear to be mostly muscle and bone tissue, and no one would come near us.  </li>
            <li> but it immediately is absorbed into the area.</li>
            <li> It is the only hand cream I have found to be effective.</li>
            <li> Even my kids like it and now trust that any discomfort is temporary and worth it.  </li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and have found this to be the only successful remedy.</li>
            <li> Hands don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling, but I put this on right before bed.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law and sister and their daughter liked these so much, that my initial purchase was quickly taken away.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for rough dry skin on fingertips</li>
            <li> And so far O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s feels great on my dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I was not given the option to \\&quot;view/file a claim,\\&quot; to report the missing item (I am able to do this with most purchases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is much thicker and works nearly as well as petroleum jelly, better than petroleum jelly if you have a habit of rubbing it off.</li>
            <li> I like the O&amp;#34;ekeeffe&amp;#34;s very much.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s creams are quite effective.</li>
            <li> I find OKeeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream is ideal to use for dry, cracking hands in the ultra dry climate of Colorado.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> and he also really likes it!</li>
            <li> We love the product however we have since found it at a lower price in stores locally</li>
            <li> which was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Pack\\&quot; was about $8 more than buying the jars individually.  </li>
            <li> Used it on the second night and if by magic my hands were healed.</li>
            <li> enjoyed the hand cream enough that I tried the foot cream as well.</li>
            <li> I would have tried it there first.</li>
            <li> Fixes cracked hands fast!</li>
            <li> Just use it at bedtime, as it is pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li> First ingredient is water.</li>
            <li> It is a more solid cream</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> They called again the second morning and pronounced the cream a miracle because their hands were feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love this foot cream and starting to see results with hand cream.</li>
            <li> I still feel the same about the size of the product &amp; the pricing though; I was expecting a better \\&quot;bang for the buck.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and eczema, and I have tried every lotion under the sun but had never had such amazing results until I started using this product!</li>
            <li> We keep on buying more as needed, because they work so well on our dry hands and cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I work in food service and wash my hands many times in a day.as a result they wore dry and cracked.working hands reversed this in no time at all.</li>
            <li> Nice to have two people in our lives from separate sides of the family to give the same review at the exact same time!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> Used for years, works very well.</li>
            <li> Healed my cracked fingers fast.</li>
            <li> Rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My feet take a real beating.  </li>
            <li> It is not a greasy feeling, I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li> I expected something more.</li>
            <li> My wife said that these are really helping her hands and feet</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for my hands which tend for the skin to crack in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> I found that either will also work on your feet very well.  </li>
            <li> Helps cracks heal and moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and really likes it.</li>
            <li> The foot cream works very well also.</li>
            <li> this stuff helps them from becoming dry and cracked..</li>
            <li> This cream works better than any other lotion or cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> Much better than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> During the winters in NH I developed severe dry cracked hands that didn&#x27;t seem to get better with any moisturizing lotion or cream, until I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Finally my hands are crack free and soft ahhhhhh</li>
            <li> Both called the next morning and said their hand were starting to feel better already overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foot care products over the years but this one is the only one that&#x27;s virtually eliminated the cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more shortly, but only use about 1 container each year for the three of us.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.l</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s home health nurse recommended it highly though, so maybe it works for some but not others.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes my feet feel better after a long day of working in boots.</li>
            <li> Right now I am using it as maintenance to keep the problem from coming back.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and do not wear shoes unless I have to.  </li>
            <li> Rapid to quick response for dry or cracking hands.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands and fingers very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when after a couple of days of using Working Hands that the problem with dryness and splitting&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s - finally decided to give it a try and the stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I started using it morning and night, and within about 2 weeks, my hands were completely healed!</li>
            <li> Although I have found the ingredients are exactly the same in each</li>
            <li> This is the first product that we have used that works, to prevent dryness and eliminates cracks former around finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream (completely odorless, however they manage that!)</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin quickly and leaves no grease.</li>
            <li> The hand cream was fantastic at healing split and cracked hands and the foot cream repaired dry heels after only a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li> Most just give a little oily moisturizing, but this product is different!  </li>
            <li> really well I&#x27;m constantly washing bar glasses this lotion once you put on</li>
            <li> No dried out, cracked and bleeding feet anymore.  </li>
            <li> It has restored my hands and feet to their smooth feeling and not so cracked &amp; dried.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Really helped my hands, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> If left along, it really helps the healing process.</li>
            <li> Neither had the painful cracks in their hands and were able to work with them like they hadn&#x27;t been able to for several months.  </li>
            <li> It is available in stores with only a little price increase.</li>
            <li> Hands and feet were very cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li> It really works for dry and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Since using working hands everyday the condition of my hands have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> This stuff really hold my dry hands at bay!</li>
            <li> &quot; They should clearly state the size of the product container rather than only posting photos of items that appear larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that heals his skin promptly and keeps his hands &amp; feet moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> My husband has had dry hands for so long and it was causing so much itch.</li>
            <li> And the instructions are right - a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> We have tried many other products with little to no success.  </li>
            <li> This product stings a bit when going onto truly raw, dry hands, but once they are healed, maintenance is painless, just a little before bed keeps things soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Well worth trying, especially if you are hard on your hands and feet like I am.</li>
            <li> The humidity in my house was high enough in the winter for the water vapor to condense on the roofing nail tips and drip down on the attic floor and ceiling sheetrock.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Healthy Feet for the past few years and with a little maintenance my feet are baby soft with this</li>
            <li> I had over 2 1/2 yrs ago also caused problems with the nails and skin on my feet, leaving a raw area on my large toes that I could not heal, no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li> Hand cream provided only minor relief.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this work well on extremly dry and cracked hands, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> just feels like it keeps on working all day long.</li>
            <li> I picked some up last year at the Home Depot paint center.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using the Working Hands Cream at night, I no longer have the red, rough hands that I was getting.  </li>
            <li> Well, a couple weeks into using this product, those raw spots are almost completely healed!  </li>
            <li> First thing I have found that actually works on very dry cracked hands!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They save the skin from falling off, which seems to just crack and split all winter long in our wintery, snowy, dry area.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product, out of the MANY they have tried, that actually does heal the bloody cracks and provide protection for several hours before needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> and i only received 1 for the hands and not the other 2.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;care of dry hands and cracked skin on feet</li>
            <li> If you get dry and cracking hands than this is what you need.</li>
            <li> My heals cracked &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry</li>
            <li> If you have dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has dry and cracking skin, you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> Is a must,especially living here in dry Colorado.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry hands.</li>
            <li> I got NOTHING out of either the working hands or the working feet, but then again, I have really dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I have insanely dry hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone struggling and battling dry overworked hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product for her dry, cracking hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I am undergoing chemotherapy, and one of the side-effects is dry, painful/burning, cracked and peeling feet.  </li>
            <li> Its the only thing that works for me and is not super greasy.</li>
            <li> His hands are very dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Working Hands for my dad who deals with very dry hands, and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands that crack and bleed in the winter (</li>
            <li> My husband and I both struggle with very dry skin in the winter, and fingers that crack.</li>
            <li> Cursed with very dry skin and feet</li>
            <li> If you have very dry , cracking skin on hands or feet give these a try.</li>
            <li> I can every last bit out of the little jars, unlike creams in tubes.</li>
            <li> If you work with lots of cardboard or any other material that causes dry, cracked hands, this is the thing for you.</li>
            <li> (Hands too, but I have been spared issues there, other than being extremely dry.).</li>
            <li> It does not smell and you hand only has that oily feel for a few min.</li>
            <li> Not very creamy.</li>
            <li> My finger tips were all rough and split.  </li>
            <li> My job is rough on my hands causing the skin to split.</li>
            <li> I keep the hand cream on my desk at work and find that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - I can&#x27;t see or feel any difference between the one labeled &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; and the one labeled &amp;#34;foot.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now I can stop wasting money on other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I went to a skin specialist for help with an extremely case of itchy and craked hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> and other times of the year).  </li>
            <li> I could tell they were both extremely grateful.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is legit and extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> In the past we used petroleum jelly, which worked well when you can get it to stay on (and some people think it feels gross).</li>
            <li> and I ended up giving it to them early as they were in need with the cold air arriving early here this year.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It prevented my fingers from getting those painful cracks and really softened my feet, especially the calluses.</li>
            <li> Leaves slight residue on fingertips.  </li>
            <li> used this product, for hands and feet, for the first time and find that it works well for my &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; finger/toe tips when winter cold comes.</li>
            <li> Again, within days it soften the hard brittle callouses on my feet, as well as helping my toe nails, which had a tendency to be dry and brittle and break off.</li>
            <li> especially this past winter was hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> He uses this product and the painful cracks in his hands heal up quickly.</li>
            <li> I keep this little jars everywhere.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from cracked and bleeding hands and fingers for much of the year.  </li>
            <li> so I am reminded to use a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> I take a few minutes after a shower, to massage the cream into my feet</li>
            <li> few days cracks healed.  </li>
            <li> and I find that this stays on even after a few hand washings and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Applied to just my fingertips a few times a day and zero splitting.  </li>
            <li> I noticed improvement after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I will still using everyday.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> The foot cream might take a few days longer.</li>
            <li> there is very little difference in the foot product vs. the hand product, don&#x27;t waste your money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more slippery hands and my winters of cracking fingers are no more.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> my hands use 2 crack and burn since I started using this no more problems</li>
            <li> I wash my hands quite often and usually remember gloves AFTER I&#x27;m done with a project.  </li>
            <li> These were purchased for a couple of friends, both of whom work in factories and have dry, dry skin with bloody cracks on their hands due to the work they do.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves at work and seems like they are hard to put on</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> It helps with all the dry, cold weather in PA</li>
            <li> Worked well protecting my hands and feet this cold, dry winter.  </li>
            <li> My fingers would crack open and hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> &quot; I thought I&#x27;d be receiving the larger containers of O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s but was disappointed when two 3.4 ounce containers arrived:</li>
            <li> Used for a few days and the painful cracks on my hands are gone.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from really bad dry skin and has searched for a product to help.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I suffer terribly in the winter with dry hands and feet.  </li>

            <li> Love the working hands, not crazy about the feet stuff...so I use the working hands on my feet now. Its the only thing that works for me and is not super greasy.</li>
            <li> Both the hands and feet creams work as well as they say.</li>
            <li> like it but seems to make my hands feel sticky sometimes.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this.  I am not fond of the way it feels on my feet.</li>
            <li> We love the product however we have since found it at a lower price in stores locally</li>
            <li> Does what it claims. Great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Stays on your hands, not slippery feeling, does not affect ability to grip tools. Used for a few days and the painful cracks on my hands are gone. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this .  It helps with all the dry, cold weather in PA</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it really does help fix chapped &amp; cracked hands!!</li>
            <li> Its works wonderfully!!!</li>
            <li> This. Stuff. Is. AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to four different stores over the holidays to get this as a stocking stuffer and was sold out everywhere.  Finally just ordered this three-pack and sent it to my daughter.  She works in the service industry and was getting cracked fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked immediately and she loves it!  I have used the Healthy Feet for the past few years and with a little maintenance my feet are baby soft with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient packaging.  Great non-greasy products.  O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s is the best! :)</li>
            <li> works great love this stuff....i wash my hands a zillion times a day at work..this stuff helps them from becoming dry and cracked..</li>
            <li> Husband love this product. Works great!</li>
            <li> easy ordering - fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
            <li> I bought these items after purchasing them a month before. My brother-in-law and sister and their daughter liked these so much, that my initial purchase was quickly taken away. So I purchased them again to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My boyfriend has worked outside for years.  His hands are very dry and cracked.  He uses this product and the painful cracks in his hands heal up quickly. I love the product too and have started to use it all the time, which is why I was shopping for a value pack.  there is very little difference in the foot product vs. the hand product, don&#x27;t waste your money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shopping for the product, I of course head right to Amazon to see what was available.  I found the individual jars and then I saw the \\&quot;Value Pak\\&quot; which was exactly what I was looking for.  One jar of hands for my boyfriend, one for me and a foot cream to try.  The difference in the price for 3 individual jars vs. this package didn&#x27;t seem to add up since this \\&quot;Value Pack\\&quot; was about $8 more than buying the jars individually.  I figured that the jars must be larger for the extra money, but couldn&#x27;t find any reference to the quantity size on the product discription.  Don&#x27;t be fooled, the product size is identical.  Buy them individually and save the money.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Got my co-workers hooked.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the hand and feet creams - seem to work well.  Hands don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling, but I put this on right before bed.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great. My hands and feet feel awesome.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream around for cracked and split nails.  I went to a skin specialist for help with an extremely case of itchy and craked hands and fingers. I used this cream along with the prescribed medication, and with the help of this O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream I no longer have the issues I had with my hands.  I shared this product with my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for hands and feet. It keeps them hydrated. My husband&#x27;s hands would crack and bleed until he used this. It really is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands and fingers very soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased Working Hands for my dad who deals with very dry hands, and cracked skin.  He said it worked better for him than anything else he&#x27;s tried over the years!  So when he ran out, I immediately got him this three pack.  He was super stoked!  Might as well get on a standing order.  He said he really liked that it isn&#x27;t oily, and it surprisingly light for how very effective it is.  I think I&#x27;ll have to keep some in my travel toiletries bag for when I visit cold climates.</li>
            <li> This was refer from a friend for me.  I just want to get these for spare and share to friends.</li>
            <li> I have always recommended this product to everyone who needs something reliable and does the job.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on both hands and feet. Nice feel to it and very effective.</li>
            <li> If you get dry and cracking hands than this is what you need. It does not smell and you hand only has that oily feel for a few min. Rapid to quick response for dry or cracking hands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t say enough how great this stuff really is!</li>
            <li> Used for years, works very well.</li>
            <li> If not for this, our hands would appear to be mostly muscle and bone tissue, and no one would come near us.  They save the skin from falling off, which seems to just crack and split all winter long in our wintery, snowy, dry area.</li>
            <li> I love the hand cream, I still haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream but I&#x27;m sure it is great as well.  I have very dry hands that crack and bleed in the winter (and other times of the year).  This has been a great product!</li>
            <li> My sister and I made this a part of our mom&#x27;s Christmas present last year. She loved both products and so I have opted to order some more for her. I occasionally use the working hands and I like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome! No greasy feeling. Healed my cracked fingers fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I use the foot cream at night before I go to bed and it works wonders.  My feet feel like they were freshly pedicured!  I keep the hand cream on my desk at work and find that a little goes a long way.  No smell or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE IT&#x27;S THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> Its suppose to be a value pack of 2 for the hands and 1 for the feet and i only received 1 for the hands and not the other 2.</li>
            <li> Wife was under chemo therapy which resulted in neuropathy.  Hands and feet were very cracked and dry.  O&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s creams helped.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, had cracks on my fingers put the cream and over night the cracks were disappearing.Used it on the second night and if by magic my hands were healed.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, I will never be without this wonderful product. My fingers cracked &amp; would bleed. My heals cracked &amp; dry. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s has truly made my life better!</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t have cracked skin anymore as long as I use this product would recommend to everyone love love love this</li>
            <li> This is a great product for winter dry skin. Rubs in very well. It is fragrance free so don&#x27;t expect a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Took just a week to work on the cracks on my feet and hands. What a relief, should have discovered this product years ago. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent results and quickly for my dried/chapped hands and heels.  I live in a desert climate and have found this to be the only successful remedy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both struggle with very dry skin in the winter, and fingers that crack. We have tried every lotion out there, this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with both and hand and foot cream by O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s. I own a farm and the work especially this past winter was hard on my hands. They were chapped, wind-burned and cracking. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s helped them heal within days. I use it every night now and go through one tub in a month. I highly recommend this product! It is the best hand cream I have ever used, by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the hand cream enough that I tried the foot cream as well. Again, within days it soften the hard brittle callouses on my feet, as well as helping my toe nails, which had a tendency to be dry and brittle and break off. It actually makes my feet feel better after a long day of working in boots. I take a few minutes after a shower, to massage the cream into my feet and I am very pleased with the results. Great products. Well worth trying, especially if you are hard on your hands and feet like I am.</li>
            <li> First thing I have found that actually works on very dry cracked hands!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS TOO!!! Got hand cream in my x-mas stocking. My fingers would crack open and hurt so bad. Used this at bedtime - rub in and put gloves on - next morning fingers not hurting....few days cracks healed.  Just got the foot cream, will try tonight....</li>
            <li> Not only does this work well on extremly dry and cracked hands, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I&#x27;m super, super picky about lotions and how my hands feel after. This works so well!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s creams are quite effective. I can every last bit out of the little jars, unlike creams in tubes. The scent is very nice and not overpowering. I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! I suffer from extremely dry skin and eczema, and I have tried every lotion under the sun but had never had such amazing results until I started using this product! I started using it morning and night, and within about 2 weeks, my hands were completely healed! No more cracked and painful fingers! I never would have believed that a product could truly heal my hands. But this product blew my mind! I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream...Good Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product, for hands and feet, for the first time and find that it works well for my &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; finger/toe tips when winter cold comes. Has a pleasant odor and texture. A little high priced ; however, a good value as it works!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Have used it before. It really works for dry and cracked hands. I started using their help cream.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best product for cracking and dry skin on the hands ever made..</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and do not wear shoes unless I have to.  I walk the beach every morning, use the pool and do a lot of biking.  My feet take a real beating.  I had given up trying to heal my sore, bleeding feet.  But after a week using O&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s my feet started to improve.  No dried out, cracked and bleeding feet anymore.  More than worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with both of these creams.  However, the feet cream worked best and faster, but I believe it is because my hands are constantly being abused by work and weather.  My hands have healed better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> Both of these products are keepers.  My husband and I have tried many of the products on the market that claim to help with dryness and NONE have worked. The hand cream was fantastic at healing split and cracked hands and the foot cream repaired dry heels after only a couple of applications.  I would recommend each of them and I have rated them both at a 5, because they work!</li>
            <li> Does what it is designed to do without all that girly smell. Have ordered several time and will continue to buy. It is available in stores with only a little price increase. If you need it don&#x27;t wait on the mail!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local store. They are always out. So I ordered it off amazon because you offer it in bundle.It&#x27;s no the same product as the store.I checked the ingredients it the same...but it&#x27;s very different.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way my hands felt after rubbing this in. It is not a greasy feeling, I can&#x27;t really explain it but I threw it away. I&#x27;m nurse and my hands are always so dry, and with all the great reviews I thought I would love this. Well I didn&#x27;t, and had I known they sold it at BB&amp;B I would have tried it there first. Try it before you buy it!!!</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry and I find that this stays on even after a few hand washings and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome hand and foot cream  Although I have found the ingredients are exactly the same in each so buy what ever one is cheaper at the time :)</li>
            <li> Softens hands, feet, elbows, and knees without leaving them feeling greasy.  A little goes a long way - I can&#x27;t see or feel any difference between the one labeled &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; and the one labeled &amp;#34;foot.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband and I suffer terribly in the winter with dry hands and feet.  With one application, we both felt relief.  Works well for woman and men.</li>
            <li> I used this and it worked great not as well as some products i have used but still for the price its great stuff</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the improvement in my winter worn hands.  I would recommend this product for purchase and have done so multiple times.</li>
            <li> Working great so far. No split or cracked skin this winter season.  But feels like my hands are coated in wax. I wear gloves at work and seems like they are hard to put on/take off when i use the cream at work.</li>
            <li> This cream works better than any other lotion or cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> I expected something more. I prefer Ahava.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hand creme, as my hands are split and cracked the minute the summer ends. The foot creme was a bonus, but boy, am I glad I got both. These are truly miracle cremes---my hands and feet are noticeably better when I wake up after putting this stuff on right before bed. I am hoping this is the first winter that my fingers don&#x27;t crack and split like in years past---OW! This stuff seems different from anything else.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for a couple of friends, both of whom work in factories and have dry, dry skin with bloody cracks on their hands due to the work they do. This is the one and only product, out of the MANY they have tried, that actually does heal the bloody cracks and provide protection for several hours before needing to be reapplied. They both LOVE it and I ended up giving it to them early as they were in need with the cold air arriving early here this year. I could tell they were both extremely grateful. No one has tried the foot lotion yet, but if it&#x27;s even half as good as the hand cream, we know it will be great stuff!</li>
            <li> Fixes cracked hands fast!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I used the products and liked it so much we had to order more.  It has restored my hands and feet to their smooth feeling and not so cracked &amp; dried.</li>
            <li> The entire family likes it.</li>
            <li> Did not care for the hand cream AT ALL.  Leaves a sticky, unpleasant feeling, a bit waxy. Not for me.  the feet cream is ok, that&#x27;s why I am giving it a three stars.  My review would go 1 star for the hand cream, and 4 stars for the feet product.</li>
            <li> This product is great at a very good price.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years.  If you have dry hands and feet this is the product for you.  Just use it at bedtime, as it is pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li> My wife said that these are really helping her hands and feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Not very creamy. First ingredient is water. Foot cream is also just ok</li>
            <li> Good product.  It works really well.  Much better than lotions.  It is a more solid cream but it immediately is absorbed into the area.</li>
            <li> My hands feel softer.</li>
            <li> Works great even the Healthy feet.</li>
            <li> it really works great</li>
            <li> this cream works wonderfully. the best hand  cream  for winter. Love it!</li>
            <li> I find OKeeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream is ideal to use for dry, cracking hands in the ultra dry climate of Colorado.  It is the only hand cream I have found to be effective.</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Hand and Foot cream worked better and faster than any prescription medicines that I had filled from doctors. I recommend it to anyone who has dry and cracking skin, you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> greatest stuff for hands and feet</li>
            <li> love this hand lotion... wont use anything else again</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from cracked and bleeding hands and fingers for much of the year.  This is the only cream that heals his skin promptly and keeps his hands &amp; feet moist and soft.  We have tried many other products with little to no success.  This really works!  It is priced reasonably&lt;br /&gt;and lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin quickly and leaves no grease. There&#x27;s stuff in it that heals overnight when skin stays warmer, but if your fingers are cracked like a sun-split grape - and every time you jamb your finger into a wall, it&#x27;s like... \\&quot;Mother of ....!...\\&quot;, well, O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s® disappearing-cream, while it slow-cures, also  produces a parched Santana wind-sting when applied to an open cut. So don&#x27;t wait for pain relief, wring-on some (white) Neosporin® cream (NOT their ointment!) because it has an almost-immediate pain reliever.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;These two are a perfect combo, It doesn&#x27;t matter which one&#x27;s used first, but use them both. In a year or so the two products will probably merge into one, but for now there&#x27;s no pre-mix of this concoction on the market.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;Neosporin® cream is in drug stores (sometimes). Get the 1 oz. tube. Note: The ointment and cream tubes are in similar packaging. Read the label or suffer a return. And start adding up these combo prices, before you push the 1-Click button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Neosporin-Plus-Pain-Relief-Ounce/dp/B001VG1WOA/ref&#x3D;cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdr</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hands which tend for the skin to crack in the cold weather. Great stuff, I have been using it now for two weeks and my hands feel great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to keep this short.  The humidity in my house was high enough in the winter for the water vapor to condense on the roofing nail tips and drip down on the attic floor and ceiling sheetrock.  To stop this I reduced the humidity to where this would not happen but my finger tips and nail cuticles began to split.  Hand cream provided only minor relief.  Then I discovered O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s on Amazon.com.  It is a godsend.  Applied to just my fingertips a few times a day and zero splitting.  In retrospect don&#x27;t know why I bought the Healthy feet cream.  I&#x27;ll use that one container on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Is a must,especially living here in dry Colorado. Great stocking filler. I keep this little jars everywhere. I also love that the lid has bumps that make it easy to open.</li>
            <li> It softens skin, but something in it caused a red rash where my wife applied it to the soles of her feet.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good product. had a problem with my heels cracking, but after daily use problem seems to be gone</li>
            <li> This cream seems to do the trick!  I actually bought for a friend who had splitting skin on her fingers, but bought the extra for myself.  Although it feels like it is greasy, it isn&#x27;t!  I put it on at work and it lasts and lasts and I handle paper and no problems!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great cream. Not greasy and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Best hand and foot cream I have ever used and I have used a lot of different products.</li>
            <li> love it --- work perfectly as advertised</li>
            <li> The product is good, but i&#x27;ve received a pack of three feet creams instead of hands</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the feel of this product.  The foot cream is wonderful but the hand leaves you feeling sticky not smooth.</li>
            <li> Realy, this stuff is amazing.  I picked some up last year at the Home Depot paint center.  Wow. Started noticing a difference in just a couple of days.  My finger tips were all rough and split.  Sometimes they would bleed.  This stuff, healed them up.  When I ran out, I noticed it all came back in about a month.  Now, I always have these around.  I found that either will also work on your feet very well.  Try it!!</li>
            <li> These creams are great for hands and feet!!  We keep on buying more as needed, because they work so well on our dry hands and cracked feet.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Definitely works like it says.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was the best thing I ever bought.  It is wonderful and well worth it. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this for both my Mother and my Uncle who both had severely cracked and bleeding hands.  They each got them from me on the same day and started using them immediately.  Both called the next morning and said their hand were starting to feel better already overnight.  They called again the second morning and pronounced the cream a miracle because their hands were feeling so much better.  Neither had the painful cracks in their hands and were able to work with them like they hadn&#x27;t been able to for several months.  Nice to have two people in our lives from separate sides of the family to give the same review at the exact same time!  Will keep them supplied.</li>
            <li> seems like its working well</li>
            <li> Works great...worth getting</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream and starting to see results with hand cream. I&#x27;ve tried many different foot care products over the years but this one is the only one that&#x27;s virtually eliminated the cracks on my heels. Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Worked well protecting my hands and feet this cold, dry winter.  It prevented my fingers from getting those painful cracks and really softened my feet, especially the calluses.</li>
            <li> This is by far and away the best product for very dry, cracking, splitting skin. Works almost immediately and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for hand and feet!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry hands.</li>
            <li> my hands use 2 crack and burn since I started using this no more problems</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well as they advertise.  Good Value.</li>
            <li> Cursed with very dry skin and feet this is the only product that stopped the split fingers and roughness.  Love it</li>
            <li> Creams worked well on hands and feet. This is the first product that we have used that works, to prevent dryness and eliminates cracks former around finger and toe nails. We highly recommend this product.l</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, great hand cream.</li>
            <li> Felt like oil and greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about.  I got NOTHING out of either the working hands or the working feet, but then again, I have really dry hands.  I used the feet cream faithfully and never noticed any results.  AT all.  I don&#x27;t understand all the rave reviews.  My husband&#x27;s home health nurse recommended it highly though, so maybe it works for some but not others.  I did notice that the price is so much better here on Amazon that at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Best hand and foot cream. Love it! Helps cracks heal and moisturizers very well. I would recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> It is good for the healing, but not a long term solution.</li>
            <li> great, very good service</li>
            <li> During the winters in NH I developed severe dry cracked hands that didn&#x27;t seem to get better with any moisturizing lotion or cream, until I tried this product.  Now my hands are greatly improved. This product stings a bit when going onto truly raw, dry hands, but once they are healed, maintenance is painless, just a little before bed keeps things soft and smooth.  Even my kids like it and now trust that any discomfort is temporary and worth it.  We will be ordering more shortly, but only use about 1 container each year for the three of us.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I noticed improvement after just a few applications. Leaves slight residue on fingertips.  Caused problem using touch screen temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED, SHIPPED ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for rough dry skin on fingertips</li>
            <li> I immediately experienced a difference in the way my hands look and feel. I&#x27;d recommend this product for those of us whose hands &amp; feet take a beating during the course of the day. Much better than the water based lotions  we use. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I have insanely dry hands in the winter.  I have tried every cream or lotion available.  O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, whoever you are, thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream 2 Pack + O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream :: Value Pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: MoreQualityLessMoney&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ordering the \\&quot;Value Pack,\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d be receiving the larger containers of O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s but was disappointed when two 3.4 ounce containers arrived: One \\&quot;Working Hands,\\&quot; &amp; one \\&quot;Working feet.\\&quot; They should clearly state the size of the product container rather than only posting photos of items that appear larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only received one of the 2 \\&quot;Working Hands Cream,\\&quot; containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did the feedback tonight on the delivery (which showed all items were delivered) I was not given the option to \\&quot;view/file a claim,\\&quot; to report the missing item (I am able to do this with most purchases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have paid for something I did not receive and for the size of the container, I feel it is overpriced and not a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect some kind of resolution...if there is, I would consider updating my review to reflect my thoughts on the actual product and not the lack of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon resolved the shipping error and made things right - 5 Stars to Amazon for customer service! And so far O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s feels great on my dry cracked hands. I still feel the same about the size of the product &amp; the pricing though; I was expecting a better \\&quot;bang for the buck.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he&#x27;s using because it has helped his hands to heal - he loves it!</li>
            <li> Very good item. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> dosnt work for me like product</li>
            <li> I like the O&amp;#34;ekeeffe&amp;#34;s very much. It has help my hands and feet a lot. I will still using everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I love both the hand and the foot cream. Best thing I have found.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have suffered for years with extremely dry skin. My job is rough on my hands causing the skin to split. Since using working hands everyday the condition of my hands have improved tremendously. Much better than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and amazing package set</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hands and feet!  Amazing product! Would recommend to anyone struggling and battling dry overworked hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dry hands for so long and it was causing so much itch. We tried everything all the cremes in the market and nothing helped. This WORKED and we were in shock. This is legit and extremely affordable. Thank you so much. Also delivery was on time! thank you!</li>
            <li> One of the best hands cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, my wife and my daughter wanted it, so I just made another order for myself.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great for those winters where your skin drys up overnight.  My wife suffers from really bad dry skin and has searched for a product to help.  Most just give a little oily moisturizing, but this product is different!  It goes into the skin and softens the skin rather than just coats it.  I really am pleased and will be purchasing more to keep her happy.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when after a couple of days of using Working Hands that the problem with dryness and splitting&lt;br /&gt;of skin seemed to be healing.  Right now I am using it as maintenance to keep the problem from coming back.  Keep&lt;br /&gt;next to kitchen sink as a reminder. Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!  It sure works great!  It is not greasy and keeps my hands and feet feeling perfect!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really hold my dry hands at bay! doesn&#x27;t seem to make it go away,  just prevents the dryness from advancing,  but much better results than the top lotion brands</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Love this product!! It is the best for dry &amp; cracked skin! Our entire family uses it</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful for use on both hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using the Working Hands Cream at night, I no longer have the red, rough hands that I was getting.  I wash my hands quite often and usually remember gloves AFTER I&#x27;m done with a project.  This cream erases many sins on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Healthy Feet Cream is simply amazing.  I use it on Mom&#x27;s feet after the rest of the pedicure, slathering it on, then putting socks on afterward.  Her feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and really likes it. She says there is no difference between the hand cream and foot cream</li>
            <li> Bought for the wife as a stocking stuffer and she could not be more pleased.  Her fingers crack bas in the winter and are now cured.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it at least once a day. Not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I work in food service and wash my hands many times in a day.as a result they wore dry and cracked.working hands reversed this in no time at all.I would buy this anytime.</li>
            <li> O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s working hand and Healthy feet cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard from some one else about the hand lotion so also got the foot lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very nice and not grease or sticky.</li>
            <li> Really helped my hands, especially in winter. At first I thought it was very light but then I saw it actually worked overnight. The foot cream works very well also. If you have very dry , cracking skin on hands or feet give these a try. The foot cream might take a few days longer. It feels insubstantial but still works for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and I as we tend to get chapped knuckles. In the past we used petroleum jelly, which worked well when you can get it to stay on (and some people think it feels gross). This stuff is much thicker and works nearly as well as petroleum jelly, better than petroleum jelly if you have a habit of rubbing it off. My love&#x27;s hands were nice, soft, and healthy after just 2 - 3 nights of applications. And the instructions are right - a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product for her dry, cracking hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for dry cracked fingers.  As with any hand cream, it works best when applied at night before bed.  If left along, it really helps the healing process.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best products for hands and feet that I have ever used.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am undergoing chemotherapy, and one of the side-effects is dry, painful/burning, cracked and peeling feet.  (Hands too, but I have been spared issues there, other than being extremely dry.). I bought these just hoping they would help the dryness ( which would help with the cracking as well), but they have done so much more - the chemo I had over 2 1/2 yrs ago also caused problems with the nails and skin on my feet, leaving a raw area on my large toes that I could not heal, no matter what I did.  Well, a couple weeks into using this product, those raw spots are almost completely healed!  What a welcome relief!  I would recommend this cream (completely odorless, however they manage that!) to anyone with problems with their feet (and hands).</li>
