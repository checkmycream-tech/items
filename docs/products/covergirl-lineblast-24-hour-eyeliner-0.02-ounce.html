            <li>this arrived in perfectly packaged condition.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed and will not be buying again.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price!</li>
            <li>But all in all , it a great product.</li>
            <li>yet I wouldn&#x27;t expect great things.  </li>
            <li>The color is great too.</li>
            <li>Great packaging and</li>
            <li>Lol un coordinated me.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This product helped me to have a better grip to draw a perfect line .</li>
            <li>within that time, it works great and makes your eyes look beautiful. :-)</li>
            <li>GOOD EYELINER</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>it is good, but do not paint so well, because it is too liquid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also does not smudge on top!</li>
            <li>Went on perfectly, both eyes, on my first application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I really liked the 24 hour mascara.</li>
            <li>Runs out very easily too..</li>
            <li>I loved how easy it was to use this eyeliner, but I wish I had more of it.</li>
            <li>, this is far the most inexpensive and best liquid eyeliner I have.</li>
            <li>love that.</li>
            <li>Testing it on my eyes didn&#x27;t bring any better results.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Then the product settles into the tip more.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this at my drugs stores or Target, and decided to order more here.</li>
            <li>n keep it for 2 minute than i was able to used it in another eye ....</li>
            <li>if u want similar product u can go for eyeko eyeliner that is best</li>
            <li>Will be looking for a better option in the marker eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Have to layer and layer, and even that doesn&#x27;t help the color come out better.</li>
            <li>but I want others to try the product:)</li>
            <li>The price is right, color intense, and size perfect.</li>
            <li>I tried an inexpensive marker eye liner and loved it, but it smudged too much.</li>
            <li>Its the right size for hand grip to line your eyes, the payoff is amazing once you shake it before you use it.</li>
            <li>I could never get a smooth, even line on both eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>but I was too excited to wait</li>
            <li>this is perfect for my shaky hands, it glides on smoothly and with a precise line to do ure cats eye or whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Tried and true.</li>
            <li>use it for quick mornings...</li>
            <li>but this isnt as bold.</li>
            <li>it applies smoothly and consistently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did last me a good five-8 hours , lasted through an intense gym session,</li>
            <li>In my 30+ years of wearing makeup, I have NEVER had success applying liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>but I had no problem getting a thin, perfect, even line.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>Very good and long lasting product.</li>
            <li>But if you rarely use liquid eyeliner, don&#x27;t except this to last more than 4 months in your purse without it drying out</li>
            <li>While the compact size is nice and fits well into my purse, this eyeliner cost way too much for the short period of time it lasted.</li>
            <li>The second one I bought was the one in the picture, hoping I&#x27;d see better results, but nope.</li>
            <li>I currently use and love the mabelline gel studio pots.</li>
            <li>I thought that putting it in hot water would help but it did not.</li>
            <li>color is amazing and dark 5/5&lt;</li>
            <li>So far the ink is coming out strong, much stronger than their older liner</li>
            <li>Have only used this a few times because I&#x27;m getting old and can&#x27;t write a perfect line where the liner should appear.</li>
            <li>its ok coz its dont work long wen</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and was easy to control despite its tiny size 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Now, after the liner is drawn on and sets...</li>
            <li>correcting mistakes with water and a q-tip is simple, but it does crack fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on very well at first - the pigment is very dark and nice</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I got a refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Almost like those liner that u apply and can peel off when u are ready to remove...</li>
            <li>It doesnt really work.</li>
            <li>when I try to put it on it doesn&#x27;t make much of a mark.</li>
            <li>It was really watery.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My only compliant is that it goes on too light at times because there is no product on the tip.</li>
            <li>I smudge everything, and this seems to go a whole day of work and a workout (</li>
            <li>I felt like this one had too much liquid coming out</li>
            <li>I just bought this item and all I can say is that it dries up so fast.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this eyeliner stays the whole day</li>
            <li>its good for making thin line but fade very fast ..</li>
            <li>lasted though an 8hour sleep filled night, and also lasted through a shower after the gym with minor touch up needed.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, it did crack and peel in a couple places near the cat eye end</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to be pretty sensitive, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product.  </li>
            <li>All these liners by Cover Girl (24 hr and non)go on really smooth, but do tend to dry up faster than others.</li>
            <li>You need a steady hand.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to smudge more and get messy as the day went on.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and last all day and are super dark.</li>
            <li>I tried 2 different ones thinking the first was a fluke....</li>
            <li>then today It peeled ever so slightly toward the inner corner of the eye on top 4/5&lt;</li>
            <li>Very watered down and doesn&#x27;t give a good thick line.</li>
            <li>Once it is moist, it applies an extremely fine line, very dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying that it dries out really quick.  </li>
            <li>but as far as sharpie markers run, it goes</li>
            <li>and this eyeliner is near useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t squeeze it to get more due to the container being a hard plastic case, I tried shaking it a few times to see if more would come out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and smooth - nothing to grip on to.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, not quite as smooth as the gel liner, but that could be because it&#x27;s a different formula and isn&#x27;t meant to be gel...</li>
            <li>Dried up in the first week!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the black color is bold enough.</li>
            <li>it went on as a light Grey color meaning it had DRIED OUT.</li>
            <li>More or less a waste of money.</li>
            <li>and you really have to be careful not to draw outside some boundary</li>
            <li>So I bough the 24 hour Covergirl version thinking it would be better, but it actually was worse than the inexpensive brand.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me and dried up real fast messy too</li>
            <li>You will be left standing with one hot mess on your lids.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know how long the felt tip of the brush lasts since i will not subject my eyes to the stinging again.  </li>
            <li>It looked very uneven and smudged right away.</li>
            <li>I just dont know how much product is actually in the bottle itself, could be a little?</li>

            <li> i don&#x27;t know how long the felt tip of the brush lasts since i will not subject my eyes to the stinging again.  </li>
            <li> It looked very uneven and smudged right away.</li>
            <li> I just dont know how much product is actually in the bottle itself, could be a little?</li>
            <li> The product worked fine the first time; on the second use, it seemed all dried up and faint.</li>
            <li> very watery lacks color not what i expected to be a 24 hr wear product do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this on how long it lasts on the eye, how well it draws, how long the actual product will last before drying up, and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - so it was harder to control, and harder to get a neat clear line.</li>
            <li> The color when it went on was awesomely dark and did last all day, but I cannot recommend it since I know it will last just 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> it becomes a sort of strange texture.</li>
            <li> Dried out within first few times of using it.</li>
            <li> However, when I wet my finger a little bit and ran it over the eyeliner, it completely smeared and ran.  </li>
            <li> Same size as cover girl&#x27;s other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> but it was a little difficult applying more to my eye.</li>
            <li> Pretty dried out when i received it. :/</li>
            <li> it looked like water with a single drop of food coloring.</li>
            <li> The non 24 hour one also turned into a grayish color rather than blackest black after a short period of time, so</li>
            <li> the tip is too hard, product barely comes out and therefore does not get distributed evenly on the lid.</li>
            <li> i was not able to apply it second eye coz</li>
            <li> I even had the cap closed tightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help you make dark lines as advertised.</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend u waste money on this product or any other covergirl liquid liner product.</li>
            <li> this eye liner did not put an even line of black on my eyelid...</li>
            <li> I did like that this one does remain black.</li>
            <li> I bought this September 1st; it has been less than three weeks</li>
            <li> Very disappointed by this liner that is supposed to be from a \\&quot;good\\&quot; brand but felt more like a dollar store item (not even!).</li>
            <li> The lid is on so tight, it won&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li> after two attempts and two uncomfortable followup experiences, i&#x27;m looking for a new eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> - I found the point a little hard to control - it seemed it made a thicker line than expected</li>
            <li> Mine hasn&#x27;t dried up after two uses, but after reading these reviews, I fully expect it will.</li>
            <li> The ink inside has since dried</li>
            <li> I thought this would be quicker in the mornings, and it was..until it dried out.</li>
            <li> I tried this liner and it was NOT cheap day one</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m impatient.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time buying it</li>
            <li> the fact that it stays put once dried</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> A junk don&#x27;t buy this ever wasted in two days</li>
            <li> dried out in about a week</li>
            <li> But after a few uses the liquid leaked out of the pen when it was in my makeup bag and dried up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually store in upside down to help with this problem.</li>
            <li> It may crack a bit and peel if rubbed slightly, but folks it will not smudge once it is set!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up on my eyeshadow and looks very thin on my natural eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is not creamy and smotth and it is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Hardly comes out, not consistent!</li>
            <li> But i didn&#x27;t expect it to be small .</li>
            <li> not sure if it will replace my gel liner yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d definately recommend this ESP if u want something small and portable.</li>
            <li> I have used many liquid liners, this is one of the worst!</li>
            <li> Waste!</li>
            <li> i hate it it, dried out with the first time using it</li>
            <li> I usually buy Covergirl eyeshadow, so I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to write a review</li>
            <li> SUCKS.</li>
            <li> TO GET A THICK LINER</li>
            <li> pen dried by the time it arrived; doesn&#x27;t paint on well, runny, poor product.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that you shake it before you start your base or other makeup because it takes several minutes to moisten the tip.</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other liners</li>
            <li> Not good at all</li>
            <li> This one was even worse.</li>
            <li> Can make thin or thicker lines and lasts all day as well.</li>
            <li> If you like thin lines buy it, if not dont.</li>
            <li> Worse eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Too thin.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I hated that one, btw, bc it lasted all of one and a half eye before it dried</li>
            <li> I like to change up my eyeliner brands and by far this is the worst one</li>
            <li> I basically use this as a base and apply black shadow over it.</li>
            <li> The color came out so faint</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is awful! I can&#x27;t draw on my eyeliner for crap!</li>
            <li> Bought this product in brown. The color came out so faint it looked like water with a single drop of food coloring. The second one I bought was the one in the picture, hoping I&#x27;d see better results, but nope. This one was even worse. Please avoid this item! I like to change up my eyeliner brands and by far this is the worst one yet :( I threw them both out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction to eye make-up and this product stung my eyes. It was awful. It does NOT last 24 hours. Mine hasn&#x27;t dried up after two uses, but after reading these reviews, I fully expect it will. Shame on Covergirl for putting out this product. I&#x27;m taking it back.</li>
            <li> I purchased this liner a week ago. It is horrible! the tip is too hard, product barely comes out and therefore does not get distributed evenly on the lid. You will be left standing with one hot mess on your lids. Thanks to Amazon I got a refund. Very disappointed by this liner that is supposed to be from a \\&quot;good\\&quot; brand but felt more like a dollar store item (not even!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and really like this product.  Can make thin or thicker lines and lasts all day as well.</li>
            <li> This product helped me to have a better grip to draw a perfect line . But i didn&#x27;t expect it to be small . But all in all , it a great product.</li>
            <li> *update*.  I do NOT recommend u waste money on this product or any other covergirl liquid liner product. It lasts all of 3 days! The ink inside has since dried and i keep it tipped downward hoping it will revive itself, but no such luck. I am back to my staple mabelline gel pot ...love that. I thought this would be quicker in the mornings, and it was..until it dried out. The color when it went on was awesomely dark and did last all day, but I cannot recommend it since I know it will last just 1-2 days. Ps..I tried 2 different ones thinking the first was a fluke....second one did the same thing. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find a review for this anywhere except one site, where the users were all given the product to randomly test. They all didn&#x27;t even know how to wear liquid liner, let alone review one...so in my quest, I ended up purchasing this liner in hopes it would become my HG liquid liner. I currently use and love the mabelline gel studio pots. They go on smooth and last all day and are super dark. But I needed something quicker, so I wouldn&#x27;t need to toss a brush and a pot into my cosmetic case while on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this arrived in perfectly packaged condition. I tore open the slim box and found a tiny sharpie like liner. Same size as cover girl&#x27;s other liquid liners. I hated that one, btw, bc it lasted all of one and a half eye before it dried up.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m reviewing this on how long it lasts on the eye, how well it draws, how long the actual product will last before drying up, and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is amazing and dark 5/5&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, not quite as smooth as the gel liner, but that could be because it&#x27;s a different formula and isn&#x27;t meant to be gel...but as far as sharpie markers run, it goes n well 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;It has no off smell..didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and was easy to control despite its tiny size 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Now, after the liner is drawn on and sets...it becomes a sort of strange texture. Almost like those liner that u apply and can peel off when u are ready to remove...ya know?!  The first time I put it on, it did crack and peel in a couple places near the cat eye end 3.5/5&lt;br /&gt;But then today It peeled ever so slightly toward the inner corner of the eye on top 4/5&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, STAY in the water line without smudging~ It also does not smudge on top! It may crack a bit and peel if rubbed slightly, but folks it will not smudge once it is set! 5/5&lt;br /&gt;It did last me a good five-8 hours , lasted through an intense gym session, lasted though an 8hour sleep filled night, and also lasted through a shower after the gym with minor touch up needed. So unless u rub at ur eye, this thing should last u a work or school day 4.5/5.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use it for quick mornings...not sure if it will replace my gel liner yet. I want to see how it holds up in summer humidity . I&#x27;ll update in July if I remember. Also I&#x27;ll update when it dries out. So far the ink is coming out strong, much stronger than their older liner ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definately recommend this ESP if u want something small and portable. And if u were upset by their last sharpie type liner,I&#x27;d suggest u give this one a go.  The price is right, color intense, and size perfect.</li>
            <li> i purchased this after seeing an add on tv it is very watery lacks color not what i expected to be a 24 hr wear product do not buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I did order this online but I was too excited to wait so I bought it from the store.  The 24 hour test did not last.  The eyeliner goes on very well at first - the pigment is very dark and nice - I found the point a little hard to control - it seemed it made a thicker line than expected and you really have to be careful not to draw outside some boundary or you&#x27;ll end up looking crazy.  I tested the eyeliner on my hand and ran a finger over it - it stays.  However, when I wet my finger a little bit and ran it over the eyeliner, it completely smeared and ran.  I guess I was expecting something called \\&quot;24 hour\\&quot; to be tear and water proof as well.  Testing it on my eyes didn&#x27;t bring any better results.  It seemed to last for a bit, but the next time I looked in the mirror it was smeared or gone.  I realize it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other liners yet I wouldn&#x27;t expect great things.  It&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with Maybelline and Covergirl eyeliners, but they are TERRIBLE. I tried this liner and it was NOT cheap day one it faded smeared and made me look like a racoon.  Day two it went on as a light Grey color meaning it had DRIED OUT. THIS IS TERRIBLE especially after spending money on a liner. I threw it away and will NEVER buy covergirl or maybelline liners again.</li>
            <li> But if you rarely use liquid eyeliner, don&#x27;t except this to last more than 4 months in your purse without it drying out inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But within that time, it works great and makes your eyes look beautiful. :-)</li>
            <li> Really bad! I have used many liquid liners, this is one of the worst! Hardly comes out, not consistent! Waste!</li>
            <li> In my 30+ years of wearing makeup, I have NEVER had success applying liquid eyeliner.  EVER.  I could never get a smooth, even line on both eyes.  I figured I&#x27;d give this a try and I LOVE it.  Went on perfectly, both eyes, on my first application.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shorter wand or what, but I had no problem getting a thin, perfect, even line.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying that it dries out really quick.  Will update my review if this is the case.</li>
            <li> i hate it it, dried out with the first time using it, i wish i could get my money back.</li>
            <li> GOOD EYELINER BUT YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO KEEP APPLYING IT TO GET A THICK LINER</li>
            <li> pen dried by the time it arrived; doesn&#x27;t paint on well, runny, poor product.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work. when I try to put it on it doesn&#x27;t make much of a mark. It doesnt even make a faint line</li>
            <li> This is the worst eyeliner ever! I usually buy Covergirl eyeshadow, so I thought I would give this product a try. It is cheap, but you get what you pay for. I couldn&#x27;t even see it show up! And, I use liquid liner all the time. I&#x27;m sticking with Sephora from now on. Tried and true.</li>
            <li> The lid is on so tight, it won&#x27;t come off.  It&#x27;s small and smooth - nothing to grip on to.  Do I need to use the rubber thing in my kitchen that I use to open jar lids?  Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a good eyeliner. It was really watery.</li>
            <li> I saw this written up in one of thew fashion magazines and decided to try it.  It is not creamy and smotth and it is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it is good, but do not paint so well, because it is too liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The problem it is when you use it you hav to spend twice the eyeliner</li>
            <li> The product worked fine the first time; on the second use, it seemed all dried up and faint.Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Recently I brought this &amp; it is HORRIBLE !!!!!!! do not buy . As soon as you apply it wears off you would have to put water on it even that it still doesn&#x27;t stay on for hours. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star</li>
            <li> I loved how easy it was to use this eyeliner, but I wish I had more of it. The color is great too.</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few times because I&#x27;m getting old and can&#x27;t write a perfect line where the liner should appear. Also, I&#x27;m impatient.</li>
            <li> If you like thin lines buy it, if not dont. Runs out very easily too..</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I hate it. Would not recommend it .</li>
            <li> Worse eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever bought. Doesn&#x27;t show up on my eyeshadow and looks very thin on my natural eyelids. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> upon removing this product with cliniq makeup remover and soap and water, my eyes became red and stung for the rest of the night.  after two attempts and two uncomfortable followup experiences, i&#x27;m looking for a new eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in regards to line and ink quality-- it applies smoothly and consistently.  correcting mistakes with water and a q-tip is simple, but it does crack fairly easily.  i don&#x27;t know how long the felt tip of the brush lasts since i will not subject my eyes to the stinging again.  not worth it.</li>
            <li> this item didn&#x27;t even last a week don&#x27;t waste your time buying it</li>
            <li> this eye liner did not put an even line of black on my eyelid...it was watery looking, even though I shook it before using...it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Its the right size for hand grip to line your eyes, the payoff is amazing once you shake it before you use it. Great packaging and well worth it. I just dont know how much product is actually in the bottle itself, could be a little?</li>
            <li> Finally found an eyeliner pen&lt;br /&gt;  I hate using the inkwell style because it smears and its so hard to use. Lol un coordinated me.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that it stays put once dried</li>
            <li> Dried out within first few times of using it. Even with the lid on. Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> My only compliant is that it goes on too light at times because there is no product on the tip. I usually store in upside down to help with this problem. Then the product settles into the tip more.</li>
            <li> Its okay. I am used to blacker bolder eyeliner but this isnt as bold. I like it though but an not a fan.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me and dried up real fast messy too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied! I do recommend that you shake it before you start your base or other makeup because it takes several minutes to moisten the tip. Once it is moist, it applies an extremely fine line, very dark. I use it to draw lashes. You need a steady hand.</li>
            <li> A junk don&#x27;t buy this ever wasted in two days</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this at my drugs stores or Target, and decided to order more here. I smudge everything, and this seems to go a whole day of work and a workout (although who cares) without coming off. All these liners by Cover Girl (24 hr and non)go on really smooth, but do tend to dry up faster than others. The non 24 hour one also turned into a grayish color rather than blackest black after a short period of time, so I did like that this one does remain black.</li>
            <li> its ok coz its dont work long wen i applied it in 1 eye i was not able to apply it second eye coz the liner stoped work i  shak it n keep it for 2 minute than i was able to used it in another eye ....its good for making thin line but fade very fast .. if u want similar product u can go for eyeko eyeliner that is best</li>
            <li> Dried up in the first week! Not good at all</li>
            <li> While the compact size is nice and fits well into my purse, this eyeliner cost way too much for the short period of time it lasted. I bought this September 1st; it has been less than three weeks and this eyeliner is near useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy this product again and I can&#x27;t recommend you buy it. More or less a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Would npt buy again....dried out in about a week</li>
            <li> Very watered down and doesn&#x27;t give a good thick line.</li>
            <li> I tried an inexpensive marker eye liner and loved it, but it smudged too much. So I bough the 24 hour Covergirl version thinking it would be better, but it actually was worse than the inexpensive brand. I felt like this one had too much liquid coming out - so it was harder to control, and harder to get a neat clear line. It looked very uneven and smudged right away. It also seemed to smudge more and get messy as the day went on. I wasn&#x27;t impressed and will not be buying again. Will be looking for a better option in the marker eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This is my go to eyeliner.  It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  My eyes tend to be pretty sensitive, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product.  Remember to shake the product before each use!</li>
            <li> this is perfect for my shaky hands, it glides on smoothly and with a precise line to do ure cats eye or whatever you want.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I really liked the 24 hour mascara. But after a few uses the liquid leaked out of the pen when it was in my makeup bag and dried up. I even had the cap closed tightly. Do they expect this product to be stored upright? Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too thin. Have to layer and layer, and even that doesn&#x27;t help the color come out better. I basically use this as a base and apply black shadow over it. SUCKS.</li>
            <li> Very good and long lasting product.</li>
            <li> Pretty dried out when i received it. :/</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that it would look like paint in a way on my face. It seems I am already running out after 1.5 weeks. I don&#x27;t feel the black color is bold enough. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I just bought this item and all I can say is that it dries up so fast. I thought that putting it in hot water would help but it did not. It doesn&#x27;t help you make dark lines as advertised. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve work in cosmetics for so many years and used expensive products and there&#x27;s nothing compare to this liquid eyeliner. I have oily skin and this eyeliner stays the whole day, this is far the most inexpensive and best liquid eyeliner I have. Please do not discontinue this item. I&#x27;ve tried Maybelline liquid liner because it says &amp;#34;Best selling &amp;#34; eyeliner, it&#x27;s the worst ever, I don&#x27;t believe some of the reviews, you just need to try it  to believe it. I usually don&#x27;t like to write a review but I want others to try the product:)</li>
            <li> The eye liner stayed for a while but it was a little difficult applying more to my eye. It was acting like it was drying out, I couldn&#x27;t squeeze it to get more due to the container being a hard plastic case, I tried shaking it a few times to see if more would come out but it didn&#x27;t. I ended up filling out the rest of my eye with ELF eyeliner cream.</li>
            <li> The tip and way it comes out is awful</li>
            <li> The worst eyeliner ever don&#x27;t even deserve one star bummer</li>
    </ol>
