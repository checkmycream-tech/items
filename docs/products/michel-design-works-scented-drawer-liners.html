            <li>love the foaming soap....</li>
            <li>Soapy hands are healthy hands</li>
            <li>The container is good looking and a positive asset to my counter.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle on hands and smells good...</li>
            <li>I still like it for my bathroom since the foam is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Must have refilled this container about a dozen times after the soap was gone, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The design on it is super cute and matches her kitchen.</li>
            <li>And I love the pretty packaging too!</li>
            <li>We really enjoy it in the kitchen</li>
            <li>i was excited to see that amazon.com distributed it.  </li>
            <li>This brand gives the most for your money, at a large 17 oz.</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>Definitely not wanting a germ killing, bacterial strengthening wash, and loving this wash, I&#x27;ll stay with Michel Design Works Lemon Basil Foaming Soap.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell heavenly (there are other scents too like Peony which also smells wonderful!)</li>
            <li>Yes, using the foaming soap is a real treat!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is so pretty too.</li>
            <li>The soap leaves your hams clean and soft add a soap should.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this soap for years love it , we will not use anything else as long as we can find this Lemon Basil Foaming Soap....</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>This purchase was part of a whole lemon themed gift.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very foamy</li>
            <li>Very lemony with a hint of basil.</li>
            <li>Pump and foam work very well.</li>
            <li>i like the scent, and i found the moisturizing feeling remained on my hand which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;moreover</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this product can be used on a daily basis without overly drying my hands out - plus it looks pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably dilute the scent with non scented soap as I use it up a little more.  </li>
            <li>I am a foaming soap lover, using EO, Deep Steep, and many other quality brands.</li>
            <li>It seems kind of expensive for hand soap, but I have had my first bottle of it for about 5 months now.</li>
            <li>We have received praise from all our guests thus far and asked where we had come across these items and purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has not dried my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, both subtle and strong if you understand what I mean.</li>
            <li>And lasts a LONG time, even considering the large size.</li>
            <li>Very lemony, which I suppose is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i was disappointed, because I love the bars of lemon soap, and the foam smells good while washing, but isn&#x27;t the same smell afterwards after it has dried on my hands.</li>

            <li> Will put in a secondary bath where will last much longer next time.</li>
            <li> It will not last very long at the kitchen sink</li>
            <li> and I will definately purchase other scents when one of the two currently in use start to go low.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Michel fragrances, and although scents are not very pronounced, I like them all for their cleansing properties.</li>
            <li> But it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but actually is quite economical for this reason</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and it is only about half gone.</li>
            <li> Even when by all appearances it is empty, it still pumps out soap.  </li>
            <li> I will not use any other brand from now on.....</li>
            <li> Not quite as lingering as some of the other Michel foaming soaps.</li>
            <li> size is average.</li>
            <li> No more messy soap pieces to replace.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a number of bars in the past and decided to take a chance on the foaming soap.</li>
            <li> Too expensive on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent of lemon covered by a horrendous, caustic, detergent-like smell.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past even comes close!!  </li>
            <li> Alas my one star deduction.</li>
            <li> However it is a tad expensive considering</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Seriously awful.</li>

            <li> Smells Great.  Looks Great.  Very drying.</li>
            <li> We purchased this and another scented soap of the same brand to place in the guest bathroom. The bottles are elegant and well designed and the scent is remarkable. We have received praise from all our guests thus far and asked where we had come across these items and purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the quality and I will definately purchase other scents when one of the two currently in use start to go low.</li>
            <li> Nice special soap for the powder room!</li>

            <li> I love this soap!  It has a wonderful smell and the foam has a real nice feel to it.  It seems kind of expensive for hand soap, but I have had my first bottle of it for about 5 months now. I use it every day, and it is only about half gone. Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this product can be used on a daily basis without overly drying my hands out - plus it looks pretty!</li>

            <li> The soap was OK, but mostly I bought this because of the nice cheery container to put my almond castile soap in.  Must have refilled this container about a dozen times after the soap was gone, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, pump works perfectly every time, never leaks. And lasts a LONG time, even considering the large size. favorite scent is Au Chocolat.</li>
            <li> No more messy soap pieces to replace. We use them in both our guest bath and the master bath. Recommended</li>
            <li> Wonderful foaming soap.  I also bought the lemon basil bar soap.  The fragance is beautiful.  It has been a great addition to my bathroom!  Love it.</li>
            <li> The best foaming soap ever!!!  Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past even comes close!!  I will not use any other brand from now on.....</li>
            <li> Yes, using the foaming soap is a real treat!  The container is good looking and a positive asset to my counter.  The foaming soap smells wonderful and cleans well.  There is a Michel Design Foaming Soap in all my bathrooms and I&#x27;ve given them several times a gifts and they were well received.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell heavenly (there are other scents too like Peony which also smells wonderful!) it lasts a long time!  Even when by all appearances it is empty, it still pumps out soap.  It may seem expensive but actually is quite economical for this reason</li>
            <li> We have been using this soap for years love it , we will not use anything else as long as we can find this Lemon Basil Foaming Soap....</li>

            <li> This is the best hand soap.  It is pricey.  But it lasts a long time.  So happy to have found it on Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This and Honey Almond are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love it. Lasts a long time. Kind to my hands.</li>
            <li> A bit pricy but the family likes these foaming soaps.</li>
            <li> Very nice scented soap. However it is a tad expensive considering it does not  foam  a lot and the bottle  size is average. It will not last very long at the kitchen sink</li>
            <li> I saw this at my mother-in-laws house in her kitchen. I can smell it from the door when she was washing her hands at the sink and I grabed the bottle and smell it...so lovely!!! It is very foamy and I was told that it lasts quite some time. The design on it is super cute and matches her kitchen. Great hand soap for the kitchen. Leaves your hands soft and lovely.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, both subtle and strong if you understand what I mean. Very lemony with a hint of basil. The bottle is so pretty too. Makes an excellent addition to my kitchen.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this because while I love basil, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted my hands smelling that way.  I love foaming handsoap, and I LOVE the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you buy a lot of pump handsoap dispensers, you probably know the frustration of getting one that has mechanical issues. This is a high quality product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I was thinking maybe this would be a stronger lemon smell but it is not.  I still like it for my bathroom since the foam is easy to use.  It came very quickly and was packed great.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  A big hit in my powder room...All guests asked me where I got this...they love the smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a slight scent of lemon covered by a horrendous, caustic, detergent-like smell.  Seriously awful.</li>

            <li> Love this product! I use this at my kitchen sink. I wash my hands all the time. Does not dry out my hands, great lather and smell! I would also purchase for gifts to family and friends!</li>
            <li> good price smells great</li>
            <li> We love it!!! Pump and foam work very well. We really enjoy it in the kitchen</li>
            <li> Nice scent and feel. Not quite as lingering as some of the other Michel foaming soaps. Would like to have a soap like this in each of my bathrooms. Alas my one star deduction. This product only lasted my family 6 weeks.when placed by the kitchen sink. Too expensive on a regular basis. Will put in a secondary bath where will last much longer next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stay with this product. Rich foam and great fragrance and it has not dried my skin. Definitely not wanting a germ killing, bacterial strengthening wash, and loving this wash, I&#x27;ll stay with Michel Design Works Lemon Basil Foaming Soap. I wonder if they make a face wash.</li>
            <li> i like the scent, and i found the moisturizing feeling remained on my hand which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;moreover, it has perfect quantity i wanted.</li>
            <li> Best hand soap ever, hands down (and smelling great)</li>
            <li> Love this brand.  The soap leaves your hams clean and soft add a soap should.  The scent is not my favorite. Very lemony, which I suppose is to be expected.  I&#x27;ll probably dilute the scent with non scented soap as I use it up a little more.  I would highly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> love the foaming soap....it&#x27;s gentle on hands and smells good...i was introduced to it over a year ago...i was excited to see that amazon.com distributed it.  thank you.</li>
            <li> This soap has the most wonderful fragrance when used and the foaming is great. And I love the pretty packaging too!</li>
            <li> Soapy hands are healthy hands</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is great to have at your bath sink.  Looks like it will last a while after 4 weeks, still only 10% used.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and lather</li>
