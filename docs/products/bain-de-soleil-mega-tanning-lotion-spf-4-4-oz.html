            <li>I have used various brands of self tanners and this is definitely one of the best, if not the best.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with 2 tanners simultaneously (this and St. Tropez), and this is the one that came on top.</li>

            <li>Love all of the products!!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found my favorite tanning lotion on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope they don&#x27;t  discontinue this one</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful natural color this product gives and there is no offensive odor.</li>
            <li>Will someone PLEASE tell me why such a successful, popular, profit-making product was d/c???</li>
            <li>, it great for early summer to get your tan going.</li>
            <li>I use to use Bain de Soleil no streak years ago and absolutely loved it why they stopped making that I really don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li>love the unique smell and every product works amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the original gel</li>
            <li>I have skin which burns easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t turn you into Oompa Loompa orange.</li>
            <li>New label and colors and a good expiration date.</li>
            <li>Spreads on easily and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>n u dont need to be out in the sun to get a nice tan thanks</li>
            <li>i get a nice tropical color from the self tanner and protection from real sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a deep tan!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, does not streak and fades amazingly like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>I am not understanding why a company would stop making such a popular product!</li>
            <li>I have always been a customer of Amazons and believed them to be a first class company, after seeing this, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>I put it on first and use a 30 to 70 on top.</li>
            <li>have lifeguarded for the past 3 summers now and all of my friends always rave about my&lt;br /&gt;seriously perfect bronze tan!</li>
            <li>Just remember to wash your palms after you apply, otherwise they turn a funny color...  :)</li>
            <li>I am very light skin, and this is the only lotion I have ever used that protects you, you don&#x27;t burn, you don&#x27;t peel and you get a really nice tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better then most self tanning products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the original,which was discontinued several years ago.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin baby soft with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why my CVS and more places don&#x27;t carry this particular Bain de Soleil product.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a mild addition to an existing tan, which was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to shower the tanner off after the minimum 3 hours, but I was able to keep this on overnight without removing it.</li>
            <li>but this is a great, less greasy alternative</li>
            <li>It looks real and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose, and this product isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>This is the most natural \\&quot;tan\\</li>
            <li>In the included picture, the skin at the top is a natural tan, 2 days after sunbathing.</li>
            <li>All the other Ban de Soleil products smell wonderful and every time I use them I think of all my summers at the beach when I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I have yellow undertones and my skin is always a beautiful color after only a couple hours in tthe sun with this product.</li>
            <li>This current product works, but customer needs many more applications to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>Excellent but expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li>It is the best fake tan ever.</li>
            <li>This is a mild self-tanner, and it has taken a full 12 hours for the effects to become apparent.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the old Bain de Soleil Deep and Dark self tanner was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is the first self tanner that I have used that looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>Love this whole line of sun care products, but they are becoming increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li>The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin.</li>
            <li>Upon reading all the good reviews other customers left for this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>The actual color of the tan became more apparent with two applications.</li>
            <li>This particular Bain de Soleil did not come close to meeting expectations.  </li>
            <li>This gives you a very natural and real looking tan, no one can tell that my tan comes from a self tanner.</li>
            <li>This creme is highly fragranced.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries this and so many other products that have been hard to find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to be a loyal fan for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>The aroma of the lotion was subtle I liked that.</li>
            <li>Very natural tan look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this one time, I&#x27;ll try more often as I start to fade later on in the summer and not as outside as often...</li>
            <li>This is a great product to add light color and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!</li>
            <li>and they were surprised when I told them it was from a sunless tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough to wear daily if you like going outside on your lunch break.</li>
            <li>and I like the natural tan it gives.  </li>
            <li>This lotion provides sunscreen and keeps your skin soft .</li>
            <li>It seems to be an old product.</li>
            <li>It is in an old box, with an old label.</li>
            <li>This one looks old and does not have a expiration date on the box or the product.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and do not tan easily.</li>
            <li>This morning it was much more obvious where I did the test, and the color *looked* like a natural tan, except for missing the warmer colors produced by a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased last year had a new label and a expiration date on it.</li>
            <li>I recently found the product at a retail store, and it is a new product.</li>
            <li>I always buy extra so that I never run out and have some ready for the next season till I stock up again...</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very careful applying</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available, yet here we have someone or some company that expects to get this utterly ridiculous amount for this product.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for the one I used as a young adult, this one being a little different.</li>

            <li> have lifeguarded for the past 3 summers now and all of my friends always rave about my&lt;br /&gt;seriously perfect bronze tan!</li>
            <li> Just remember to wash your palms after you apply, otherwise they turn a funny color...  :)</li>
            <li> I am very light skin, and this is the only lotion I have ever used that protects you, you don&#x27;t burn, you don&#x27;t peel and you get a really nice tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better then most self tanning products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original,which was discontinued several years ago.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin baby soft with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why my CVS and more places don&#x27;t carry this particular Bain de Soleil product.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a mild addition to an existing tan, which was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to shower the tanner off after the minimum 3 hours, but I was able to keep this on overnight without removing it.</li>
            <li> but this is a great, less greasy alternative</li>
            <li> It looks real and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose, and this product isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> This is the most natural \\&quot;tan\\</li>
            <li> In the included picture, the skin at the top is a natural tan, 2 days after sunbathing.</li>
            <li> All the other Ban de Soleil products smell wonderful and every time I use them I think of all my summers at the beach when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I have yellow undertones and my skin is always a beautiful color after only a couple hours in tthe sun with this product.</li>
            <li> This current product works, but customer needs many more applications to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> Excellent but expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li> It is the best fake tan ever.</li>
            <li> This is a mild self-tanner, and it has taken a full 12 hours for the effects to become apparent.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the old Bain de Soleil Deep and Dark self tanner was perfect.  </li>
            <li> This is the first self tanner that I have used that looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Love this whole line of sun care products, but they are becoming increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin.</li>
            <li> Upon reading all the good reviews other customers left for this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> The actual color of the tan became more apparent with two applications.</li>
            <li> This particular Bain de Soleil did not come close to meeting expectations.  </li>
            <li> This gives you a very natural and real looking tan, no one can tell that my tan comes from a self tanner.</li>
            <li> This creme is highly fragranced.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries this and so many other products that have been hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to be a loyal fan for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> The aroma of the lotion was subtle I liked that.</li>
            <li> Very natural tan look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time, I&#x27;ll try more often as I start to fade later on in the summer and not as outside as often...</li>
            <li> This is a great product to add light color and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!</li>
            <li> and they were surprised when I told them it was from a sunless tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light enough to wear daily if you like going outside on your lunch break.</li>
            <li> and I like the natural tan it gives.  </li>
            <li> This lotion provides sunscreen and keeps your skin soft .</li>
            <li> It seems to be an old product.</li>
            <li> It is in an old box, with an old label.</li>
            <li> This one looks old and does not have a expiration date on the box or the product.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and do not tan easily.</li>
            <li> This morning it was much more obvious where I did the test, and the color *looked* like a natural tan, except for missing the warmer colors produced by a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased last year had a new label and a expiration date on it.</li>
            <li> I recently found the product at a retail store, and it is a new product.</li>
            <li> I always buy extra so that I never run out and have some ready for the next season till I stock up again...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very careful applying</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available, yet here we have someone or some company that expects to get this utterly ridiculous amount for this product.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for the one I used as a young adult, this one being a little different.</li>
            <li> After washing the sunscreen off completely, I was outdoors when the sun was low in the sky, and there was a noticeable orange hue on my lower half, where I had applied this product twice, liberally (as stated in the directions).  </li>
            <li> but, went back to what I was using because as I stated I applied for days and no WOW look at my TAN !</li>
            <li> Keeps your tan longer too long after the sun is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using the gel for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> Not only does it protect you from the sun while you are outside, but it also gives you a nice base tan or adds to the one you already have.  </li>
            <li> Every now and then, I swayed away to experiment with other brands but always come back to this because none of them can beat it.</li>
            <li> for several years I had to use other brands/products for my &amp;#34;tan in a can&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I might end up using it on my legs since its not appropriate for sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> The upper part of me, with a single application, was less noticeable a color.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have, and it&#x27;s not even a complaint really, is the scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no color</li>
            <li> The next morning, there was a very slight self tanner scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps stave off those harsh burns and gives me that little bit of color with only limited sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep a constant supply &amp; remain tan all year round!</li>
            <li> It was hard to find this line locally and now that I have found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I noticed no color and ordered the dark tanning which I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> It really jump starts your tan for the beginning of summer, then I switch to Ban de Soleil SPF 4 gelee once I have a base tan and alternate back and forth.</li>
            <li> I just found this at Walgreens (TX) has it for $3 less,</li>
            <li> Control the tan you want to get, put on as much or as little as you want as often as you like.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a few times</li>
            <li> a few bucks</li>
            <li> This is my updated review after a few days of testing.</li>
            <li> I did get a few commentsthat</li>
            <li> I will try again, but so far I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> At first I believed it was worthless, since after 6 hours the self-tanning was barely noticeable, especially in artificial light.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money !</li>
            <li> but I do like to get at least a bit of a base tan quickly.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I am so disappointed in Amazon for being so greedy as to put such a ridiculous price on what they have left.</li>
            <li> This hardly provides any color at all and</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to get.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only self-tanning lotion I have found that doesn&#x27;t make me look dirty or turn me orange.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that at least some brick &amp; mortar stores would carry it.</li>
            <li> Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Sunscreen w/self tanner is one of the least smelly self tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works slowly but had zero tanning smell.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I felt a bit ridiculous, although I don&#x27;t think it was so extreme that people noticed.</li>
            <li> I used this product devotedly for several years until it became almost impossible to obtain in stores or internet orders.  </li>
            <li> I am seriously thinking of returning this product that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I lay out by myself and want some serious color I use the gel orange</li>
            <li> This product proved worthless in a side by side test against Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow.  </li>
            <li> This product may be expensive, but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they stopped carrying it in stores so</li>
            <li> This item, Bain de Soleil ia way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in the stores in this lotion.  </li>
            <li> but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> so I tried other brands, all awful and orange.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in the product I received.</li>
            <li> an SPF of 4 is obviously worthless.</li>
            <li> and I have a base</li>
            <li> This was the worst self-tanner I have ever tried and believe me I have about tried them all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought it because the old Bain de Soleil Deep and Dark self tanner was perfect.  This hardly provides any color at all and an SPF of 4 is obviously worthless.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy to find this product on Amazon. It disappeared from stores several years ago and I thought it had been discontinued. So glad Amazon carries this and so many other products that have been hard to find.</li>
            <li> This product may be expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I have tried everything out there and this is absolutely the best self-tanning lotion there is.  I promise you that.  I have fair skin and this is the only self-tanning lotion I have found that doesn&#x27;t make me look dirty or turn me orange.  I would recommend this to everyone including my enemies- LOL!  It is a must try- you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This product proved worthless in a side by side test against Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow.  Absolutely no color AT ALL!!  Can not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never used a self-tanner before. Upon reading all the good reviews other customers left for this product, I decided to try it. It is awesome! My friends asked me how I keep my legs tanned all the time and they were surprised when I told them it was from a sunless tan. It looks real and it&#x27;s easy to apply. You do want to wash your hands afterwards as the directions state. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite tanning lotion! It doesn&#x27;t let me burn but give me the the most perfect tan. A must have every summer!</li>
            <li> This was one of the most perfect tanning lotions ever made. I am not understanding why a company would stop making such a popular product! With that being said, I am so disappointed in Amazon for being so greedy as to put such a ridiculous price on what they have left. I have always been a customer of Amazons and believed them to be a first class company, after seeing this, I&#x27;m not so sure. I&#x27;ll rethink future purchases.[[ASIN:B000142AZ8 Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Sunscreen Lotion With Self Tanner, SPF 4 - 4 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I am fair skinned and took it to Hawaii.  It gave me a beautiful tan and I was the only one in our family that didn&#x27;t burn!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to get.  Thank heavens for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years when I&#x27;m able to find it online. Even though it has a low sunscreen i have never once burned. It must have something to do with the self tanner in it. I have yellow undertones and my skin is always a beautiful color after only a couple hours in tthe sun with this product. Not fakey at all. I&#x27;m not very careful applying and it never streaks either. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original,which was discontinued several years ago. The current product has sunscreen in it. Like many customers who LOVED the original, we don&#x27;t want sun protection. We just want the mega tanning lotion or gel. This current product works, but customer needs many more applications to get the same effect. Will someone PLEASE tell me why such a successful, popular, profit-making product was d/c???</li>
            <li> Smells great like coconuts and gently self tans.</li>
            <li> This an excellent product protect your skin if you used properly from peal.</li>
            <li> I used this product devotedly for several years until it became almost impossible to obtain in stores or internet orders.  It might even be unavailable?  I switched to another newer self tan product with 15 SPF and found it to be highly superior.  The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin baby soft with a nice glow. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product does not Tan, It says a self-tanner and reviews I read I wanted to try it but, went back to what I was using because as I stated I applied for days and no WOW look at my TAN ! Would not recommend to anyone. This was the worst self-tanner I have ever tried and believe me I have about tried them all. I use to use Bain de Soleil no streak years ago and absolutely loved it why they stopped making that I really don&#x27;t get it, that is why I gave this a try. No comparison whatsoever. I wasted my money !</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I love it</li>
            <li> i love this self tanner, have used it for yrs, it dose not turn u orange, n u dont need to be out in the sun to get a nice tan thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why my CVS and more places don&#x27;t carry this particular Bain de Soleil product.  I have to order it online every year as it is the ONLY tanning product I will use.  Not only does it protect you from the sun while you are outside, but it also gives you a nice base tan or adds to the one you already have.  If they ever take it off the market I&#x27;ll have to buy it in bulk.  Try it and I believe you will like it!</li>
            <li> I have used all the various products of Bain de Soleil. It is my #1 location. I am very light skin, and this is the only lotion I have ever used that protects you, you don&#x27;t burn, you don&#x27;t peel and you get a really nice tan. At the beginning of tanning season, I start with the #30 and I love their Faces Lotion too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a few times and I have a base then I start with the Mega Tan w/Self Tanner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most of the stores use to carry this product and now have to go online.  Thank God for Amazon.  I always buy extra so that I never run out and have some ready for the next season till I stock up again...LOL  Happy Tanning...Gloria from Florida</li>
            <li> How appropriate for this day and age.  This product is no longer available, yet here we have someone or some company that expects to get this utterly ridiculous amount for this product.  So, go ahead and try to take advantage of people who can&#x27;t find it or any equivalent elsewhere.  I would love to get just one bottle for my sister&#x27;s birthday.  Guess not ... you greedy s.o.b.!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff will order more. Can&#x27;t find in a store in florida beleive that.</li>
            <li> love this lotion!  i get a nice tropical color from the self tanner and protection from real sun.</li>
            <li> I love Bain De Soleil products and used to use this all the time and then a couple of summers ago I could not find it in my area so I tried other brands, all awful and orange. Then I decided to search Amazon again and I was soooo happy to find it. It is a little pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the only suntan lotion I will use. I have skin which burns easily but I do like to get at least a bit of a base tan quickly. This lotion helps stave off those harsh burns and gives me that little bit of color with only limited sun exposure. It&#x27;s also light enough to wear daily if you like going outside on your lunch break. I just wish that at least some brick &amp; mortar stores would carry it. But thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years, and it&#x27;s the best. I put it on first and use a 30 to 70 on top. I don&#x27;t burn but turn brown and block out the harmful rays.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and for people with fair skin &lt;br /&gt;this is the product for you.  I have been red, &lt;br /&gt;orange and also bought products that didn&#x27;t  &lt;br /&gt;change my color at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I beg anyone who is fair and wishes to have a  &lt;br /&gt;tan for the summer to try this product- It is  &lt;br /&gt;only a few bucks and it really works!</li>
            <li> Bain de Soleil Mega Tan Sunscreen w/self tanner is one of the least smelly self tanners I&#x27;ve used. Although, after a day or two, it&#x27;s odor is also discernable. I apply it with a plastic baggie to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used various brands of self tanners and this is definitely one of the best, if not the best. Every now and then, I swayed away to experiment with other brands but always come back to this because none of them can beat it. This gives you a very natural and real looking tan, no one can tell that my tan comes from a self tanner. It is easy to apply, does not streak and fades amazingly like a natural tan. One tip to avoid streaking is to exfoliate before applying and to wait for the present tan to fade before applying again. No one product can satisfy all customers but this is one that you should try!</li>
            <li> Still causes streaking</li>
            <li> This is the best. I have used it for years on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to be a loyal fan for as long as I can remember.  It was hard to find this line locally and now that I have found it on Amazon I am thrilled.  I&#x27;ve used up the last of my gelee &amp; just about done with this lotion (didn&#x27;t realize it was only 4 fl. oz. - my fault).  Spreads nicely, no horrible scent &amp; love the self tanning part without turning me orange!</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen with self tanner that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Very natural tan look.  Smells very nice</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for many years.  Unfortunately they stopped carrying it in stores so for several years I had to use other brands/products for my &amp;#34;tan in a can&amp;#34; :o).  I took a stab at looking on Amazon and was so happy to see that they carried it!!  :o)</li>
            <li> It is the best suntan lotion I have ever purchased.  It gives you a perfect golden tan.</li>
            <li> This item, Bain de Soleil ia way too expensive. Shop wisely cause there are web sites cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works slowly but had zero tanning smell.&lt;br /&gt;Best self tanner out there</li>
            <li> Best smelling self-tanner I have tried (based on no less than 10 brands). I experimented with 2 tanners simultaneously (this and St. Tropez), and this is the one that came on top. I tried it with a scented body lotion over it as well. The result was the lotion by itself was the winner. Initially, the lotion goes on with a vanilla/coconut smell. After one hour the scent was basically the same. Normally, I have to shower the tanner off after the minimum 3 hours, but I was able to keep this on overnight without removing it. The next morning, there was a very slight self tanner scent. The color was even and didn&#x27;t splotch or fade after 3 days. It is fairly quick-drying for cream. There is no tint, so I needed to take extra time to ensure I put it on evenly.</li>
            <li> I discovered this tanning lotion  any years ago,  it&#x27;s the only tanning lotion that my daughter can use.  She is faired skin and this lotion gives her a nice tran without getting a sun burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a deep tan! The aroma of the lotion was subtle I liked that. And the speed of my delivery was impressive , Amazon sure knows how to fill an order</li>
            <li> An oldie and a goodie</li>
            <li> Gives even color. Doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The self tanner portion gives me a great tan and the SPF keeps me from burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time, I&#x27;ll try more often as I start to fade later on in the summer and not as outside as often...so far so good.</li>
            <li> Control the tan you want to get, put on as much or as little as you want as often as you like. Keeps your tan longer too long after the sun is gone. Excellent product, pleasant scent - works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent but expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li> I bought Mega Tan based on the reviews I read here on Amazon. I am very fair skinned &amp; ALWAYS turn orange (orange-ish at best!) when I use a self-tanner no matter how many claims I have read to the contrary. This is the most natural \\&quot;tan\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever achieved from a \\&quot;faux\\&quot; tanner.  I just bought 4 more! I plan to keep a constant supply &amp; remain tan all year round!</li>
            <li> Was looking for the one I used as a young adult, this one being a little different. It still worked great.</li>
            <li> I had to order it from the internet.  It is difficult to find in the stores in this lotion.  It is my favorite sun block but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my updated review after a few days of testing. I didn&#x27;t see any photos, and I have never used a chemical tanner, so I had no idea what to expect.  I began by covering a test area of un-tanned skin on my upper leg, reapplying every couple hours, for about 4 applications, without sun exposure. At first I believed it was worthless, since after 6 hours the self-tanning was barely noticeable, especially in artificial light.  This is a mild self-tanner, and it has taken a full 12 hours for the effects to become apparent. This morning it was much more obvious where I did the test, and the color *looked* like a natural tan, except for missing the warmer colors produced by a long day in the sun. In the included picture, the skin at the top is a natural tan, 2 days after sunbathing. At the bottom is an area unexposed to the sun, and the left side has had 4 applications of this product.  All in all, it&#x27;s a mild addition to an existing tan, which was what I was looking for. I&#x27;ll also comment that the smell isn&#x27;t offensive, and reminds me of the days on the beach when I was a kid. I have a very sensitive nose, and this product isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  Update: There is a noticeable odor the day after, but that&#x27;s not the reason why I&#x27;m lowering my rating to two stars. The actual color of the tan became more apparent with two applications. After washing the sunscreen off completely, I was outdoors when the sun was low in the sky, and there was a noticeable orange hue on my lower half, where I had applied this product twice, liberally (as stated in the directions).  Needless to say, I felt a bit ridiculous, although I don&#x27;t think it was so extreme that people noticed. We&#x27;re not talking Roark Junior here, but it is enough to stop me from using it again. The upper part of me, with a single application, was less noticeable a color.  Two days later, the unnatural hue had faded a bit, but at sunrise and sunset I could still notice an orange/yellow hue. I did get a few commentsthat I look tan (though I was already a bit tan before using this product)</li>
            <li> love,love,love this self tanner.  Had used this for a number of years, but then couldn&#x27;t! Find it  anywhere.  Can always rely on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This creme is highly fragranced. I don&#x27;t care for the scent; cloying. I might end up using it on my legs since its not appropriate for sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to add light color and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!</li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and I like the natural tan it gives.  Ive used this product for 15 years</li>
            <li> I have used Ban de Soleil products since the 80s. They were the &#x27;it&#x27; thing in the 80s. Remember the commercials?! This stuff is great. It really jump starts your tan for the beginning of summer, then I switch to Ban de Soleil SPF 4 gelee once I have a base tan and alternate back and forth. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t turn you into Oompa Loompa orange. The only complaint I have, and it&#x27;s not even a complaint really, is the scent. It&#x27;s far better then most self tanning products but it still reminds me a bit of Play-doh! All the other Ban de Soleil products smell wonderful and every time I use them I think of all my summers at the beach when I was a teen.</li>
            <li> The best and I have been using since the 1980&#x27;s . This lotion provides sunscreen and keeps your skin soft . Plus the smell is so nice!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in the product I received. It seems to be an old product. It is in an old box, with an old label. The one I purchased last year had a new label and a expiration date on it. This one looks old and does not have a expiration date on the box or the product. I recently found the product at a retail store, and it is a new product. New label and colors and a good expiration date. I am seriously thinking of returning this product that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I just found this at Walgreens (TX) has it for $3 less, this wk it&#x27;s buy 1 get 1 for 50% off!!</li>
            <li> Just nor seeing any color</li>
            <li> used it for 10 years, i think its the best you can do for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful natural color this product gives and there is no offensive odor. Highly recommend it and glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Growing up I have fond memories of being at the beach with my mom and her using Bain de Soleil.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am grown, Bain de Soleil has always been the only sunscreen I will ever use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lifeguarded for the past 3 summers now and all of my friends always rave about my&lt;br /&gt;seriously perfect bronze tan! Trust me, its not just the lifeguarding, its this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love all of the products!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I lifeguard I use the spray,&lt;br /&gt;when I lay out by myself and want some serious color I use the gel orange&lt;br /&gt;When Im out with friends i use the Mega tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the unique smell and every product works amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, for the best bronze tan, BAIN DE SOLEIL!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using bain de soleil since i was a kid... i love the orange gelee but this is a great, less greasy alternative</li>
            <li> Not as good as the gel.  I have been using the gel for as long as I can remember and then my Mom before me....Love the original gel</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I am very pale and do not tan easily. For years I have been trying to get the &amp;#34;perfect tan&amp;#34; through self tanners. They would always come out yellow or orange or streaky. This is the first self tanner that I have used that looks like a real tan. I am very happy with this and will continue to buy  this product.</li>
            <li> This particular Bain de Soleil did not come close to meeting expectations.  I noticed no color and ordered the dark tanning which I have used for years.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with the latter from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found my favorite tanning lotion on Amazon. I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  It works well and smells great!  Just remember to wash your palms after you apply, otherwise they turn a funny color...  :)</li>
            <li> I did a test area on my leg and ... nothing.  No self tanning happened at all.  I will try again, but so far I am not impressed.  I wish Bain de Soleil would make the orange gelee in spf 8 or 10 and I would be happy.</li>
            <li> Promotes even looking tan.</li>
            <li> The best Sunscreen lotion with the best scent</li>
            <li> Love this whole line of sun care products, but they are becoming increasingly hard to find. I sure hope they don&#x27;t  discontinue this one, it great for early summer to get your tan going. Spreads on easily and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Bain de Soleil used to be good. This was oily.  If you want a great tan try FakeBake. It is the best fake tan ever. You can find it here on Amazon.</li>
