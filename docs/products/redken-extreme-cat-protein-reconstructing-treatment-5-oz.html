            <li>Attention everyone.this product is amazing</li>
            <li>and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>For my hair which is very fine, it is too concentrated.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It was better than conditioners for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I know it does a lot of damage, but with this product I am able to grow my hair out and keep highlighting it.  </li>
            <li>I did some damage to my hair and this helps make it feel healthy again</li>
            <li>and I started getting compliments on how shiny and healthy it looked and</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really healthy, look better, and hold a style better.  </li>
            <li>; treatment worked even better.</li>
            <li>This is okay to use now and again, but the leave-in product has made a world of difference to my hair.</li>
            <li>I guarantee you all love this.</li>
            <li>Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling really healthy without the weightiness.</li>
            <li>For the price that I had paid, one would think this product would have worked better.</li>
            <li>but there are better products for the money.</li>
            <li>Hair Fortifying Treatment, which seemed to work even better, because it immediately made my hair feel thicker (as I was rinsing the product out).  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it and the shampoo and conditioner with the protein.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>Helps keep it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Do this 2-3 times a week or whenever you wash your hair and within a couple months you&#x27;ll notice your hair is really easy to style, feels stronger, smoother, and just looks healthy.</li>
            <li>keeps my fine hair healthy</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel so alive and shinny and in great condition,.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is finally starting to look good again!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and blow drying and curling easily causes breakage.  </li>
            <li>My hair is too fine to use a cream conditioner, yet it needs something after a shampoo to help repair damage and for detangling.  </li>
            <li>Just use the spray for 3-4 minutes and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>My post-menopausal, highlighted and color treated, fine hair was breaking and snapping all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Used 2 weeks before used Matrix opti smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s looking healthier and almost as frizz free as my &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>rinse LIGHTLY and follow with a conditioner or rinse to moisturize, seal and detangle.</li>
            <li>After about a week my hair started to feel more natural and people were telling me that my hair look liked</li>
            <li>It makes my hair full and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money if you want to keep your hair in check!</li>
            <li>I do not usually buy products as I make my own.</li>
            <li>but I was able to repair it decently with this reconstruct or and with using the anti snap.</li>
            <li>have very damage hair, and with this product I found my hair is strong again.</li>
            <li>It does wonders and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Apply about ten pumps to freshly washed, damp hair (two in front , two on each side, two on the crown (top) and two in back) use more if needed until you get a lather when hair is massaged if hair does not lather, you need more.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist just commented on my hair&#x27;s healthy, soft feeling too.  </li>
            <li>so its like a fresh start.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it and she was right.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product is a big help.  </li>
            <li>Excellent when extra heavy conditioning needed for hair.  </li>
            <li>I bleach my hair and it was to the point that it was breaking off more and more everyday.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any one with fine, soft hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse and follow up with a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, light brown (natural color), thin/fine hair</li>
            <li>This product made my hair hard after the first use and after 3x in a row it was significantly more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am using the whole &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; line to get my hair back into condition and this is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped to strengthen my hair a whole bunch!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fragile hair that breaks easily after washing.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and has been damaged by dying it for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li>I use this for my fine, soft, natural (not chemically treated), hard-to-manage hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;SO my point of sharing that is to state that if your hair feels hard after you use this that&#x27;s a GOOD thing because the proteins are fortifying your hair.  </li>
            <li>After torturing my hair with bleach and coloring this was very healing for it.  </li>
            <li>So I kept doing this about twice a week for a couple of months because my hair was very damaged from bleaching and it really does work.</li>
            <li>Maybe I used too much??</li>
            <li>It seems to thicken and make my hair look so much fuller</li>
            <li>Works on evry type of hair and really works repair your hair and ends.</li>
            <li>When my hair was really fried from getting highlights over bleached hair (will never do that again), the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Ten&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Since I both color and perm my hair and also swim a lot, my hair really takes a beating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to repair the damage repeated chemical processing can do to their hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>and I found the keratin treatment really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see so much effect</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see much of that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about hair</li>
            <li>I shampoo, rinse, squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair, then spray a LOT of either this or the CHI spray in, leave in for 10-15 minutes, then rinse, then condition - once a week</li>
            <li>and both work very well.</li>
            <li>and my hair is much softer.  </li>
            <li>I really notice it help with all of the breakage</li>
            <li>Protein is really needed for those who dye their hair and for those who swim for sport (like me).</li>
            <li>You must leave this in your hair for at least 10 minutes with a shower cap if you really want good results.</li>
            <li>Her suggestion was to apply it to shampooed and towel dried hair and put a plastic cap over it and use a warm dryer for about 5 minutes to activate it.</li>
            <li>works better than any other</li>
            <li>After several bleaching treatments my once beautiful, strong, thick hair was dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, oily, thin, super straight hair.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to use it in towel dried hair otherwise it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li>My Stylist recommended this product because she said that the older hair gets, it can lose protein and look as if chunks have been taken out of the strand of hair.  </li>
            <li>For Fine Hair or a not so heavy feel: Body Full Conditioner , Time Reset Youth Revitalizer or Diamond Oil High Shine Clear Gel Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to towel dry your hair or else it just drips right off wet hair.</li>
            <li>He stressed that I would not see immediate results when I hopped out of the shower, but that it would help my hair recover to its full health in the long run, and would help undo some damage that color treatments cause.    </li>
            <li>So I quit using it, and it took a couple of months for it to feel normal again.</li>
            <li>The ideal follow-up treatments: REDKEN® Curvaceous Curl Dive Mask, Diamond Oil Deep Facets Mask or All Soft Heavy Cream for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell anything right away, but after a couple of months, my hair was SUPER dry and starting to break.</li>
            <li>and I live in CO</li>
            <li>vibrant colors put in my highlights like Pravana&#x27;s Vivids in Violet or Wild Orchid.</li>
            <li>With wet hands you cannot grasp it firmly enough to spray on your hair because it&#x27;s tapered at the top.</li>
            <li>Therefore it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was completely fried from over processing!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a heavy conditioner afterward, it doesn&#x27;t say it  on the bottle, but it&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li>This is not a magical conditioner that coats your hair with wax or fats to trick you into thinking your hair is magically healthy just because it looks like hair in commercials.</li>
            <li>However, when I used to get my hair lightened (bleached), the Redken Extreme Strength Builder treatment worked better because it contains the same protein but adds moisture.  </li>
            <li>after bleaching and re-bleaching my hair 3 times in 1 week, this stuff (in cunjuction with smooth down conditioner and anti-snap) SAVED MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>She also suggested if you have the time to just sit for about 30 min or more with it on at least once a week.</li>
            <li>can damage hair / make it coarse if used too much.</li>
            <li>I wrote a review for a similar product from this line of products (the anti-snap leave-in treatment) - using both of these products (along with some coconut oil hair masks and keratin treatment) has really smoothed out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got this on recommendation from an email to Redken when I wrote and asked what was the closest replacement product they had for the old PPT they used to sell.  </li>
            <li>It may have also given it a bit of gloss, but my hair is naturally glossy anyway</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>I have no plans and leave it in for about 4-6 hours for deep recontructor since I dye my hair so much.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>After huge handfuls of my hair falling out I got it cut and ordered the entire line of Redken Extreme products.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair color is black and I like to get fun</li>
            <li>I wash it out with cold water and my hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li>it was getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Thin hair needs more protein, so I use this treatment once a week.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I much prefer the Redken Extreme Leave-In Anti-Snap conditioner to this rinse out product.</li>
            <li>For Very Damaged Hair: EXTREME STRENGTH BUILDER PLUS Mask.</li>
            <li>went from my natural dark brunette color to a light blond in 1 day, along with residual damage from a Japanese straightening perm from the previous year, so my hair was shot.</li>
            <li>It was super soft when wet, but that was misleading because as it dried the moisture from the water left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this would be great for those women who have course, thick curly hair and are trying to tame it down.</li>
            <li>He instructed me to use 3x in a row the first day leaving in a few minutes each time then 1x a day for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it every few days at first and now I use it once a week or once every two weeks as my hair has grown thicker again.</li>
            <li>I shampoo first, then spray this on and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I usually start this right after a hair cut</li>
            <li>Normally, you just spray it on your wet hair in the shower and rinse out 3-5 minutes later.  </li>
            <li>but I do know if your hair is very damaged,takes hours to dry, and is sort of slimy when wet (like you pull on a strand</li>
            <li>Good nor bad ones.</li>

            <li> Totally worth the money if you want to keep your hair in check!</li>
            <li> I do not usually buy products as I make my own.</li>
            <li> but I was able to repair it decently with this reconstruct or and with using the anti snap.</li>
            <li> have very damage hair, and with this product I found my hair is strong again.</li>
            <li> It does wonders and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Apply about ten pumps to freshly washed, damp hair (two in front , two on each side, two on the crown (top) and two in back) use more if needed until you get a lather when hair is massaged if hair does not lather, you need more.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist just commented on my hair&#x27;s healthy, soft feeling too.  </li>
            <li> so its like a fresh start.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it and she was right.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product is a big help.  </li>
            <li> Excellent when extra heavy conditioning needed for hair.  </li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and it was to the point that it was breaking off more and more everyday.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one with fine, soft hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse and follow up with a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, light brown (natural color), thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> This product made my hair hard after the first use and after 3x in a row it was significantly more healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am using the whole &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; line to get my hair back into condition and this is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped to strengthen my hair a whole bunch!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with fragile hair that breaks easily after washing.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and has been damaged by dying it for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li> I use this for my fine, soft, natural (not chemically treated), hard-to-manage hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;SO my point of sharing that is to state that if your hair feels hard after you use this that&#x27;s a GOOD thing because the proteins are fortifying your hair.  </li>
            <li> After torturing my hair with bleach and coloring this was very healing for it.  </li>
            <li> So I kept doing this about twice a week for a couple of months because my hair was very damaged from bleaching and it really does work.</li>
            <li> Maybe I used too much??</li>
            <li> It seems to thicken and make my hair look so much fuller</li>
            <li> Works on evry type of hair and really works repair your hair and ends.</li>
            <li> When my hair was really fried from getting highlights over bleached hair (will never do that again), the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Ten&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Since I both color and perm my hair and also swim a lot, my hair really takes a beating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to repair the damage repeated chemical processing can do to their hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> and I found the keratin treatment really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see so much effect</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see much of that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hair</li>
            <li> I shampoo, rinse, squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair, then spray a LOT of either this or the CHI spray in, leave in for 10-15 minutes, then rinse, then condition - once a week</li>
            <li> and both work very well.</li>
            <li> and my hair is much softer.  </li>
            <li> I really notice it help with all of the breakage</li>
            <li> Protein is really needed for those who dye their hair and for those who swim for sport (like me).</li>
            <li> You must leave this in your hair for at least 10 minutes with a shower cap if you really want good results.</li>
            <li> Her suggestion was to apply it to shampooed and towel dried hair and put a plastic cap over it and use a warm dryer for about 5 minutes to activate it.</li>
            <li> works better than any other</li>
            <li> After several bleaching treatments my once beautiful, strong, thick hair was dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, oily, thin, super straight hair.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to use it in towel dried hair otherwise it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> My Stylist recommended this product because she said that the older hair gets, it can lose protein and look as if chunks have been taken out of the strand of hair.  </li>
            <li> For Fine Hair or a not so heavy feel: Body Full Conditioner , Time Reset Youth Revitalizer or Diamond Oil High Shine Clear Gel Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to towel dry your hair or else it just drips right off wet hair.</li>
            <li> He stressed that I would not see immediate results when I hopped out of the shower, but that it would help my hair recover to its full health in the long run, and would help undo some damage that color treatments cause.    </li>
            <li> So I quit using it, and it took a couple of months for it to feel normal again.</li>
            <li> The ideal follow-up treatments: REDKEN® Curvaceous Curl Dive Mask, Diamond Oil Deep Facets Mask or All Soft Heavy Cream for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell anything right away, but after a couple of months, my hair was SUPER dry and starting to break.</li>
            <li> and I live in CO</li>
            <li> vibrant colors put in my highlights like Pravana&#x27;s Vivids in Violet or Wild Orchid.</li>
            <li> With wet hands you cannot grasp it firmly enough to spray on your hair because it&#x27;s tapered at the top.</li>
            <li> Therefore it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried from over processing!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a heavy conditioner afterward, it doesn&#x27;t say it  on the bottle, but it&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> This is not a magical conditioner that coats your hair with wax or fats to trick you into thinking your hair is magically healthy just because it looks like hair in commercials.</li>
            <li> However, when I used to get my hair lightened (bleached), the Redken Extreme Strength Builder treatment worked better because it contains the same protein but adds moisture.  </li>
            <li> after bleaching and re-bleaching my hair 3 times in 1 week, this stuff (in cunjuction with smooth down conditioner and anti-snap) SAVED MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> She also suggested if you have the time to just sit for about 30 min or more with it on at least once a week.</li>
            <li> can damage hair / make it coarse if used too much.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for a similar product from this line of products (the anti-snap leave-in treatment) - using both of these products (along with some coconut oil hair masks and keratin treatment) has really smoothed out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Got this on recommendation from an email to Redken when I wrote and asked what was the closest replacement product they had for the old PPT they used to sell.  </li>
            <li> It may have also given it a bit of gloss, but my hair is naturally glossy anyway</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> I have no plans and leave it in for about 4-6 hours for deep recontructor since I dye my hair so much.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> After huge handfuls of my hair falling out I got it cut and ordered the entire line of Redken Extreme products.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is black and I like to get fun</li>
            <li> I wash it out with cold water and my hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> it was getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Thin hair needs more protein, so I use this treatment once a week.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I much prefer the Redken Extreme Leave-In Anti-Snap conditioner to this rinse out product.</li>
            <li> For Very Damaged Hair: EXTREME STRENGTH BUILDER PLUS Mask.</li>
            <li> went from my natural dark brunette color to a light blond in 1 day, along with residual damage from a Japanese straightening perm from the previous year, so my hair was shot.</li>
            <li> It was super soft when wet, but that was misleading because as it dried the moisture from the water left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this would be great for those women who have course, thick curly hair and are trying to tame it down.</li>
            <li> He instructed me to use 3x in a row the first day leaving in a few minutes each time then 1x a day for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it every few days at first and now I use it once a week or once every two weeks as my hair has grown thicker again.</li>
            <li> I shampoo first, then spray this on and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually start this right after a hair cut</li>
            <li> Normally, you just spray it on your wet hair in the shower and rinse out 3-5 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> but I do know if your hair is very damaged,takes hours to dry, and is sort of slimy when wet (like you pull on a strand</li>
            <li> Good nor bad ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pretty thick hair, and that hair can get pretty dried out, frizzy, coarse, etc.</li>
            <li> Its gone from barely feeling like hair to being soft and shiny in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and get it high lighted every few months and blow dry it straight a few times a week so my hair can get quite damaged.</li>
            <li> It is now soft and I have way less breakage.</li>
            <li> This product changes the texture of my too soft hair into thicker, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I spent $18 on this bottle when an egg mixed with oils does the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Cat is the best product I have found to combat all of the evil things I do to my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed no effect on my color treated long hair at all.</li>
            <li> Its totally a long term thing.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is wheat (gluten) &amp; I had an extreme reaction, was awake all night.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend these products, especially in conjunction with other moisturizing shampoo/conditioner/masks</li>
            <li> I keep a dry washcloth in the shower.  </li>
            <li> After shampoo and conditioning, I blot my hair with the dry cloth and spritz this through.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t let my hair air dry b/c</li>
            <li> my hair was a bit dry from coloring.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair was breaking quite a bit when dry.  </li>
            <li> I have colored/bleached blond hair, that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> so do not expect your hair is soft with him, he will return proteins that your hair needs, your result is gradual, should be used 1 time per week for an extremely damaged hair and then remove hair product and apply a moisturizing mask and with wet hands is a bit tricky to apply the product but will not give less stars so since the fault is not the seller.</li>
            <li> I have sprayed this on my wet hair after a shower and let it dry, for maximum potency.  </li>
            <li> After a rough and rocky flirtation with John Freida volumizing hair products, I had some severely damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference when I use this product over a few months time.  </li>
            <li> After a while I will get breakage along my hairline at the top of my hair and get those annoying tiny hairs that stick up.</li>
            <li> I will say however that you should be careful when applying Extreme Cat:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week, along with the Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave In Conditioner, and my tired old hair is looking shinier and feeling stronger than it has in quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Like any other part of your body, you can&#x27;t improve your hair or make it healthier in the span of 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Cat does what it says it does: it strengthened my hair.</li>
            <li> It works, but I&#x27;d recommend using it in addition to the Extreme Anti-Snap leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> He suggested I use Redken&#x27;s CAT and their other extreme lines</li>
            <li> instead I go every other month.</li>
            <li> My hair is flat looking after just a small amount is applied.</li>
            <li> The product is hard to find anymore where I am at and was the same price I&#x27;d pay here with the shipping, since its discounted on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After dying my hair a few times within 10 days I lost some of the body I had due to damage.</li>
            <li> I do this for about half an hour once a week</li>
            <li> I wanted to go from black to blond hair.  </li>
            <li> It has smoothed out my hair and less hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> a puffy frizzy electrocuted looking mess.</li>
            <li> and I have less of those little hairs along my hairline.</li>
            <li> Spritz just a little on towel dried hair with a shower cap on and use a blow dryer to activate.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it really works and saved me from cutting off about 6 inches of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave my the REDKEN CAT Protein after a harsh coloring treatment.</li>
            <li> It is sprayed on after shampooing and rinsed out after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just a few squirts to damp hair</li>
            <li> It loses a star because it&#x27;s so dang hard to spray on when your hands are wet!</li>
            <li> I like this product as there are not many products on the market that restores protein to the hair like CAT from Redken.</li>
            <li> Not able to return product.</li>
            <li> I usually try to avoid rinsing it all out, so it will continue to repair and protect my hair during blow drying and when I am in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a difference</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> so I just use it when I notice breakage and not more than once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I usually put this in once a month on a Saturday</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the shower, it&#x27;s really hard to grip while spraying this stuff in my hair.</li>
            <li> I leave it in for at least three minutes while I wash and shave my legs, then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> when I left it in for 9 minutes instead of the recommended 3-4 minutes (I lost track of time), my hair became painful and felt a bit dried out.</li>
            <li> I substituted this for my conditioner and it makes my hair feel limp and thin.</li>
            <li> It was so sad I ruined it by repeated bleaching, dying, toning, abuse from shampooing everyday.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle so expensive.</li>
            <li> my cousin even asked to know my secret.</li>
            <li> The results are gradual but I think the secret is the protein in this treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that everyone else&#x27;s hairdresser wasn&#x27;t as helpful as mine, because he explained to me that the spray will help replenish protein in my hair over time.</li>
            <li> Very poor design.</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty feet.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see a change, and too expensive!</li>
            <li> and my hair was impossible to comb, even to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> I never bought a product so bad.</li>
            <li> feel bad on my hair</li>
            <li> , it was that bad.  </li>
            <li> Smelled horrible, not like it should smell.</li>
            <li> My hair was in horrible shape after I went to the salon.  </li>
            <li> Also the bottle design is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible.</li>

            <li> After torturing my hair with bleach and coloring this was very healing for it.  Its gone from barely feeling like hair to being soft and shiny in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very damage hair, and with this product I found my hair is strong again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair full and easy to manage. I would recommend this to any one with fine, soft hair.</li>
            <li> I used this twice and my hair was impossible to comb, even to run my fingers through it. I never bought a product so bad. Don&#x27;t wast your money on it, it&#x27;s to damage the hair not to treat it.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried from over processing! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and my hair has changed dramatically!!! It is now soft and I have way less breakage. Just make sure to use a heavy conditioner afterward, it doesn&#x27;t say it  on the bottle, but it&#x27;s a must! This product has been the MIRACLE I&#x27;ve been searching  for!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave my the REDKEN CAT Protein after a harsh coloring treatment. It&#x27;s unfortunate that everyone else&#x27;s hairdresser wasn&#x27;t as helpful as mine, because he explained to me that the spray will help replenish protein in my hair over time. He stressed that I would not see immediate results when I hopped out of the shower, but that it would help my hair recover to its full health in the long run, and would help undo some damage that color treatments cause.    This is not a magical conditioner that coats your hair with wax or fats to trick you into thinking your hair is magically healthy just because it looks like hair in commercials. Like any other part of your body, you can&#x27;t improve your hair or make it healthier in the span of 5 minutes. This spray helps replenish proteins over time that are stripped and damaged in the course of styling, and it does a very good job doing it.     It loses a star because it&#x27;s so dang hard to spray on when your hands are wet!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> keeps my fine hair healthy</li>
            <li> It improved the condition of my damaged hair.  It was better than conditioners for my hair.  I would recommend it to friends.  It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> after bleaching and re-bleaching my hair 3 times in 1 week, this stuff (in cunjuction with smooth down conditioner and anti-snap) SAVED MY HAIR. I went from sections of my hair breaking off to the scalp to NO breakage at all. You must leave this in your hair for at least 10 minutes with a shower cap if you really want good results. Make sure you rinse and follow up with a deep conditioner. If this could save my bleached blonde hair, it will save yorus!</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair a lot, about every eight weeks.  I know it does a lot of damage, but with this product I am able to grow my hair out and keep highlighting it.  Before I started using it, I&#x27;d have to cut quite a bit of hair off every time I went to the salon.  Now they tell me my hair is in really good shape.  Spritz just a little on towel dried hair with a shower cap on and use a blow dryer to activate.  I do this for about half an hour once a week and it makes all the difference in the world.  Also, a bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now and this was a reorder...I did some damage to my hair and this helps make it feel healthy again</li>
            <li> After multiple bleachings my hairstylist recommended this to me. Her suggestion was to apply it to shampooed and towel dried hair and put a plastic cap over it and use a warm dryer for about 5 minutes to activate it. She also suggested if you have the time to just sit for about 30 min or more with it on at least once a week. So I kept doing this about twice a week for a couple of months because my hair was very damaged from bleaching and it really does work. My hair started to get stronger and I started getting compliments on how shiny and healthy it looked and my cousin even asked to know my secret. The results are gradual but I think the secret is the protein in this treatment.</li>
            <li> Smelled horrible, not like it should smell.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, oily, thin, super straight hair. Hoping this would pouf my hair a bit (don&#x27;t know why I thought that), I purchased and began using every day. I couldn&#x27;t tell anything right away, but after a couple of months, my hair was SUPER dry and starting to break. At my next hair appt., I told my hairdresser what I had been using, and she said that any treatment with a lot of protein will do that to hair. Yikes!! So I quit using it, and it took a couple of months for it to feel normal again. Maybe I used too much?? Scared to try it again, though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have used it for years and I have very fine hair. It seems to thicken and make my hair look so much fuller</li>
            <li> I like this product as there are not many products on the market that restores protein to the hair like CAT from Redken. It shipped from London! I was unaware when ordering, so it took a couple of weeks. No biggy though. The product is hard to find anymore where I am at and was the same price I&#x27;d pay here with the shipping, since its discounted on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this item and have used it for years! A must for me to keep on hand!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, amazing! Works on evry type of hair and really works repair your hair and ends. Try it!</li>
            <li> I use this for my fine, soft, natural (not chemically treated), hard-to-manage hair.  It makes my hair feel really healthy, look better, and hold a style better.  However, when I used to get my hair lightened (bleached), the Redken Extreme Strength Builder treatment worked better because it contains the same protein but adds moisture.  When my hair was really fried from getting highlights over bleached hair (will never do that again), the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Ten&amp;#34; treatment worked even better.</li>
            <li> Since I both color and perm my hair and also swim a lot, my hair really takes a beating.  Redken Extreme Cat is the best product I have found to combat all of the evil things I do to my hair.  It works wonders.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for those who are looking for a light protein product. Definitely a keeper in my book!</li>
            <li> This conditioner gives my hair strength and seems to repair the damage I cause when I highlight my hair every 3 months.</li>
            <li> After a rough and rocky flirtation with John Freida volumizing hair products, I had some severely damaged hair.  I am using the whole &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; line to get my hair back into condition and this is my favorite product.  I keep a dry washcloth in the shower.  After shampoo and conditioning, I blot my hair with the dry cloth and spritz this through.  Leave on 3-5 minutes and rinse.  It does wonders and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> can damage hair / make it coarse if used too much. Be careful!</li>
            <li> works better than any other</li>
            <li> My trusted hairdresser for 10+ years recommended I use this product before our next appointment. My natural hair color is black and I like to get fun vibrant colors put in my highlights like Pravana&#x27;s Vivids in Violet or Wild Orchid. That means she has to bleach the snot out of my hair. After the last go-round the bleached parts started to feel like straw. This product seemed to make a noticeable difference in the strength of those sections within two uses! You still have to use conditioner after this spray, so don&#x27;t expect it to detangle your hair or make it softer. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to repair the damage repeated chemical processing can do to their hair.</li>
            <li> I trust nothing else except Redken CAT to repair my damaged hair. I was a licenses cosmetologist for 13 years and I swore by this stuff. Will keep buying!</li>
            <li> My hair was in horrible shape after I went to the salon.  I wanted to go from black to blond hair.  After several bleaching treatments my once beautiful, strong, thick hair was dry and brittle.  After huge handfuls of my hair falling out I got it cut and ordered the entire line of Redken Extreme products.  After about a week my hair started to feel more natural and people were telling me that my hair look liked it was getting back to normal.  Thank goodness for these product they saved my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I much prefer the Redken Extreme Leave-In Anti-Snap conditioner to this rinse out product. This is okay to use now and again, but the leave-in product has made a world of difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever!! Stronger hair instantly</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and has been damaged by dying it for the last 3 years. I have always loved Redken products so I decided to try this one. It has made my hair stronger and fuller. I shampoo my hair, rinse, and then spray this on. I leave it in for at least three minutes while I wash and shave my legs, then rinse it out. I end by using a good conditioner. There has definitely been a difference in the strenght of my hair--less breakage--since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is wheat (gluten) &amp; I had an extreme reaction, was awake all night. Not able to return product.</li>
            <li> Used 2 weeks before used Matrix opti smooth.  Excellent when extra heavy conditioning needed for hair.  Small bottle so expensive.</li>
            <li> Attention everyone.this product is amazing I recomend this to everybody especially to those who had permanently straighten thier hair or colored thier hair this product will save your life spray into your hair follow the instruction in the bottle and your hair will get back in life. I even get to run my finger on my hair after the treatment of this product I guarantee you all love this.Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive. Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy. Excellent choose. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for a similar product from this line of products (the anti-snap leave-in treatment) - using both of these products (along with some coconut oil hair masks and keratin treatment) has really smoothed out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from my natural dark brunette color to a light blond in 1 day, along with residual damage from a Japanese straightening perm from the previous year, so my hair was shot. I couldn&#x27;t let my hair air dry b/c it would end up a puffy frizzy electrocuted looking mess. I was panicked and convinced I had made a grave mistake but I worked with my stylist and followed her advice and took extra care of my hair. Now it&#x27;s looking healthier and almost as frizz free as my &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair. :) I would def recommend these products, especially in conjunction with other moisturizing shampoo/conditioner/masks and I found the keratin treatment really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. I do not usually buy products as I make my own. My hair needed repair and my cousin told me about this. I have to say it really works and saved me from cutting off about 6 inches of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  My hair is too fine to use a cream conditioner, yet it needs something after a shampoo to help repair damage and for detangling.  CAT is a protein based product rather than a cream based product.  Therefore it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  It is sprayed on after shampooing and rinsed out after a few minutes.  I usually try to avoid rinsing it all out, so it will continue to repair and protect my hair during blow drying and when I am in the sun.  It leaves hair feeling really healthy without the weightiness.</li>
            <li> redken great-great price</li>
            <li> This product was recommended b/c my hair was a bit dry from coloring.  I purchased it and used it. I did not see any type of results. Good nor bad ones. My hair stayed the same. For the price that I had paid, one would think this product would have worked better. The product did not do what it was supposed to do. Maybe it was just me?</li>
            <li> Good but there are better products for the money.</li>
            <li> Have  used  product  on  my  hair  for  years,  love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair extemely oily. I substituted this for my conditioner and it makes my hair feel limp and thin.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  A friend recommended it and she was right.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference as I do with Apogee</li>
            <li> It works but you have to give it time. You will not see immediate results with this one. Also, make sure to use it in towel dried hair otherwise it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> According to some of the reviews here, some people don&#x27;t know what they are using or WHY they are using it. REDKEN® Extreme™ CAT™ is a STRENGTHENING RECONSTRUCTOR. It is supposed to restore strength, resiliency and body to chemically damaged hair. If your hair is NOT chemically treated this product is not for you. Apply about ten pumps to freshly washed, damp hair (two in front , two on each side, two on the crown (top) and two in back) use more if needed until you get a lather when hair is massaged if hair does not lather, you need more. Leave on 10 to 20 min. rinse LIGHTLY and follow with a conditioner or rinse to moisturize, seal and detangle. This is not an &#x27;instant cure&#x27; and you may need several applications to see results - BUT, you will see them. The ideal follow-up treatments: REDKEN® Curvaceous Curl Dive Mask, Diamond Oil Deep Facets Mask or All Soft Heavy Cream for dry, brittle hair. For Fine Hair or a not so heavy feel: Body Full Conditioner , Time Reset Youth Revitalizer or Diamond Oil High Shine Clear Gel Conditioner. For Very Damaged Hair: EXTREME STRENGTH BUILDER PLUS Mask. -  Hope This Helps.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see so much effect</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a stylist.  I have fine hair and blow drying and curling easily causes breakage.  This product helps to strengthen the hair which produces a thicker look.  Don&#x27;t over do it.  Use it only once or twice a week.  I definitely see a difference when I use this product over a few months time.  Don&#x27;t look for overnight results.</li>
            <li> Great! It helps to strenghten my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone with fragile hair that breaks easily after washing.</li>
            <li> I severely damaged my hair with bleach but I was able to repair it decently with this reconstruct or and with using the anti snap. I am ecstatic with these products from redken</li>
            <li> Got this on recommendation from an email to Redken when I wrote and asked what was the closest replacement product they had for the old PPT they used to sell.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Cat does what it says it does: it strengthened my hair. It may have also given it a bit of gloss, but my hair is naturally glossy anyway so I didn&#x27;t see much of that. I will say however that you should be careful when applying Extreme Cat: when I left it in for 9 minutes instead of the recommended 3-4 minutes (I lost track of time), my hair became painful and felt a bit dried out. It didn&#x27;t break off like I&#x27;ve heard someone else say though. Just use the spray for 3-4 minutes and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It works, but I&#x27;d recommend using it in addition to the Extreme Anti-Snap leave in treatment. Make sure to towel dry your hair or else it just drips right off wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product is a big help.  Just a few squirts to damp hair and it helps with body and styling&lt;br /&gt;b</li>
            <li> For my hair which is very fine, it is too concentrated. My hair is flat looking after just a small amount is applied. I think this would be great for those women who have course, thick curly hair and are trying to tame it down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I swear I see a difference.  I have been growing my hair out for 3 years now and its been a struggle.  I dyed it a lot and the ends are a bit damaged.  I will buy this gain once its out, my hair is finally starting to look good again!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see a change, and too expensive!</li>
            <li> Product actually very good. But this is a product for reconstruction so do not expect your hair is soft with him, he will return proteins that your hair needs, your result is gradual, should be used 1 time per week for an extremely damaged hair and then remove hair product and apply a moisturizing mask and with wet hands is a bit tricky to apply the product but will not give less stars so since the fault is not the seller.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a difference but with all the different products used together I guess it helps.</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and it was to the point that it was breaking off more and more everyday. This has really helped to strengthen my hair a whole bunch! I shampoo and rinse my hair and then i spray this on and let it sit for maybe 10 minutes and then i rinse and use a deep conditioner! Id recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing a review and recommendation on YouTube but I noticed no effect on my color treated long hair at all. Also the bottle design is HORRIBLE. With wet hands you cannot grasp it firmly enough to spray on your hair because it&#x27;s tapered at the top. Very poor design. Will not buy again. Buy \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; instead.</li>
            <li> very good for fine hair - helps with the texture &amp; gives body</li>
            <li> feel bad on my hair im latina</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff. The reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is the shape of the bottle. When I&#x27;m in the shower, it&#x27;s really hard to grip while spraying this stuff in my hair. I had to buy a different spray bottle from the local drugstore and put it in there.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> My hair was TRASHED.  It was so sad I ruined it by repeated bleaching, dying, toning, abuse from shampooing everyday.  I went to a stylist to see what I could do because I felt like I just needed to  shave my head, it was that bad.  He suggested I use Redken&#x27;s CAT and their other extreme lines so I bought the CAT bottle.  He instructed me to use 3x in a row the first day leaving in a few minutes each time then 1x a day for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW.  I don&#x27;t know much about hair but I do know if your hair is very damaged,takes hours to dry, and is sort of slimy when wet (like you pull on a strand and it keeps stretching then snaps) it&#x27;s a sign it&#x27;s fried.  Also, my hair was breaking quite a bit when dry.  It was super soft when wet, but that was misleading because as it dried the moisture from the water left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO my point of sharing that is to state that if your hair feels hard after you use this that&#x27;s a GOOD thing because the proteins are fortifying your hair.  This product made my hair hard after the first use and after 3x in a row it was significantly more healthy.  Follow up with a deep moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it hit me the next night.  I spent $18 on this bottle when an egg mixed with oils does the same thing.  My hair is almost fully restored to what it was before the chemical abuse.  Be patient and don&#x27;t lose hope, it&#x27;s a process that takes time</li>
            <li> I have waist length, light brown (natural color), thin/fine hair and I live in CO so it&#x27;s dry/mixed weather here - lots of sun, wind, rain, snow, etc. for your hair to deal with.  Thin hair needs more protein, so I use this treatment once a week.  I also tried&lt;br /&gt;Chi Deep Brilliance Silkeratin 17 Hair Fortifying Treatment, which seemed to work even better, because it immediately made my hair feel thicker (as I was rinsing the product out).  Try both and see what you think.  I shampoo, rinse, squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair, then spray a LOT of either this or the CHI spray in, leave in for 10-15 minutes, then rinse, then condition - once a week and both work very well.</li>
            <li> After dying my hair a few times within 10 days I lost some of the body I had due to damage. This definitely helped it by reviving some of the body OVER TIME. It does not work in one use. I used it every few days at first and now I use it once a week or once every two weeks as my hair has grown thicker again.</li>
            <li> My post-menopausal, highlighted and color treated, fine hair was breaking and snapping all over the place.  My Stylist recommended this product because she said that the older hair gets, it can lose protein and look as if chunks have been taken out of the strand of hair.  This can make it snap and break.  I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week, along with the Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave In Conditioner, and my tired old hair is looking shinier and feeling stronger than it has in quite a long time.  You must use a conditioner after you rinse or your hair will feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Excellente product! Make my hair stronger!! I love this product! And all the products for this brand are excellent!! !!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair feel so soft and I now do not have to go every 6 weeks for a hair cut instead I go every other month. This product arrived when it was supposed to and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love it and the shampoo and conditioner with the protein. It has smoothed out my hair and less hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have colored/bleached blond hair, that tends to be dry.  I use this product twice a week and my hair is much softer.  My hair stylist just commented on my hair&#x27;s healthy, soft feeling too.  I have sprayed this on my wet hair after a shower and let it dry, for maximum potency.  Normally, you just spray it on your wet hair in the shower and rinse out 3-5 minutes later.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have colored/bleached hair, also post chemo hair.  This product makes my hair feel so alive and shinny and in great condition,.  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pretty thick hair, and that hair can get pretty dried out, frizzy, coarse, etc. This stuff is great. Its totally a long term thing. Do this 2-3 times a week or whenever you wash your hair and within a couple months you&#x27;ll notice your hair is really easy to style, feels stronger, smoother, and just looks healthy. I usually start this right after a hair cut so its like a fresh start.</li>
            <li> This product changes the texture of my too soft hair into thicker, less frizzy.It is not for eveybodys hair,but certaily works for mine.</li>
            <li> Great for rebuilding damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible. Smells like dirty feet. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> Great product! I go to a salon and my hair stylist introduced me to this product. I have blond hair and get it high lighted every few months and blow dry it straight a few times a week so my hair can get quite damaged. After a while I will get breakage along my hairline at the top of my hair and get those annoying tiny hairs that stick up. When I see that happen I start to use this product. I shampoo first, then spray this on and let it sit for a few minutes. I rinse it out then condition my hair. This stuff works great and after just one or two uses I really notice it help with all of the breakage and I have less of those little hairs along my hairline. You can&#x27;t use this product all of the time (my hair dresser had a great reason why but I don&#x27;t remember the specifics) so I just use it when I notice breakage and not more than once a week or so. The bottle lasts forever. Great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!! I love this spray.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I buy this at Ulta where it is surprisingly cheaper at 17 bucks. I usually put this in once a month on a Saturday I have no plans and leave it in for about 4-6 hours for deep recontructor since I dye my hair so much. I wash it out with cold water and my hair feels amazing! Protein is really needed for those who dye their hair and for those who swim for sport (like me). Totally worth the money if you want to keep your hair in check!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Good price and great service. I would recommend this to anyone. Makes your hair soft and silky. Helps keep it healthy and shiny.</li>
