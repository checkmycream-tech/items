            <li>Smells good and very light feel.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling during application.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and feels very light on my skin-- almost like water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lotion!It</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t the most perfect thing for facial moisturizer either.</li>
            <li>and now i&#x27;m WORRY-FREE!!! :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and this is just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and when I put it on, my skin is really soft.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect, but it should be more creamer, and made with less water.</li>
            <li>I preferred the original fragrance, which was longer-lasting, but the new one is still pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is really really great lotion, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and the wrinkles disappear.</li>
            <li>It IS perfect as an everyday body lotion and I will absolutely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li>I sent several items; but the Olay Moisture lotion was the one item she liked the most.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it was shipped for free within a week or so.</li>
            <li>But it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin silky.</li>
            <li>It smells really pretty but is not at all overpowering, and it leaves my skin really super smooth.</li>
            <li>has a such a nice sweet scent, and it stays with you for a while.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for myself and love the soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A lovely, lush body lotion.</li>
            <li>The fact that it came in a tube instead of one of those pump bottles was a very positive sight.  </li>
            <li>The lotion acts quickly to provide the deep, lasting moisturization that my winter-dry skin craves, and it&#x27;s a great after-sun lotion for summer, too.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many times for super dry skin, and this one works when I need it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it also has some sort of golden shimmer in it, but its very sutble.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t expected the fast delivery and really felt good when i saw the bottles covered with plastic for leak protection..</li>
            <li>First I must say that I bought this product for $2.18.</li>
            <li>When I first put this product on it felt like water, it wasn&#x27;t very creamy at all</li>
            <li>I love the very subtle scent, I can&#x27;t quite put a finger on what it is, but it&#x27;s nice and it lingers for a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay pretty thin, but not horrible lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, fresh fragrance and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers have complained that this formulation is really inferior to the first one, but I still find it more effective than other brands of intense moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, with no greasy, sticky feel afterwards, and really makes a big difference in the condition of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>made the skin look soft and supple after first use itself... use it immediately after taking bath and it does maintain the moisture of the skin throughout the day...</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly even 1st thing after a shower and it is light enough so that I have even put it on my face a few times when I was out of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I thought that would be a problem, especially since water is the first ingredient!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the long lasting effects of this lotion.</li>
            <li>wat i pay on amozon for the product to clear when it gets to me</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky soft and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling soft all day.  </li>
            <li>and I am 45 years old)  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out (I have normal to moderately oily skin</li>
            <li>Gave this item to my daughter as an early Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this thick formula over watery lotions.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>She is 36 years old now and has suffered with extremely dry skin since she was a teen.  </li>

            <li> Luxurious body wash, it feels so good! I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  The price for this in the stores is around $5.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a facial lotion every day.  It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling during application.  It does not oil up either throughout the day.  The SPF rating is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is really really great lotion, especially for the price. It smells really pretty but is not at all overpowering, and it leaves my skin really super smooth.

            <li> A lovely, lush body lotion.</li>

            <li> Helps my dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m always a fan of olay but this time i needed to buy it online..i didn&#x27;t expected the fast delivery and really felt good when i saw the bottles covered with plastic for leak protection..i will be travelling for 3 months that&#x27;s why i bought 2 bottles and now i&#x27;m WORRY-FREE!!! :)</li>
            <li> First I must say that I bought this product for $2.18. It was on sale and I had a coupon, so it was a steal! I love the very subtle scent, I can&#x27;t quite put a finger on what it is, but it&#x27;s nice and it lingers for a bit. The shimmer isn&#x27;t noticeable. When I first put this product on it felt like water, it wasn&#x27;t very creamy at all so I thought that would be a problem, especially since water is the first ingredient! But it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin silky. This product is perfect, but it should be more creamer, and made with less water.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the long lasting effects of this lotion. My skin was really dry and starting to crack due to forced air heating. I enjoy this thick formula over watery lotions. I wish this was a larger bottle. Please don&#x27;t stop making this formula - it seems to be hard to find.</li>
            <li> I could no longer buy it in the store, so I&#x27;m afraid they will discontinue. I don&#x27;t know why Olay and Pantene insist on switching products around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay pretty thin, but not horrible lotion. Smells good and very light feel.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers have complained that this formulation is really inferior to the first one, but I still find it more effective than other brands of intense moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, and will continue to buy it. I preferred the original fragrance, which was longer-lasting, but the new one is still pleasant.

            <li> This is a wonderful soothing and repairing lotion.  The price was right and it was shipped for free within a week or so.</li>
            <li> made the skin look soft and supple after first use itself... use it immediately after taking bath and it does maintain the moisture of the skin throughout the day...</li>
            <li> This lotion is just great! I love it. It has a great smell and when I put it on, my skin is really soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forvthis product in my area and gave not found it.  I love Olay products and this is just what I wanted.  It has a nice fragrance and feels very light on my skin-- almost like water.  My skin is smooth and the wrinkles disappear.</li>
            <li> I sent this lotion to my sister recovering from surgery.  I sent several items; but the Olay Moisture lotion was the one item she liked the most.  She said she had never used lotion as soothing.  She loved it!  VMW</li>
            <li> smells wonderful fresh n bubbly feels like silk on my skin without the oily residue my only problem with this item is the packageing my god a big big box for 1 small bottle of cream??? it cost me 4 time wat i pay on amozon for the product to clear when it gets to me im always gonna buy so please package smaller</li>
