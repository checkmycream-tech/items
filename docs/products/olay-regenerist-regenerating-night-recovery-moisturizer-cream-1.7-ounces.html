            <li>My skin looks great and feels so soft...</li>
            <li>I had been using the light lavender colored formula for years and had many complements on my skin.</li>

            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>I am excited by the long-term prospects.</li>
            <li>We are busy trying to buy as many of the original formulas as we can find.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the difference in price compared to other&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get a pack of 2 for less than the price of one in the store.</li>
            <li>Smell is neutral, very creamy, and is not greasy on my skin when applied.  </li>
            <li>This is a really god night cream.</li>
            <li>And for what it is worth, my mom is in her early 70&#x27;s, and I am almost 44.</li>
            <li>This particular one was not greasy upon application.</li>
            <li>This night cream is very smooth going on; and a little is all you need for your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Just came to amazon and saw many other commenters saying the exact same thing!  </li>
            <li>it seems to leave my face very soft</li>
            <li>I looked at my old jar and the new jar, the new jar says &amp;#34;Made in Thailand&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial moisturizer it is easily absorbed into skin without clogging pores and prefer it to more expensive products that are often too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and makes your face feel moist and firm.</li>
            <li>Have been using for a few years and it is a good night moisturizer, not too heavy, odorless, and keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>the smell is horrible, like cheap perfume (I have always liked the smell of Regenerist, but cannot stand this!).</li>
            <li>bought mainly for the fact that when I wake up my eye area always feel taught &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li>She has been using Olay products for as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li>The new product is sticky and dry rather than silky and moist.</li>
            <li>It is the same Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream sold at Costco and other beauty stores but at a much lower price.</li>

            <li> partly due to genetics, of course, but also because I have used Olay products for years.  </li>
            <li> Nor is it a heavy lotion, so it does not feel like a mask or goop is on your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m early sixties, and have been on the Olay skin care for years, after learning how comparable Olay is to very expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t too thick, nor was it &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this order but not in the cream that looks the same and is from local drugstores.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any of the Olay poducts against the expensive store products!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when they changed the formula</li>
            <li> Sorry Olay</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that the manufacturer reformulated this product.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a terrible rash.</li>

            <li> Olsy products work great.  Just get what works for your age and type of skin.  I&#x27;m early sixties, and have been on the Olay skin care for years, after learning how comparable Olay is to very expensive brands.  I think my face is proof that it works, when told I look much younger than I am.</li>
            <li> feels very good on my skin</li>
            <li> Smell is neutral, very creamy, and is not greasy on my skin when applied.  Nor is it a heavy lotion, so it does not feel like a mask or goop is on your face.  When I wake up, my face is not oily or such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mainly for the fact that when I wake up my eye area always feel taught &amp; dry.  This makes my face feel good when I wake up.  I use it during the day when the humidity levels drop as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No comment on the anti-wrinkle part, as I&#x27;ve only used it for about 10 days, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*did not buy from Amazon</li>
            <li> Could not believe it... I&#x27;ve been using this for year. I opened up another new jar today and something is seriously fishy... the smell is horrible, like cheap perfume (I have always liked the smell of Regenerist, but cannot stand this!). I looked at my old jar and the new jar, the new jar says &amp;#34;Made in Thailand&amp;#34;.... something is fishy, this seems like a generic product under the Oil of Olay Regenerist guise!!!!  Just came to amazon and saw many other commenters saying the exact same thing!  Amazon be aware!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really god night cream.</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream bought in US stores. I do not think it&#x27;s a knockoff, but the container is ever slightly different and the cream is very different (a little greasier, colored purple, smells completely different)</li>
            <li> Love the price and quality</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few years and it is a good night moisturizer, not too heavy, odorless, and keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 yrs. old and have very nice skin ... partly due to genetics, of course, but also because I have used Olay products for years.  I use a serum and then the moisturizing products for day and night.  This night cream is very smooth going on; and a little is all you need for your face and neck.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after a referral from my mom. She has been using Olay products for as far back as I can remember. The Regenerist line is her favorite, to date. I gave this line a shot but was skeptical, as I haven&#x27;t been a huge fan of other Olay products. I absolutely love all that I have tried. This particular one was not greasy upon application. The smell was very nice. The product wasn&#x27;t too thick, nor was it &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;. Applies easily and absorbs well, into my skin. The results have been great. I will definitely continue to use Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. And for what it is worth, my mom is in her early 70&#x27;s, and I am almost 44.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and feels so soft...</li>
            <li> Is great for nighttime moisturizing .i use SUV 15 oil of Olay for daytime with same results.these have always been great products</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Smooth my face with this velvety moisturizing cream every night; can&#x27;t go without it. Price is right.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when they changed the formula but I have to admit I think it does an even better job and smoothing out wrinkles.  I wake up every morning with noticeable softness and hydration to my face.</li>
            <li> Great product and I like the smell.  When you wake in the morning you can see the difference in your skin.  I am excited by the long-term prospects.</li>
            <li> so far so good it seems to leave my face very soft</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used. Goes on smooth and makes your face feel moist and firm. Not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have used it for several years and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer but nothing special.  Have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and although when younger had slightly oily skin as I have aged need extra moisturizer.  This is my favorite facial moisturizer it is easily absorbed into skin without clogging pores and prefer it to more expensive products that are often too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> good stuff at a great price and i&#x27;ve used this product for years.  You&#x27;ll need scissors to get through all that packaging!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that the manufacturer reformulated this product. I had been using the light lavender colored formula for years and had many complements on my skin. The new product is sticky and dry rather than silky and moist. I broke out in a terrible rash. My friend had the same experience. We are busy trying to buy as many of the original formulas as we can find. I don&#x27;t know why they just can&#x27;t leave a great product as is, it must be for some financial benefit to them. We will definitely be checking other brands to replace this one. Sorry Olay this is a dud...</li>
            <li> Their moisturizer is superior, and so is this night cream.  It is well worth the difference in price compared to other&lt;br /&gt;Olay night creams.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the nite cream. Not oily. Keeps my skin rehydrated and smooth</li>
            <li> It was nice to get a pack of 2 for less than the price of one in the store.</li>
            <li> This does not appear to be the same cream I buy in local stores with identical label. It is a different color and is packaged in Thailand, not Ohio! Very disappointed in this order but not in the cream that looks the same and is from local drugstores. I don&#x27;t know how to avoid this; have I bought a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Great price! It is the same Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream sold at Costco and other beauty stores but at a much lower price. I have used this cream for over 5 years and don&#x27;t see myself changing my night cream any time soon.</li>
            <li> Love the night recovery cream. Can see a difference for the good in my complexion. Highly recommend any of the Olay poducts against the expensive store products!!!</li>
