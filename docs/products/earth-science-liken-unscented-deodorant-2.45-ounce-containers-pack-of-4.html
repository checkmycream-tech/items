    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Unscented Earth Science Liken is the best underarm deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The best part?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t take the perfume scents so this is perfect</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t win them all, I guess.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work great.</li>
            <li>Nice to know there is an alternative!  </li>
            <li>&quot; the product works remarkably well.</li>
            <li>Also, the deodorant is really good.</li>
            <li>and the fact it it available as a 4 pack from Amazon is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Works sufficiently for me and it doesn&#x27;t stain my nice shirts.  </li>
            <li>no aluminum derivatives and the product works very well, and for me the no scent is the best scent of all</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the performance of this natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>And being a guy, in the summer, constantly on a bicycle but also sitting in an air conditioned office, i don&#x27;t always have the best situation for being \\&quot;nice smelling.\\</li>
            <li>- then get some more.  </li>
            <li>One container has lasted me more than a year</li>
            <li>In short, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately most deodorants don&#x27;t work on me and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I wasn&#x27;t able to use the it more than a week or two.</li>
            <li>Finally, we found this product and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I think this is great stuff considering it is all natural and have been using it for a couple years now.  </li>
            <li>It is not an anti perspirant, however, which I am fine with, but some people like that coverage as well.</li>
            <li>However, customer service was fantastic and the situation was rectified.  </li>
            <li>Always keeps me stink free.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours if you are a chronic sweating kind of person like me.</li>
            <li>This stuff, however, after a full day of commuting, sitting in an office,</li>
            <li>When I purchased this, it seemed like it would be a good alternative to traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li>and no bad stuff like aluminum etc</li>
            <li>Impressed because with a ridiculous name like</li>
            <li>So i normally used something like A&amp;H unscented deodorant, and it mostly worked</li>
            <li>1 order, no driving, and importantly no conflict with cologne, very pleased :-)</li>
            <li>Also, I have the peace of mind that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my underarms to be absorbed by my body.  </li>
            <li>Ok, to be fair, after the ride i wasn&#x27;t unoffending (bicycle polyester has a way of amplifying offending scents), but I was a lot less smelly than I normally used to be.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here (all positive), and seeing the nice low Amazon reseller price, i thought \\&quot;I ought to give it a try.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t order it in the height of the summer when it is really hot</li>
            <li>First, i sweat.</li>
            <li>If you really need something strong it might not be enough, but for 95% of the population, I think it would work</li>
            <li>I compared the products carefully, and the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; stuff worked better (for me) than Earth Science Liken deodorant or Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li>The unscented aspect really is unscented</li>
            <li>Which is to say, I smell like a mixture of light cologne and my corporate HVAC.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t give a very thorough review beyond the reaction my body against it but be warned.</li>
            <li>On days where I don&#x27;t go on bicycle rides, I&#x27;m almost as fresh as when I first left home in the morning.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold up to a long walk on a hot day, but it&#x27;s good enough for most of the time, without the alcohol and aluminum in more efficient deodorants that my skin reacts badly to.</li>
            <li>We tried a dozen or more brands off the shelf from various local stores.</li>
            <li>way better than the other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>so this was something new.</li>
            <li>Nor do i reek of my old man&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I have been using this natural deoderant for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin before</li>
            <li>Needless to say, that wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>This is my new standard.</li>
            <li>This is not due to any odor-performance issues, but because the deodorant itself always breaks off</li>
            <li>I have a very hard time finding unscented deodorant except via a special trip to the health food store, really like this brand</li>
            <li>So how is it possible that this stuff is natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the only one that works at all.</li>
            <li>I just smell like a normal 21st century urban person.</li>
            <li>- they tend to melt a little when it&#x27;s that hot.</li>
            <li>The A&amp;H stuff I used only barely worked.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I perspire a lot and Earth Science Liken does not allow any odor to develop for at least the first 10 hours of my day.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an unscented deodorant, consider the \\&quot;Crystal Body Deodorant\\&quot; product that comes as a dry solid.  </li>
            <li> I still sweat, but the product hasn&#x27;t left any stains on my shirts, and i can go all day on a single morning application.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a t.v. cameraman and I&#x27;ve been around a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband recently developed an allergic reaction to the deodorant he had used for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Indeed it didn´t sprout any allergy as opposed to the other deodorants, however half day later I was smelling...</li>
            <li> This means that for the last few weeks (at least), the deodorant itself is want to fall out of the container, especially when removing the lid.  </li>
            <li> Once you try it, you&#x27;ll never need any other.</li>
            <li> No sticky residue, no powerful scent, no allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liken unscented proved to be life (nose) saver for us.</li>
            <li> I could just toss it at this point, but I can get upwards of a month more use out of it, so I hate to be so wasteful.</li>
            <li> If I go without deodorant, then things get ugly quickly.</li>
            <li> This crap is in everything that i normally steer clear from.</li>
            <li> I always want something natural because if I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll leave weird stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> After buying this upon a recommendation from a friend i decided to look at the ingredients after using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (The only thing close is Lavilin, an Israeli deodorant that&#x27;s expensive but that seems to lose its effectiveness over time.)</li>
            <li> It blocks, in my vague unscientific estimation, about &gt;95% of my daily \\&quot;scent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I had the very unpleasant surprise that they put a annoying sticker with their name on it on all of the sticks right over the relatively pretty \\&quot;liken plant\\&quot; sticker.</li>
            <li> This review initially reflected a bad buying experience.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell like a crazy hippy who wipes crystals under his arms and hides their failure with patchouli.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s base</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now, and it works really well.  If you really need something strong it might not be enough, but for 95% of the population, I think it would work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am reducing my initial 5-Star rating by 1 point.  This is not due to any odor-performance issues, but because the deodorant itself always breaks off it&#x27;s base well before it is done.  This means that for the last few weeks (at least), the deodorant itself is want to fall out of the container, especially when removing the lid.  I could just toss it at this point, but I can get upwards of a month more use out of it, so I hate to be so wasteful.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an unscented deodorant, consider the \\&quot;Crystal Body Deodorant\\&quot; product that comes as a dry solid.  It is a salt that you apply after moistening it with water.  I compared the products carefully, and the \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; stuff worked better (for me) than Earth Science Liken deodorant or Tom&#x27;s of Maine unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li> This review initially reflected a bad buying experience.  However, customer service was fantastic and the situation was rectified.  Also, the deodorant is really good.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a decade. Always keeps me stink free.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding unscented deodorant except via a special trip to the health food store, really like this brand and the fact it it available as a 4 pack from Amazon is a great idea.  1 order, no driving, and importantly no conflict with cologne, very pleased :-)</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the performance of this natural deodorant.  It has been my first shift from the strange chemicals in \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorant, and I was afraid that it would not work, but it works as well or better than any other type I have ever used.  Nice to know there is an alternative!  This is my new standard.</li>
            <li> I think this is great stuff considering it is all natural and have been using it for a couple years now.  No scent.  Works sufficiently for me and it doesn&#x27;t stain my nice shirts.  Also, I have the peace of mind that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my underarms to be absorbed by my body.  Now, not everyone reacts the same to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients.  Order one and see how it goes - then get some more.  Just don&#x27;t order it in the height of the summer when it is really hot - they tend to melt a little when it&#x27;s that hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a t.v. cameraman and I&#x27;ve been around a long time. Unscented Earth Science Liken is the best underarm deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all. (The only thing close is Lavilin, an Israeli deodorant that&#x27;s expensive but that seems to lose its effectiveness over time.) I perspire a lot and Earth Science Liken does not allow any odor to develop for at least the first 10 hours of my day. One container has lasted me more than a year but I&#x27;m ordering a pack of 4 because I never want to be without this product. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll never need any other.</li>
            <li> So i normally used something like A&amp;H unscented deodorant, and it mostly worked Ok. Then, for whatever reason, i couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore. I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with Aluminum in it, or scent, and i also didn&#x27;t want to pay $5 for some Tom&#x27;s of Someplace underarm stick.    After reading the reviews here (all positive), and seeing the nice low Amazon reseller price, i thought \\&quot;I ought to give it a try.\\&quot;    First, i sweat. A. Lot. And being a guy, in the summer, constantly on a bicycle but also sitting in an air conditioned office, i don&#x27;t always have the best situation for being \\&quot;nice smelling.\\&quot; My wife lets me know when i get home. If I go without deodorant, then things get ugly quickly. The A&amp;H stuff I used only barely worked.    This stuff, however, after a full day of commuting, sitting in an office, *and then* going on a post-work 40-mile bike ride, still worked. Ok, to be fair, after the ride i wasn&#x27;t unoffending (bicycle polyester has a way of amplifying offending scents), but I was a lot less smelly than I normally used to be. On days where I don&#x27;t go on bicycle rides, I&#x27;m almost as fresh as when I first left home in the morning.    In short, I&#x27;m impressed. Impressed because with a ridiculous name like \\&quot;Lichen Plant,\\&quot; the product works remarkably well. It blocks, in my vague unscientific estimation, about &gt;95% of my daily \\&quot;scent.\\&quot; The unscented aspect really is unscented (I wear a men&#x27;s cologne and it never interferes). I still sweat, but the product hasn&#x27;t left any stains on my shirts, and i can go all day on a single morning application.    The best part? I don&#x27;t smell like a crazy hippy who wipes crystals under his arms and hides their failure with patchouli. Nor do i reek of my old man&#x27;s Old Spice. I just smell like a normal 21st century urban person. Which is to say, I smell like a mixture of light cologne and my corporate HVAC. You can&#x27;t win them all, I guess. But my wife thinks it&#x27;s a big improvement, and therefore, it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. Doesn&#x27;t smell great. Doesn&#x27;t work great. Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours if you are a chronic sweating kind of person like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this deodorant since quite a while and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I ordered a \\&quot;4-pack\\&quot; from \\&quot;all star health\\&quot; which arrived today and I had the very unpleasant surprise that they put a annoying sticker with their name on it on all of the sticks right over the relatively pretty \\&quot;liken plant\\&quot; sticker. Yes, I tried to remove the sticker but it&#x27;s one of them where you have to peel for hours... what a pain.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for five or six years... no aluminum derivatives and the product works very well, and for me the no scent is the best scent of all</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for 15-20 yrs.  works.  and no bad stuff like aluminum etc so no alzheimer&#x27;s disease for you!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It&#x27;s amazing. I sweat a lot, so I need a deodorant that&#x27;ll work as an antiperspirant. I always want something natural because if I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll leave weird stains on my shirts. THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T DO IT!! FINALLY!! AND IT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way better than the other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have been using this natural deoderant for years. I can&#x27;t take the perfume scents so this is perfect and I&#x27;ve had no issues with body odor while using it. It is not an anti perspirant, however, which I am fine with, but some people like that coverage as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant because it did not contain aluminum. Unfortunately most deodorants don&#x27;t work on me and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Indeed it didn´t sprout any allergy as opposed to the other deodorants, however half day later I was smelling...</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, it seemed like it would be a good alternative to traditional deodorant. However, after a couple uses, I began to develop a skin irritation and swelling of the lymph nodes. Needless to say, that wasn&#x27;t good. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin before so this was something new. Consequently, I wasn&#x27;t able to use the it more than a week or two. So I can&#x27;t give a very thorough review beyond the reaction my body against it but be warned.</li>
            <li> After buying this upon a recommendation from a friend i decided to look at the ingredients after using for a few weeks. i found propylene glycol. I was floored. isn&#x27;t this the same ingredient that people who buy this stuff stay away from? This crap is in everything that i normally steer clear from. Its a chemical found in antifreeze. So how is it possible that this stuff is natural. I can&#x27;t believe it. Although it does work for me i will no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> My partner loves this deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the only one that works at all. It doesn&#x27;t hold up to a long walk on a hot day, but it&#x27;s good enough for most of the time, without the alcohol and aluminum in more efficient deodorants that my skin reacts badly to.</li>
            <li> My husband recently developed an allergic reaction to the deodorant he had used for the past 30 years. We tried a dozen or more brands off the shelf from various local stores. Finally, we found this product and it works wonderfully. No sticky residue, no powerful scent, no allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liken unscented proved to be life (nose) saver for us.</li>
