            <li>Out of all the brands I like this one the best so far!</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s anti bacterial &amp; anti viral- features prominently in a lot of my mixes..</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed 2 day shipping for a lot of products I have to drive a distance for- specialty foods, books, etc..</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I got it for him.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a dropper lid also.</li>
            <li>I love that they included a glass eye dropper as it makes it easier to adjust the amount you need.</li>
            <li>Awesome product with many different uses!!</li>
            <li>and I was finally able to get some peace.</li>
            <li>I just made sure to use it at night</li>
            <li>I love the dropper, too.  </li>
            <li>I NEED MORE OF THIS AND THE PEPPERMINT OIL</li>
            <li>Easy to use with the built in dropper top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree oil does have a strong odor, but</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle its strong smell but it works wonders for any skin issue, I use it for acne and nail fungus.</li>
            <li>This is fine, except that I use tea-tree oil all the time...</li>
            <li>Has a fantastic strong aroma</li>
            <li>Jojoba is fine, but I like this oil even better mixed with some good avocado oil.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference in her skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look to save a dollar or 2 on a cheap Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>Great product and would definitely recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>I was given a free sample by Garden Escents to test.</li>
            <li>Easy with the special bottle top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is what I originally got the product for -</li>
            <li>Then I use it to clean my face before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>stuff is strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>Tee tree is much healthier and more affective than cortisone creams.</li>
            <li>How cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scalp feels fresh and clean, no itching, and the hair is shiny and rich.</li>
            <li>I appreciate getting follow up emails to make sure that I&#x27;m satisfied, and I like that the last one I got had some ideas about how to use the product that I hadn&#x27;t yet thought of...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been fun testing it out.</li>
            <li>I received this on time and it is a powerful substance.  </li>
            <li>Very pure product.</li>
            <li>At first glance the price might seem a little high, but it&#x27;s really a very good value when you consider the large 2 oz size bottle.</li>
            <li>I knew that it was the one product that I had to add to my traveling first aid</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>My first bottle leaked and company immediately sent another bottle.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy breathing it deeply to clear out my sinuses.</li>
            <li>Most of the tea tree oil I purchase is in the teeny tiny bottles at my neighborhood store.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the tip!</li>
            <li>I was unsure about this product at first</li>
            <li>it comes with many warnings but with the proper respect and use of the product it works well.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the smell was from riding in the delivery truck.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend actually likes the smell :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super busy and it&#x27;s nice to have the option of buying bigger sizes at decent prices and having it shipped to my door.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I can make my own cleaning supplies, add to shampoo, body scrub and a bunch of other things.</li>
            <li>The tee tree oil is of high quality and worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s  too strong to be used especially on scalp without diluting with some oil.</li>
            <li>Large amount of tea tree oil on skin can cause poisoning.  </li>
            <li>The product is 100% pure as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>really appreciate that it&#x27;s pure 100% tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>They should do very well.  </li>
            <li>Reading reviews can be very helpful sometimes.</li>
            <li>I also really like the inserted dropper and the 2oz size.</li>
            <li>Too much money for something that I have to work at to even dispense.  </li>
            <li>As a certified aromatherapist I am familiar with several brands of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>Garden Escents has a potent but pleasing aroma that compares well with other high quality tea tree oils.</li>
            <li>Certainly something worth considering, especially if you are a hiker.</li>
            <li>I bought this tea tree oil a couple of months ago and have been using it on tough mold in an old shower and it works great.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise there was a hand written note with the new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I like about this brand in particular is the quality customer service.</li>
            <li>And after reading the description and reviews for this product, I added some tea tree oil in my regular shampoo this morning, instead of washing my hair with the pharmaceutical shampoo with ketakozanol (anti-fungal), which I&#x27;ve used regularly a couple of times per month for many years now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on different kind of shampoos to find an alternative.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to use a high quality Tea Tree Oil as well as</li>
            <li>my expectations were not that high.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it every day for a few days and it got much better.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong odor but once mixed in the proper amounts with lotions shampoos etc.</li>
            <li>I live in Miami</li>
            <li>I had to return it, but the merchant is very professional and replaced the item promptly.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I will be trying the oil for getting rid of my husband&#x27;s little tag warts that annoy him on his arms, which many others have had success with.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve also used tea tree oil in the past for skin ailments, mixing my own cleaning solutions and especially for insect bites and cuts.</li>
            <li>Company send you emails a couple times, which I thought was cool, telling you other ways Tea Tree oil can be used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oil nightly on my dry but breakout prone skin, in combination with a facial cream, and I have already noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Recently ordered this and was surprised how fast it came...</li>
            <li>I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who told me she&#x27;d been using it to clear up her skin, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The eye dropper disintegrated, so when I went to use it, all the oil fell over me and nearly hit my toddler.  </li>
            <li>I suggested him to try some natural remedies before using over-the-counter creams.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this product on mosquito bites and my hair -</li>
            <li>I apply it directly onto my toenails without diluting or putting into a carrier oil, and it never irritates my nails or skin.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell if helps or not.</li>
            <li>Wish I still had the old style ceramic tub</li>
            <li>highly recommend Garden Escents and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought some normal shampoo from Walmart, mixed some oil in and used it twice a week.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but this one certainly receives my stamp of approval!</li>
            <li>bottle will last me a bit longer than the tiny ones I usually get, but this company has earned my repeat business :)</li>
            <li>Oil quickly degrades the rubber stopper and seal, rendering it useless as a cap or dropper; will quickly leak on bottle and label, and onto whatever it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this tea tree oil initially to take a natural approach to clearing up some acne spots.</li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;ve tried some with tee trea oil as well, but perhaps the amount of tee trea was too small, too diluted or not potent enough, because it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t discovered all of the different uses for Tea Tree oil yet but so far it goes above my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had trouble with my first delivery, as it spilled in the box.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil nightly on my dry but breakout prone skin, in combination with a facial cream, and I have already noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Recently ordered this and was surprised how fast it came...</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who told me she&#x27;d been using it to clear up her skin, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The eye dropper disintegrated, so when I went to use it, all the oil fell over me and nearly hit my toddler.  </li>
            <li> I suggested him to try some natural remedies before using over-the-counter creams.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product on mosquito bites and my hair -</li>
            <li> I apply it directly onto my toenails without diluting or putting into a carrier oil, and it never irritates my nails or skin.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell if helps or not.</li>
            <li> Wish I still had the old style ceramic tub</li>
            <li> highly recommend Garden Escents and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought some normal shampoo from Walmart, mixed some oil in and used it twice a week.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but this one certainly receives my stamp of approval!</li>
            <li> bottle will last me a bit longer than the tiny ones I usually get, but this company has earned my repeat business :)</li>
            <li> Oil quickly degrades the rubber stopper and seal, rendering it useless as a cap or dropper; will quickly leak on bottle and label, and onto whatever it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this tea tree oil initially to take a natural approach to clearing up some acne spots.</li>
            <li> I am sure I&#x27;ve tried some with tee trea oil as well, but perhaps the amount of tee trea was too small, too diluted or not potent enough, because it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t discovered all of the different uses for Tea Tree oil yet but so far it goes above my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my first delivery, as it spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> My wife used it to clean up a tough mold spot in our shower, an idea I got from the follow up emails the seller sent me.</li>
            <li> after trying this in a diffuser for the past few days, it&#x27;s significantly improved my condition by purifying the air and relieving me of my congestion.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is mix up a few drops of this miracle oil, with some health food store natural and unscented shampoo.</li>
            <li> I start my day by adding a few drops to my brush to make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Has helped with some minor skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> She applied it directly on the cyst for a week and it popped, dried up and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hiking is a passion with me, and at the end of a long hike the feet need all the help that they can get!  </li>
            <li> Wonder if it&#x27;s due to the dropper lid not sealing properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using the Tea Tree oil in my hair to help with my dry scalp and dandruff and it has drastically helped for that as well.  </li>
            <li> little bit also goes a long way, so I feel like it will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We saw improvement applying it every night for less than a week and will continue to use it for any future flare-ups.</li>
            <li> and if I bleach the tub everyday and use the oil on my feet in a foot bath once a week I can stay relatively fungus-free!  </li>

            <li> Hiking is a passion with me, and at the end of a long hike the feet need all the help that they can get!  So, I soak them, massage them, and nurse those nasty blisters that occasionally blow up on me! When I read in the product description that it was good for hiking, I decided to dig deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold! Because tea tree essential oils acts as an anti-fungal agent (help with Athlete&#x27;s Foot) and acts as an antiseptic (for insect bites) I knew that it was the one product that I had to add to my traveling first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By putting a drop or two of diluted tea tree oil on my toes, I no longer have to worry about what&#x27;s happening under all those layers of wool socks and gortex boots while I am hiking those miles! Plus, when my feet get soaked because of the wet grasses, mud and slushy trails, I know that my feet are not giving a home to those unwanted nasties! Certainly something worth considering, especially if you are a hiker.</li>
            <li> I find tea tree oil to be a lifesaver for dermatitis and dandruff. We tried all of the other \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders, and Selsun along with some expensive Doctors prescriptions. Not one of them worked. Luckily, a good friend recommended Tea Tree Oil to battle this condition. Never heard of it before that. All you have to do is mix up a few drops of this miracle oil, with some health food store natural and unscented shampoo. A couple of drops per ounce and you&#x27;ll have the best shampoo hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use a high quality Tea Tree Oil as well as that can make all the difference in the world. Don&#x27;t look to save a dollar or 2 on a cheap Tea Tree Oil. I&#x27;ve used this brand and I recommend it as it has worked well for my family.</li>
            <li> Recently ordered this and was surprised how fast it came... literally the next day with my prime account. Tea Tree Oil, in my opinion, is a must for every medicine cabinet. I used this oil on a pretty bad kitchen knife cut and see it has already healed nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is also great for things like toe fungus. We&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my mother&#x27;s feet.  We put a few drops on a cotton stick and applied it every night to the infected areas. You can also add a few drops to moisture creams too. That&#x27;s what companies like Melaleuca do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> As a certified aromatherapist I am familiar with several brands of tea tree oil.  Garden Escents has a potent but pleasing aroma that compares well with other high quality tea tree oils. At first glance the price might seem a little high, but it&#x27;s really a very good value when you consider the large 2 oz size bottle. I like this tea tree oil for any kind of fungal infection, I just add a few drops to a carrier oil. Jojoba is fine, but I like this oil even better mixed with some good avocado oil. I also like it for skin infections. Works really well!</li>
            <li> Garden Escents is a wonderful company, I would recommend them to everyone!  My first bottle leaked and company immediately sent another bottle.  Much to my surprise there was a hand written note with the new bottle.  This company has got it all together when it comes to serving the customer.  They should do very well.  If I could I would give them 6 stars!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who told me she&#x27;d been using it to clear up her skin, so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using the oil nightly on my dry but breakout prone skin, in combination with a facial cream, and I have already noticed a huge difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve also been using the Tea Tree oil in my hair to help with my dry scalp and dandruff and it has drastically helped for that as well.  After reading the other reviews, I will be trying the oil for getting rid of my husband&#x27;s little tag warts that annoy him on his arms, which many others have had success with.  Great product and would definitely recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I think I have a defective bottle.  I can&#x27;t return it either.  The eye dropper disintegrated, so when I went to use it, all the oil fell over me and nearly hit my toddler.  Large amount of tea tree oil on skin can cause poisoning.  I&#x27;m not very happy with this.</li>
            <li> When I decided to start using tea tree oil my expectations were not that high. Now I know I will use it forever! I start my day by adding a few drops to my brush to make my hair soft and shiny. Then I use it to clean my face before putting on makeup. I also enjoy breathing it deeply to clear out my sinuses. I&#x27;ve just started using it to create my own body scrub and that may be the best of all.</li>
            <li> Most of the tea tree oil I purchase is in the teeny tiny bottles at my neighborhood store. This is fine, except that I use tea-tree oil all the time...I make a lot of homemade bath and cleaning products- and tea-tree- because it&#x27;s anti bacterial &amp; anti viral- features prominently in a lot of my mixes..&lt;br /&gt;As a recent convert to Amazon Prime, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed 2 day shipping for a lot of products I have to drive a distance for- specialty foods, books, etc.. I&#x27;m super busy and it&#x27;s nice to have the option of buying bigger sizes at decent prices and having it shipped to my door.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this brand in particular is the quality customer service. I appreciate getting follow up emails to make sure that I&#x27;m satisfied, and I like that the last one I got had some ideas about how to use the product that I hadn&#x27;t yet thought of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last me a bit longer than the tiny ones I usually get, but this company has earned my repeat business :)</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my first delivery, as it spilled in the box. I had to return it, but the merchant is very professional and replaced the item promptly. The Garden Escents Team knows how to take care of customers. The tee tree oil is of high quality and worth the additional cost. I use it for breakouts and itchy skin. Tee tree is much healthier and more affective than cortisone creams.</li>
            <li> So good for so many things. Easy to use with the built in dropper top.&lt;br /&gt;We really appreciate that it&#x27;s pure 100% tea tree oil. Has helped with some minor skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it with shampoo or body scrub yet, but probably will.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample by Garden Escents to test. And after reading the description and reviews for this product, I added some tea tree oil in my regular shampoo this morning, instead of washing my hair with the pharmaceutical shampoo with ketakozanol (anti-fungal), which I&#x27;ve used regularly a couple of times per month for many years now. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on different kind of shampoos to find an alternative. I am sure I&#x27;ve tried some with tee trea oil as well, but perhaps the amount of tee trea was too small, too diluted or not potent enough, because it didn&#x27;t do much. I even tried laser treatment years ago. But unfortunately nothing else has helped, which has been a dilemma since the ketakozanol dries out the hair. So I am really happy to find out that this wonderful natural remedy seems to be a great solution to my dilemma. The scalp feels fresh and clean, no itching, and the hair is shiny and rich. Hopefully there will be a lot fewer bad hair days in the future. Reading reviews can be very helpful sometimes. Thanks for the tip!</li>
            <li> I have bought other brands of tea tree oil before and some of them have been poor quality and watery. Since I wanted to try something different I bought this brand, based on the product description and reviews, to treat a skin boil I had and it worked great. The boil cleared up in a matter of days. The product is 100% pure as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is strong and powerful. I also really like the inserted dropper and the 2oz size. Gives me plenty to work with. My wife used it to clean up a tough mold spot in our shower, an idea I got from the follow up emails the seller sent me. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Garden Escents and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My sister has really bad acne, and my parents are tired of buying expensive creams to help her. So I bought this tea tree oil initially to take a natural approach to clearing up some acne spots. We saw improvement applying it every night for less than a week and will continue to use it for any future flare-ups. Other products and remedies we have tried didn&#x27;t work as well and had chemicals that would cause serious reactions on my sister&#x27;s skin. We just applied the tea tree oil with a q-tip. Easy with the special bottle top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself I used a little of this product in my shampoo to help with my dandruff, which had gotten worst and it seemed immune to my old Head and Shoulder&#x27;s and Selsun Blue. I bought some normal shampoo from Walmart, mixed some oil in and used it twice a week. It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s snowing on my shoulders anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprise came when Garden Escents sent me email tips and recipes on other ways to use it. What a great purchase! I don&#x27;t need to buy multiple products. I can make my own cleaning supplies, add to shampoo, body scrub and a bunch of other things.How cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been fun testing it out. Love it and will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil for my brother who has been suffering from athletes foot. I suggested him to try some natural remedies before using over-the-counter creams. He&#x27;s been using it every day for a few days and it got much better.  He didn&#x27;t like the smell in the beginning but he&#x27;s totally used to it now.  He also applied it on the pimple on his chest and it was almost gone in 3 days.  I am really glad I got it for him.</li>
            <li> I love Garden Escents Tea Tree oil!  Has a fantastic strong aroma so you know it is the GOOD stuff!  I have been applying to a skin tag and am anxiously awaiting the results!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil a couple of months ago and have been using it on tough mold in an old shower and it works great. After reading the follow up emails Garden Escents sent me with ideas on other uses I gave it to my daughter to use on a painful cyst she had on her backside. She applied it directly on the cyst for a week and it popped, dried up and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff. My family is sold on this brand and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Out of all the brands I like this one the best so far! I love that it has a dropper lid also. Company send you emails a couple times, which I thought was cool, telling you other ways Tea Tree oil can be used. That was a bonus! Very pure product. I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. However, it&#x27;s  too strong to be used especially on scalp without diluting with some oil.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell something you have to get used to.</li>
            <li> Excellent product it works wonders on the skin and it helped with my parents toe fungus, I will be purchasing again when it is back in stock. A little application goes a long way. I love that they included a glass eye dropper as it makes it easier to adjust the amount you need. Can&#x27;t wait until it is back in stock again!! Awesome product with many different uses!!</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from acne so I had her use this tea tree oil on her spots. I saw a huge difference in her skin. it cleared her acne and reduced the redness.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this product at first it comes with many warnings but with the proper respect and use of the product it works well. It has a strong odor but once mixed in the proper amounts with lotions shampoos etc. you will hardly smell it at all.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT LOVE THE ITEM</li>
            <li> I received his item on time, however, the dropper does not work properly....it has leaked repeatedly, and is hard to get back together. Too much money for something that I have to work at to even dispense.  Would never, ever, order again.</li>
            <li> Oil quickly degrades the rubber stopper and seal, rendering it useless as a cap or dropper; will quickly leak on bottle and label, and onto whatever it&#x27;s on.  Overpriced for the quantity - over $17/oz, compared to $5/oz elsewhere on Amazon.  Buy a replaceable dropper bottle, a cheaper product, and pass this up.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been suffering from a bad sinus problem recently and was tired of taking antibiotics so i ordered this tea tree oil to relieve my symptoms. after trying this in a diffuser for the past few days, it&#x27;s significantly improved my condition by purifying the air and relieving me of my congestion. i&#x27;ve also used tea tree oil in the past for skin ailments, mixing my own cleaning solutions and especially for insect bites and cuts. be sure to order real authentic 100% tea tree oil like this one to get the most benefits out of it.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product on mosquito bites and my hair - and I absolutely love it! I live in Miami and it&#x27;s summer so I was mortified when I kid you not I had over 50 bug bites all over my body after spending the evening at a poolside bar on South Beach. I hadn&#x27;t planned on using the Tea Tree Oil for bites, but it just happened to occur 2 days before I received the oil. Oh my gosh am I so happy that fate was in my favor! The bug bites immediately stopped itching and I was finally able to get some peace. The Tea Tree oil does have a strong odor, but I kinda like it so it didn&#x27;t bother me. I just made sure to use it at night so I wouldn&#x27;t bother others around me during the day if they didn&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my hair - which is what I originally got the product for - it also works wonders. I haven&#x27;t discovered all of the different uses for Tea Tree oil yet but so far it goes above my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit also goes a long way, so I feel like it will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried other Tea Tree oils so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but this one certainly receives my stamp of approval!</li>
            <li> Pure tea tree oil.  I apply it directly onto my toenails without diluting or putting into a carrier oil, and it never irritates my nails or skin.  I love the dropper, too.  This way it doesn&#x27;t get messy or leaky when handling the bottle.  I will repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and it is a powerful substance.  I like the bigger bottle too.  I use tea tree oil for my toenail fungus and it keeps it in check.</li>
            <li> I NEED MORE OF THIS AND THE PEPPERMINT OIL I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!EXCELLENT FOR YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle its strong smell but it works wonders for any skin issue, I use it for acne and nail fungus. It works!</li>
            <li> First time purchasing Tea Tree oil and not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like this or not.  Very strong smell that I don&#x27;t care for.  When it arrived the box it arrived in smelled of it.  At first I thought the smell was from riding in the delivery truck.  Now everything in the cabinet where I have it stored smells of it.  Wonder if it&#x27;s due to the dropper lid not sealing properly.  Purchased it to add to my shampoo for scalp issues.  Added some Lemon oil as well in order to combat the smell in my shampoo.  Too early to tell if helps or not.</li>
            <li> I was struggling to find something for my skin tag issues for some time.&lt;br /&gt;I even decided to use a variety of Compound W products. Of course none of these worked and were extremely painful.&lt;br /&gt;This product however is amazing! The odor isn&#x27;t so bad either. My girlfriend actually likes the smell :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
            <li> Excellent product, high quality glass bottle and glass dropper.  Only issue for me is the expense.  I will buy another without the dropper and refill this bottle.  I use for stubborn athlete&#x27;s foot fungus.  My acrylic tub has an all over non-stick surface that breeds the fungus and if I bleach the tub everyday and use the oil on my feet in a foot bath once a week I can stay relatively fungus-free!  Wish I still had the old style ceramic tub --no fungus there! LOL!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil product is great and very potent. Great product!</li>
