            <li>They reported amazing results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived in a promptly manner and they can fit in your purse if you want to carry it around.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product.</li>
            <li>but it also does make for a nice skin, as the trade name says.</li>
            <li>Nice on skin</li>
            <li>Not sticky and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>that Skin-So-Soft is a very effective deterrent for mosquitoes, fire ants, chiggers, etc., while it does a darn good job as a reasonably long-lasting sunscreen for the kiddoes.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Skin-so-soft&amp;#34; is an amazing and environmentally acceptable product with multi-benefits: not only does it an excellent job to keep biting pests away</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best product out on today&#x27;s market, with a pleasant smell, that really does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I go to the Caribbean every year, and after dusk it is just an all-you-can-eat buffet for the mosquitoes -- and they LOVE me.</li>
            <li>and I never burn and it seems to keep most bugs away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredients may be better for skin, (DEET-Free, PABA-Free, Hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic,</li>
            <li>(may be we have to apply more often, like every hour?)</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for the bug guard - for knats.  </li>
            <li>We have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I use to use it when I lived in Georgia, the home of some of the most viscous Mosquitos I&#x27;ve ever seen,</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident that this will keep the bugs off.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and daughter love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care it beats carrying around bottles of Benadryl :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even put more on after 80 minutes, I can go a couple of hours without putting more on and I am fairly light complected.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and it keeps them burn and bug free.</li>
            <li>Then I was able to enjoy the sun, surf, and beach.</li>
            <li>smells good doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily and it really works for the protections from the sun and the bugs.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan of the smell - too strong.</li>
            <li>Its is the best stuff I ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a fine product, but I haven&#x27;t tried it through a mosquito season yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and light</li>
            <li>This stuff works extremely well and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>light, creamy does NOT smell like bug spray or lotion.</li>
            <li>It was great to come to amazon and get the same price and quality</li>
            <li>Okay, so I read scores of reviews on a dozen similar products, and Avon&#x27;s Skin-So-Soft handily took the lead for effectiveness amongst the reviewers.  </li>
            <li>and it smells pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>works specially to keep mosquitoes away.</li>
            <li>I kept one bottle of Skin So Soft for my own use</li>
            <li>We had so many gnats and mosquitos living by the water,has really come in handy,seemed to keep them away,will keep using.recemmendThanks</li>
            <li>Lucky me, Mosquitos don&#x27;t like me at all</li>
            <li>They got the package to me quickly and padded it well.</li>
            <li>Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I live where mosquito&#x27;s, noseem&#x27;s, and chiggers love me.</li>
            <li>The scent can be a bit too strong if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>useful purposes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is a lotion, which is kind of labor intensive to apply for bug stuff.</li>
            <li>but all of the skin care products are very gentle on his skin.</li>
            <li>I feel better about using this product than those that have DEET in them, but it&#x27;s not as effective, however we&#x27;ve had an especially wet spring and early summer</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Really does keep the bugs from biting!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Never got bit when I used it, and the sun screen protected my skin from the hot Georgia sun.  </li>
            <li>i certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The spray is good for trying to get hard to reach places, but it will make ur hair greasy if you spray your shoulders.  </li>
            <li>but it takes so much timed</li>
            <li>gentle breeze</li>
            <li>--- that doesn&#x27;t get to be too much as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had had it at the very beginning of bug season.</li>
            <li>It works really well against mosquitoes.  </li>
            <li>She is very allergic to the bites</li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>This product really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the scent too.</li>
            <li>They stated that it really worked and their coworkers kept trying to borrow it.</li>
            <li>I really like the combination of the sunblock and bug repellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but it was very watery.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida an am very allergic to no see ums and fleas !</li>
            <li>Hope they like it better than other stuff.</li>
            <li>Most important of all, Skin-So-Soft, unlike so many other such products, does NOT BURN EYES whenever pool water or sweat drips down.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>My adult son is a mosquito attractant!!  </li>

            <li>I live in &amp;#34;No SeeUms&amp;#34; country.</li>
            <li>I love this bug repellent, smells fine and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>So Soft Bug Guard</li>
            <li>Thought this would work for my 3 year old granddaughter but after using for a week she was again covered in mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on how young I look, no one can ever guess my age.</li>
            <li>So Soft is known for that.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s only a portion of the reasons for buying this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I am super allergic to mosquito bights and I wear it everyday before leaving the house</li>
            <li>Avon should know that all sunscreen should be broad spectrum these days.</li>
            <li>great insect protection without the bad smell.  </li>
            <li>Been using Avon Skin so Soft Bug Guard for the last 16 years.</li>
            <li>finally decided that I would go on Amazon and just order the my favorite stuff and stop wasting my money and save my poor feet and ankles which are covered in bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s only a portion of the reasons for buying this particular product.  </li>
            <li> I am super allergic to mosquito bights and I wear it everyday before leaving the house</li>
            <li> Avon should know that all sunscreen should be broad spectrum these days.</li>
            <li> great insect protection without the bad smell.  </li>
            <li> Been using Avon Skin so Soft Bug Guard for the last 16 years.</li>
            <li> finally decided that I would go on Amazon and just order the my favorite stuff and stop wasting my money and save my poor feet and ankles which are covered in bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AVON Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard Plus IR3535 SPF 30 Insect Repellent is great.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the spray, however, and this order seemed to take a long time from the time I ordered it to the time I received it.</li>
            <li> My only regret, and it is a big one that will probably make me not buy it again, is that the sunscreen does not appear to be broad spectrum (at least it doesn&#x27;t say so).  </li>
            <li> Free\\&quot; claim you can use them and feel like your not putting chemicals on your clothes and body; well I bought 3 different brands of those extremely over-priced, all-natural, Eco-friendly products and NONE of them</li>
            <li> Only drawback...very little in bottles.</li>
            <li> be careful with the eyes</li>
            <li> This product works as expected and keeps the bug away.</li>
            <li> Delivery was as expected.</li>
            <li> This product works well on me to keep insects and other pest from biting.</li>
            <li> 4 oz bottle seems small, but it is lasting quite well.</li>

            <li> Does help keep horse flies away.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I go to the Caribbean every year, and after dusk it is just an all-you-can-eat buffet for the mosquitoes -- and they LOVE me. Nothing else has worked. I usually end up with about 100 bites on my by the end of my trip, and that has happened even after using bug-deterring soap, spray/cream, AND citronella bracelet and anklet! With Skin-So-Soft I might get a total of five or ten bites in two weeks.</li>
            <li> Escellent product &amp; service!</li>
            <li> Works on the no-see-ums</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son breaks out in terrible pink welts with every other sunblock we have tried. This stuff is amazing, I don&#x27;t know what it is about Avon but all of the skin care products are very gentle on his skin. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> We used this product while traveling the Inca trail and Amazon jungle in Peru as well as in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador. It performed very well as both sunscreen and bug repellent. Also, did not feel greasy or heavy. I&#x27;d use it again!</li>
            <li> works specially to keep mosquitoes away. Good product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a fine product, but I haven&#x27;t tried it through a mosquito season yet. It was a great bargain and I&#x27;m glad to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Not the product but the fact that all they sent was 1 tube when I should have gotten 3.  Trying to get this rectified but it takes so much timed</li>
            <li> be careful with the eyes</li>
            <li> I have used Skin So Soft Bug Guard gentle breeze SPF 30 product for years and I never burn and it seems to keep most bugs away.  I don&#x27;t even put more on after 80 minutes, I can go a couple of hours without putting more on and I am fairly light complected.</li>
            <li> My adult son is a mosquito attractant!!  I had hoped this would be a winner!!  My husband likes it; son complains of its smell!  Sigh!!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t please everyone!!  Lucky me, Mosquitos don&#x27;t like me at all, so I never touch the stuff!!  LOL</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Skin-so-soft&amp;#34; is an amazing and environmentally acceptable product with multi-benefits: not only does it an excellent job to keep biting pests away but it also does make for a nice skin, as the trade name says.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected and keeps the bug away.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I read scores of reviews on a dozen similar products, and Avon&#x27;s Skin-So-Soft handily took the lead for effectiveness amongst the reviewers.  Now that we ourselves are using it, I can only concur and likewise agree that despite the price, it is well worth its cost.  No question but that Skin-So-Soft is a very effective deterrent for mosquitoes, fire ants, chiggers, etc., while it does a darn good job as a reasonably long-lasting sunscreen for the kiddoes.  One application, two useful purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s only a portion of the reasons for buying this particular product.  What makes it really different is that it is a lotion which doesn&#x27;t make skin look nor feel greasy.  It also has a pleasant, light scent --- it&#x27;s Avon! --- that doesn&#x27;t get to be too much as the day goes on.  Most important of all, Skin-So-Soft, unlike so many other such products, does NOT BURN EYES whenever pool water or sweat drips down.  Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li> light, creamy does NOT smell like bug spray or lotion. Really does keep the bugs from biting!  Wish I had had it at the very beginning of bug season.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to this being used this summer--gift for 3rd party as not yet given.  Hope they like it better than other stuff.</li>
            <li> In Louisiana this is a MUST have.  It works really well against mosquitoes.  We wear it all the time when we are outside.</li>
            <li> This product works well on me to keep insects and other pest from biting.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Kept me and all 5 of my children free from mosquito bites all day and we played at the water park, great product</li>
            <li> Great for repelling mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients may be better for skin, (DEET-Free, PABA-Free, Hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic, non-acnegenic)&lt;br /&gt;SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Still got a few mosquito bites. (may be we have to apply more often, like every hour?)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this for a while both as sunscreen and as bug repellent.  It works excellent as both.  We just visited the beach, and the only area that got burned was the small spot not covered by this stuff!  It made me a believer in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this bug repellent, smells fine and goes on easily.  It is a little greasy but it lasts.  My only regret, and it is a big one that will probably make me not buy it again, is that the sunscreen does not appear to be broad spectrum (at least it doesn&#x27;t say so).  Avon should know that all sunscreen should be broad spectrum these days.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter for her small children. She found that a similar product that was a spray was easier to apply. I kept one bottle of Skin So Soft for my own use but I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> It works great. I bought it mostly for the bug guard - for knats.  I used it years ago for the same reason and it worked.  The only complaint I have is that I wish it was in a lotion form that was not so greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen for kids! The smell is lovely and it keeps them burn and bug free. The school had been putting on bug spray every day and the smell just made me nauseous. This stuff works extremely well and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> AVON Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard Plus IR3535 SPF 30 Insect Repellent is great.  two products in one.  smells good doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily and it really works for the protections from the sun and the bugs.  We have used this product for many years.  I have always purchased from an Avon rep.  It was great to come to amazon and get the same price and quality</li>
            <li> Took this stuff to Alaska and the bugs left me alone the entire time I was there. Its is the best stuff I ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> Thought this would work for my 3 year old granddaughter but after using for a week she was again covered in mosquito bites.  She is very allergic to the bites so I had to switch to a deet product.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs as an insect repellent.  It works amazingly well. No ticks, mosquitos or flies.  Also works on humans</li>
            <li> I love it!! It really works... I am super allergic to mosquito bights and I wear it everyday before leaving the house</li>
            <li> We had so many gnats and mosquitos living by the water,has really come in handy,seemed to keep them away,will keep using.recemmendThanks</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a bit greasy. The scent can be a bit too strong if you put too much on. My kids were not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent, product as described, delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Been using Avon Skin so Soft Bug Guard for the last 16 years.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, both for sun and bug protection.&lt;br /&gt;North Carolina&#x27;s mosquitoes will now have to find another flesh buffet.</li>
            <li> This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;It provides sunscreen and bug repellent all in one. I really like the scent too.</li>
            <li> Just finished my beach vacation and no bug bites!! Absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> insect repellent is so so and I din&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars!!! I Have 4 kids, 3 of whom worked in the corn fields this summer. We are talking monster mosquitoes. Regular OFF products were not working. I saw great reviews on this product, so I bought it and the kids tried it. They reported amazing results. They stated that it really worked and their coworkers kept trying to borrow it. As a plus, it also has a 35 spf sunscreen. The only drawback is that it is a lotion, which is kind of labor intensive to apply for bug stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> It works, but nothing works as well as DEET. I feel better about using this product than those that have DEET in them, but it&#x27;s not as effective, however we&#x27;ve had an especially wet spring and early summer so we&#x27;ve been inundated with mosquitos. I also like that it has sunscreen and it smells pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> Only Insect Repellent I will Use.  Smells great, works good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I use to use it when I lived in Georgia, the home of some of the most viscous Mosquitos I&#x27;ve ever seen, used it every day when I was either cutting grass or working on my lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never got bit when I used it, and the sun screen protected my skin from the hot Georgia sun.  I get compliments on how young I look, no one can ever guess my age.</li>
            <li> great insect protection without the bad smell.  Nice on skin</li>
            <li> I really like the combination of the sunblock and bug repellent.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. Sunblock works well, and as far as I can tell, the repellent is also effective.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz bottle seems small, but it is lasting quite well.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this keeps the mosquitos away, but is the least offensive of the repellents we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this before we went to Costa Rica&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I won&#x27;t buy anything else!&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; have any problems with any bugs and the smell is great!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen also in it works. My husband burns all the time because he.is very fair skin and he usually sweats off the other lotions . Not with this! He also has trouble with fragrant which burns his skin. NOT  a problem with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.we tested  the bug guard before we left. I put it all over me and my husband everywhere except his ankles. The bugs would start to land on me and then fly away.  They would only land on my husband ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always keeping this stocked up in my house. Hopefully this stays on the market!</li>
            <li> Husband loves it! Only drawback...very little in bottles.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell - too strong.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident that this will keep the bugs off. Skin So Soft is known for that. I wish I had bought the spray, however, and this order seemed to take a long time from the time I ordered it to the time I received it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a number of yrs.</li>
            <li> I have been using the SSS designated bug repellent for probably 5 years and it is the only thing that truly keeps the bugs away.  I used to purchase it in my local pharmacy b/c that was the only place I could find it and when they stopped carrying it I thought I would try some other products.&lt;br /&gt;1.) The other products smell terrible and are way too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;Deet Free\\&quot; claim you can use them and feel like your not putting chemicals on your clothes and body; well I bought 3 different brands of those extremely over-priced, all-natural, Eco-friendly products and NONE of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided that I would go on Amazon and just order the my favorite stuff and stop wasting my money and save my poor feet and ankles which are covered in bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both the spray in the green bottle and the lotion.  I chose to order the lotion this time b/c I can choose exactly where I want to put the repellent without getting it on my clothes (b/c it is slightly greasy.)  The spray is good for trying to get hard to reach places, but it will make ur hair greasy if you spray your shoulders.  The lotion will not get in you hair if you put it on your shoulders.</li>
            <li> great product, slowest shipping EVER.</li>
            <li> I live in &amp;#34;No SeeUms&amp;#34; country. We get about six weeks of them centered around June and I do not leave the house to work on my property without applying Skin-So-Soft. This product does the trick!!!</li>
            <li> Great product , I recommend to anyone and I will buy again...</li>
            <li> Have to have this product on hand always!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I love it. Not sticky and smells really nice. None of the bugs even think of landing on me.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Sadly didn&#x27;t protect me from China mosquitoes. Seemed to work for others. My blood makeup could be to blame though. I also avoided bananas.</li>
            <li> I can only speak for my family, but this bug guard works every time for us.  We swear by it to our friends.  We start putting it on a day before we leave on trips to insect prevalent places and don&#x27;t stop until we leave.  I can absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells so good and does work!</li>
            <li> This product stopped the sand fleas at Florida beach in their tracks. Then I was able to enjoy the sun, surf, and beach.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I live where mosquito&#x27;s, noseem&#x27;s, and chiggers love me. It works and protects me. Buying a 3 pack was a good deal. They got the package to me quickly and padded it well. I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and smells good. Both my wife and daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Kept the bugs away but it was very watery.</li>
            <li> Used this for years. Works well.</li>
            <li> We both these for our Caribbean Cruise . . . no bites and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> Have used Avon Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard for years, good product.</li>
            <li> Great deal package! i certainly recommend it. They&#x27;re not only sunblock; they also truly block all the mosquitoes bites.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a promptly manner and they can fit in your purse if you want to carry it around.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product.</li>
            <li> We bought the SSS Bug Guard Plus SPF Spray for body protection and the lotion for the face, neck area. This is the absolute best product out on today&#x27;s market, with a pleasant smell, that really does what it advertises. We are outdoor people, in the Alabama heat in summer, with horses and dogs, and this is the only product that works to keep the bugs away from us. Will never settle for anything less again.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida an am very allergic to no see ums and fleas ! I would have to stay inside without SSS! Don&#x27;t buy anything but this if you want to keep the bugs away!!! It will also keep away people, cats, everything!!! It smells awful!!!! I don&#x27;t care it beats carrying around bottles of Benadryl :)</li>
            <li> This product met all my expectations. Delivery was as expected. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
