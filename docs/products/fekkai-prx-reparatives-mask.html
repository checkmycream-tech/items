            <li>I will say this product works great either way, but there was a noticeable difference when I stopped using Fekkai shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Fekkai fan for many years!  </li>

            <li>it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla smell and my hair looks so good after using it.</li>
            <li>mask makes my hair look and feel very silky, and it has the best fragrance of any hair product I can remember.</li>
            <li>then i put it on my hair and a warm towel over it like it says and waited to rinse.</li>
            <li>this  product conditions very well and smells AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless you like the smell of very, very strong musk.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>

            <li>it felt refreshed and very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too.</li>
            <li>After blowdrying and straightening, it looked better than ever.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>My hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d apply mostly to the lower parts of your hair.</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla scent but it ends up just smelling like argan oil once your hair dries.</li>
            <li>I just have to say I absolutely love, love, love what it has done for my hair.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s were most</li>

            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is easy to purchase online or at my local CVS and cost is very nice on the wallet!</li>
            <li>and this stuff keeps my hair healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>I have never had a conditioner leave my hair so soft and smelling so great.</li>
            <li>After drying my hair, I noticed that it looked more hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Remembering how much I liked this conditioner from years ago, I decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>In fact, i loved it so much i purchased the full size!  </li>
            <li>smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about product buildup, but this product definitely kept my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t go to the gym, I can easily get away with using this and not washing my hair again for three days, since it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>I also like that the scent was not too strong.</li>
            <li>After using it my curly hair was super shiny and my curls were light and bouncy!</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolute MAGIC!</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in LOVE with this product!  </li>
            <li>My fly aways are tamed and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>As soon as I rinsed this out of my hair, I could already tell a huge difference in how it felt.</li>
            <li>it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and I am glad I did</li>
            <li>Especially great to use during the harsh, winter months.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product smell great, but it leaves your hair shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I happened to get a free sample of this a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this mask from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li>it smells EXTREMELY strongly of cheap musk.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>i received a free sample of this from influenster in my vox box.</li>
            <li>that I wish it was available in a perfume.  </li>
            <li>masque smells amazing, works great in adding moisture, but also brought out the shine that my hair was missing before!  </li>
            <li>The original product strengthened my hair and gave it lustrous body.</li>
            <li>First off, it seems to do most of what it claims</li>
            <li>i have very fine straight hair that is oily</li>
            <li>Honestly, it made my hair feel so soft and bouncy!  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this product and from the first application I was hooked!</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, and has a soft touch.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the brief contact with my face didn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
            <li>(a rarity, I&#x27;ve found, in most cosmetic &amp; beauty product descriptions), a fact that I judge by the strictest of scientific scales: how much I want to run my fingers through my silky-soft hair after using it.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot; Was so excited to receive this in the mail .</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this from influenster to try for free and I absolutely fell in love from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>i love this product and highly recommend it-</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of PrX Reparatives Hair Mask from Influenster and instantly fell in love!  </li>
            <li>However, I have been combining this with a homemade hair mask of egg yolk, olive oil, and honey to stretch it further and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li>Great as a weekly conditioner and is helping so much in repairing my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy which translates into great moisture!</li>
            <li>Really repairs hair, leaving it smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many scents but had no problem with this one.</li>
            <li>I received this product from Influenster as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary.</li>
            <li>I received this product as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li>I received this mask plus the shampoo and conditioner complimentary from influenster for sample and review purposes.</li>
            <li>After just ONE use my hair was completely flyaway and frizz free!</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I would have to cut several inches off of my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for the complimentary product to try out in my voxbox!</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not the most economical solution for me, since I like to deep condition once a week.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried a complimentary sample of this product via influenster and have found my new favorite mask!  </li>
            <li>it is amazing leaves my hair soft and frizz free really treats the damage i have caused my hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Recommend doing a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; treatment once a week by wrapping up your hair in a hot towel and leaving the conditioner in for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After first use noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some residue left.</li>
            <li>Intense conditioning!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It left my hair looking, feeling, and smelling fantastic!</li>
            <li>I got nearly identical results with Redken All Soft Heavy Cream treatment, which to me smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I have some pretty stubborn hair (Indian origin).</li>
            <li>I like to let it sit for a good 30 min, with a hair cap on and a blow dryer for a few mins too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>It was easy to open in the shower.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product and continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li>I can actually get a comb through my long hair when it&#x27;s wet after using this beautiful product!  </li>
            <li>I used the product the last two days and stay tame and shiny and absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>my hair is smooth, soft and alive!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair (which is highlighted, fine texture) smooth and tangle free, but not heavy or dull.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been really helpful to moisturize.</li>
            <li>so it really takes a beating.</li>
            <li>and I had to use a TON of this product to really coat all my hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or too often.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It seems to have reduced some of my frizz from my very damaged hair as well.</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>it has a strong vanilla scent, but the scent is not overpowering after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Mr waves were defined and my hair seemed healthier than it has since high school&#x27; thanks indluenster</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft and light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing a full size of this product in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li>Big fan!&lt;br /&gt;Check out the full review on my blog www.justyouraveragemomma.com</li>
            <li>My hair also smelled so good both wet and dry!</li>
            <li>it left my hair feeling really soft, silky, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>There was no residue afterwards, and I think it also helped to reduce my frizz (I used this during a particularly humid week here in Georgia).&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I can;t be sure if its repaired my split ends or fortified the strength of my hair, but it surely has transformed my dull, dry, and brittle hair into soft strands that are much easier to manage (and thus less likely to tangle and cause more damage), and that&#x27;s more than enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly reccomend this line by Fekkai.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product-</li>
            <li>Given how well Fekkai has treated my hair in the past, I was thrilled, but not altogether surprised, by how well this product works.</li>
            <li>and I have 6 months of new growth.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>I turned my 84 year old neighbor and she loves the Fekkai products.</li>
            <li>used to really like Kenra&#x27;s deep conditioner too</li>
            <li>I am absolutely sold on this product and will be incorporating it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and visibly smoother.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week, took help moisturize and keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This mask in combination with the matching shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really should have rated this lower than four stars, but I don&#x27;t like giving low ratings because I know I have difficult hair, and I really love the smell!</li>
            <li>I received a small bottle of this masque as a free trial sample.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it direct from the FF site and didn&#x27;t notice it is scented with &amp;#34;vanilla and cream.&amp;#34;  I really dislike the fake &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; that is used for most products, but this doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla -</li>
            <li>I have a really hard time finding conditioner that allows me to easily get a brush through after washing.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool.</li>
            <li>It is coarse, thick, and frizzy, so most hair products don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, bouncy and moisturized!</li>
            <li>The PrX Reparatives left my hair feeling soft and took the frizz out.</li>
            <li>Left my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>And a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s honestly as economical as some department store conditioners when you consider the cost per application.</li>
            <li>It has been the only product to work on me after spending a lot of money in other high end brands.</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Fekkai fan for many years!  </li>
            <li> In fact, my love affair began with their shea butter mask!  </li>
            <li> It looked shiny and healthy!  </li>
            <li> Love the Smell!</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try and share a picture, but it looks amazing..</li>
            <li> it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla smell and my hair looks so good after using it.</li>
            <li> mask makes my hair look and feel very silky, and it has the best fragrance of any hair product I can remember.</li>
            <li> then i put it on my hair and a warm towel over it like it says and waited to rinse.</li>
            <li> this  product conditions very well and smells AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless you like the smell of very, very strong musk.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>

            <li> it felt refreshed and very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too.</li>
            <li> After blowdrying and straightening, it looked better than ever.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> My hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d apply mostly to the lower parts of your hair.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent but it ends up just smelling like argan oil once your hair dries.</li>
            <li> I just have to say I absolutely love, love, love what it has done for my hair.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s were most</li>
            <li> and I love, love love it</li>

            <li> It is lovely.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff</li>
            <li> Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is easy to purchase online or at my local CVS and cost is very nice on the wallet!</li>
            <li> and this stuff keeps my hair healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> I have never had a conditioner leave my hair so soft and smelling so great.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair, I noticed that it looked more hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Remembering how much I liked this conditioner from years ago, I decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> In fact, i loved it so much i purchased the full size!  </li>
            <li> smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about product buildup, but this product definitely kept my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t go to the gym, I can easily get away with using this and not washing my hair again for three days, since it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I also like that the scent was not too strong.</li>
            <li> After using it my curly hair was super shiny and my curls were light and bouncy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolute MAGIC!</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in LOVE with this product!  </li>
            <li> My fly aways are tamed and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> As soon as I rinsed this out of my hair, I could already tell a huge difference in how it felt.</li>
            <li> it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and I am glad I did</li>
            <li> Especially great to use during the harsh, winter months.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product smell great, but it leaves your hair shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I happened to get a free sample of this a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this mask from Influenster to try out.</li>
            <li> it smells EXTREMELY strongly of cheap musk.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> i received a free sample of this from influenster in my vox box.</li>
            <li> that I wish it was available in a perfume.  </li>
            <li> masque smells amazing, works great in adding moisture, but also brought out the shine that my hair was missing before!  </li>
            <li> The original product strengthened my hair and gave it lustrous body.</li>
            <li> First off, it seems to do most of what it claims</li>
            <li> i have very fine straight hair that is oily</li>
            <li> Honestly, it made my hair feel so soft and bouncy!  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product and from the first application I was hooked!</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, and has a soft touch.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the brief contact with my face didn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
            <li> (a rarity, I&#x27;ve found, in most cosmetic &amp; beauty product descriptions), a fact that I judge by the strictest of scientific scales: how much I want to run my fingers through my silky-soft hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot; Was so excited to receive this in the mail .</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from influenster to try for free and I absolutely fell in love from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> i love this product and highly recommend it-</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of PrX Reparatives Hair Mask from Influenster and instantly fell in love!  </li>
            <li> However, I have been combining this with a homemade hair mask of egg yolk, olive oil, and honey to stretch it further and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li> Great as a weekly conditioner and is helping so much in repairing my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy which translates into great moisture!</li>
            <li> Really repairs hair, leaving it smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many scents but had no problem with this one.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary.</li>
            <li> I received this product as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I received this mask plus the shampoo and conditioner complimentary from influenster for sample and review purposes.</li>
            <li> After just ONE use my hair was completely flyaway and frizz free!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would have to cut several inches off of my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster for the complimentary product to try out in my voxbox!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not the most economical solution for me, since I like to deep condition once a week.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried a complimentary sample of this product via influenster and have found my new favorite mask!  </li>
            <li> it is amazing leaves my hair soft and frizz free really treats the damage i have caused my hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Recommend doing a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; treatment once a week by wrapping up your hair in a hot towel and leaving the conditioner in for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> After first use noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some residue left.</li>
            <li> Intense conditioning!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking, feeling, and smelling fantastic!</li>
            <li> I got nearly identical results with Redken All Soft Heavy Cream treatment, which to me smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I have some pretty stubborn hair (Indian origin).</li>
            <li> I like to let it sit for a good 30 min, with a hair cap on and a blow dryer for a few mins too.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> It was easy to open in the shower.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product and continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> I can actually get a comb through my long hair when it&#x27;s wet after using this beautiful product!  </li>
            <li> I used the product the last two days and stay tame and shiny and absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> my hair is smooth, soft and alive!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair (which is highlighted, fine texture) smooth and tangle free, but not heavy or dull.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been really helpful to moisturize.</li>
            <li> so it really takes a beating.</li>
            <li> and I had to use a TON of this product to really coat all my hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or too often.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It seems to have reduced some of my frizz from my very damaged hair as well.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> it has a strong vanilla scent, but the scent is not overpowering after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Mr waves were defined and my hair seemed healthier than it has since high school&#x27; thanks indluenster</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft and light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing a full size of this product in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> Big fan!&lt;br /&gt;Check out the full review on my blog www.justyouraveragemomma.com</li>
            <li> My hair also smelled so good both wet and dry!</li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling really soft, silky, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> There was no residue afterwards, and I think it also helped to reduce my frizz (I used this during a particularly humid week here in Georgia).&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I can;t be sure if its repaired my split ends or fortified the strength of my hair, but it surely has transformed my dull, dry, and brittle hair into soft strands that are much easier to manage (and thus less likely to tangle and cause more damage), and that&#x27;s more than enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly reccomend this line by Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product-</li>
            <li> Given how well Fekkai has treated my hair in the past, I was thrilled, but not altogether surprised, by how well this product works.</li>
            <li> and I have 6 months of new growth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I turned my 84 year old neighbor and she loves the Fekkai products.</li>
            <li> used to really like Kenra&#x27;s deep conditioner too</li>
            <li> I am absolutely sold on this product and will be incorporating it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and visibly smoother.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, took help moisturize and keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This mask in combination with the matching shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really should have rated this lower than four stars, but I don&#x27;t like giving low ratings because I know I have difficult hair, and I really love the smell!</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this masque as a free trial sample.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it direct from the FF site and didn&#x27;t notice it is scented with &amp;#34;vanilla and cream.&amp;#34;  I really dislike the fake &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; that is used for most products, but this doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla -</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding conditioner that allows me to easily get a brush through after washing.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool.</li>
            <li> It is coarse, thick, and frizzy, so most hair products don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, bouncy and moisturized!</li>
            <li> The PrX Reparatives left my hair feeling soft and took the frizz out.</li>
            <li> Left my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s honestly as economical as some department store conditioners when you consider the cost per application.</li>
            <li> It has been the only product to work on me after spending a lot of money in other high end brands.</li>
            <li> I just focus on my new growth and my ends and less on the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a conditioner that is not going to make my hair go flat and oily!</li>
            <li> The only drawback was that since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, I only got 2 uses out of the sample they sent me.</li>
            <li> I had decided to have a smoothing treatment done at a salon, where a conditioner/smoother was put on my hair, and it was flat ironed repeatedly to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; it.  </li>
            <li> You can use this as your sole conditioner if you have very dry hair or only wash your hair every couple of days.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price, especially since it&#x27;s a very thick cream and lasts for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only thing that might keep me from buying it again is that I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally transformed my hair from dead and stringy to shiny and soft..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily with a blow dryer and round brush.  </li>
            <li> sad Proctor and Gamble acquired this once fine brand and ruined it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly long so gets knotted and frizzy though out the day.</li>
            <li> I left it in for a few hours with no heat before rinsing and my hair felt soft and moisturized and my thick new growth detangled effortlessly.</li>
            <li> it is hard to say it left my hair very soft amendable</li>
            <li> It has a very slight wave to it that is mostly just inconvenient and makes it more difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling dry from heat-styling</li>
            <li> I applied it to dry hair and put my hair under a processing cap.  </li>
            <li> Once a week makes my dry hair feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit too heavy to use on the roots regularly, so I use regular volumizing conditioner for everywhere except the ends.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount rubbed into my hair for about 3 minutes and my hair was so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair in this tub last forever because it does not take a lot of product to work and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> (I suspect if you used it as a rinse-out hair mask per the directions, you could get by with using less product and it would last you longer.)</li>
            <li> After the salon treatment, my ends would frizz and multiply in size, leaving me with an embarrassing mess.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it is a bit pricey, especially if you have long, thick hair like I do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because if it came unscented, I would love it for the results.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea what this does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars.  </li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying that by itself this product made absolutely no difference for my hair.</li>
            <li> It no longer felt dry and less damaged.</li>
            <li> It no longer felt dry and less damaged.</li>
            <li> had run out of coconut oil, my usual deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have dry/frizzy split ends due to an ombre style I had done a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that is about at my shoulders currently.</li>
            <li> I have spent over 20 years trying to find a product for my thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> This new version horrible for fine hair.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it saved me from cutting my hair is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> this did not weigh my hair down whatsoever</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> but this beats them all hands down.</li>
            <li> it is hard to say I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> makes the hard, dry ends of my hair like silk!</li>
            <li> In fact it made it feel a little sticky and gummed up even after washing off and shampooing.</li>
            <li> Use it a few times a week and leave it on for 5 min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x/wk for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I usually shop and will consider adding it to my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I tried it in the small size and couldn&#x27;t believe that it made the difference that it did.</li>
            <li> I usually just go with the damaged hair rather than the greasy, looking like</li>
            <li> It makes fine hair limp and horrible.</li>
            <li> I may not buy it again due to the price, or only buy it if my hair gets in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It did feel hard to rinse off</li>
            <li> I do have thick, resilient hair though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it several times now and am addicted to it!!</li>
            <li> I have dry, thick hair that gets frizzy as soon as the weather turns cold</li>
            <li> It has a subtle vanilla scent-</li>
            <li> I have some seriously colored and processed hair.</li>
            <li> When I took off the cap about 5 minutes later, the smell was so bad my eyes stung.  </li>
            <li> It is worse than nothing.</li>
            <li> some of the reviewers have because they have thin hair.</li>
            <li> am obsessed with the smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it left my hair in terrible shape.  </li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with this!</li>

            <li> Combats that nasty straw hair feeling like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great! Have bleached hair and it&#x27;s been really helpful to moisturize. Use it a few times a week and leave it on for 5 min.</li>
            <li> The best product I have used to help repair split ends and heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy to semi curly hair. I am always looking for a product that gives me the moisture I need. I received this product for complementary testing purposes and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I am obsessed with the smell. It smells of vanilla but isn&#x27;t too overpowering. It left my hair silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about product buildup, but this product definitely kept my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical upon first receiving this product because so many shampoos and conditioners do nothing for me but this line definitely worked out well. It has a subtle vanilla scent- it&#x27;s a nice vanilla bean smell not like a cheap vanilla smell, so that was a plus, too. The only drawback was that since I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, I only got 2 uses out of the sample they sent me. Oh, I also noticed that I had increased volume after using which is rare for a deep conditioning product- this did not weigh my hair down whatsoever it actually gave it some volume which is a welcome change. I would recommend for anyone who has frizzy, dry, damaged or \\&quot;super knotty after a shower\\&quot; hair! It was very easy to get a pick through my hair after my shower.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot; Was so excited to receive this in the mail . Smells good and product is silky and smooth!! This is easy to purchase online or at my local CVS and cost is very nice on the wallet! I reccomend this to others . Thank you again Influenster for my VoxBox with Fekkai sample complementary</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and I am glad I did or I may have never tried the Fekkai brand. I have dry, thick hair that gets frizzy as soon as the weather turns cold and the heaters go on. The PrX Reparatives left my hair feeling soft and took the frizz out. I like the addition of the argan oil. I also like that the scent was not too strong. I am sensitive to many scents but had no problem with this one. Since I received my sample, I have seen this product at the store I usually shop and will consider adding it to my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in my Influenster box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH. I am completely obsessed with this! I have never had a conditioner leave my hair so soft and smelling so great. As soon as I rinsed this out of my hair, I could already tell a huge difference in how it felt. My hair did not feel weighed down at all. After blowdrying and straightening, it looked better than ever. I am sold on this product!!</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool. I loved how my hair felt after applying the masque. it felt refreshed and very smooth. It no longer felt dry and less damaged.</li>
            <li> I received this product to try as part of the Influenster VoxBox. The packaging is nice, and has a soft touch. It was easy to open in the shower. The smaller size contained about two uses for my shoulder-length hair. I left it on for about 10 minutes, and after rinsing and drying, my hair was noticeably softer and shinier than before I used it. The effect lasted for about 5 days. I will definitely be purchasing a full size of this product in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary. This is an amazing product and leaves my hair smelling amazing and revives my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Really repairs hair, leaving it smooth and hydrated. Especially great to use during the harsh, winter months. Recommend doing a &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; treatment once a week by wrapping up your hair in a hot towel and leaving the conditioner in for 10 minutes. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> I turned my 84 year old neighbor and she loves the Fekkai products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolute MAGIC! I had the worst fried ends - I am very slack on getting my hair trimmed to get rid of the dead ends, and I heat style my hair every day so it really takes a beating. I got a free sample of this product and from the first application I was hooked! It&#x27;s totally transformed my hair from dead and stringy to shiny and soft..it is absolutely wonderful. Totally worth the price, especially since it&#x27;s a very thick cream and lasts for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time I wash my hair, but only on the ends. I think it&#x27;s a bit too heavy to use on the roots regularly, so I use regular volumizing conditioner for everywhere except the ends. I do a full-hair treatment with this maybe once every 2 weeks or so and it does the trick. Love love love</li>
            <li> Left my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x/wk for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  Hope to see results soon. I do love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> The best mask I have ever used, and I have tried  a lot of them. Left my hair soft, bouncy and moisturized! My hair looked and felt great. Buyers will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it is hard to say it left my hair very soft amendable it is hard to say I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Made my hair noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Great mask!  I alternate using this and an Alterna Mask.  They are both great products and do a wonderful job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea what this does.  But my wife keeps telling me to get it so it must be good.</li>
            <li> I picked this product up on a whim in CVS. I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and I have 6 months of new growth. My hair was feeling dry from heat-styling and I was looking for  strengthening treatment that would also soften my hair. This one  did the trick! I left it in for a few hours with no heat before rinsing and my hair felt soft and moisturized and my thick new growth detangled effortlessly. If this product continues to perform like this, it is definitely a keeper. It also smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, especially if you have long, thick hair like I do. I just focus on my new growth and my ends and less on the length of my hair. This treatment reminds me of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi, but it is actually cheaper. I paid $24.99 for a 7 oz. car at CVS Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> makes the hard, dry ends of my hair like silk! I have waist length hair in this tub last forever because it does not take a lot of product to work and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After first use noticed a difference. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again next week.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  Leaves my hair (which is highlighted, fine texture) smooth and tangle free, but not heavy or dull.  Definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I did not use this product as directed.  However, I am happy with the results, nonetheless.  Hopefully my review will give you another way to use the product!  (For the record, I have waist-length, color-treated hair that tends to get a bit dry/frizzy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had run out of coconut oil, my usual deep conditioner.  But I had a sample of this, so I thought I would give it a try.  I applied it to dry hair and put my hair under a processing cap.  I let it sit for 30 minutes (I soaked in the tub in the meantime), then shampooed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it left my hair feeling really soft, silky, and smooth.  It was just wonderful!  There was no residue afterwards, and I think it also helped to reduce my frizz (I used this during a particularly humid week here in Georgia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that might keep me from buying it again is that I have very long hair and I had to use a TON of this product to really coat all my hair.  So it&#x27;s not the most economical solution for me, since I like to deep condition once a week.  (I suspect if you used it as a rinse-out hair mask per the directions, you could get by with using less product and it would last you longer.)</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!! I can actually get a comb through my long hair when it&#x27;s wet after using this beautiful product!  I bought the Frederic Fekkai vanilla spray for my hair as well....it smells delicious and I get soooo many compliments!!!</li>
            <li> I received this in a VoxBox to review and wasn&#x27;t paying attention so I put it on my face before realizing it was for hair. Oops! The good news is that the brief contact with my face didn&#x27;t do any harm. Once applied to my hair, it worked beautifully for giving me smooth, detangled hair. My hair had that &amp;#34;just after a hair cut&amp;#34; feel to it where it feels healthy again. Don&#x27;t use too much or too often. I&#x27;d apply mostly to the lower parts of your hair. It did feel hard to rinse off and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some residue left.</li>
            <li> The original mask was wonderful, with keratin and silk protein. This new version horrible for fine hair. It makes fine hair limp and horrible. It is worse than nothing. I am sad Proctor and Gamble acquired this once fine brand and ruined it. If you have fine hair, don&#x27;t waste your time or money. The original product strengthened my hair and gave it lustrous body.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and my hair is abused daily by the sun, salt water, and swimming in the pool. I loved how my hair felt after applying the masque. it felt refreshed and very smooth. It no longer felt dry and less damaged.</li>
            <li> I received this product as well as the shampoo and conditioner complimentary. This a great line of hair products. Good formula, and amazing smelling too, which is always a plus. It leaves the hair feeling moisturized and strengthened.</li>
            <li> a bit pricey but it definitely works</li>
            <li> Great product! When I had my hair bleached, this was the only line of products (e.g. Fekkai conditioning masks) to restore some health to my hair. You can use this as your sole conditioner if you have very dry hair or only wash your hair every couple of days. It does not leave any residue in your hair so theoretically, if you could afford it, you could use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this! Once a week makes my dry hair feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;And I bleach my hair at home, so I use this once all the bleach is rinsed out. I like to let it sit for a good 30 min, with a hair cap on and a blow dryer for a few mins too. Combats that nasty straw hair feeling like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I used to really like Kenra&#x27;s deep conditioner too but this beats them all hands down. Well worth the price and your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> Intense conditioning!</li>
            <li> Given how well Fekkai has treated my hair in the past, I was thrilled, but not altogether surprised, by how well this product works. First off, it seems to do most of what it claims (a rarity, I&#x27;ve found, in most cosmetic &amp; beauty product descriptions), a fact that I judge by the strictest of scientific scales: how much I want to run my fingers through my silky-soft hair after using it. In all honesty, I can;t be sure if its repaired my split ends or fortified the strength of my hair, but it surely has transformed my dull, dry, and brittle hair into soft strands that are much easier to manage (and thus less likely to tangle and cause more damage), and that&#x27;s more than enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, going off of something another reviewer said (perhaps on another listing for this item?), I have been using sparing amounts of this mask as a leave-in conditioner on my ends after showering, and it has been working wonderfully in that use as well!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, love what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deep conditioner. My curls especially loved how moisturizing it is.  After using it my curly hair was super shiny and my curls were light and bouncy! I love it!</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try the PrX products and I especially loved the Prx Reparatives Mask.  Not only does this product smell great, but it leaves your hair shiny and manageable.  I was expecting it to be greasy and it is NOT!  I will be using this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Fekkai fan for many years!  In fact, my love affair began with their shea butter mask!  I recently tried a complimentary sample of this product via influenster and have found my new favorite mask!  In fact, i loved it so much i purchased the full size!  Honestly, it made my hair feel so soft and bouncy!  It looked shiny and healthy!  I will definitely be using my mask a couple of times a week or as needed to revitalize my hair!  Obsessed!</li>
            <li> I have spent over 20 years trying to find a product for my thick coarse hair.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars.  I happened to get a free sample of this a couple months ago.  I decided to give it a try.  AMAZING!!!  Never have a found a hair product like this.  Thank you Fekkai.  I wish i had found this years ago to save me tons of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from influenster to try for free and I absolutely fell in love from the first time I used it. Just a small amount rubbed into my hair for about 3 minutes and my hair was so soft and manageable. I was suffering from the frizzies and this repaired it. My hair also smelled so good both wet and dry! I am absolutely sold on this product and will be incorporating it into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. I constantly dye my hair so deep conditioners are a must for me!! It&#x27;s light weight, not greasy, smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft!! Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> great repair mask for hair</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve EVER used and I plan to purchase asap. I received this mask plus the shampoo and conditioner complimentary from influenster for sample and review purposes. After just ONE use my hair was completely flyaway and frizz free! Mr waves were defined and my hair seemed healthier than it has since high school&#x27; thanks indluenster and I highly reccomend this line by Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this mask from Influenster to try out. I really like it a lot. It is very thick and creamy which translates into great moisture! I love the vanilla scent but it ends up just smelling like argan oil once your hair dries. It left my hair feeling very soft and light. It seems to have reduced some of my frizz from my very damaged hair as well.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I love the vanilla smell and my hair looks so good after using it. It left my hair shiny and smooth. It hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. Thanks Influenster for the complimentary product to try out in my voxbox!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that is about at my shoulders currently. It has a very slight wave to it that is mostly just inconvenient and makes it more difficult to brush. I have a really hard time finding conditioner that allows me to easily get a brush through after washing. This works miracles. It made my hair soft and visibly smoother. If I don&#x27;t go to the gym, I can easily get away with using this and not washing my hair again for three days, since it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. It also smells amazing - it has a strong vanilla scent, but the scent is not overpowering after your hair is dry. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of this masque as a free trial sample.  I absolutely fell in LOVE with this product!  I used it both with the *matching* shampoo and conditioner, and also seperately with my *off brand* cleansers.  I will say this product works great either way, but there was a noticeable difference when I stopped using Fekkai shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This masque smells amazing, works great in adding moisture, but also brought out the shine that my hair was missing before!  My hair has gone</li>
            <li> I recently received the fekkai prx reparatives mask as a sample in the mail. I followed the tips and left the mask on for 10 minutes and then rinsed out the product. I was very pleased with the results. It left my hair looking, feeling, and smelling fantastic!</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This just didn&#x27;t repair my hair, at all! I used as directed and I feel like my hair is still just as damaged. The smell was great, but dissapointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner in the world!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of PrX Reparatives Hair Mask from Influenster and instantly fell in love!  It left my hair silky smooth.  After drying my hair, I noticed that it looked more hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product once my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> i have very fine straight hair that is oily this  product conditions very well and smells AMAZING!! I have purchased it several times now and am addicted to it!!</li>
            <li> I received the sample of the Shampoo/Conditioner/Mask via Influesnter!! I just have to say I absolutely love, love, love what it has done for my hair. It&#x27;s fairly long so gets knotted and frizzy though out the day. I used the product the last two days and stay tame and shiny and absolutely beautiful. I would certainly recommend this product and continue to use it myself. Especially if you like to dye your hair (that&#x27;s were most my damage has come from.) I&#x27;ll try and share a picture, but it looks amazing.. I did I mention it smells divine!!</li>
            <li> Great as a weekly conditioner and is helping so much in repairing my dry hair. I use about once a week, a jar lasts me around 3 months and my hair is just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I would give this 2.5 stars if I could. It works well, but the odor of this stuff is horrible. I ordered it direct from the FF site and didn&#x27;t notice it is scented with &amp;#34;vanilla and cream.&amp;#34;  I really dislike the fake &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; that is used for most products, but this doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla - it smells EXTREMELY strongly of cheap musk.  As soon as I&#x27;d put it on my hair, I covered it with a plastic cap.  When I took off the cap about 5 minutes later, the smell was so bad my eyes stung.  I hoped the smell would dissipate, but no, of course not.  It clings to the hair.  I won&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless you like the smell of very, very strong musk.  It&#x27;s too bad, because if it came unscented, I would love it for the results.  EDITED:  I got nearly identical results with Redken All Soft Heavy Cream treatment, which to me smells wonderful!  So, if you don&#x27;t like smell of the Fekkai product, you may want to give the Redken one a try.</li>
            <li> no comment! fekkai is number one product for curly hair! i used it because of hair loss but will use it after again and again. my hair is smooth, soft and alive!</li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying that by itself this product made absolutely no difference for my hair. In fact it made it feel a little sticky and gummed up even after washing off and shampooing. Mind you I have some pretty stubborn hair (Indian origin). It is coarse, thick, and frizzy, so most hair products don&#x27;t work for me. However, I have been combining this with a homemade hair mask of egg yolk, olive oil, and honey to stretch it further and my hair has never been better! I really should have rated this lower than four stars, but I don&#x27;t like giving low ratings because I know I have difficult hair, and I really love the smell! I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very deep conditioning hair mask. I have very fine hair. It helps a lot with heat damage and moisture.  I did leave a bit of a residue I think.  Not enough that I will stop&lt;br /&gt;using it. It is also a bit pricey for the amount you receive.  I tried it as it was recommended to me as a great repair mask. I may not buy it again due to the price, or only buy it if my hair gets in bad shape. SMELLS HEAVENLY too!</li>
            <li> I have an inactive thyroid gland and have been on medication so a friend recommended this product line for my hair and I love, love love it Prx Reparative shampoo, conditioner and mask are great</li>
            <li> Love the Smell! Smells just like Vanilla Pudding! Leaves hair soft and manageable. I use this once a week, took help moisturize and keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff. I get my hair dyed (bleached) every 6 weeks and this stuff keeps my hair healthy and strong. I do have thick, resilient hair though. I don&#x27;t experience any of the heaviness some of the reviewers have because they have thin hair. The vanilla smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Spectacular!!! Leaves my hair super soft! I have dry/frizzy split ends due to an ombre style I had done a year ago. This mask in combination with the matching shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny. It has been the only product to work on me after spending a lot of money in other high end brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer convinced that you get what you pay for since so many expensive salon products don&#x27;t seem to make any difference to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is an exception. I tried it in the small size and couldn&#x27;t believe that it made the difference that it did. I have since become a full-on Fekkai fan.&lt;br /&gt;This mask makes my hair look and feel very silky, and it has the best fragrance of any hair product I can remember. I wish he would make his Hair Fragrance spray in this scent. It is lovely.</li>
            <li> i love this product and highly recommend it-it works great</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and manageable. Really love this product. \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> finally not greasy&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this hair repair conditioner as a testing product to try and give my personal opinion from Influenster. I was a little skeptic at first because conditioners tend to make my hair greasy because my hair is so fine. I usually just go with the damaged hair rather than the greasy, looking like i haven&#x27;t washed it hair. As soon as i opened the top i smelled the wonderful scent. i loved the smell. then i put it on my hair and a warm towel over it like it says and waited to rinse. When i rinsed it out i could almost instantly tell tell it was not going to be greasy. i love this stuff it is great. Finally a conditioner that is not going to make my hair go flat and oily! Thanks Fekkai for the great product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Influenster. Such a great product. I have some seriously colored and processed hair. It works wonders. My fly aways are tamed and my hair is super soft. Big fan!&lt;br /&gt;Check out the full review on my blog www.justyouraveragemomma.com</li>
            <li> i received a free sample of this from influenster in my vox box. it is amazing leaves my hair soft and frizz free really treats the damage i have caused my hair in a short amount of time. bonus...it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I had decided to have a smoothing treatment done at a salon, where a conditioner/smoother was put on my hair, and it was flat ironed repeatedly to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; it.  Unfortunately it left my hair in terrible shape.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily with a blow dryer and round brush.  After the salon treatment, my ends would frizz and multiply in size, leaving me with an embarrassing mess.  I honestly thought I would have to cut several inches off of my shoulder length hair.  Remembering how much I liked this conditioner from years ago, I decided it was worth a try.  Within a week of nightly applications of this conditioning mask in which I would sleep with it on and rinse in the morning, my hair was transformed.  I cannot say enough good about this product.  It surely doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells so incredible, that I wish it was available in a perfume.  But the fact that it saved me from cutting my hair is well worth it.  And a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s honestly as economical as some department store conditioners when you consider the cost per application.</li>
