            <li>Most products I have bought do not make a noticeable difference in adding any body to my hair (endless hairstylists seem to need to point out my fine hair, as if I am unaware).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than my other salon purchased Volumizer.  </li>
            <li>Products that cost half this much perform better.</li>

            <li> I spent $75 on the Keratase Masquintense mask and it did no better than my $10 Shea Moisture Manuka Honey mask.  </li>
            <li> Adds a small amount of volume if you use just a small amount at the roots and blow dry.</li>
            <li> The line is owned by Loreal and in my opinion, it&#x27;s no better than the drugstore Loreal brand.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair very limp and it would not hold a style.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, worst since chemo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but one bottle lasts about 3 months with every other day use.</li>
            <li> So with trepidation, as it was expensive, I purchased both.</li>
            <li> Difficult to correctly use the product.</li>
            <li> I have been sorely disappointed by every Keratase product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love this product having been introduced to it by a salon in Arizona.  Nothing at the local drug store compares.  It is not really a hair spray, but kind of a leave in conditioner.  It makes my fine thin hair have actual body.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first but then it started to make my hair fall out.  No clue why.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for achieving volume and reducing frizz without making your hair weighted down or tacky to the touch. It&#x27;s expensive but one bottle lasts about 3 months with every other day use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this for my fine, straight hair. I&#x27;ve tried other Kerastase volumizers and other companies&#x27; products but I keep coming back to this.  The trick for me is to spray it on my round styling brush while blow drying instead of spraying it directly on the hair. Gives fabulous volume without the \\&quot;weight\\&quot; some volumizing products create.  I notice the difference right away if I run out and have to use something else. Nothing works quite as well as this product does.</li>
            <li> It works, I use it every time and helps make hair thicker, the end result after brushing  shows more regularly to the tip</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it.  I have thin, straight hair and this helps to give it some boost without leaving it sticky.  I haven&#x27;t found a better product out there.</li>
            <li> Adds a little volume and allows you to get the most of out of your blow dry. Great to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> I purchase this a couple of weeks ago. The original one I purchased at my salon and loved it. It works well. Just don&#x27;t put too much on otherwise it is too heavy and your hair will go flat I have semi fine hair. But let end by saying this is the only product that does what it says</li>
            <li> It is a boon to fine, straight hair! It adds body and helps hair hold a set, even in wind and humidity.</li>
            <li> I originally received a bottle of this product and as gift. Now I&#x27;m hooked as it makes my hair stay in place without mousse or hair spray build up.</li>
            <li> This spray didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  It did absolutely nothing for volume and it was sticky and crunchy to boot. I&#x27;ve had better volume from Living Proof Full mousse, which isn&#x27;t crunchy or sticky at all and gives me great volume and shine.  I have been sorely disappointed by every Keratase product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The line is owned by Loreal and in my opinion, it&#x27;s no better than the drugstore Loreal brand.  I spent $75 on the Keratase Masquintense mask and it did no better than my $10 Shea Moisture Manuka Honey mask.  In fact, I would say that the results were not as good!!  So I&#x27;m not spending another nickel on Keratase.  I will stick with my Living Proof Perfect Hair Day shampoo and conditioner and my SM mask.  After using these products for more than a month, my hair has never looked better.  It is soft, silky, shiny and frizz free.  So I don&#x27;t recommend anyone spend big bucks for glorified Loreal products.  Buy the drugstore line if you must, but if you want great hair, try what I&#x27;ve been using.  With LP s/c and SM mask and the LP Full mousse I have a great hair day every day.  Keratase isn&#x27;t worth a plug nickel in my opinion and my experience bears this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years ever since my stylist turned me on to it.  Lightweight but works with heat to volumize fine hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds volume and some control to my do. Have been using for a couple of years now. I&#x27;ve tried others but like this the best</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite products it adds volume without adding weight or leaving your hair feeling like it has product in it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and really like it. occasionally I will try something different, but I always come back to this as my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good product for people with thin hair but the pump clogged up after awhile.</li>
            <li> gives here hair added volume</li>
            <li> While this worked reasonably well, I have found other brands of spray volumizers that work equally well for much less money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than my other salon purchased Volumizer.  It just costs more than the current product I use.</li>
            <li> Good product for fine hair</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  It gives my hair just enough body and volume!  My hair is hard to manage and this product makes it manageable and lovely, if I do say so myself!</li>
            <li> Great for controlling static. Pleasant scent. Adds a small amount of volume if you use just a small amount at the roots and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, worst since chemo.  this is the only product that helps to give me volume! Yes it is pricey but worth it. This is a must have !</li>
            <li> I purchase this regularly from my hair stylist but ran out and wasn&#x27;t due to visit her for awhile.  Amazon makes ordering and receiving so easy!  This is a great product, especially for thin or baby fine hair like mine.  You don&#x27;t need to use much to achieve fullness.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinnish hair. Most products I have bought do not make a noticeable difference in adding any body to my hair (endless hairstylists seem to need to point out my fine hair, as if I am unaware). I bought this from Amazon after my current hairstylist used it on me. I will never have thick tresses but this is actually worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product adds volume to your roots but doesn&#x27;t affect the texture of your hair.  The pump nozzle works very well and the product sprays evenly and over a fairly large area instead of being concentrated in a stream.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product smells great and provides volume for thin hair. Love this product, I highly recommend you buy this product</li>
            <li> I have straight baby fine hair and was hoping for more volume as I read in the reviews.  It did not deliver that for me.  It made my hair very limp and it would not hold a style.  I tried it twice to be sure, but had the same result.  I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product for awhile and now I am stocking up--great for body in short hair!  Love it for styling while hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin short hair and needed a product that would give it some boost and plenty of volume and control. I did not know whether to purchase the mousse or the spray as both had great reviews. So with trepidation, as it was expensive, I purchased both. So, therefore, I am writing this review for those of you who might be wondering what is the difference between the mousse and the spray. If you want plenty of volume, control and condition to your hair that last all day choose the mousse. The spray is indeed easier to apply, but I found it to be diluted and the volume quite loose and not as controlled as the mousse; if it is just a little boost you need then the spray is for you. With the mousse you can control the fullness of your hair with the amount you use, with the spray it just seems to be more added liquid without added volume.</li>
            <li> Basically save your money. The performance of this product does not warrant the price. Products that cost half this much perform better.Highly overpriced with very low return for your money.</li>
            <li> Instructions for use written in foreign language. I speak only english. Difficult to correctly use the product. How do I get english version?</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommends this. Amazon pricing is by far better than beauty salon mark up</li>
