            <li>I want to buy the summer collection set now of all the bright neon colors.</li>
            <li>not in the good sense.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous color on my caramel skin.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color but the polish chips within a day of putting it on.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she has enjoyed it greatly.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Really love this fum color!</li>
            <li>but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice neon</li>
            <li>Orange knockout shows it as very diluted here but trust me, it is incredibly bright bright bright orange.</li>
            <li>One of the prettiest summer colors out there, but I find it to be streaky and it chips easily!</li>
            <li>love love love this color, super neon super great, great addition to your collection</li>
            <li>this picture doesn&#x27;t show how beautiful this color really is, defiantly recomend this color and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>It did NOT seem like China Glaze product, it seemed VERY CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Yes, the neons do chip easier and they also need 2-3 coats to even out and a top coat to make it glossy and not matted.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the brand.</li>
            <li>but you just need so many</li>
            <li>but like I have said just need too many</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t be buying any more China Glaze polish.</li>
            <li>I had even put some Sally Hanson No Chip top coat on it...</li>
            <li>I applied 2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat.  </li>
            <li>it requires more than one coat .</li>
            <li>I have tons of China Glaze nail polish and normally love it, but not this time.  </li>
            <li>Must use top coat because it dries matte finish.</li>
            <li>and you need a top coat to make it shine.</li>
            <li>However, the color chipped within a day even with a top coat on.</li>
            <li>If you are buying this product make sure you have seen it in person</li>
            <li>I really do love this color</li>
            <li>you need to put a top coat.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>that are very nice and go on very welll......</li>
            <li>awesome, fast, brand new bottles.</li>
            <li>I originally wrote a great review on this product but after getting a professional manicure and having my nails chip literally hours after has changed my mind!!  </li>
            <li>I love China Glaze polishes, but I&#x27;ve used this color for a couple years and it wasn&#x27;t true to color when I got it.</li>
            <li>If you apply more than 2 coats it chips quickly .</li>
            <li>Definitely apply a top and bottom clear coat to get the best staying power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it came quickly and the process was easy.</li>
            <li>The original bottle of China Glaze Pool Party (I bought three at the time.........</li>
            <li>/&gt;You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color is SO bright and gorgeous, but you need at least 3 coats and even then you can still see your nail.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I have a pretty good idea of how wonderful a nail polish</li>
            <li>Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon</li>
            <li>It is definitely a summer color and is bright.</li>
            <li>Its so bright i only use it on my toes</li>
            <li>I loved this color but this product only lasted a day and it started lifting and clipping.</li>
            <li>thinking maybe my top coat was old, repainted with new bottle of top coat and by Monday afternoon, again chipping on most nails.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty color but took 2 to 3 coats and it chipped on me pretty easily!</li>
            <li>keep some more in stock for me later :)    </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that the color I purchased (Pool Party) looked NOTHING like the color it&#x27;s supposed to be, I had to put on THREE coats of the nail color and TWO coats of top coat to make it look like normal nail</li>
            <li>REAL china glaze DOES NOT do this!!</li>
            <li>a perfect cross between orange and pink.  </li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite nail polish, and that is saying a lot being that i have tons and tons of nail polish</li>
            <li>This product image does not represent the right color of the product.</li>
            <li>Super bright, and very very flattering for pale skin tones.</li>
            <li>When applying this color be sure to work quickly, as matte finishes have a tendency to dry fairly fast!</li>
            <li>so  pretty</li>
            <li>definitely need a shiny top coat for this pool party color</li>
            <li>I also have purchased China Glaze at a much higher price tag from upscale cosmetic stores and salons.</li>
            <li>Pool Party looks like a nice pink....</li>
            <li>It immediately began chipping from even the most basic activity using my hands.  </li>
            <li>I polished my nails with the usual top coat on Saturday night, and by Sunday afternoon they were chipping on most nails.  </li>
            <li>too see if you really like it!</li>
            <li>I first tried this color at the nail salon for my pedicure</li>
            <li>The only positive things I can say about this product are it&#x27;s a lovely color (Pool Party)</li>
            <li>Make sure you know the real color prior to buying the product.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite polish ever, bummer that it was limited time...</li>
            <li>Polish goes on as matte and is very streaky although the color is very vibrant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more pink than orange</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really like China Glaze</li>
            <li>it chips so fast.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast</li>
            <li>Very orange and not the coral color</li>
            <li>in real life</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not just for the summer if you really want to stand out get the pool party color.</li>
            <li>but is very matte</li>
            <li>but i really really like it.</li>
            <li>it goes on looking very neon orange rather than</li>
            <li>fast dry top coat and my manicure looked a little better but still very streaky.  </li>
            <li>and it does dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unfortunate because I bought 3 beautiful colors!</li>
            <li>There can be bald spots with the appliation and it chipped within 2 days with two coats of my fail safe top coat.</li>
            <li>This is a vibrant orange/pink toned nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color for the summer time, it last a long time on my toes and recommend to buy if up into neon colors.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the polish, but want the pink back, not this orange color.</li>
            <li>It immediately began chipping again and I spent an entire day babysitting my fingers, filling in each chip and covering with yet another coat of top coat no less than six times.  </li>
            <li>Upside dried very fast tho!!</li>
            <li>I use China Glaze whenever I go to salons and get professional manicures/pedicures.</li>
            <li>noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color</li>
            <li>it dries really well and has a matte finish, and if you don&#x27;t like a matte finish nail color, by applying a clear gloss it shines just as normally as any other</li>
            <li>First of all, Pool Party is not bubblegum pink</li>
            <li>I was expecting a hot pink like the picture and bottle.</li>
            <li>Hot pink.</li>
            <li>The pool party is an electric pink and can be worn with any thing really</li>
            <li>This polish color is beautiful and the first day I got tons of compliments but the quality of the polish is awful...</li>
            <li>I should have spent the extra $5 and purchased the real thing at a store.</li>

            <li> This polish color is beautiful and the first day I got tons of compliments but the quality of the polish is awful...</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra $5 and purchased the real thing at a store.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s complete garbage</li>
            <li> need multiple coats and dries very very flat.</li>
            <li> /the color looks flat.</li>
            <li> The name of the polish is the same, but the polish color is orange now, not neon pink.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s a very sheer neon pink when the pictures all look like a coralish color</li>
            <li> I love the color, but the texture of just the polish is very weird and started chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> Lasts long too!</li>
            <li> The only other option I can think of to have the polish stay on longer is to do a glue manicure...</li>
            <li> China Glaze quality is really above and beyond any other.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a neon orange with a slight neon red undertone.</li>
            <li> I removed all of it and reapplied less than 24 hours after the initial application.  </li>
            <li> I have other colors by China Glaze</li>
            <li> The one that I bought from a store in the past and have gotten from the nail salon did not have such an orange tint.</li>
            <li> However, when i get these colors on my toes they last at least 2 weeks because my toes experience less contact.</li>
            <li> Color is totally different than what is shown.the actual product I got is very thin and neon orange</li>
            <li> And finally shocking pink is neon light pink.</li>
            <li> and it dried matte for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dull finish</li>
            <li> but the color is matte or dull.</li>
            <li> that is after you put at least three coats on because it does not go on well.  </li>
            <li> Ordered late - still got it before Christmas</li>
            <li> Money down the drain!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it must be a quality product, but unless I&#x27;m missing some secret trick to applying and maintaining this junk, I was totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> Again less than 24 hours after applying I had to remove all of it because of the horrible chipping.  </li>
            <li> Really bad quality polish.</li>
            <li> Hugely Disappointed in color</li>
            <li> If the glue manicure doesn&#x27;t work then this polish is useless to me!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the color that i have got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Horribly streaky</li>

            <li> I have a LOT of China Glaze neon colors. First of all, Pool Party is not bubblegum pink it is actually what I would call Neon Watermelon if that helps anyone. I just got my nails done and what is showing on my computer is NOT what color it is. It&#x27;s neon orangish-pink and if you have ever had a neon watermelon bathing suit you will know what this color is. Flip Flop Fantasy is actually what I would call neon coral. It&#x27;s more pink than orange but it&#x27;s one of my favorites. Orange knockout shows it as very diluted here but trust me, it is incredibly bright bright bright orange. And finally shocking pink is neon light pink. I wanted to comment because the colors showing are not the colors. I am sitting here with my nail polish next to me and it&#x27;s not showing the vibrancy or even hue they are. Yes, the neons do chip easier and they also need 2-3 coats to even out and a top coat to make it glossy and not matted. I have found that even getting a manicure at the nail salon my fingers will chip after 2 days. However, when i get these colors on my toes they last at least 2 weeks because my toes experience less contact.</li>
            <li> The original bottle of China Glaze Pool Party (I bought three at the time.........one to give, one to use and an extra)  was a totally different color........a perfect cross between orange and pink.  When my extra bottle was lost, I ordered this one and it is the brightest shade of orange I could&#x27;ve imagined and I do NOT do orange.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the brand. China Glaze is awesome and this color is one of the best ever. Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased China Glaze Pool Party &amp; Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&lt;br /&gt;The Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon yellow.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color going.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are  so  pretty but you just need so many coats.&lt;br /&gt;I used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.&lt;br /&gt;You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.&lt;br /&gt;I really like China Glaze but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle but like I have said just need too many coats.&lt;br /&gt;The polishes also chipped within a day as well.</li>
            <li> need multiple coats and dries very very flat. definitely need a shiny top coat for this pool party color</li>
            <li> The name of the polish is the same, but the polish color is orange now, not neon pink.  I love the quality of the polish, but want the pink back, not this orange color.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite polish ever, bummer that it was limited time... keep some more in stock for me later :)    awesome, fast, brand new bottles. A++</li>
            <li> This is a great color! Super bright, and very very flattering for pale skin tones. The only thing I would recommend would be to always use a topcoat with this product, as it dries as a matte, rather than drying as a glossy finish. When applying this color be sure to work quickly, as matte finishes have a tendency to dry fairly fast!</li>
            <li> The color is SO bright and gorgeous, but you need at least 3 coats and even then you can still see your nail. There can be bald spots with the appliation and it chipped within 2 days with two coats of my fail safe top coat.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer color. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the cheapest nail polish I have ever bought... not in the good sense. I love the color, but the texture of just the polish is very weird and started chipping the next day. Even with two coats. Definitely apply a top and bottom clear coat to get the best staying power. Not like OPI where you don&#x27;t need them. Probably won&#x27;t be buying any more China Glaze polish. Only OPI for this girl! Giving it two stars just because I LOVE the color, which makes me sad it chips so fast.</li>
            <li> I use China Glaze whenever I go to salons and get professional manicures/pedicures. I also have purchased China Glaze at a much higher price tag from upscale cosmetic stores and salons. Needless to say, I have a pretty good idea of how wonderful a nail polish China Glaze is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China GLAZE is supposed to come out SHINY (hence the name). This garbage looks like I colored my nail with a highlighter. Besides the fact that the color I purchased (Pool Party) looked NOTHING like the color it&#x27;s supposed to be, I had to put on THREE coats of the nail color and TWO coats of top coat to make it look like normal nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep reading people&#x27;s reviews saying you have to use lots of coats/the color looks flat. REAL china glaze DOES NOT do this!! I guess you get what you pay for... I should have spent the extra $5 and purchased the real thing at a store.</li>
            <li> I love this color for the summer time, it last a long time on my toes and recommend to buy if up into neon colors.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous color on my caramel skin. It&#x27;s like a neon orange with a slight neon red undertone. Love this! Lasts long too!</li>
            <li> China Glaze \\&quot;Pool Party\\&quot; is absouloutely gorgeous! It dries so fast and it&#x27;s the perfect color I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Very orange and not the coral color I was expecting</li>
            <li> Color is totally different than what is shown.the actual product I got is very thin and neon orange</li>
            <li> I loved this color but this product only lasted a day and it started lifting and clipping. I had even put some Sally Hanson No Chip top coat on it... This polish color is beautiful and the first day I got tons of compliments but the quality of the polish is awful... I would never order again.</li>
            <li> One of the prettiest summer colors out there, but I find it to be streaky and it chips easily!</li>
            <li> The color I purchased did NOT look like it did on the computer.  Pool Party looks like a nice pink....in real life it&#x27;s neon orange. It also is not glossy.  It&#x27;s a dull finish so you would have to put a gloss op coat on.....that is after you put at least three coats on because it does not go on well.  I have other colors by China Glaze that are very nice and go on very welll......but skip this color</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has enjoyed it greatly. She has also gotten a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I bought China Glaze polish because I see it used often in my local nail salons. I thought it must be a quality product, but unless I&#x27;m missing some secret trick to applying and maintaining this junk, I was totally wrong.  I prepped my nails and painted them with this polish, 2 coats.  Horribly streaky and it dried matte for some reason.  Applied China Glaze fast dry top coat and my manicure looked a little better but still very streaky.  It immediately began chipping from even the most basic activity using my hands.  I removed all of it and reapplied less than 24 hours after the initial application.  Still streaky.  I applied 2 coats of polish and 2 coats of top coat.  It immediately began chipping again and I spent an entire day babysitting my fingers, filling in each chip and covering with yet another coat of top coat no less than six times.  Again less than 24 hours after applying I had to remove all of it because of the horrible chipping.  The only positive things I can say about this product are it&#x27;s a lovely color (Pool Party) and it does dry very quickly.  Other than that it&#x27;s complete garbage and I will never buy China Glaze again.</li>
            <li> i guess it&#x27;s made that way on purpose but the color is matte or dull. i had to put on like 5 layers to get any effect, then several days later it chipped. so i&#x27;m kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Polish goes on as matte and is very streaky although the color is very vibrant it requires more than one coat . If you apply more than 2 coats it chips quickly .</li>
            <li> I have tons of China Glaze nail polish and normally love it, but not this time.  I polished my nails with the usual top coat on Saturday night, and by Sunday afternoon they were chipping on most nails.  Removed Sunday thinking maybe my top coat was old, repainted with new bottle of top coat and by Monday afternoon, again chipping on most nails.  Not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> Bright orange. I was expecting a hot pink like the picture and bottle. Hugely Disappointed in color but China glaze has great quality. Must use top coat because it dries matte finish.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color but the polish chips within a day of putting it on. Really bad quality polish.</li>
            <li> love love love this color, super neon super great, great addition to your collection</li>
            <li> Make sure you know the real color prior to buying the product. It&#x27;s a really nice neon and you need a top coat to make it shine. However, the color chipped within a day even with a top coat on. I&#x27;d rather just buy a different brand that holds up longer.</li>
            <li> I originally wrote a great review on this product but after getting a professional manicure and having my nails chip literally hours after has changed my mind!!  I&#x27;m very disappointed and I have never had this happen, even with no name brand polishes I buy from the 99cent store. The only other option I can think of to have the polish stay on longer is to do a glue manicure...I&#x27;m going to try it and update. If the glue manicure doesn&#x27;t work then this polish is useless to me!! It&#x27;s very unfortunate because I bought 3 beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> Label didn&#x27;t say the color dries matte. &amp; it&#x27;s a very sheer neon pink when the pictures all look like a coralish color</li>
            <li> This product image does not represent the right color of the product. How can that be acceptable when one is buying a nail polish based on the color. I absolutely hate the color that i have got. it does not go well with my skin tone at all. Money down the drain!!!</li>
            <li> It is a pretty color but took 2 to 3 coats and it chipped on me pretty easily!</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this justice.  The pool party is an electric pink and can be worn with any thing really, it&#x27;s not just for the summer if you really want to stand out get the pool party color. China Glaze quality is really above and beyond any other.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant orange/pink toned nail polish. The picture shown does the color no justice. If you are buying this product make sure you have seen it in person too see if you really like it! Boy is it bright! I really do love this color it dries really well and has a matte finish, and if you don&#x27;t like a matte finish nail color, by applying a clear gloss it shines just as normally as any other</li>
            <li> This has been on my daughter&#x27;s list for awhile.... she loved it!!! Ordered late - still got it before Christmas</li>
            <li> Very nice color but is very matte you need to put a top coat. Upside dried very fast tho!! Very bright and eye grabbing color.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It was just like buying it from the store.I will StStarr buying my nail polish from here</li>
            <li> Really love this fum color! It is definitely a summer color and is bright. I would not wear this to work but on the weekends or during summers off this is the perfect pool party shade! It stayed on for about 5 days before starting to chip. Once it did start to chip I had to take it off because it was very obvious with chips. I want to buy the summer collection set now of all the bright neon colors.</li>
            <li> I first tried this color at the nail salon for my pedicure and i loved it. Its so bright i only use it on my toes but i really really like it. Its like and orange pinkish color Very Very bright!!!!</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze polishes, but I&#x27;ve used this color for a couple years and it wasn&#x27;t true to color when I got it. The one that I bought from a store in the past and have gotten from the nail salon did not have such an orange tint. When I got this bottle of polish it goes on looking very neon orange rather than pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it came quickly and the process was easy.</li>
            <li> It did NOT seem like China Glaze product, it seemed VERY CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Hot pink. Love it. Goes on matfinish</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite nail polish, and that is saying a lot being that i have tons and tons of nail polish this picture doesn&#x27;t show how beautiful this color really is, defiantly recomend this color and will purchase again.</li>
