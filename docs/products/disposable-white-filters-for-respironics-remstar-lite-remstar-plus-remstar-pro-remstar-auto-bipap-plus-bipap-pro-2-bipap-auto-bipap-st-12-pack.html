            <li>They fit my unit good and work as they should.</li>
            <li>high quality, perfect fit -</li>
            <li>Be sure to measure your filter.  </li>
            <li>and I change the filter monthly (sometimes more during allergy season).</li>
            <li>but i dont know what else to say too many words.</li>
            <li>ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to order these.</li>
            <li>When you order these filters, as others have mentioned, measure your existing machine and make sure they are specified for it</li>
            <li>I suppose these are working OK.</li>
            <li>love it just what I wanted</li>

            <li>I cut to fit my machine.  </li>
            <li>Have to cut them into about 6ths to make them fit</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit....</li>
            <li>Fit CPAP</li>
            <li>Perfect fit without all the trouble of going through a CPAP shop sales routine.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the right size filter.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>For the price you really cant ask for more they are oversized for my cpap but easily cut to match with scissors</li>
            <li>Very satisfied--just make sure you get your machine&#x27;s filter size requirements correct.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I looked on Amazon before purchasing from a Medical supply store and paying way more.</li>
            <li>well packaged &amp; quickly shipped, we&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed - was paying much much more before discovering this - do not hesitate to order - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The first batch of filters that I received were very large and not correct,  I contacted the seller and they immediately forwarded the correct size requesting that I return the original shipment at my convenience.  </li>
            <li>i cut them to fit my cpap machine, and now i have many extra filters.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was delivered fast and for a great price.</li>
            <li>Tina&#x27;s Home Care always provides exactly what you order, quickly and no hassles.</li>
            <li>Told me they would send me a label and replace the filters with the right ones.  </li>
            <li>They are the right size, are doing the job</li>
            <li>Order the right one.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>My order came in at the right time and they were the exact filters for my machine.</li>
            <li>Good Quality durable plastic mess backed HEPA CPAP filter.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what it said it was.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I found these for such a cheap price!  </li>
            <li>It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>these smell funny.</li>
            <li>As many have mentioned, I have the same model number that appears in their description.  </li>
            <li>, so I speak with first hand</li>
            <li>I actually bought this to cut up and use for a different filter as the price and quality were so good.</li>
            <li>Filters are of a good quality, reseller just too lazy to list the correct match of machine to filter.  </li>
            <li>Great product, costs much less than if purchased locally.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much dirt these things trap.</li>
            <li>These are much cheaper from Amazon than getting them from the place where I got my machine.</li>
            <li>I have given up and would rather pay the small amount these are and order them on my own.  </li>
            <li>My machine is pretty old, but it still blows air, so I&#x27;ll put off replacing it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>A little large for my machine but easily trimmed.</li>
            <li>Filters came quickly and were priced much lower than my rehab center.  </li>
            <li>I have used my B-Pap machine for several years and could not find the right size for my machine.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again these disposable white fine filters for my Respironics Remstar</li>
            <li>I depend on my CPAP to live.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the product which is exactly the same as my unit uses.  </li>
            <li>They are the exact ones I get from my medical supplier and that insurance will approve.  </li>
            <li>The description of the filters in the add did not make the size clear.</li>
            <li>Called them direct.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s machine is 10 years old and to purchase these at the Home Health Store was triple the cost of these.</li>
            <li>But ill have to say make sure you have right filter when ordering filters.</li>
            <li>our insurance insist we use always gave us too-large ones also -- they&#x27;re easily clipped down to the proper size with no loss of function.</li>
            <li>The photo is a Respironics Remstar M Series, but these filters are used with the older &amp; larger CPAPs (e.g., the Remstar Plus).  </li>
            <li>wrong white filter guys mine are smaller, they don&#x27;t fit , send me the right ones please, philips respironics, optilife doesn&#x27;t make white filters that large for my machine .</li>
            <li>Simple you open the package and replace the old units.</li>
            <li>Not sure who is at fault  me for not reading or company for not sending right size.</li>

            <li> I live on over an acre of desert and the house gets dusty fast.</li>
            <li> these cost approx 90% less than my medical supplier bills my insurance and approx one third of the amount my insurance finally pays my supplier.</li>
            <li> They sell this product using a long list of machines one of which is the one I have.  </li>
            <li> I am so tired of fighting my insurance to get replacement filters and then getting my supplier to order the right ones.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost of postage to send them back.</li>
            <li> Too little information on too wide a variety of machines.</li>
            <li> Thank-you Tina&#x27;s Homecare for not letting me down.</li>
            <li> One size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> Did not fit machine that the description specifies</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong size, that&#x27;s on me, but they are the right product, just the wrong size.</li>
            <li> These filters DO NOT FIT!  </li>
            <li> These appear to be identical to the filters we&#x27;d been given in the past.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was their fault or mine.....</li>
            <li> Should replace filter no more than each 60 days.</li>
            <li> Confusing, this product is not what I ordered and does not work for my machine.  </li>
            <li> I use but not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> It was the wrong size for my machine.</li>
            <li> these were mistakenly ordered, and were the wrong size.</li>
            <li> They are expensive as is the competitions.  </li>
            <li> Tried cutting them to size, they then de-laminated and fell apart.  </li>
            <li> When I change them, they don&#x27;t look dirty.</li>
            <li> and you should not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If they would have given the dimensions in the add I would have known they were not the correct ones for my machine, so I cut them up and used them anyway.</li>
            <li> I depend on my CPAP to live. These filters add to that. I am very satisfied with them. If you use a CPAP then you already know that you need one of these for the machine to function properly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from ABC distribution through Amazon 5 weeks ago.  They sell this product using a long list of machines one of which is the one I have.  What I received resembles the picture but is twice the size that works in my machine.  Contacted the company through Amazon and they responded that they would send me a return label and replace with the correct filters.  Waited 3 1/2 wks.  No label,no further correspondence.  Called them direct. The person who answered the phone couldn&#x27;t wait to get off the line.  Told me they would send me a label and replace the filters with the right ones.  Still waiting! It isn&#x27;t the product which is exactly the same as my unit uses.  It&#x27;s the size and the vendor selling them.  Too little information on too wide a variety of machines. One size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> Tina&#x27;s Home Care always provides exactly what you order, quickly and no hassles. Keep it up please.</li>
            <li> I have a REMStar Pro.  These filters DO NOT FIT!  Way too big, despite being listed as the correct filter.  Tried cutting them to size, they then de-laminated and fell apart.  Filters are of a good quality, reseller just too lazy to list the correct match of machine to filter.  Wont do business with them again.  Not worth the cost of postage to send them back.</li>
            <li> Good Quality durable plastic mess backed HEPA CPAP filter.  I actually bought this to cut up and use for a different filter as the price and quality were so good.</li>
            <li> Great product, costs much less than if purchased locally.  Excellent quality.  A little large for my machine but easily trimmed.</li>
            <li> The first batch of filters that I received were very large and not correct,  I contacted the seller and they immediately forwarded the correct size requesting that I return the original shipment at my convenience.  Great service, good product, I will re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the condition of the items ordered. Right on time in good condition. Will definitely buy again these disposable white fine filters for my Respironics Remstar Plus from the same seller. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Lost our C-pap supplier a while back and have been looking for these white filters for our Remstar pro2 machine ever since. These appear to be identical to the filters we&#x27;d been given in the past. They are the right size, are doing the job and we&#x27;re happy for that. We are also grateful to have found a C-pap equipment supplier on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Be sure to measure your filter.  Order the right one.</li>
            <li> Filters don&#x27;t fit a REMstar Pro. Way too big.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what it said it was.  My husband&#x27;s machine is 10 years old and to purchase these at the Home Health Store was triple the cost of these.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the right size filter. If not, you will have to pay for the return postage and by that point any savings will be moot.</li>
            <li> For the price you really cant ask for more they are oversized for my cpap but easily cut to match with scissors</li>
            <li> It was the wrong size for my machine. Other than that it was delivered fast and for a great price.</li>
            <li> wrong white filter guys mine are smaller, they don&#x27;t fit , send me the right ones please, philips respironics, optilife doesn&#x27;t make white filters that large for my machine .</li>
            <li> I have used my B-Pap machine for several years and could not find the right size for my machine.  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found these for such a cheap price!  They fit my REMStar Plus 2 perfectly and I change the filter monthly (sometimes more during allergy season).</li>
            <li> whats to say, it is what it is.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit without all the trouble of going through a CPAP shop sales routine. Very satisfied--just make sure you get your machine&#x27;s filter size requirements correct.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong size, that&#x27;s on me, but they are the right product, just the wrong size.</li>
            <li> Filters came quickly and were priced much lower than my rehab center.  However the white filters were twice as big as I needed so out came the scissors.  Not sure who is at fault  me for not reading or company for not sending right size. Still a big savings.</li>
            <li> Simple you open the package and replace the old units. I cannot tell you how much dirt these things trap. I live on over an acre of desert and the house gets dusty fast.</li>
            <li> Thank-you Tina&#x27;s Homecare for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li> I am so tired of fighting my insurance to get replacement filters and then getting my supplier to order the right ones.  I have given up and would rather pay the small amount these are and order them on my own.  They are the exact ones I get from my medical supplier and that insurance will approve.  BTW these cost approx 90% less than my medical supplier bills my insurance and approx one third of the amount my insurance finally pays my supplier.</li>
            <li> high quality, perfect fit - exactly what I needed - was paying much much more before discovering this - do not hesitate to order - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Look like the ones I get from my home health supplier but these smell funny. I use but not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> Just what I was look for at a great price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> As many have mentioned, I have the same model number that appears in their description.  I even have the same Bi-Pap device shown in their photo, but the filters I received are twice the size.  It would have been nice if the company had provided a size description of the product.  I should have known better than to order these.</li>
            <li> I cut to fit my machine.  It makes a lot of extras.</li>
            <li> these were mistakenly ordered, and were the wrong size. they were much larger than the ones i use.  i cut them to fit my cpap machine, and now i have many extra filters.</li>
            <li> Did not fit machine that the description specifies</li>
            <li> Filters arrived on time and nice. But ill have to say make sure you have right filter when ordering filters.</li>
            <li> My order came in at the right time and they were the exact filters for my machine. I am happy with the price, size, and the delivery of the filters. When you order these filters, as others have mentioned, measure your existing machine and make sure they are specified for it and you should not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Confusing, this product is not what I ordered and does not work for my machine.  I guess it what you pay for</li>
            <li> Good quality, better than the others.  They are expensive as is the competitions.  I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;JPC</li>
            <li> They were the right size and best deal.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Respironics BiPap. Comes with handy &amp;#34;tabs.&amp;#34; Good buy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I suppose these are working OK. When I change them, they don&#x27;t look dirty. My machine is pretty old, but it still blows air, so I&#x27;ll put off replacing it. These are much cheaper from Amazon than getting them from the place where I got my machine.</li>
            <li> Have to cut them into about 6ths to make them fit so now I have about 10,000 years of filters.</li>
            <li> works for my husband&#x27;s machine perfectly.  I am so glad I looked on Amazon before purchasing from a Medical supply store and paying way more.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit....not sure if it was their fault or mine.....</li>
            <li> Fit CPAP just right.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Fits my Remstar Pro perfectly - and great price.  Highly recommend.  Should replace filter no more than each 60 days.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This is an evaluation of the Amazon ad, not the product.  Explanation: The photo is a Respironics Remstar M Series, but these filters are used with the older &amp; larger CPAPs (e.g., the Remstar Plus).  These filters will not work in the CPAP in the photograph!  The text part of this ad is correct (incl. the measurements).  I have both the M and Plus, so I speak with first hand knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Remstar M Series, search &amp;#34;Respironics Remstar M Series, M Compatible 12 UF 2 Foam filter&amp;#34; on Amazon.  They currently sell for $10.98/dozen.</li>
            <li> I received product in very good time, it came just as described and am well satisfied with what I got.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fits perfectly. Identical to the ones from my supplier, just about 1/4 of the cost. Thanks!!! Can breathe easy now.</li>
            <li> These disposable CPAP filters were rather larger than the ones we needed but -- given the ones we used to get from the company our insurance insist we use always gave us too-large ones also -- they&#x27;re easily clipped down to the proper size with no loss of function. well packaged &amp; quickly shipped, we&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Purchased the filters to avoid spending a lot if money on medical supply filters. They fit my unit good and work as they should. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> great price and quick quick shipping</li>
            <li> I cant use these filters withmy c-pap as they are 5 times bigger than the ones mine uses. The description of the filters in the add did not make the size clear.</li>
            <li> love it just what I wanted</li>
