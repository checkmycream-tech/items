            <li>All around good product.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works great</li>
            <li>but once you apply it takes affect within a couple of days, and it has a very refreshing feel to it.</li>
            <li>That product has a distinct smell that wasn&#x27;t very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is free of that smell and does it&#x27;s job as described.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>All of the bumps were gone within a week, although the doctor&#x27;s visit cost much more than this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my rating as I learn more about the product.</li>
            <li>is more when applying to the face or chin region, don&#x27;t want to feel like vick&#x27;s vapor rub (I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice cool tingling feeling to let you know that it is working.</li>

            <li>Helps to keep your skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works as just as described.</li>

            <li>I am pretty sure I have fungal folliculitis</li>
            <li>this product is nothing new ,I have been using it for some time now even though the price is much more than my original purchase,but the product is fulfilling to the purpose and has strong referral to anyone in need of this product..</li>
            <li>It goes on white but will eventually fade in so it is good to use in the morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I used kiti kiti on it and it helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Is refreshing and does help like I said but just be sure your using it to target specific elements.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had noticed the bumps becoming more plentiful and larger in size.</li>
            <li>and it was worth the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>this will heal you right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think my first week I used it morning and night,</li>
            <li>This creams works very well, I&#x27;d recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have used what claimed to be similar products in the past, but this product is great!  </li>
            <li>this product does the trick making his skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After I used it for a week, I came back here and ordered two more bottles and one of the tubs.</li>
            <li>It has a menthol feel to it that may feel nice on the scalp or other parts of the body, but on my face it burned.  </li>
            <li>This product helped initially, primarily by drying out the bumps, but instead of continuing to heal the bumps seemed to only come back larger and more filled with liquid.</li>
            <li>By far the best product for hair bumps, minor cuts, fungus and trouble with my scalp and face.  </li>
            <li>I feel it tobe working at this point very well.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>Works fast....</li>
            <li>Still not sure if this treatment is what&#x27;s effective in reducing my skin condition(s)</li>
            <li>You will need to apply it regularly to start seeing results so order enough to make sure you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and much cheaper than some of the highly marketed, expensive stuff (emu oil salves and soaps).</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff since High School.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like other products.</li>
            <li>The cream came quickly and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li>As long as you stay consistent with it, you will see results.</li>
            <li>Hair bump free for a few months now.</li>
            <li>Kitikiti started working within 1 day of use and by day 5 my bumps were nearly gone.</li>
            <li>My doctor prescribed cortisone 2% yet it barely helped and was very greasy (could only use at night or if not leaving home).</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well on my folliculitis and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>My head is generally trimmed with no guard attachment</li>
            <li>He has very dry and sensitive skin and</li>

            <li> I am black male with short hair and having a clear scalp is vital.</li>
            <li> I ran out a few months ago and could not get to the place where I normally purchase from because I&#x27;m out of state</li>
            <li> I find my scalp getting dry regularly, especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m only on my 3rd bottle -- so it&#x27;s extremely affordable, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear the area up entirely, but it saved it from looking hideous so i could go out in public at least.  </li>
            <li> My dermatological treatments could not clear the razor bumps on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is an essential item for the black male.  </li>
            <li> From major (never had one) to minor bumps (little ingrown hairs)</li>
            <li> Within a Few days of starting to use it I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when it arrived because the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on properly.</li>
            <li> If you shave at night and apply this after, you will have minimal bumps in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a few hundred dollars on various products trying to solve my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used their oil treatment that comes in a little tub (oil is yellow).</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s the combination of other applications used in conjuction with this minty cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some years now and it never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> The ad states would receive a free soap however, I like others did not :-( ...</li>
            <li> I use a little in affected areas every morning after washing my face and the product does the rest to hep me heal and prevent hair bumps.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the cream for approximately 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It takes a few days of use to get the ball rolling</li>
            <li> I would not recommend use of this product because of my experience and because of some of the harsh ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> Every time he shaves he uses it no more bumps....</li>
            <li> eh not really effective</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few days!!!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really disappointed with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible and burns my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did work for me. Greasy.</li>
            <li> I am still putting it to use. I feel it tobe working at this point very well.</li>
            <li> Works well but it&#x27;s stinky</li>
            <li> I used this daily. Helps to keep your skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> Cleared my ingrown hair bumps within days. I use it after I shave every morning. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like other products.</li>
            <li> This product works!  It goes on white but will eventually fade in so it is good to use in the morning and night.  As long as you stay consistent with it, you will see results. I have acne keloidis achae, which is a skin condition that produces keloids and razor bumps.  I used kiti kiti on it and it helped tremendously.  It didn&#x27;t clear the area up entirely, but it saved it from looking hideous so i could go out in public at least.  However using this with a combination of tea tree oil is effective.  And also for any suffering with acne keloidis nuchae using the gold dial antibacterial soap will work good. it dries up the area so it does not feel as irritated and the area will not look as noticeable.  Also neosporin helps because it kills the bacteria.  Doxycylin helps the condition disappear as well. it is an antibiotic prescription that fights bacteria.  A product called Scar-Away will specifically address the keloids with great results.But bottom line kiti kiti is the most legit bump solution for me.  You can even use it on your face.  If you shave at night and apply this after, you will have minimal bumps in the morning.  This is an essential item for the black male.  The smell is refreshing bt can be overwhelming.  Recommended buy.</li>
            <li> I always feel relieved after application .Outstanding Product ! If you have shaving bumps, I recommend this product .It&#x27;s one of the best.Yes, I&#x27;m a liscenced barber with over twenty years experience!</li>
            <li> OK, I love this stuff.  I have ordered a lot of products for hair bumps but this stuff works and continues to work.  Just use it once a day, and you will see results in a week.  I think my first week I used it morning and night, but after that I only use it in the morning.  Hair bump free for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great, love it</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when it arrived because the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on properly. My husband loves this product though,  I&#x27;m just really disappointed with the packaging.</li>
            <li> If I use this product after I shave, I never bump-up.  When I run out of the product, I begin getting bumps after I shave.  When I resume use of the product, the bumps go away.  Excellent product, but don&#x27;t buy the 1 oz. size.  It&#x27;s not worth the cost.  Get the 4 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works great I will continue to use this product keep up the good work I look forward in purching more in the future</li>
            <li> I have had red bumps on the back of my neck and I was looking for a cure. while it did eliminate some of the inflammation on the red bumps it is not having the effect I am looking for. I apply it once a day after the morning shower but I don&#x27;t seem to be making headway on the issue I&#x27;m trying to cure. Is refreshing and does help like I said but just be sure your using it to target specific elements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It even helped my cystic breakout. Both my husband and I use it abd love it.</li>
            <li> This product is the truth! I use it after my Brazilian wax and minum hair bumps. The only reason I say minimum is because se were already present. I will order again.</li>
            <li> By far the best product for hair bumps, minor cuts, fungus and trouble with my scalp and face.  I absolutely LOVE the cool-tingly feeling from applying Kitikiti right after a shower and shave.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This works like magic if you get razor bumps from shaving or with liners to trim your beard.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Still not sure if this treatment is what&#x27;s effective in reducing my skin condition(s) or if it&#x27;s the combination of other applications used in conjuction with this minty cream.  It goes on nicely with a mentholated after effect.  Results are somewhat inconsistent for me. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again unless its impact can be verified as a stand alone solution.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well on my folliculitis and dry scalp. Within a Few days of starting to use it I noticed a big difference. Only downside to me is the smell. It smells like something I recognize, I think Selsun Blue, but have not used it in awhile so could be mistaken.  Whatever it is, I do not care for that smell.</li>
            <li> My head is generally trimmed with no guard attachment so I&#x27;m basically bald. I find my scalp getting dry regularly, especially in the summer months. The Kitikiti scalp/skin treatment has been great at helping my head stay moisturized. I&#x27;ve previously used their oil treatment that comes in a little tub (oil is yellow). That product has a distinct smell that wasn&#x27;t very pleasant. I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is free of that smell and does it&#x27;s job as described. You will need to apply it regularly to start seeing results so order enough to make sure you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This creams works very well, I&#x27;d recommend it to others! The item arrived just as it was described in the details.</li>
            <li> Used this product at the advice of my barber to help with the bumps that would form after each haircut. My girlfriend had noticed the bumps becoming more plentiful and larger in size. This product helped initially, primarily by drying out the bumps, but instead of continuing to heal the bumps seemed to only come back larger and more filled with liquid. I finally just went to the dermatologist who injected something into the bumps and then gave me a cream and gel to apply. All of the bumps were gone within a week, although the doctor&#x27;s visit cost much more than this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it gets rid of any skin irritants almost immediately.  I have been using this product for some years now and it never lets me down.  I ran out a few months ago and could not get to the place where I normally purchase from because I&#x27;m out of state but I found it online and it was worth the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> BEST SCALP AND SKIN TREATMENT EVER! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> The cream came quickly and was what I expected.  I have only been using the cream for approximately 3 weeks but I am starting to see some results.  I&#x27;ll update my rating as I learn more about the product.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff since High School.  From major (never had one) to minor bumps (little ingrown hairs) this will heal you right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use after each shave for 2-3 days, then keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less is more when applying to the face or chin region, don&#x27;t want to feel like vick&#x27;s vapor rub (I don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a recommendation from my barber. I thought it was for razor bumps but all it does is stop the itching... Also stains clothing so beware of that! What I received came in a jar, not a bottle and it smells like car oil!</li>
            <li> My dermatological treatments could not clear the razor bumps on my scalp. My doctor prescribed cortisone 2% yet it barely helped and was very greasy (could only use at night or if not leaving home). Kitikiti started working within 1 day of use and by day 5 my bumps were nearly gone. I am black male with short hair and having a clear scalp is vital. I used this item along with [[ASIN:B000052XZX Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl oz]]. I began using the T/Sal prior to Kitikiti and it alone helped but was never 100% after a couple month of use. Once I added Kitikiti, ALL indications of barber rash were gone. I also use Kitikiti  on my neck which fully cleared bumps there. *** ONLY PROBLEM *** The ad states would receive a free soap however, I like others did not :-( ...</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for about 8 years or so, and loves it. Every time he shaves he uses it no more bumps....Get it!</li>
            <li> I have used this before. It has a nice cool tingling feeling to let you know that it is working. I use it on razor burns and it helps reduce the time it takes to heal.</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few days!!! Nice product quick shipping</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible and burns my skin. I was not impressed by this product at all.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with razor pumps and ingrown hairs.  This product has cleared up the issue.  Great for bald heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works well!</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works as just as described. It takes a few days of use to get the ball rolling but once you apply it takes affect within a couple of days, and it has a very refreshing feel to it.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my folliculitis that is on my face.  I have been dealing with this infection for over 3 months and no antibacterial soaps, antibiotics or anything else that I have tried has worked.  I am pretty sure I have fungal folliculitis so this seemed like a good product for me.  Instantly after I put it on my face became inflamed and the rash grew.  It has a menthol feel to it that may feel nice on the scalp or other parts of the body, but on my face it burned.  I would not recommend use of this product because of my experience and because of some of the harsh ingredients in it.  Cetyl Alcohol, Sulfate, Sulfur etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have used what claimed to be similar products in the past, but this product is great!  Works fast....I noticed the reduction of razor bumps and irritation immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my husband and he loves it! He has very dry and sensitive skin and this product does the trick making his skin soft and smooth. He uses it after he shaves his face and its excellent!</li>
            <li> kitikiti was fine. All around good product. BUT I didn&#x27;t get the bar soap that was to come with the order. Sent a comment to the shipper and got no reply</li>
            <li> this product is nothing new ,I have been using it for some time now even though the price is much more than my original purchase,but the product is fulfilling to the purpose and has strong referral to anyone in need of this product..</li>
            <li> eh not really effective</li>
            <li> Great for brothers who are trying to prevent keyloids on their face and back of the neck</li>
            <li> Nice soothing balm but I still had to go to doctor and get medicated shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a few hundred dollars on various products trying to solve my skin condition. The &#x27;Kitikiti&#x27; products work wonders. After I used it for a week, I came back here and ordered two more bottles and one of the tubs. Great stuff and much cheaper than some of the highly marketed, expensive stuff (emu oil salves and soaps).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two years. By the way, I&#x27;m only on my 3rd bottle -- so it&#x27;s extremely affordable, and lasts a long time. I use a little in affected areas every morning after washing my face and the product does the rest to hep me heal and prevent hair bumps.</li>
