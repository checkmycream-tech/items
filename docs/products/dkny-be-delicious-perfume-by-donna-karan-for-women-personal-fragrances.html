            <li>Loved it ttotally worth it</li>
            <li>I loved it right away and had to buy some.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice fragrance... really clean.</li>

            <li>Smells great, got it for a good price, girlfriends favorite, will get it again in the future, smells more fresh than over powering</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered a larger bottle, but this one arrived quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li>I owned a larger bottle of this perfume that I bought at Dillard&#x27;s and completely loved the scent!  </li>
            <li>Also, it is not too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong,</li>

            <li>The perfume fits in the palm of your hand and it smells fantastic.</li>

            <li>try out any new perfume on my husband, of course, and this one he really, really liked.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite of the minute!</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s perfect for work or during the day - as it isn&#x27;t overpowering but has such a nice green apple/vanilla-ish scent that isn&#x27;t cloying or immature.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this as a christmas present for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy and would buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Smells nice Im trying to buy all the DKNY perfumes they are just to high for my budget right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a crisp, fruity, light, clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>Old time favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice summer fragrance that last the day.</li>
            <li>Deliciously fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Having your man nuzzle up at your neck while your doing dishes because you smell good is one of life&#x27;s little prizes not to take for granted.</li>
            <li>but I really dont&#x27; mind it that much.</li>
            <li>Something you put on smells real good&amp;#34; She began to show me what she had sampled and when she got to DKNY</li>
            <li>real perfumy, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Not unbearable perhaps, but not soft and light.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s like $10 cheaper on Amazon than retail, plus no shipping, plus no tax either for where I live!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying  a lot of different fragrances of late and this easily falls in my Top 5</li>
            <li>Which is surprising because I don&#x27;t like apples at all,not in perfume or just regular old plain apples.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It has the smell of a fresh ,ripe, and crisp green apple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft fragrance</li>
            <li>I like soft floral scents.</li>
            <li>If you really want to buy this and not sure, walk into a store and try it on first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, nor subtle, does have hints of apple and citrus.  </li>

            <li> I finally got my perfume in the mail and I love this smell. It&#x27;s quickly becoming a favorite and I been wearing it for over a week in a row.

If you really want to buy this and not sure, walk into a store and try it on first. You won&#x27;t be disapointed!</li>

Having your man nuzzle up at your neck while your doing dishes because you smell good is one of life&#x27;s little prizes not to take for granted. So glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> I had this before but had stopped wearing it.  My granddaughter came over and sampled the small amount that I had left.  I told her &amp;#34; Something you put on smells real good&amp;#34; She began to show me what she had sampled and when she got to DKNY, I said that is it! Deliciously fresh scent.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time on what I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s definitely a daytime wearer bc it&#x27;s subtle and not overpowering. By far my favorite of the minute!</li>
            <li> very good this service and the product</li>
            <li> arrived perfectly and promptly</li>
            <li> I bought my wife this perfume and she loved it. It&#x27;s not too strong, just right. She has others too but this one is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandchildren to give to their mother at Christmas.  They were happy and excited and my daughter loved it and had been wanting some Be Delicious for some time. It smelled so nice on her. Shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition. Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> I actually like this. Which is surprising because I don&#x27;t like apples at all,not in perfume or just regular old plain apples. But this is a great. It has the smell of a fresh ,ripe, and crisp green apple. I can&#x27;t stop using this perfume! I love it!</li>

I will definitely buy more in the future! It&#x27;s a soft fragrance but it stays and that&#x27;s what I like about it the best!</li>
            <li> Not the one I thought it was. This one is okay but real perfumy, which I don&#x27;t like. I like soft floral scents. This just smells really strong. Not unbearable perhaps, but not soft and light.</li>
