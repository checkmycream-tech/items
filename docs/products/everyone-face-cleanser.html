            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it has something to do with the foaming agents and the strong citrus scent (which is a nice scent, but the essential oils can be irritating to some).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its nice smelling, gentle, effective, and cruelty free. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit - I&#x27;m not 100% crazy about the smell of this product. It&#x27;s a lemon scent with a hint of something that I can&#x27;t put my finger on. Despite the scent, I still really love this product. I was using Simple Face Cleanser and having a ton of problems with breakouts. Since using this cleanser for the last couple of weeks, my skin is on the mend!</li>
            <li> I decided to try EOs facial cleanser because I really enjoy their hand soaps. For me it is a great every day cleanser. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using this cleanser. It has a citrus type scent, I like it others may not.  I do have sensitive acne prone skin and this cleanser has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Does not dry or irratate your face. Follow with some Toner and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> I liked this for a couple weeks but it ended up being kind of irritating and drying for my skin. I&#x27;m sad this is the case because I&#x27;m such a huge fan of the company&#x27;s body lotion.

            <li> This is a really great cleanser. Makes my skin feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li> This face wash is great. It is super gentle and smells amazing. It even does a pretty good job at removing eye makeup. The bottle is bigger than most face cleansers so you get more for your money, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face wash for my husband originally. He has roseacea. It worked to calm his skin down so I tried it. Now we both use it. Good ingredients and  gentle. Amazon always has good prices.</li>
            <li> This face wash is wonderful! It works great and feels so good! It smells good too! I am happy with my buy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and its working just fine.  The consistency is a bit on the watery side but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This is just wonderful. Goes on like silk and gets off all my makeup. So much better than soap!! I will purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because it looked like a plain face scrub. I bought it for my sister and it gave her white heads all over her face. I thought I could just use it as body scub for me, but it gave me itchy white heads all over my arms :(</li>
            <li> Citrus scent.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to only buy products that do not test on animals but are still useful to my life. I&#x27;ve had this cleanser for a month now and I love it. The pump makes it easy to dispense and it smells great. My skin feels clean and refreshed but not super dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a week ago and am liking it.  I usually like St. Ives green tea wash, but I can&#x27;t find it!  This is nice and light and leaves face feeling clean and fresh.  I use it in the morning and then apply moisturizer (not EO) and it works great.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent but has a really odd smell that can be off putting; good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin of dry but oily that is also prone to breaking out. This face wash has helped me skin become more toned. I&#x27;ve also noticed smaller breakouts and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week. It also has a very nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent No-Frills Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily skin and also wear a lot of makeup. Thoroughly rids my face of all dirt and grime without stripping or drying it. Super effective and gentle and a little goes a long way. Leaves no residue and works very well with other facial products. A fantastic PERMANENT addition to my skincare regimen!</li>
            <li> Soft and luxurious.  My face loves it.  Gentle and a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best face was product I have found</li>
            <li> Works great.  Good scent, leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
