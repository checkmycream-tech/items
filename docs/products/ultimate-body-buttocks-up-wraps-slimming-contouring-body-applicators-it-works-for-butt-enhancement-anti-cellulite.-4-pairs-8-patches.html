            <li>I am happy, once again my butt looks better, but there is more work to do there.</li>
            <li>Like a VERY strong bandaid.</li>
            <li>These were very easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;These patches very easy to use</li>
            <li>I am sure that with diet and exercise combined I will finally be more confident every time I take my kids to the beach this summer!</li>
            <li>kept it over night as i could not imagine walking around with it for so many hours.</li>
            <li>but I will not be buying more...</li>
            <li>And I do eat healthy and workout.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even keep them on for more than 1/2 an hour.</li>
            <li>and I can say by butt looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>I have to admit that when I received these body buttocks up wraps, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect  while using them.</li>
            <li>or you simply are going to and event where you want to look your BEST</li>
            <li>Looking forward to ordering more to show my results.</li>
            <li>I was  lucky to receive this for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I did a light body scrub before I applied because I wanted the best results possible.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to apply this</li>
            <li>The wrap applies easily like a sticker and is also removed easily.</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So, as a result I had to place the wraps just right and in slightly different places each time I used them to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>The wraps did smooth and tighten my skin</li>
            <li>I used to have a nice firm buttock, but age has not been good to me, so I want to correct that.  </li>
            <li>you wear them the more intense the heat you will feel throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I really like the way that it feels on my thighs which is where I chose to apply them since this is my most problematic area.</li>
            <li>Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one treatment while others need to buy more than 4 pair of patches.</li>
            <li>It might sound funny</li>
            <li>Finally had my baby and was able to try this!</li>
            <li>This product is doing a fairly good job, and after I used it 4 times on the same area and the improvement certainly can be seen.  </li>
            <li>never try ist sound very interestin planing to buy  firt time</li>
            <li>So I figured this was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>but it basically shrinks and tightens, kind of like eliminating some extra water weight.</li>
            <li>They kind of are like a second skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In combination with working out and eating right</li>
            <li>I think as time progresses and a few more weeks, a few more patches, Iâ€™ll be able to notice more results.</li>
            <li>You will see the difference in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a pretty neat feeling cause it feels like it is melting away the fat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a permanent fix, however, if you are needing it to fit into an old dress or pants</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that was possible any more.</li>
            <li>Saw the difference after the first time.</li>
            <li>When I did order this wrap through a great deal to share my honest opinion I was very curious to say the least to see if it did work.</li>
            <li>I do want to say that if you choose to wear these for and extended amount of time, be prepared to feel some pretty significant heat especially if you are sitting on them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one or two patches do not give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different.</li>
            <li>and it stays put really well.</li>
            <li>Made my skin very irritated and itchy to the point where I had to take it off.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t really see results but will try again</li>
            <li>I put them on one night before bed and lasted about an hour; the burning and tingling was so intense I couldn&#x27;t sleep nor sit still.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that after one use I couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference while looking</li>
            <li>They stick very well and except for the warmth I can&#x27;t feel them.</li>
            <li>I would love too see what other products this company has.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly, after all disappointment in those chemical products, it is such a relief to find a product which actually works and has great natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>did not really do anything but feel cool.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just sensitive to them</li>
            <li>product too is no less.</li>
            <li>I was just amazed after my first application how much smoother and less bumpy my behind was, the orange peel look has diminished significantly and looks more tight.</li>
            <li>These patches/wraps are very easy to use and they do not leave any sticky residue behind.  </li>
            <li>I wish they were bigger and had them in strips I.e. For the abdomen and love handles, inner thighs to wrap around to outer, and to run up and down the back of the leg.</li>
            <li>Wow, big difference.</li>
            <li>So far ive taken pictures of current results.</li>
            <li>During application these patches give cooling and warming sensations similar to icy hot patches.</li>
            <li>it really is a miracle product for firming that last bit of loose skin.</li>
            <li>The patches are very thin and very easy to apply to your skin and once they are on</li>
    </ol>

            <li> will not suggest you go all out and use all the wraps within a week as that way your results may not last too long.</li>
            <li> Idk how long this will last</li>
            <li> Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I am getting older, and had a late in life baby, I seem to be getting a lot of extra inches and cellulite.  </li>
            <li> So, I will continue to use this product, regardless of how long it takes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to spend lots of money on expensive products and probably would have never given this a try, but trying it has definitely proven to me that this would totally be worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I feel like they didn&#x27;t cover enough of my buttocks (I am of average size).  </li>
            <li> burns for many hours, bad idea if you decide to take a shower to remove it.</li>
            <li> but thats a minimal pain.</li>
            <li> I would suggest doing this with a few days of fluid pills to get the maximum effect!</li>
            <li> I only use it during the day, applying 2 patches after my morning shower and keep it on for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I did change spots each time and put them on every other day.  </li>
            <li> It did lift though a little.</li>
            <li> Not sure I saw the results, worked a little but will not re-order again.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a body wrap, so I was not sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it does it</li>
            <li> Not anything crazy like a half inch, but a tiny change.</li>
            <li> This are so small and they did nothing to me!</li>
            <li> , it was subtle by the measurements before and after.  </li>
            <li> and I seriously notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It makes you firm up and is helping to get rid of that awful cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I hate it!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used a few firming products from this seller and they have all worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;This product too is no less. You get 4 pair of patches for application which means you get 4 times to put this.Its really easy to apply this and it stays put really well. It does not come off but rather sticks to your butt.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it over night as i could not imagine walking around with it for so many hours. So applying it and going off to sleep was the easiest method. Remove it in the morning. It may hurt a bit like you are removing a band aid or a sticker but thats a minimal pain. You will see the difference in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I will not suggest you go all out and use all the wraps within a week as that way your results may not last too long. But rather use this weekly or alternate week, It will take time but there will be results. I was  lucky to receive this for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a body wrap, so I was not sure what to expect.  As I am getting older, and had a late in life baby, I seem to be getting a lot of extra inches and cellulite.  So I figured this was worth a try.  I used to have a nice firm buttock, but age has not been good to me, so I want to correct that.  So I put this on once a week after my shower, and keep it on for several hours.  And I am amazed to say that I am starting to tell a difference.  It makes you firm up and is helping to get rid of that awful cellulite.  I would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I tried one application for 8 hours on my chin and stomach... I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but I did expect some type of change and saw nothing... I would have had the same results applying tape to my chin and stomach... I&#x27;m going to use the rest of the pack but I will not be buying more...</li>
            <li> Seems like to work, but not a big noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure I saw the results, worked a little but will not re-order again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all after religious use.</li>
            <li> These patches/wraps are very easy to use and they do not leave any sticky residue behind.  I used them on my buttocks even though they say you can use them in various places.  The only thing that I would change about the wraps is to make them in different sizes because people have different size butts.  The wraps did smooth and tighten my skin but I feel like they didn&#x27;t cover enough of my buttocks (I am of average size).  So, as a result I had to place the wraps just right and in slightly different places each time I used them to get the best results.  These would also be great on the thighs for summer time!&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I hate it!! burns for many hours, bad idea if you decide to take a shower to remove it. feels like you are on fire!</li>
            <li> did not work, no changed noticed. And I do eat healthy and workout. would love a refund!</li>
            <li> No,  they don&#x27;t work.  No changes noticed.</li>
            <li> When I did order this wrap through a great deal to share my honest opinion I was very curious to say the least to see if it did work. I live in Hawaii so beach is a weekly activity for me. I did a light body scrub before I applied because I wanted the best results possible. The wrap applies easily like a sticker and is also removed easily. It might sound funny but it felt  very refreshing after the application. Although I already knew is not a miracle treatment I was just amazed after my first application how much smoother and less bumpy my behind was, the orange peel look has diminished significantly and looks more tight. Pretty happy with this wrap and now a believer that they do work! I am sure that with diet and exercise combined I will finally be more confident every time I take my kids to the beach this summer!</li>
            <li> did not really do anything but feel cool.  no effect</li>
            <li> never try ist sound very interestin planing to buy  firt time but ilike how is work on my friend body let you know later how  is work promess</li>
            <li> This are so small and they did nothing to me! It make no sense just to put it in the middle of you but !!!ðŸ‘Žnever buying this again</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even keep them on for more than 1/2 an hour. Made my skin very irritated and itchy to the point where I had to take it off. And it hurt to remove. Like a VERY strong bandaid. I did not see any results. Maybe my skin is just sensitive to them but I have never had an issue like that before.</li>
            <li> Finally had my baby and was able to try this! I was left with some cellulite on my thighs postpartum and these patches seem to be clearing that up well. I have only done two applications on each thigh and already see results! Plus I like the smell and the fact that they stick to your skin so no need to wrap them or worry about time sliding off.</li>
            <li> Legs starting burning 10minutes in. Thought I was going to have to take them off but I stuck it out and kept them on overnight...couldn&#x27;t really see results but will try again</li>
            <li> These patches are the most amazing things I have EVER seen!!!!!! I put them on one night before bed and lasted about an hour; the burning and tingling was so intense I couldn&#x27;t sleep nor sit still. I took them off until morning and tried again. Wow, big difference. I wore them during the day and I can say by butt looks so much better. Idk how long this will last but I hope forever!!  I wish they were bigger and had them in strips I.e. For the abdomen and love handles, inner thighs to wrap around to outer, and to run up and down the back of the leg. I did managed to wear them for 8-12 hours/day.The adhesive is amazing, doesn&#x27;t peel. I did change spots each time and put them on every other day.  My cellulite has Greatly reduced!!!! Skin is tighter, and over all looks skinnier. I would love too see what other products this company has.  Greatly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> These were very easy to use and I had forgotten I had them on. I used them on the sides of my thighs ( saddle bags as I call them) and I did notice a change, it was subtle by the measurements before and after.  Not anything crazy like a half inch, but a tiny change. It did lift though a little. I will be buying more</li>
            <li> I have to admit that when I received these body buttocks up wraps, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect  while using them. They come in a pack of five with two patches in each pack. You&#x27;re supposed to use these patches once every couple of days. The patches are very thin and very easy to apply to your skin and once they are on and you put your clothes back on, they stay on all day if that&#x27;s what you want to do. It is recommended to wear them for about four hours or so but I have one them all throughout the day. I have noticed the longer you wear them the more intense the heat you will feel throughout the day. They do not bother my skin and I have had no reactions from them. I really like the way that it feels on my thighs which is where I chose to apply them since this is my most problematic area. I have to admit that after one use I couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference while looking but I could feel a difference. After the 3rd session I did see some minimizing if my lumps and bumps. I do want to say that if you choose to wear these for and extended amount of time, be prepared to feel some pretty significant heat especially if you are sitting on them. It is a pretty neat feeling cause it feels like it is melting away the fat. I was sent this for review however it does not affect my thoughts, opinions or experiences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 of the packs and I seriously notice a difference. My pants are actually bigger. I&#x27;m not all toned up from it but I definitely look smaller. I was gratefully able to get this for a discounted price in return for an unbiased review and I&#x27;m really happy that I did. The reason I say that is bc I&#x27;m not one to spend lots of money on expensive products and probably would have never given this a try, but trying it has definitely proven to me that this would totally be worth the money. Warning** it&#x27;s not a permanent fix, however, if you are needing it to fit into an old dress or pants or you simply are going to and event where you want to look your BEST then this is without a doubt the answer! I&#x27;m not sure how it does it but it basically shrinks and tightens, kind of like eliminating some extra water weight. I would suggest doing this with a few days of fluid pills to get the maximum effect! Love the product, keep up the great work</li>
            <li> Honestly, after all disappointment in those chemical products, it is such a relief to find a product which actually works and has great natural ingredients in it. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible any more. I only use it during the day, applying 2 patches after my morning shower and keep it on for a few hours. This product is doing a fairly good job, and after I used it 4 times on the same area and the improvement certainly can be seen.  Finally, my cellulite is melting away.  I think as time progresses and a few more weeks, a few more patches, Iâ€™ll be able to notice more results. I am happy, once again my butt looks better, but there is more work to do there. So, I will continue to use this product, regardless of how long it takes. This stuff does actually work and with consistency, I can get to where I want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These patches very easy to use, they have some menthol scent, and it is not overpowering. During application these patches give cooling and warming sensations similar to icy hot patches. These patches are versatile, they can be applied to any problem areas including buttocks, abdomen, thighs, arms, and hips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In combination with working out and eating right it really is a miracle product for firming that last bit of loose skin. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one or two patches do not give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different. Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one treatment while others need to buy more than 4 pair of patches. Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Saw the difference after the first time. I loooove the way thy feel on my butt! Warm! I wear them at night or during the day and they ever fell. They stick very well and except for the warmth I can&#x27;t feel them. They kind of are like a second skin. Definitely recommend these! Will buy some more as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> Awesome results!!! Easy on the skin. Low maintenance. Easy to apply. Just follow the directions. Looking forward to ordering more to show my results. So far ive taken pictures of current results. I want to post all of them when I reach my goal!</li>
