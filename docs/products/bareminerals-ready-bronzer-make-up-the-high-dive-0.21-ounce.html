            <li>it&#x27;s so easy if you make a mistake to correct it</li>
            <li>Secondly, the reviews I read said that it was better suited for more of a fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am also happy with the list of clean and almost all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light</li>

            <li>Got this bronzer because first of all, I love the BareMinerals brand.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality, it feels like butter, its so soft.</li>
            <li>I had read another review (for a blond) which recommended The High Dive, and I&#x27;m glad I bought this color.  </li>
            <li>Might be a little bit darker than what I was looking for but still looks very natural and will be perfect for summer!</li>

            <li>This bronzer may be pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>When you blend it out on your face, it gives such a nice color.</li>
            <li>They seem to work and look more natural on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives my skin the right amount of color without looking washed out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange at all, it just gives you the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a light hand when using this product because it is highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your quick delivery, needed this product for an approaching wedding and is perfect for the day and now as my everyday make up.</li>
            <li>Bought this for price was real good but the color of this product was so wrong for my color.</li>
            <li>Most days I only apply it once</li>
            <li>Love use it everyday, Bare Minerals is great, no chemicals and actually helps improve your skin.</li>
            <li>With my light skin, I look pretty pale most of the time, and even blush doesn&#x27;t help that much.  </li>
            <li>This really does make me look normal!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As usual Bare minerals is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I ordered it based on reviews saying that it would be dark but works really well on light skin.</li>
            <li>You can go for a very natural bronzed look or</li>
            <li>I like it - Nice for giving color to skin after a long winter, but it&#x27;s very dark</li>
            <li>and I am completely amazed how this product works.  </li>
            <li>and so far, I have not had this problem with the bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a Light in the powder foundation of Bare Minerals and so I ordered the High Dive.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals bareMinerals READY(tm) Bronzer in \\&quot;The High Dive\\&quot; shade is so silky-light that even I can look like a golden girl without appearing as though I was left in the oven for too long!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have the initial breakout that I get sometimes after switching to a new cosmetic.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and got it and was surprised at first how dark it is.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased this bronzer along with the new foundation from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews note it does look dark - and I would have thought too dark for my blonde hair and fair skin tone -</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals makeup is oh so forgiving...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to put it on pretty heavy to make it look un-natural.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend introduced me to bareMinerals and I love it.  I not only use it as bronzer but as blush all year round.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it lasts long so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it. It is easy to use and covers all flaws and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this as folks said it was not too dark--but I find it very dark for my medium skin-- I know it&#x27;s a good product-but will not be using</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer and will continue ordering. The product is so good on my skin and I didn&#x27;t even have the initial breakout that I get sometimes after switching to a new cosmetic. It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t make me look overly or fake tan.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your quick delivery, needed this product for an approaching wedding and is perfect for the day and now as my everyday make up. Thank YOU!! AAA+++</li>
            <li> I used to be a klutz when it came to using a bronzer to add a touch of sun to my pale complexion. I am not a sun-worshiper, so I never have a suntan. The few times in the past that I attempted to apply a bronzer made me look like a gingerbread cookie! Bare Escentuals bareMinerals READY(tm) Bronzer in \\&quot;The High Dive\\&quot; shade is so silky-light that even I can look like a golden girl without appearing as though I was left in the oven for too long! Unscented, anti-aging softly sunny faux-glow keeps you cool and gives you more time for real fun in the sun!</li>
            <li> I have an olive, tan complexion &amp; the color is great! I may order a step darker next time. This is the best blush I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth the price &amp; it stays on all day giving my face a healthy looking natural glow.</li>
            <li> Bought this for price was real good but the color of this product was so wrong for my color. So I won&#x27;t be taking a chance on color products.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer.  It is a great product.  I like it much better than the powder bronzer.  It&#x27;s cleaner to us and does a great job.  Most days I only apply it once but if I&#x27;m going somewhere later I will apply it again. The color looks darker than it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> As usual Bare minerals is a good choice. Love their product as it does not clog pores and their concealer is fairly good.</li>
            <li> Just like you would purchase it from Ulta. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> My sister had this bronzer and I fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s really light and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of ingredients in it.  The color looks really good with my tan skin and adds color to my pigment.  I don&#x27;t use foundation or anything, just a tinted SPF BB cream.  Sometimes I can look really pale so this bronzer added the perfect touch without looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> This bronzer may be pricey but it&#x27;s worth it. It lasts a long time and it provides a slight bronzed look for any skin tone. I&#x27;ve used it after tanning...and I&#x27;ve also used it when I hadn&#x27;t gone tanning in months. It looks great either way. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this bronzer along with the new foundation from Bare Minerals and I am completely amazed how this product works.  It looks extremely dark in pictures I had seen and in the case itself and I was concerned if it would be too dark.  I ordered it based on reviews saying that it would be dark but works really well on light skin. And it does.  I usually use a Light in the powder foundation of Bare Minerals and so I ordered the High Dive.  It is fantastic!!! I will not use another blush/bronzer.  I&#x27;m sold. It gives my skin the right amount of color without looking washed out.  Bare Minerals makeup is oh so forgiving...it&#x27;s so easy if you make a mistake to correct it and so far, I have not had this problem with the bronzer.  It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange at all, it just gives you the right amount of color. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am light blond, with a fair complexion.  I had read another review (for a blond) which recommended The High Dive, and I&#x27;m glad I bought this color.  I wear Medium in Bare Minerals color, and this bronzer is perfect to just add a bit more &amp;#34;suntan&amp;#34; color.  You&#x27;d have to put it on pretty heavy to make it look un-natural.  It looks really dark in the case, but after I&#x27;ve put all my makeup on, I swirl the brush over the compact and go over my forehead, over my nose and cheeks, and chin, about 2-3 times.  All it does is give a warm (very faint) color.  With my light skin, I look pretty pale most of the time, and even blush doesn&#x27;t help that much.  This really does make me look normal!!</li>
            <li> I like it - Nice for giving color to skin after a long winter, but it&#x27;s very dark and I do need to rub it off a bit with tissue afterwards to ensure its not too Artificial looking.</li>

I took a chance and got it and was surprised at first how dark it is. I used it on my skin and I love it. When you blend it out on your face, it gives such a nice color. Do not be scared of the initial color in the pan. I do have to use a light hand when using this product because it is highly pigmented. Amazing quality, it feels like butter, its so soft. Love that my skin loves it and the benefits it has for it. I will definitely purchase this again, because I know it&#x27;ll last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear make up so this is great I don&#x27;t feel like I have make up on!!!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer, it is light -- never looks caked on and its buildable! You can go for a very natural bronzed look or but on a few more layers for a dramatic look. Best of all it&#x27;s NOT orange so it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake tan. I am also happy with the list of clean and almost all natural ingredients.</li>

            <li> Love use it everyday, Bare Minerals is great, no chemicals and actually helps improve your skin. What else can I say.</li>
            <li> Great color and goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews note it does look dark - and I would have thought too dark for my blonde hair and fair skin tone - but it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful once you put it on! Feels great on your skin,  color is perfect!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this in very good time but have not used it so I cannot tell about its use.  I do like Bareminerals makeup products.  They seem to work and look more natural on my skin.  I love the pressed powder!</li>
