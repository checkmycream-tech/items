            <li>Works great as a frizz reducer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,HOLDS UP GREAT!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Great price for fabulous product for ultra curly hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair turned out but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just because of the way she did my hair.</li>
            <li>Curls look perfect and natural, not wet-look either.</li>
            <li>I love Wave Foam - my unruly hair is curly and neat.</li>
            <li>Great and fast service.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure to shake the bottle well.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it via Prime, got it in two days, and I love it.</li>
            <li>(this is important to me and my spouse who has to tolerate it), works fantastic as it gives hold, controls frizz and is not crunchy.</li>
            <li>It has an overly sweet orange smell, like a creamsicle but even sweeter.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural wave through my hair and with the right curl enhancer, it turns into a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>This turns my messy waves into beautiful shaped curls.</li>
            <li>works so very well for my fine hair</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested this product for me even though I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>If it can control my hair it is worth every cent</li>
            <li>Too many times I&#x27;ve had mousse that works but stays crunchy, or is soft but my curls fall out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the dependable service!</li>
            <li>and I love the curls in the back.  </li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t terribly strong so you may want to spritz with a little hairspray, but in the end you&#x27;ll have curls that follow your wave pattern with no crunch :)</li>
            <li>At first I was unclear and not sure I loved it</li>
            <li>My hair came out really</li>
            <li>have used other kms products w no problems - this just isn&#x27;t right for my fine, tho lots of it, wavy hair</li>
            <li>I used other products then realized I was in love.</li>
            <li>Like any new product I needed to adjust how much I put in my hair, so I can&#x27;t really rate it on its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that tends to be messy and stringy, and I love this foam!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and using this product calms the wild look!</li>
            <li>I order this product every few months and love the service and product.</li>
            <li>Just use a tiny bit and it curls right up.</li>
            <li>Put it in your hair right after a shower, scrunch and shape the curls, then leave alone to dry.</li>
            <li>Keeps my natural curls curly, but eliminates the frizz.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of curl naturally that I wanted to enhance and this does it.</li>
            <li>The KMS Foam Mousse makes the curls soft (not crunchy or frizzy)</li>
            <li>After I get dressed, I scrunch my curls with my hands, and they become soft.</li>
            <li>So when I found it on here I went ahead &amp; purchased it, and was pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the products is a gel that turns into a mousse, so it REALLY can make your hair crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells and generally cannot tolerate scented products but</li>
            <li>When it starts getting old or low, it doesn&#x27;t foam up as well, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it in general.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, short hair</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair, but somewhat thick.  </li>
            <li>Really made nice thick curls, but final hair texture was a little stiff.</li>

            <li> Really made nice thick curls, but final hair texture was a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand having to smell that all day long!</li>
            <li> It does define the curls but it leaves your hair sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> Once dry</li>
            <li> I use a diffuser on my hair in order to allow my loose curls to form.  </li>
            <li> I put this in my (not soaking wet) hair, and dry it with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I just fluff out with a brush.</li>
            <li> I only used about a dime size and it still made my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> gel makes my curls too hard and mouse usually isn&#x27;t enough so this does everything I need product for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry that I had a hard time getting a brush through my hair every morning.  </li>
            <li> I use a little bit of Argon or Moroccan oil &amp; break the &amp;#34;crunchy cast&amp;#34; as you scrunch with the oil.  </li>
            <li> I use a round brush on my bangs.  </li>
            <li> and it dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel greasy and heavy, my face breaks out because the product on my hair touches my face.</li>
            <li> The curls are a little stiff, but I leave them while I finish my makeup.</li>
            <li> I usually like KMS products</li>
            <li> I now have 3 bottles of a product that makes my hair dull and sticky.  </li>
            <li> my husband even started using this and loves for his thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Obviously I am not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I tried KMS CurlUp as an alternative for my curl enhancing mousse that is hard to find and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m using it wrong</li>
            <li> Was extremely disappointed</li>

            <li> Great product! If it can control my hair it is worth every cent and it does.</li>
            <li> works so very well for my fine hair</li>
            <li> this is genius! gel and mouse in one!! it&#x27;s perfect for my curly hair! gel makes my curls too hard and mouse usually isn&#x27;t enough so this does everything I need product for my hair. my husband even started using this and loves for his thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I love Wave Foam - my unruly hair is curly and neat. And I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> This is my second can of this product. At first I was unclear and not sure I loved it - I used other products then realized I was in love. It smells great (this is important to me and my spouse who has to tolerate it), works fantastic as it gives hold, controls frizz and is not crunchy. I will continue to purchase!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Could not even get the mouse to come out of the can. Was extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> I usually like KMS products but this missed the mark. It does define the curls but it leaves your hair sticky and dry. I do agree with another reviewer that mixing it with oil helps. I will use it in this manner but I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Keeps my natural curls curly, but eliminates the frizz.</li>
            <li> I ordered curl up mousse and received wave up.  I now have 3 bottles of a product that makes my hair dull and sticky.  Obviously I am not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Just use a tiny bit and it curls right up. I have a bit of curl naturally that I wanted to enhance and this does it. Also, if you run your fingers through your hair after it dries, the stiffness goes but the curl stays.</li>
            <li> I use a diffuser on my hair in order to allow my loose curls to form.  I use a round brush on my bangs.  The KMS Foam Mousse makes the curls soft (not crunchy or frizzy) however they hold without hairspray.  The next day when I don&#x27;t wash my hair the steam from the shower perks up the curls again.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product for me even though I have fine, straight hair. It gives my hair body and makes it feel and look thicker. I am sensitive to smells and generally cannot tolerate scented products but the fragrance of this product does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Really made nice thick curls, but final hair texture was a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I tried KMS CurlUp as an alternative for my curl enhancing mousse that is hard to find and very expensive.  I have fine blonde hair, but somewhat thick.  I have a natural wave through my hair and with the right curl enhancer, it turns into a nice curl.  I used the KMS CurlUp for a couple weeks and it dried out my hair.  My hair was frizzy and the curl disappeared.  My hair was so dry that I had a hard time getting a brush through my hair every morning.  This product didn&#x27;t work for me and I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great and fast service. I order this product every few months and love the service and product. Thanks for the dependable service!</li>
            <li> This is great if you have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  Yes, I love it.  I have naturally curly, short hair and I love the curls in the back.  I just fluff out with a brush.</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m using it wrong but it makes my hair heavy. have used other kms products w no problems - this just isn&#x27;t right for my fine, tho lots of it, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that tends to be messy and stringy, and I love this foam! Too many times I&#x27;ve had mousse that works but stays crunchy, or is soft but my curls fall out. I put this in my (not soaking wet) hair, and dry it with a diffuser. The curls are a little stiff, but I leave them while I finish my makeup. After I get dressed, I scrunch my curls with my hands, and they become soft. This turns my messy waves into beautiful shaped curls. I always make sure to shake the bottle well. When it starts getting old or low, it doesn&#x27;t foam up as well, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it in general. After I spray it in my hand, I do wait 10 seconds or so while it converts to the foam.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel greasy and heavy, my face breaks out because the product on my hair touches my face. I only used about a dime size and it still made my hair heavy. It did not curl my hair, it did not create curls, the only thing it did well was banish my frizz. Works great as a frizz reducer.</li>
            <li> I used this once but I will never use it again.  Like any new product I needed to adjust how much I put in my hair, so I can&#x27;t really rate it on its effectiveness.  I will never use this again because of the smell.  It has an overly sweet orange smell, like a creamsicle but even sweeter.  I couldn&#x27;t stand having to smell that all day long!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended it, but didn&#x27;t have any left at her salon. I didn&#x27;t want to fuss trying to find it somewhere else so I ordered it via Prime, got it in two days, and I love it. Put it in your hair right after a shower, scrunch and shape the curls, then leave alone to dry. Curls look perfect and natural, not wet-look either.</li>
            <li> I recently had a Deva Cut and I use all the Deva Curl products, but when I had my hair done, my stylist used this product.  I loved the way my hair turned out but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just because of the way she did my hair. So when I found it on here I went ahead &amp; purchased it, and was pleasantly surprised at the results.  My hair came out really good!&lt;br /&gt;Now the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the products is a gel that turns into a mousse, so it REALLY can make your hair crunchy.  The way I used it that worked for me was to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; it onto my hair and then scrunch AND use a diffuser.  Once dry I use a little bit of Argon or Moroccan oil &amp; break the &amp;#34;crunchy cast&amp;#34; as you scrunch with the oil.  The hold isn&#x27;t terribly strong so you may want to spritz with a little hairspray, but in the end you&#x27;ll have curls that follow your wave pattern with no crunch :)</li>
            <li> Great price for fabulous product for ultra curly hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,HOLDS UP GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and using this product calms the wild look! I tried a lot of product over the years and I&#x27;ll stick with this one for now.</li>
