            <li> Personally, I think this soap is really perfect for oily skin. After washing my face, I can feel the absolute cleanliness.</li>
            <li> great soap always use it</li>
            <li> Love this soap, great for oily to combo skin. Keeps breakouts at bay. Well-balanced facial soap, which I&#x27;ve used for years and appreciate not having to run to the mall for it when I run out. One bar lasts approx. 6 months, so this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really clear skin with an occasional hormonal pimple or two.  However, when I recently deployed to Afghanistan, my forehead turned into an oily mess.  My routine washing and products weren&#x27;t cutting it.  I&#x27;ve had this soap for about three weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference.  Finally the disgusting eruption is starting to clear and I am beginning to look and feel more like myself.</li>
            <li> have used this product for over 10 ears. skin in great condition. when I use the entire 3 step it&#x27;s &amp;#34;flawless.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily, no acne, no problems. I have allergies to many other products which is why I have stuck with this one for well over 10 years since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use and it&#x27;s for good reason. It totally eliminates deeply rooted oil and surface dirt as well. It also leaves my face tingly and refreshed without overdrying the skin. My face has a glow because of the lack of blackheads and blemishes. It seems to even the tone of my face as well.</li>
            <li> My acne has been a problem since high school and I am in my mid 20&#x27;s. I have used just about every product out there but nothing helped with my oily skin except this! My face is not oily anymore and my acne has cleared up after 2 weeks! I also used to get pimples that wouldn&#x27;t break the surface of my skin until I would get really stressed and then my face was basically all breakouts but this took care of them :) I highly recommend this product to anyone who has oily skin and acne problems!</li>
            <li> Soap is Great, I have been using it for years. Don&#x27;t change the formula. Only thing I hate is the case. It pops open, doesn&#x27;t stay closed. I like the old slide-out design better, as it protected soap better.</li>
