    <ol>
            <li>Best one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with your product.  </li>
            <li>Great improvement!</li>
            <li>The texture and consistency are perfect.</li>
            <li>Thank you MyChelle for a superb product!</li>
            <li>The best moisterizing suncreen that I have tried!</li>
            <li>This is the best sunblock.</li>
            <li>I have never burned using this sunscreen and as I said I have very fair skin (redhead)</li>
            <li>This line is great</li>
            <li>I liked the cosmetic finish, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>If this kind of texture doesn&#x27;t bother you, I&#x27;d recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>This is the sunblock that you want to use on your babies and children, and it is the best I have found for an adult too.  </li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen that I have ever tried by far.</li>
            <li>The first couple times in using this sunscreen on my face worked great.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin and need to wear sunscreen on my face every day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many sunscreens on my face and they all end up either giving me a rash or burning my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this sunblock as I&#x27;ve read so many great things about it.  </li>
            <li>I guess I had better keep looking...</li>
            <li>but unlike most zinc sunscreens it&#x27;s invisible.</li>
            <li>and she said that the meds she had me on (doxacycline and Retin-A) should have made it somewhat better.</li>
            <li>it feels firmer and more supple.</li>
            <li>I never run out of this stuff, I&#x27;ve found what works for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I also put it on for bed, and wake up with a smooth face!</li>
            <li>Whatever this smells like -- seems fragrance-free to me -- I love it.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is best suited for a daily wear to work, as it is invisible and lightly moisturizing without being at al greasy, but no stinging or drying your skin.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on chemical free sunscreens that don&#x27;t clog pores, this one came up on top and lived up to expectations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take along and you can carry it on a plane.</li>
            <li>And isn&#x27;t going to easily absorb into skin like the micro-mineral stuff.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is good product for someone whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, fair with freckles</li>
            <li>This facial sunblock is easy to rub in, non-greasy or oily (which is great for me because I sometimes break out), and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>This one gets an excellent review because it is a sunblock that does not have the harsh chemicals, parabens.  </li>
            <li>Another that I like for my body is Alba mineral (fragrance free or kids).</li>
            <li>night I use juice beauty oil free moisturizer over the hyluronic aid and eye cream instead.</li>
            <li>It works well with light make-up.</li>
            <li>Its not very shiny so it would be great for a guy to use.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers, I am very fair-skinned, and I have never burned while using this product.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive reviews, but want to add this: true to the description on the label, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>It absorbed on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I like using natural, safe products</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I still think this is a good product, but a couple of caveats:  I think it might lead to occasional breakouts; and even if I rub it in really well</li>
            <li>So far this winter, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using MyChelle Sun Shield SPF 28 with ZinClear.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a high level of zinc oxide, which provides better full spectrum protection than titanium dioxide and it is photostable unlike many chemical sunscreens (so as long as it doesn&#x27;t sweat or rub off</li>
            <li>The first tube I bought in a store near me for $17, so when it runs out I will look online for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2014:  </li>
            <li>and it actually kind of stays in my skin even after washing, so that my skin looks dry for days afterward.  </li>
            <li>I love MyChelle products overall.  </li>
            <li>I can feel a mineral type of scent at first</li>
            <li>A basic search of pore clogging ingredients turns up coconut oil at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>In addition, you recently changed the container to a better type of plastic and the shape of the container is sleeker and easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first sunblock I&#x27;ve ever found that has no adverse impact on  my skin or on my makeup.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it&#x27;s a barrier sunscreen rather than the chemical type that is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to switch from ProActiv to an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for many of the same reasons others have written about.</li>
            <li>It also acts more like a moisturizer, going on clear and giving a soft, dewy appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>Somewhat safer compared to chemical sunscreens for daily use (Good for a day with moderate sun exposure).  </li>
            <li>At first she thought it was purely hormonal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a broad spectrum sunblock as well which means that it protects well against a large range of UVB and UVA wavelengths of light.    </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with minimal effort, is a great primer for liquid foundation, and I think it has improved the appearance of my skin in the few years I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It does apply smoothly and without a white film (unlike so many physical sunscreens).</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the sunsceeen that I will be replacing all of my old products and starting fresh with a Mychelle regime of skincare.</li>
            <li>I use this as my moisturizer during the day over my eye cream ( juice beauty) and a  pure hyluronic acid on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>one positive it that this is very MATTE.</li>
            <li>Most facial sun protection is either too white, too oily or too full of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely faithful to this product as my SPF moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but it absolutely throws off my foundation</li>
            <li>I am very picky with spf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle sun screen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that compared to other SPF this feels a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>and I live in California!</li>
            <li>A two-pack every six months subscription discount on Amazon good enough for me for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>It does sweat off if you are doing heavy outdoor activity though so either re-apply often or go with a greasy but more sweat resistant lotion.     </li>
            <li>Although it has a bit low SPF level compare to others I used to have, it is perfectly absorbed into the skin and works well with makeup.</li>
            <li>While coconut oil has many benefits, it can indeed clog pores as any fatty acid will.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply generously, and re-apply every few hours.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most physical sunscreens you do not see the obvious white sheen on your face (due to the nano-particles* - more on that later)  </li>
            <li>It seemed to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; quickly in the fourth or fifth time and turn white.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for the sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I showed her the products I was using, the Clear Skin Acne cleanser, Pumpkin Renew Cream and Sun Shield.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that it had this effect because I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>One look at the ingredients tells the real answer: coconut oil is the third ingredient.</li>
            <li>when i use this spf on my face very sparingly I still get a white cast.</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients &amp; it had no fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>so it is completely invisible on my skin,  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts, and this is the first and only facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used where I can apply it right on my upper eyelids, and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes and give me intense pain, like every other sunscreen (all the natural/organic ones, that is!)</li>
            <li>Not good for pro-longed use (more on this below)    </li>
            <li>There has been new research that nano particles such as the zinc dioxide nano particles may damage your DNA ([...])  </li>
            <li>I hope I am right and that my skin flares will go down.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that has the safety profile I&#x27;m looking for and a clear matte finish.</li>
            <li>Finally, a sunscreen I can wear every day, under make-up, absorbs immediately, no white-ish cast, and my skin feels softer and smoother as an added unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Interestingly enough, I&#x27;ve noticed a year later, that the new, current packaging no longer states \\&quot;Does not clog</li>
            <li>It was rated highly on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website as it contains no carcinogens and minimal toxins</li>
            <li>My face used to get red (allergic reaction) with other products, but now I can wear as much sunblock as I want.</li>

            <li> My face used to get red (allergic reaction) with other products, but now I can wear as much sunblock as I want.</li>
            <li> and BTW I am usually guessed to be in my early 40&#x27;s because I have no wrinkles at all other than minor laugh lines.</li>
            <li> The area around my chin and neck had insanely bad cystic acne, the kind where you press a blemish and it would hurt because of all the stuff inside (gross!)</li>
            <li> Regardless, I think those are minor issues compared to getting a matte coverage sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time to find a sunscreen for sensitive facial skin without the harmful, negative ingredients that doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> I also have to moisturize well before applying, as the sunscreen itself otherwise tends to highlight my dry patches.</li>
            <li> In the winter-time my face gets very dry</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s impossibly for a sunblock to be completely free of toxins and actually work).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a moisturizer, so if your skin is very dry you may need a moisturizer as well.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 58 and began using sunscreen daily (and I mean EVERY day) since I was 29. I have tried many, many sunscreens on my face and they all end up either giving me a rash or burning my eyes. This product does neither and protects well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and BTW I am usually guessed to be in my early 40&#x27;s because I have no wrinkles at all other than minor laugh lines. WEAR YOUR SUNSCREEN GIRLS!!</li>
            <li> Dried my face and made me peel! I liked the cosmetic finish, but I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned skinned 30-something redhead.    I tried using it on my body, but it&#x27;s not water resistant and ran in little white rivulets.     Very sad. :(</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen cream. It absorbed on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. The price is reasonable. Each tube lasted for two months.</li>
            <li> This facial sunblock is easy to rub in, non-greasy or oily (which is great for me because I sometimes break out), and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  In the summer, I use this as a moisturizer after washing my face in the morning and then reapply if I&#x27;m in the sun for extended periods.      It was rated highly on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website as it contains no carcinogens and minimal toxins (it&#x27;s impossibly for a sunblock to be completely free of toxins and actually work).  It&#x27;s a broad spectrum sunblock as well which means that it protects well against a large range of UVB and UVA wavelengths of light.    Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this sunblock as I&#x27;ve read so many great things about it.  However, I was really disappointed, after using it for about 2-3 weeks, I found that it really dries out my skin and it actually kind of stays in my skin even after washing, so that my skin looks dry for days afterward.  I was also surprised that it had this effect because I have oily skin.  I guess I had better keep looking...</li>
            <li> I love MyChelle products overall.  This one gets an excellent review because it is a sunblock that does not have the harsh chemicals, parabens.  I mix this with Mychelle moisturizer and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s easy to take along and you can carry it on a plane.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that has the safety profile I&#x27;m looking for and a clear matte finish. It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break out. Sun Shield is zinc based and doesn&#x27;t contain the usual chemical suspects like PABA, avobenzone,  oxybenzone, etc. but unlike most zinc sunscreens it&#x27;s invisible. It&#x27;s also scentless. Not only can I wear it at work without anyone knowing, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes during athletic activities. This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that has all the features I want.</li>
            <li> I like using natural, safe products and I wanted a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I bought this to use as my daily sunscreen.  This sunscreen appears to be a quality product, didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin, didn&#x27;t cause break-outs, and protected my skin.  However, it&#x27;s just to heavy for me.  I have oily skin and it felt too thick on my face.  Trying to apply makeup over it was a nightmare.  Even on my arms and hands, it felt sticky and I would immediately wash my hands when I went inside.    If this kind of texture doesn&#x27;t bother you, I&#x27;d recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> The first couple times in using this sunscreen on my face worked great. It seemed to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; quickly in the fourth or fifth time and turn white. I am not sure if this is due to the lack of preservatives in the product of if I got a \\&quot;bad batch\\&quot; or what. I still continued to use to (second tube) on my arms and chest. This line is great and I used the other products!</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen daily on my face and hands/arms. I have very sensitive skin, fair with freckles so I am concerned about sun aging and cancer, from daily sun exposure driving or walking around at lunch time. This sunscreen has a high level of zinc oxide, which provides better full spectrum protection than titanium dioxide and it is photostable unlike many chemical sunscreens (so as long as it doesn&#x27;t sweat or rub off it will continue to protect your skin).     This sunscreen is best suited for a daily wear to work, as it is invisible and lightly moisturizing without being at al greasy, but no stinging or drying your skin. It does sweat off if you are doing heavy outdoor activity though so either re-apply often or go with a greasy but more sweat resistant lotion.     I have never burned using this sunscreen and as I said I have very fair skin (redhead) and I live in California!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time to find a sunscreen for sensitive facial skin without the harmful, negative ingredients that doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost.  Although it does give a slightly white cast, it isn&#x27;t greasy and can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> Although it has a bit low SPF level compare to others I used to have, it is perfectly absorbed into the skin and works well with makeup. I can feel a mineral type of scent at first but it goes away quickly. It is gentle enough for the sensitive skin and I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for many of the same reasons others have written about. I purchased a tube a year ago when the packaging was different and the phrase \\&quot;Does not clog pores\\&quot; was printed on the packaging. I did, however, notice that after use, the pores on the bridge of my nose were indeed clogged. Interestingly enough, I&#x27;ve noticed a year later, that the new, current packaging no longer states \\&quot;Does not clog pores\\&quot;. One look at the ingredients tells the real answer: coconut oil is the third ingredient. While coconut oil has many benefits, it can indeed clog pores as any fatty acid will. A basic search of pore clogging ingredients turns up coconut oil at the top of the list. Slightly skeptical now of a company that has quietly removed a once-touted benefit from their packaging.</li>
            <li> Best one and I&#x27;ve tried four others that were also least harmful chemically (in the cosmetics database). This one does not make you feel like a grease ball (probably due to the Zinclear). Does not make you look like a ghost. Does not make you smell like a bazaar. Does the job, and a little goes a long way. And isn&#x27;t going to easily absorb into skin like the micro-mineral stuff. A two-pack every six months subscription discount on Amazon good enough for me for everyday use. A little moisture lotion underneath helps due to some dryness effect, probably from the alcohol.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on chemical free sunscreens that don&#x27;t clog pores, this one came up on top and lived up to expectations.  Doesn&#x27;t look white or smell like sunscreen.  Be sure to apply generously, and re-apply every few hours.  Another that I like for my body is Alba mineral (fragrance free or kids).</li>
            <li> I was excited to switch from ProActiv to an all natural product. I&#x27;ve been using Mychelle for over 3 months and it has made my skin worse than it ever has been before. The area around my chin and neck had insanely bad cystic acne, the kind where you press a blemish and it would hurt because of all the stuff inside (gross!) I had to go to the derma to figure how how to keep my acne at bay. At first she thought it was purely hormonal (I had a baby a little over a year ago), but I went back to her today and she said that the meds she had me on (doxacycline and Retin-A) should have made it somewhat better. I showed her the products I was using, the Clear Skin Acne cleanser, Pumpkin Renew Cream and Sun Shield. She had said that they have oil in them and are not good for my skin. So I am back to the basics with Cera-Ve and Neutrogena. I have a feeling the Mychelle products were the culprit because I had just started them when the acne began. I hope I am right and that my skin flares will go down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with your product.  In addition, you recently changed the container to a better type of plastic and the shape of the container is sleeker and easier to hold.  Great improvement!</li>
            <li> I would recommend My Chelle Sun Shield SPF 28 to anyone who has any sensitivity to cosmetics.  This is the sunblock that you want to use on your babies and children, and it is the best I have found for an adult too.  Harmful ingredients are not found in this product.  My face used to get red (allergic reaction) with other products, but now I can wear as much sunblock as I want.</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency are perfect. I put it over my moisturizer and under my makeup. It&#x27;s the first sunblock I&#x27;ve ever found that has no adverse impact on  my skin or on my makeup. It is worth every penny and then some!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely faithful to this product as my SPF moisturizer. It goes on smooth with minimal effort, is a great primer for liquid foundation, and I think it has improved the appearance of my skin in the few years I&#x27;ve used it. I can definitely tell the difference in the skin on my neck--it feels firmer and more supple. I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction with it. In the winter-time my face gets very dry so I use a layer of moisturizer underneath this. No parabens, or sulfates. I never run out of this stuff, I&#x27;ve found what works for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a sunscreen I can wear every day, under make-up, absorbs immediately, no white-ish cast, and my skin feels softer and smoother as an added unexpected bonus. I am so pleased with the sunsceeen that I will be replacing all of my old products and starting fresh with a Mychelle regime of skincare.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive reviews, but want to add this: true to the description on the label, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes! I wear contacts, and this is the first and only facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used where I can apply it right on my upper eyelids, and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes and give me intense pain, like every other sunscreen (all the natural/organic ones, that is!) that I&#x27;ve tried. Price is a factor, so like another reviewer, I use MyChelle only on my face. ears, and neck and use Goddess Garden on the rest of my body. Like many reviewers, I am very fair-skinned, and I have never burned while using this product. It also acts more like a moisturizer, going on clear and giving a soft, dewy appearance to my skin. Thank you MyChelle for a superb product!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen that I have ever tried by far. I have oil skin in the summer and this helps my skin stays matt. My dark spots don&#x27;t get darker unlike other sunscreens I tried. Definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> when i use this spf on my face very sparingly I still get a white cast. Its not clown white but it absolutely throws off my foundation (and i use very expensive foundation that matches my skin very well). I also don&#x27;t like how heavy and sticky it feels. Keep in mind that compared to other SPF this feels a whole lot better. I am very picky with spf. I have very oily skin and cannot stand oily, greasy, heavy, tacky, sticky, sweaty spf. This is not the worst but its not the best. I will not be repurchasing this simply because it makes my face whiter and i cannot use this on my neck because it makes me feel like i need a shower. one positive it that this is very MATTE. Its not very shiny so it would be great for a guy to use. But for the price, i would rather spend it on neutra gena ultra sheer.</li>
            <li> I use this as my moisturizer during the day over my eye cream ( juice beauty) and a  pure hyluronic acid on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It protects from sun and seals in the hyluronic acid. I don&#x27;t need any extra oil on my checks, forehead, chin or nose, yet I do need sun protection. Most facial sun protection is either too white, too oily or too full of toxic chemicals. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I use juice beauty oil free moisturizer over the hyluronic aid and eye cream instead.</li>
            <li> I use this unscented, environmentally-safe sun screen on my face.  It&#x27;s a gentle sun screen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago at Sprouts Farmer&#x27;s Market for $18.99. It has natural ingredients &amp; it had no fragrance in it. There was a coconut scented one, but I don&#x27;t want any fragrance on my face because it can irritate the skin. It is a little thick, and it rubs on clear and not greasy like a lot of other brands. My face was definately moisterized even when I put some powder over it. It works well with light make-up. I also put it on for bed, and wake up with a smooth face! The best moisterizing suncreen that I have tried!</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for over 3 years. Let me list the pros and cons:    Pros:  1. Somewhat safer compared to chemical sunscreens for daily use (Good for a day with moderate sun exposure).  2. Unlike most physical sunscreens you do not see the obvious white sheen on your face (due to the nano-particles* - more on that later)  3. Not oily    Cons:  1. There has been new research that nano particles such as the zinc dioxide nano particles may damage your DNA ([...])  2. Not good for pro-longed use (more on this below)    Overall I like using this sunscreen for just casual days that I don&#x27;t expect to spend too much time in the sun (ie: commuting to the office). It doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and it protects against moderate UV exposure. However, I do not recommend this if you plan to spend a day at a sunny beach. I got sun burned after spending a few hours at a Northern California beach on a sunny day (I did not sweat). After that incident I still use this sunscreen but switch to the chemical ones for those occasions that I go to the beach or take a run outdoors. Also, note that this is not a moisturizer so you can immediately apply this over your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin and need to wear sunscreen on my face every day.  I&#x27;ve had an impossible time finding one that&#x27;s matte and doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny at all, but this is the one! It has the extra bonus of being unscented.  It&#x27;s white in the tube but you cannot see it at all once you rub it in.  I also really like that it&#x27;s a barrier sunscreen rather than the chemical type that is absorbed by the skin.  It&#x27;s not really a moisturizer, so if your skin is very dry you may need a moisturizer as well.  The first tube I bought in a store near me for $17, so when it runs out I will look online for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2014:  I still think this is a good product, but a couple of caveats:  I think it might lead to occasional breakouts; and even if I rub it in really well so it is completely invisible on my skin,  it seems to rub off and leave a white residue on my cell phone (from resting it against my cheek) and on some clothing.  Regardless, I think those are minor issues compared to getting a matte coverage sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out... I am sure it is good product for someone whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to everything. This is the best sunblock. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and it keeps my dark spots away.</li>
            <li> So far this winter, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using MyChelle Sun Shield SPF 28 with ZinClear. It does apply smoothly and without a white film (unlike so many physical sunscreens). My only gripe is that my skin feels slightly rubbery, a bit sticky, if you will, after application, and that the product has a tendency to dry into small clumps if I don&#x27;t apply it carefully. I also have to moisturize well before applying, as the sunscreen itself otherwise tends to highlight my dry patches. Whatever this smells like -- seems fragrance-free to me -- I love it.</li>
