            <li> Great company. Stands behind it&#x27;s product. Much more natural looking then colored adhesives.!!</li>
            <li> They are not real hair very fake and plasticky lashes. I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for years these are horrible.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these, better than I expected, and a great bargain. I still like variety, but these are the best I have tried so far form amazon. Definitely a re-purchase waiting to happen! Can&#x27;t wait to try some other styles.</li>
            <li> I received my lashes today in the mail. I was happy they came before the expected date. But very disappointed to see they looked nothing like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Horrible lashes does not look Like what&#x27;s online disappointed!</li>
            <li> The lashes don&#x27;t look exactly as shown on the picture, the band is transparent but the section of lashes are group so close that you barely see the transparent band. They are very soft, easy to apply and they look very natural. The item arrived before the ETA and that makes a client very happy. Their customer service department is on point replying almost instantly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, unbeatable price for 10 pairs of lashes and free shipping. I will be buying again for me and sisters.</li>
            <li> .These are every bit as good as the lashes that cost more at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on.they look great on!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two similar products unknowingly. One from amazon and the other from another site. I was so relieved that this is what I got. I dislike the other one. These ones are more natural looking and the stems are actually clear.</li>
            <li> The band is thin and the lashes are comfortable to wear....at this price, I rarely feel the need to reuse them, however, they do hold up nicely for multiple uses</li>
            <li> Excellent price arrived ahead of schedule. Looks exactly like the picture. I&#x27;m pleased with the order.</li>
            <li> i hate it so much! it&#x27;s not as light looking as the picture i&#x27;m not sure what are they made of plastic? it looks so cheap and ugly on the eye it&#x27;s like i&#x27;ve worn a toy lashes. idk how to describe it. please invest in nice lashes you can actually wear more than once like huda beauty or lily lashes.</li>
            <li> The best EVER!!!  THEY LOOK SO REAL.  I JUST BOUGHT 3 MORE boxes Really thin and transparent Very easy to work with, and I&#x27;m just learning how to wear them</li>
            <li> For the natural, non dramatic look perfect for every day wear</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I received wrong lashes but its was still pretty close to the picture, and They work perfectly.</li>
            <li> lashes look nothing like photo shown these are really bad never again buying cheap lashes what a mistake</li>
            <li> I did not like the lashes..the strip of da lash was thick and  uncomfortable, some of da lashes had glue on them prior to me openin them..disapointed wit these lashes..</li>
            <li> I am only giving one star because I did not recieve the right product. Other than that the band seems to be thin and wearable and the lashes dont seem like they will fall apart. Just didnt get the right ones that I really wanted</li>
            <li> very nice if I wanted ones this long.  too long for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give a one for at least receiving something! Not happy! The ones I recieved are completely different then these. These say transparent band, but the ones I recieved are a black band, and the lashes are not the same. If I wanted drag queen lashes, that&#x27;s what I would if ordered! So not happy!</li>
