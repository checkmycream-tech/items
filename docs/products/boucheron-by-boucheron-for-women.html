            <li>Well, my problem is that it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like the parfum I&#x27;ve been wearing for 15-20 years!  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>My Mom and I love this fragrance!  </li>

            <li>Love this Eau De Parfum!</li>
            <li>we all love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and sensual and somewhat earthy.  </li>
            <li>Cost was fair and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>I have always liked Boucheron by Boucheron.</li>
            <li>Nice purchase</li>
            <li>I use this perfume and was very happy to find it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>(Smelling good is VERY important to me, and no matter what else is going on in my life, if I smell nice, it all seems better, somehow.)  </li>
            <li>Perfume is beautiful and price is right.</li>
            <li>Been wearing Boucheron for many years and this was the absolute best price I ever found for the Eau de Parfum!</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery and a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for selling it for a great price and for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very strong</li>
            <li>Before my wedding many years ago I went into Nordstrom&#x27;s  looking for a nice fragrance to wear on my wedding day.</li>
            <li>Good high quality product in a very nice container.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy to have found the real deal here on Amazon and happier yet about the price!</li>
            <li>Definitely a memorable scent that stands out.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer it to many famous vintage perfumes like Shalimar and Chanel 5.It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and always get so many compliments from both men and women.  </li>
            <li>The perfect perfume for daily wear or any occasion.</li>
            <li>Totally in love with&lt;br /&gt;the scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have worn for years.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>It gets me so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>If you love Boucheron but need a break on the price of it, get this.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when I wear it, from both men and women.  </li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume and men</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most often described as oriental, spicy, and floral.  </li>
            <li>This one is definitely more like Chanel No. 5 or Coco by Chanel - musky and sensual, is how I would describe it.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance - have worn it for years.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>The men love this scent on me.  </li>
            <li>Just have to spray it on more often.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Boucheron is available , thank you !</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this perfume..</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and have worn it for years as my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li>I like it , I love it</li>
            <li>, I want some more of it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and so does my mother.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and have been wearing it everywhere.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a powdery smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, so I thought I would return 1 after it arrived and put up with the inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others before and after, but nothing to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite parfum, it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li>One of my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrances....</li>
            <li>I love this smell..</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing the oils, but I had to step out and get the next best thing.</li>
            <li>it was my 1st amazon purchase &amp; many more to come...</li>
            <li>Boucheron has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Admired by many...</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It has been an all time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I love waking up to it on my sheets and smelling it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I make sure lovers like it before I where it when sex could happen.</li>
            <li>AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
            <li>This perfume is exquisite, it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My favorite and 1/2 the cost at the fine department stores that sell it.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the perfume, which stays better than the eau de parfum , but this is fine.</li>
            <li>and i was happy and surprised with the price and the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about this Eau De Parfum all good.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle and received a full set of lotion and shower gel too!</li>
            <li>Goes on strong and within 15 minutes, its gone.  </li>
            <li>Still available and much more reasonably priced, and the reviews are pretty great.  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Shame on me for not reading the fine print on returning (or not returning perfumes).  </li>
            <li>Super price from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Go to a reputable retailer and you will purchase the real Boucheron, not a knock-off!!</li>
            <li>Product as advertised thanks!!!</li>
            <li>This is a classic perfume for the sophisticated and  elegant lady.  </li>
            <li>It will certainly make a fine replacement for my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m pleased to report that this Boucheron eau de parfum is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I give this product five stars because it is original and the quality exceeds the price.  </li>
            <li>ITS THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it so easy and affordable to buy!  </li>
            <li>I put it on before I go to bed to make me and my bed smell so sexy, lovely and alive.  </li>
            <li>is the celebration of class,beauty and living life to the full.</li>
            <li>Tangy, mandarine spicy yet sweetly feminine.</li>
            <li>One reviewer called the fragrance \\&quot;sweet and billowy,\\&quot; but I disagree.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for my being able to purchase online.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money, but I have been wearing Boucheron for 20 yrs and since it has been taken over by another company I do not think the sent is the quite the same.</li>
            <li>I always receive countless accolades about how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>This is the most rich, elegant, womanly perfume ever created.  </li>
            <li>otimo product, quickly , thank delivery .</li>
            <li>The price here is very reasonable, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>When I exhaust my current supply, I will order more!</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.  </li>
            <li>Since I was so in love with Trouble, I thought I&#x27;d try Boucheron by Boucheron to see if I liked it as well.  </li>
            <li>I perfer crisp or oriental spice to sweet and billowy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
            <li>Love this classy perfume.  </li>
            <li>I have bought a few more bottles since that time because it is my favorite and was thrilled I could now purchase it at Amazon and at a considerably lower price than I paid in Paris all those years ago.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s nothing at all like Trouble, it&#x27;s still VERY nice.  </li>
            <li>Tried it online, and it still doesn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li>Again, not the right scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a spicy sweet seductive scent that men really like.  </li>
            <li>I find that this lasts a very long time - even at day&#x27;s end there is still a nice scent</li>
            <li>(EDP is superior; it has about twice the amount of fragrance and less alcohol).</li>
            <li>I have loved Boucheron for about&lt;br /&gt;20 years, but the cost has frequently held me back.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time we ordered</li>
            <li>Boucheron is an outstanding French fragrance that I have worn for years.  </li>
            <li>First purchased at a duty-free shop in Athens, Greece ~2004.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vendor!!</li>
            <li>It was my first order on amazon and already have ordered another product.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal when you consider you will pay at least $150 in a department store (if you can even find it).  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the parfum before but always bought from a store locally.</li>
            <li>box and cellophane wrapping looked authentic enough but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>Still like it, just not as much!</li>
            <li>IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,  </li>
            <li>My husband first purchased Boucheron for me after we started dating.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Boucheron in Paris.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, last long, sweet!  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was nice.</li>
            <li>A bit of a warning - it seems to be sensitive to light and starts to smell sour more quickly than some other perfumes I have had unless I store it away from light.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It has a very upscale fragrance</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>(not to be confused with Eau de Toilette which is a more diluted form and therefore requires more when applying...)</li>
            <li>It smelled so old !!!</li>
            <li>smells a bit different from the original</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this purfume than any other I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>My very favorite in a long long time!</li>
            <li>Its sweet and billowy that earmarks French perfume.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING HARDER TO FIND</li>
            <li>This is a classic natural fragrance that consistently delivers.</li>
            <li>I had spent over an hour scouring the duty free stores on a recent trip for this, and could find only the eau de toillette form, for far more than the price of this eau de parfum!</li>
            <li>At Macy&#x27;s, this retails for over $100, so I&#x27;m so glad I could find it on here for much less.</li>
            <li>A classic that I have worn since it was launched.  </li>
            <li>more recently got a vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume as a man magnet.</li>
            <li>I tried a few other very nice scents, but got a lot of backlash from family members and friends who associate this fragrance with me.</li>
            <li>Once you have smelled one French perfume,  you pretty much have got the jist of all of them.</li>
            <li>Boucheron edp should normally smell.  </li>
            <li>And with free shipping--you can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than the eau de toilette, but worth it because they smell very different on.</li>
            <li>Maybe my dog will be sporting a new scent....</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The Orange blossom,ylong ylong,and sandalwood make such a masterpiece together with their entourage of bergamot ,sweet mandarin,Amber...that I can not get enough of.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s half the price and the same type of smell and lasts just as long-maybe three hours the most.</li>
            <li>Love it same as I buy in the store except a lot less money.</li>
            <li>While I will desperately miss my Trouble and the compliments I received whenever I wore it, I am pretty sure this will do quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just ordering the perfume, but was pleasantly surprised when I received a box set with lotion and body wash.</li>
            <li>Firstly, eau de parfum arrives in a sealed purple box and it is NOT marked tester.  </li>
            <li>It is sexy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other discount sites, but it doesn&#x27;t smell right and presumably is a knock-off.</li>
            <li>and I thought;, well, since it was pricey I would try and wear it for a while to see if the smell would calm down into something that I could stand..</li>
            <li>Absolutely no where near the real Boucheron.  </li>
            <li>Tried emailing Boucheron directly to ask whether the formulation has changed, and I&#x27;ve never heard back.  </li>
            <li>This Boucheron eau de parfum is authentic and from what I read, if you question it Amazon stands behind all thier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always wary of buying perfume online, because you ever know if you&#x27;re going to get the real thing or a cheap, smelly knock off.</li>
            <li>It is the same exact perfume for much less than in the store.</li>
            <li>I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING, AND IF YOU WERE NOT AWARE - MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING IS NOT HAZARDOUS OR FLAMMABLE.  </li>

            <li> Well, my problem is that it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like the parfum I&#x27;ve been wearing for 15-20 years!  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> My Mom and I love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, cannot believe the amount I saved buying it online!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this Eau De Parfum!</li>
            <li> we all love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm and sensual and somewhat earthy.  </li>
            <li> Cost was fair and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I have always liked Boucheron by Boucheron.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase</li>
            <li> I use this perfume and was very happy to find it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> (Smelling good is VERY important to me, and no matter what else is going on in my life, if I smell nice, it all seems better, somehow.)  </li>
            <li> Perfume is beautiful and price is right.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Boucheron for many years and this was the absolute best price I ever found for the Eau de Parfum!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling it for a great price and for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on very strong</li>
            <li> Before my wedding many years ago I went into Nordstrom&#x27;s  looking for a nice fragrance to wear on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Good high quality product in a very nice container.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy to have found the real deal here on Amazon and happier yet about the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely a memorable scent that stands out.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer it to many famous vintage perfumes like Shalimar and Chanel 5.It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and always get so many compliments from both men and women.  </li>
            <li> The perfect perfume for daily wear or any occasion.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with&lt;br /&gt;the scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have worn for years.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> It gets me so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> If you love Boucheron but need a break on the price of it, get this.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments when I wear it, from both men and women.  </li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume and men</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most often described as oriental, spicy, and floral.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely more like Chanel No. 5 or Coco by Chanel - musky and sensual, is how I would describe it.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance - have worn it for years.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> The men love this scent on me.  </li>
            <li> Just have to spray it on more often.</li>
            <li> I am glad that Boucheron is available , thank you !</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this perfume..</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and have worn it for years as my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li> I like it , I love it</li>
            <li> , I want some more of it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and so does my mother.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent and have been wearing it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a powdery smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, so I thought I would return 1 after it arrived and put up with the inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many others before and after, but nothing to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfum, it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrances....</li>
            <li> I love this smell..</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing the oils, but I had to step out and get the next best thing.</li>
            <li> it was my 1st amazon purchase &amp; many more to come...</li>
            <li> Boucheron has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> Admired by many...</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It has been an all time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I love waking up to it on my sheets and smelling it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I make sure lovers like it before I where it when sex could happen.</li>
            <li> AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE.</li>
            <li> This perfume is exquisite, it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My favorite and 1/2 the cost at the fine department stores that sell it.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the perfume, which stays better than the eau de parfum , but this is fine.</li>
            <li> and i was happy and surprised with the price and the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about this Eau De Parfum all good.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle and received a full set of lotion and shower gel too!</li>
            <li> Goes on strong and within 15 minutes, its gone.  </li>
            <li> Still available and much more reasonably priced, and the reviews are pretty great.  </li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Shame on me for not reading the fine print on returning (or not returning perfumes).  </li>
            <li> Super price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Go to a reputable retailer and you will purchase the real Boucheron, not a knock-off!!</li>
            <li> Product as advertised thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is a classic perfume for the sophisticated and  elegant lady.  </li>
            <li> It will certainly make a fine replacement for my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m pleased to report that this Boucheron eau de parfum is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because it is original and the quality exceeds the price.  </li>
            <li> ITS THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it so easy and affordable to buy!  </li>
            <li> I put it on before I go to bed to make me and my bed smell so sexy, lovely and alive.  </li>
            <li> is the celebration of class,beauty and living life to the full.</li>
            <li> Tangy, mandarine spicy yet sweetly feminine.</li>
            <li> One reviewer called the fragrance \\&quot;sweet and billowy,\\&quot; but I disagree.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for my being able to purchase online.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, but I have been wearing Boucheron for 20 yrs and since it has been taken over by another company I do not think the sent is the quite the same.</li>
            <li> I always receive countless accolades about how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> This is the most rich, elegant, womanly perfume ever created.  </li>
            <li> otimo product, quickly , thank delivery .</li>
            <li> The price here is very reasonable, too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> When I exhaust my current supply, I will order more!</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.  </li>
            <li> Since I was so in love with Trouble, I thought I&#x27;d try Boucheron by Boucheron to see if I liked it as well.  </li>
            <li> I perfer crisp or oriental spice to sweet and billowy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
            <li> Love this classy perfume.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a few more bottles since that time because it is my favorite and was thrilled I could now purchase it at Amazon and at a considerably lower price than I paid in Paris all those years ago.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s nothing at all like Trouble, it&#x27;s still VERY nice.  </li>
            <li> Tried it online, and it still doesn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li> Again, not the right scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a spicy sweet seductive scent that men really like.  </li>
            <li> I find that this lasts a very long time - even at day&#x27;s end there is still a nice scent</li>
            <li> (EDP is superior; it has about twice the amount of fragrance and less alcohol).</li>
            <li> I have loved Boucheron for about&lt;br /&gt;20 years, but the cost has frequently held me back.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time we ordered</li>
            <li> Boucheron is an outstanding French fragrance that I have worn for years.  </li>
            <li> First purchased at a duty-free shop in Athens, Greece ~2004.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this vendor!!</li>
            <li> It was my first order on amazon and already have ordered another product.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal when you consider you will pay at least $150 in a department store (if you can even find it).  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the parfum before but always bought from a store locally.</li>
            <li> box and cellophane wrapping looked authentic enough but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> Still like it, just not as much!</li>
            <li> IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,  </li>
            <li> My husband first purchased Boucheron for me after we started dating.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Boucheron in Paris.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, last long, sweet!  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was nice.</li>
            <li> A bit of a warning - it seems to be sensitive to light and starts to smell sour more quickly than some other perfumes I have had unless I store it away from light.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It has a very upscale fragrance</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> (not to be confused with Eau de Toilette which is a more diluted form and therefore requires more when applying...)</li>
            <li> It smelled so old !!!</li>
            <li> smells a bit different from the original</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this purfume than any other I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> My very favorite in a long long time!</li>
            <li> Its sweet and billowy that earmarks French perfume.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING HARDER TO FIND</li>
            <li> This is a classic natural fragrance that consistently delivers.</li>
            <li> I had spent over an hour scouring the duty free stores on a recent trip for this, and could find only the eau de toillette form, for far more than the price of this eau de parfum!</li>
            <li> At Macy&#x27;s, this retails for over $100, so I&#x27;m so glad I could find it on here for much less.</li>
            <li> A classic that I have worn since it was launched.  </li>
            <li> more recently got a vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this perfume as a man magnet.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other very nice scents, but got a lot of backlash from family members and friends who associate this fragrance with me.</li>
            <li> Once you have smelled one French perfume,  you pretty much have got the jist of all of them.</li>
            <li> Boucheron edp should normally smell.  </li>
            <li> And with free shipping--you can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than the eau de toilette, but worth it because they smell very different on.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dog will be sporting a new scent....</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The Orange blossom,ylong ylong,and sandalwood make such a masterpiece together with their entourage of bergamot ,sweet mandarin,Amber...that I can not get enough of.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s half the price and the same type of smell and lasts just as long-maybe three hours the most.</li>
            <li> Love it same as I buy in the store except a lot less money.</li>
            <li> While I will desperately miss my Trouble and the compliments I received whenever I wore it, I am pretty sure this will do quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just ordering the perfume, but was pleasantly surprised when I received a box set with lotion and body wash.</li>
            <li> Firstly, eau de parfum arrives in a sealed purple box and it is NOT marked tester.  </li>
            <li> It is sexy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other discount sites, but it doesn&#x27;t smell right and presumably is a knock-off.</li>
            <li> and I thought;, well, since it was pricey I would try and wear it for a while to see if the smell would calm down into something that I could stand..</li>
            <li> Absolutely no where near the real Boucheron.  </li>
            <li> Tried emailing Boucheron directly to ask whether the formulation has changed, and I&#x27;ve never heard back.  </li>
            <li> This Boucheron eau de parfum is authentic and from what I read, if you question it Amazon stands behind all thier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of buying perfume online, because you ever know if you&#x27;re going to get the real thing or a cheap, smelly knock off.</li>
            <li> It is the same exact perfume for much less than in the store.</li>
            <li> I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING, AND IF YOU WERE NOT AWARE - MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING IS NOT HAZARDOUS OR FLAMMABLE.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and says that she only needs to use very little of it when putting it on so it has last a long time for her.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get shipped to you.</li>
            <li> It does not distingiush itself from any other French perfume ive ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> However, the fragrance is not the same, it does not smell like all my other bottles.  </li>
            <li> For A Very Long Time.</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer than it does</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I am now stuck with this bottle that cannot be returned due to Amazon&#x27;s policy.  </li>
            <li> I usually order the smaller size but the 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I really wonder if it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> Never lets me down.</li>
            <li> As the price went up and the availability went down</li>
            <li> If you want to spend half the money, may I suggest getting Marina De Bourbon</li>
            <li> I am wearing the parfum now but feel it is not as I remember from a previous purchase.</li>
            <li> However, it can get a little pricey in the department stores</li>
            <li> I ordered this parfum because I previously wore Trouble by Boucheron, but it has simply gotten so expensive and hard to find that I&#x27;ve had to find another fragrance to wear daily.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and get tons of compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li> It is a heavy scent</li>
            <li> Usually, the fragrance will linger on my skin all day, but this is gone within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is hard to find in department stores.</li>
            <li> but it is getting hard to find...</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and was a little skeptical when I sprayed some on.  </li>
            <li> The does not get rank after several hours.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and only use it when I am not trying to impress.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 STAR PRODUCT, GET IT, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> ITS FAKE SAVE</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive in department stores I had to ration it to myself.  </li>
            <li> Two seconds after I realized that I had ordered 2 instead of 1, I tried to modify the order and was unable to do so.  </li>
            <li> I would accept one of the two factors since I did order wrong.  </li>
            <li> well, needless to say that did not happen.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews on this product and some of them are crazy.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because this product was discontinued it is bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I am Very disappointed!!!.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> However, combined it is the worst experience that I have ever had on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Well when I received my order it smelled horrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this parfum because I previously wore Trouble by Boucheron, but it has simply gotten so expensive and hard to find that I&#x27;ve had to find another fragrance to wear daily.  (Smelling good is VERY important to me, and no matter what else is going on in my life, if I smell nice, it all seems better, somehow.)  Since I was so in love with Trouble, I thought I&#x27;d try Boucheron by Boucheron to see if I liked it as well.  Still available and much more reasonably priced, and the reviews are pretty great.  Can&#x27;t hurt to try.  While it&#x27;s nothing at all like Trouble, it&#x27;s still VERY nice.  It will certainly make a fine replacement for my favorite.  I just sprayed it on myself when my package arrived and now I can&#x27;t stop sniffing.  It&#x27;s warm and sensual and somewhat earthy.  Definitely a memorable scent that stands out.  While I will desperately miss my Trouble and the compliments I received whenever I wore it, I am pretty sure this will do quite nicely.</li>
            <li> My favorite and 1/2 the cost at the fine department stores that sell it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those scents that will never disappear into oblivion.The Orange blossom,ylong ylong,and sandalwood make such a masterpiece together with their entourage of bergamot ,sweet mandarin,Amber...that I can not get enough of.I do not know why it is not as known as Chanel No.5 but I prefer it to many famous vintage perfumes like Shalimar and Chanel 5.It is the celebration of class,beauty and living life to the full.I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is different. Maybe they have changed formula.</li>
            <li> item arrived in good shape and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> have worn Boucheron for over 20 years It&#x27;s my perfume.!!</li>
            <li> This order was canceled</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition. Cost was fair and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> Great I keep buying my wife keeps being happy</li>
            <li> This is very French indeed.  It does not distingiush itself from any other French perfume ive ever smelled.  Its sweet and billowy that earmarks French perfume.  I pefer Italian to French because of that reason. Once you have smelled one French perfume,  you pretty much have got the jist of all of them. I perfer crisp or oriental spice to sweet and billowy.  It&#x27;s all a matter of preference.  If you want to spend half the money, may I suggest getting Marina De Bourbon, It&#x27;s half the price and the same type of smell and lasts just as long-maybe three hours the most.</li>
            <li> Well, my problem is that it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like the parfum I&#x27;ve been wearing for 15-20 years!  Purchased it locally at Macy&#x27;s and had to return it.  Tried it online, and it still doesn&#x27;t smell right.  Don&#x27;t know what to do.  Tried emailing Boucheron directly to ask whether the formulation has changed, and I&#x27;ve never heard back.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> The Nite nite 😍🙋😍🙋Nite nite 😍🙋😍🙋</li>
            <li> Boucheron Eau De Parfum for Women is my \\&quot;signature fragrance.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years, and always get so many compliments from both men and women.  People always ask me, \\&quot;What perfum are you wearing?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The perfect perfume for daily wear or any occasion. Not over powering at all. I receive compliments every day I wear this.</li>
            <li> Product came in perfect conditions and time and nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spray package .. wonderful scent .</li>
            <li> Been wearing Boucheron for many years and this was the absolute best price I ever found for the Eau de Parfum! (not to be confused with Eau de Toilette which is a more diluted form and therefore requires more when applying...)</li>
            <li> smells a bit different from the original</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I thought I was just ordering the perfume, but was pleasantly surprised when I received a box set with lotion and body wash. Before my wedding many years ago I went into Nordstrom&#x27;s  looking for a nice fragrance to wear on my wedding day. This was the perfume the sales associate pointed me to because it is a &amp;#34;timeless fragrance.&amp;#34; To this day I can&#x27;t find another fragrance I like as well as this one. I get lots of compliments while wearing this and that is just a plus. The item arrived on time and I was happy to receive the lotion and body wash as a bonus!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews on this product and some of them are crazy.  Firstly, eau de parfum arrives in a sealed purple box and it is NOT marked tester.  This Boucheron eau de parfum is authentic and from what I read, if you question it Amazon stands behind all thier customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that, that has been said, the timeframe of receiving this product was amazing, the price is the best I&#x27;ve ever heard of or seen on the internet. Checkout the Internet and you&#x27;ll ultimately return to Amazon, I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Bocheron since it came on the market in 1988 and the price has constantly gone up year after year.  This is a 5 STAR PRODUCT, GET IT, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. Just checkout Macy&#x27;s current price.  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two top perfumes that come from Framce are Boucheron and Joy by Jean Patou.  Get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Boucheron is consistently&#x3D;fabulous!</li>
            <li> wonderful! I have always liked Boucheron by Boucheron. Totally in love with&lt;br /&gt;the scent. Never lets me down.</li>
            <li> I looked around for this perfume and i was happy and surprised with the price and the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Love it same as I buy in the store except a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s Christmas present.</li>
            <li> My Mom and I love this fragrance!  She was very happy when she opened it this Christmas!  Good price too!</li>
            <li> Maybe because this product was discontinued it is bad.  I have used this product for years and have never had a bottle like this one.  It goes on very strong and then it is gone.  Usually, the fragrance will linger on my skin all day, but this is gone within 30 minutes.  I would have returned it, but since I knew the fragrance, I threw away the packaging.  I really wonder if it was a fake.  What a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Floral fantasy!!! My very favorite in a long long time!</li>
            <li> Very good service. Came on time. Product matching the publicity. Good price. It&#x27;s the first time we ordered&lt;br /&gt;with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to have the same service in some future orders. Thank you,  Charles</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the perfume, have received lots of compliments. Delivery was very prompt. I give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, cannot believe the amount I saved buying it online!  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> A classic that I have worn since it was launched.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have worn for years.  It has a spicy sweet seductive scent that men really like.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> They smell different from the ones I bought at Dillards.</li>
            <li> Great price, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume--and the best price on the internet!  And with free shipping--you can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than the eau de toilette, but worth it because they smell very different on.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It gets me so many compliments.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of buying perfume online, because you ever know if you&#x27;re going to get the real thing or a cheap, smelly knock off. Well, I&#x27;m pleased to report that this Boucheron eau de parfum is exactly what it says it is. It smells great and lasts all day long. At Macy&#x27;s, this retails for over $100, so I&#x27;m so glad I could find it on here for much less. If you love Boucheron but need a break on the price of it, get this. It is the same exact perfume for much less than in the store. And it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to get shipped to you.</li>
            <li> Product supplied as advertised in the correct time frame.</li>
            <li> Boucheron is an outstanding French fragrance that I have worn for years.  First purchased at a duty-free shop in Athens, Greece ~2004.  I receive many compliments when I wear it, from both men and women.  It is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price for Boucheron.  .</li>
            <li> What can I say - Boucheron is wonderful. Tangy, mandarine spicy yet sweetly feminine. I wish it would last a little longer than it does but it&#x27;s worth owning.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and a good bargain. What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. It is like liquid heaven. It is sexy and a little goes a long way. It is also the only perfume that lasts all day and that I can actually smell on myself even when I just use the smallest amount. I LOVE this perfume and men seem to love it too!!! Thank you Amazon for selling it for a great price and for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> I lept at the chance to buy this on Amazon.  I had spent over an hour scouring the duty free stores on a recent trip for this, and could find only the eau de toillette form, for far more than the price of this eau de parfum! (EDP is superior; it has about twice the amount of fragrance and less alcohol). I find that this lasts a very long time - even at day&#x27;s end there is still a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  One reviewer called the fragrance \\&quot;sweet and billowy,\\&quot; but I disagree. It&#x27;s most often described as oriental, spicy, and floral.  (I think of a \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; perfume as being Tresor, or Coco Mademoiselle).  This one is definitely more like Chanel No. 5 or Coco by Chanel - musky and sensual, is how I would describe it.  The official recommendation is for \\&quot;evening wear,\\&quot; but I wear it all the time!  Intoxicating. . .)</li>
            <li> The best price, the fasted delivery and the realthing, no immitation brands here. I highly recommend this vendor!!</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS SCENT FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS.  HAVE NOT USED ANYTHING ELSE!!!!</li>
            <li> Boucheron? Scent is not what I remember. Seriously, I am Very disappointed!!!.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance - have worn it for years.  Thanks for making it so easy and affordable to buy!  It was my first order on amazon and already have ordered another product.</li>
            <li> That was for my wife and we are very happy becouse promotes romantic nights and attracts me a lot...she knows how to use it.....Good price and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> My wife puts it on every day Loved the smell.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> The men love this scent on me.  I always get compliments.  I bought the shower gel, too--love that as well.  I can dance all night, and still smell so good the guys can&#x27;t help but sniff me.  Highly recommend this perfume as a man magnet.</li>
            <li> otimo product, quickly , thank delivery .</li>
            <li> I would prefer the perfume, which stays better than the eau de parfum , but this is fine. Just have to spray it on more often. Delivery and packaging were perfect . I am glad that Boucheron is available , thank you !</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance...have worn it for years and never tire of it...nor do my friends.  Don&#x27;t change, please.</li>
            <li> Hello to the world of the %%</li>
            <li> The notes in this fragrance are pleasant and longlasting.  The does not get rank after several hours.  I especially like to wear it for an evening affair.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this perfume.  She receives compliments from friends and strangers as to how attractive the perfume is.</li>
            <li> Best value on the market for the genuine Boucheron Eau De Parfum.  This is a classic perfume for the sophisticated and  elegant lady.  Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> My brother loved it .&lt;br /&gt;For me , it is a good parfum but not the best one.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quickly -- love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume ever since my niece brought it back from visiting a friend in France and it has become my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; fragrance. As the price went up and the availability went down I tried a few other very nice scents, but got a lot of backlash from family members and friends who associate this fragrance with me. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other discount sites, but it doesn&#x27;t smell right and presumably is a knock-off. I am extremely happy to have found the real deal here on Amazon and happier yet about the price! Way to go Amazon - you&#x27;ve made me a very happy shopper yet again!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance. Can never get enough!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this perfume..I was a Coco Mademoiselle girl for years... Nice purchase</li>
            <li> I have really loved this perfume for over 15 years, and this was a sequel purchase as I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This is the most exquisite perfume ever. I have worn it since it came out. People always compliment me and ask the name of it. The price here is very reasonable, too!</li>
            <li> Great Authentic Perfume At A Great Price !&lt;br /&gt;Would Buy Again. Have Been Wearing This&lt;br /&gt;Classic Floral Perfume For A Very Long Time.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it.  She wanted this brand specifically, and was very happy with my when I gave it to her....</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and have worn it for years as my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.  I wear it everyday and get tons of compliments all the time.  However, it can get a little pricey in the department stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like it , I love it , I want some more of it. My baby puts this on and I give it a 10 pole , very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this classy perfume.  It has a very upscale fragrance and I love it and so does my husband.  It is a great deal when you consider you will pay at least $150 in a department store (if you can even find it).  A great buy!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is hard to find in department stores. Thanks Amazon for my being able to purchase online. Love this Eau De Parfum!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the parfum before but always bought from a store locally. I am wearing the parfum now but feel it is not as I remember from a previous purchase. Good price, but I think I will go back to the local store and compare fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and so does my mother.  I bought if for her for Christmas because it is one of her favorites.  Really good.</li>
            <li> I use this perfume and was very happy to find it at such a great price.  Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have been wearing it everywhere. I do wish it would last longer than it does.</li>
            <li> ITS FAKE SAVE YOU MONEY</li>
            <li> excellent she loved it</li>
            <li> This perfume is exquisite, it lasts for a long time.  This is the best price I have seen it for anywhere.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of stated date.  Completely satisfied.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and was a little skeptical when I sprayed some on.  It didn&#x27;t smell they way Boucheron edp should normally smell.  But I thought I would give it another try this morning.  Again, not the right scent.  I have worn Boucheron for over 10 years and know how it should smell....and how it should linger hours after application; even the following morning. Whatever is in the bottle I received does neither.  This is more of a powdery smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box and cellophane wrapping looked authentic enough but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better.  I am now stuck with this bottle that cannot be returned due to Amazon&#x27;s policy.  Shame on me for not reading the fine print on returning (or not returning perfumes).  I got what I paid for...$55 of perfume that I do not like.  Maybe my dog will be sporting a new scent....I will call it....BowWow-cheron.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  Goes on strong and within 15 minutes, its gone.  Absolutely no where near the real Boucheron.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Company says the formula has been revised and resold?  Go to a reputable retailer and you will purchase the real Boucheron, not a knock-off!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, elegant perfum spray.  Super price from Amazon! I have loved Boucheron for about&lt;br /&gt;20 years, but the cost has frequently held me back.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume and have used it for years but it is so expensive in department stores I had to ration it to myself.  A bit of a warning - it seems to be sensitive to light and starts to smell sour more quickly than some other perfumes I have had unless I store it away from light.  The bottle I have now has lasted over a year without &amp;#34;decomposing&amp;#34; at all, but I keep it in a drawer between uses instead of on the counter.</li>
            <li> Two seconds after I realized that I had ordered 2 instead of 1, I tried to modify the order and was unable to do so.  I do not understand why as I have modified orders before, especially if it was before it was shipped.  OK, so I thought I would return 1 after it arrived and put up with the inconvenience.  I did order 2 by mistake after all.  When it arrived, I started to go through the return process and found out that I cannot return it since it is flammable.  I would accept one of the two factors since I did order wrong.  However, combined it is the worst experience that I have ever had on Amazon.  I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING, AND IF YOU WERE NOT AWARE - MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING IS NOT HAZARDOUS OR FLAMMABLE.  Amazon, if you actually see this, check the logs.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, but I have been wearing Boucheron for 20 yrs and since it has been taken over by another company I do not think the sent is the quite the same. I used to get compliments daily and that changed when the company changed!  Still like it, just not as much!</li>
            <li> great buy and find too</li>
            <li> Good high quality product in a very nice container.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years.....but it is getting hard to find...I was so glad to find it on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I met this perfume 15 years ago. I have tried so many others before and after, but nothing to compare.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> This is a classic natural fragrance that consistently delivers. It remains my favorite. I will order again and again - and again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfum, it met all my expectations. I was happy with pricing &amp; delivery. When I exhaust my current supply, I will order more!</li>
            <li> me encanta llego en el tiempo esperado todo bien graciaas . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I have worn the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Boucheron scent for 20 years and my husband also likes the scent.  Have used both the eau de toilette and the eau de parfum, went with the eau de parfum this time because the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfume is beautiful and price is right.</li>
            <li> IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,  THANK YOU BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING HARDER TO FIND AND IT IS THE ONLY PARFUM MY WIFE LIKES.  REGARDS,  JL GAUMONT</li>
            <li> great...love the smell</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered this product from years ago. Arrived on time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I  was so upset when this product arrived. I had heard so much about this Eau De Parfum all good. Well when I received my order it smelled horrible...you could not even use it as a air freshner. It smelled so old !!! and I thought;, well, since it was pricey I would try and wear it for a while to see if the smell would calm down into something that I could stand..well, needless to say that did not happen. I now have bought it and I am stuck with it...</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrances....we all love it!</li>
            <li> My friend told me that I should have known about this fragrance but I hadn&#x27;t. I love this smell.. Wow! Wow! I have been purchasing the oils, but I had to step out and get the next best thing. Price was up my alley.</li>
            <li> My husband first purchased Boucheron for me after we started dating.  We have been together for 24 years and I still wear it.  I get more compliments on this purfume than any other I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> I have worn Boucheron for years and always had compliments on my perfume.  I usually order the smaller size but the 3.4 oz. was such a bargain I felt I could not pass on.  However, the fragrance is not the same, it does not smell like all my other bottles.  I was very disappointed and only use it when I am not trying to impress.</li>
            <li> wife loved it ...it was my 1st amazon purchase &amp; many more to come...more recently got a vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> My mother loves this scent but I was looking for the refill cartridge not a spray bottle.  Other than that it was nice.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a deal. I ordered a bottle and received a full set of lotion and shower gel too! The perfume itself is multifaceted and so beautiful</li>
            <li> My ultimate!....smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> best women perfume ever!</li>
            <li> Boucheron has been my favorite for years. It is subline.</li>
            <li> Brought some for my Mom who always spoke about it. She absolutely loves it and says that she only needs to use very little of it when putting it on so it has last a long time for her. I brought this years ago and she&#x27;s still using the same bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, last long, sweet!  Admired by many...I wear daily to work or out on the town &#x3D;) I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.  This is my 3rd bottle</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Boucheron in Paris.  At that time that was the only place it was sold.  I have bought a few more bottles since that time because it is my favorite and was thrilled I could now purchase it at Amazon and at a considerably lower price than I paid in Paris all those years ago.</li>
            <li> Love-Love-Love this fragrance!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because it is original and the quality exceeds the price.  Try it you like it</li>
            <li> It has been an all time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I have used this parfum for years.  It is one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrances.  I always receive countless accolades about how good I smell.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> Tres elegante. This is the most rich, elegant, womanly perfume ever created.  I put it on before I go to bed to make me and my bed smell so sexy, lovely and alive.  I love waking up to it on my sheets and smelling it in my hair.  It is a heavy scent so I make sure lovers like it before I where it when sex could happen.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised thanks!!!</li>
            <li> A very nice perfume - something you wouldn&#x27;t be ashamed to give your wife or girlfriend for her birthday - and Amazon has it at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Excelente, buen servicio y el perfume llego en muy buen estado.. Recomiendo este sitio para comprar de una manera facil</li>
            <li> MY MOTHER IN LAW WAS LOOKING FOR THIS PERFUME FOR A WHILE AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE. SHES VERY HAPPY WITH IT ITS NOT A KNOCK-OFF ITS THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> Always loved Boucheron.  great scent at a great price!</li>
