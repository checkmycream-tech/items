            <li>Still very pleased with the results and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>And a great price you made my day.:-)</li>
            <li>and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I love the foam application!</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It was for my mom,she liked it.</li>
            <li>After 2 years,  I did my  own research and after 3 dermatologist whom agreed to use Rogaine her bald spot has shown hair growth.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>(that is where I needed the most improvement).</li>
            <li>It means more hair).</li>
            <li>It works so well that I  bought two more.  </li>
            <li>I switched from the Rogaine liquid to this foam because once per day use instead of twice seemed appealing.</li>
            <li>i like the drops better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but it works I love this product</li>
            <li>I am sure the chemical make-up would be identical.  </li>
            <li>I likes the ease of application of the foam much better than the liquid.</li>
            <li>It is better to part the hair and then apply the product so it gets a better distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had time to use it, it takes 6 weeks or more, just move out of</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but you have to take it  for 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>I am at a point where even if don&#x27;t see anymore improvements and get to keep the improvements I have so far, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does not smell</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>it was to strong for my scalp</li>
            <li>I was very surprised and happy that I saw results this quick.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night before going to bed and in the morning my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it for 2 months and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>and as I say it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>This light picks up</li>
            <li>Liquid Romaine never gave me any problems and it works... would rather use a more gentle liquid than a strong foam...</li>
            <li>The front has filled in nicely and the crown area no longer shows bare scalp.  </li>
            <li>You have to give it time to see full growth.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>This does seem to help the foam not disintegrate so quickly by having cool fingertips.  </li>
            <li>So for now, I am very pleased with how easily it applies to my scalp, causes no irritation, and is showing very promising results in only one month.  </li>
            <li>This works well, but you have to take it twice a day for 6 months, and you have to be VERY consistent. .</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for almost 3 months now and am still very excited about the new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]</li>
            <li>It is worth he try.</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure and get it directly onto your scalp.</li>
            <li>As a side note,  I never had success with the  Rogaine liquid either.</li>
            <li>Takes a lot more time to get it directly on my scalp while trying to keep it out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]].</li>
            <li>The foam is easier to apply and only requires one application a day which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Hurrah!!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use and I can apply it and style my hair easily without a wait because the foam dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I see some really good progress on some parts and no progress in other parts.  </li>
            <li>He would come in and growl and scream to get out right after he ate.  </li>
            <li>You use your finger and hope the foam doesn&#x27;t melt before applying and that you get it on the right places.</li>
            <li>I find it easy to use, and the new hair that is growing is thicker and darker.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has more volume and when I wash it takes longer to dry it than it used to (which is a good sign.</li>
            <li>U wont be disappointed.just remember as ive said if you are already bald this product will not work for u. Its also a very good product for someone who has just cut their hair short and wants to grow it back faster.</li>
            <li>It is to early on to know whether this product will make a difference or not, but what I do know it is not sticky it is easy to use</li>
            <li>While my head of hair will never be as lush as it was when I was 35, after 10 weeks of regular use, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Sure enough!  </li>
            <li>I had hoped this would work better than the regular Women&#x27;s Rogaine.</li>
            <li>Bit the bullet and paid the higher price for the brand name made specifically for women.</li>
            <li>So much better than the generic brand.</li>

            <li>So much better than the generic brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that is really does work!</li>
            <li>Prior to that I had been using the liquid for a number of years successfully, I like the foam because it&#x27;s only once a day</li>
            <li>At first I tried the liquid, that needs to be applied 2x a day.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using it for almost six months now and can gladly say that I have noticed considerable new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It also seems like there is a lot less hair lost when washing it, which is a HUGE bonus :)</li>
            <li>Liked other Rogaine products but hadn&#x27;t tried foam.</li>
            <li>my forehead became super sensitive -</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and only once a day.  </li>
            <li>This is specifically purposed for certain hairloss treatment since it has a higer (5%) minoxidil content.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m excited to say I can actually see new hair growth!!!</li>
            <li>It wants to float on top of any hair you have left and therefore stays mostly on the hair rather than getting down into the scalp.</li>
            <li>I will finish up the Men&#x27;s containers that I&#x27;ve already bought, but will probably spend the money on the genuine Women&#x27;s Rogaine next time just because it feels much lighter on my hair.  </li>

            <li>Turns out that I really don&#x27;t like the foam formula.  </li>
            <li>Adding the mynoxidrin really helped.</li>
            <li>Ladies can get clip on hair (very affordable) to add some fullness while waiting for the Rogaine to show results.</li>
            <li>The product itself comes in official box, very fancy for a product like this.  </li>
            <li>Yes, absolutely this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>Just started using, have not seen any results yet, but I haven&#x27;t ben using as much as I should.</li>
            <li>she comments on her amazement at how much thicker my hair has grown.</li>
            <li>I also thought there was no way that slender light can would last two months.  </li>
            <li>I also thought there was no way that slender light can would last two months.  </li>
            <li>The finoxidrin REALLY helped.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair, type 3C, and</li>
            <li>Too much work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the higher price over regular Rogaine</li>
            <li>, it works, I see new hair growing where there was none!</li>
            <li>The liquid, although it needs to be applied twice daily dries quickly with no residue.  </li>
            <li>It actually lasted a little over two months, even though I am sure I was using more than the half cap full</li>
            <li>It actually lasted a little over two months, even though I am sure I was using more than the half cap full</li>
            <li>Squirting it into the cap to measure it, and then trying to scoop it out of the cap to apply it was just more of a mess than I wanted to deal with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more of a mess trying to rub it into my hairline.  </li>
            <li>The black light  showed me exactly where they had urinated.  </li>
            <li>Highly toxic and goes thru skin and is filtered by the liver.</li>
            <li>The thing about this product is that it is a preventative meaning if uve lost hair that hasnt grown back in years this not help u because dht.has already killed that hair folicile but what it does is help the rest of.the hair remaining to stay in the growing stage for a longer period of.time resulting in longer hair,it also rejuvinates the remaining hair ,sometimes at first use u may.notice a bit more shedding that is only.because</li>
            <li>Started seeing new growth in a month.</li>
            <li>This was touted as a new and improved method for application.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m using new women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>a new house.  </li>
            <li>your new har growth falls  out.</li>
            <li>Less hair is falling out and the foam is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I usually wash my hair twice a week but had to do it more when I started using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li>The hair that grew was a darker brown than my natural color which I did like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this rogaine for approx 4-5 months so far.  </li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t  care to use the Foam simply because as soon as you put it on your fingers to put on your scalp</li>
            <li>Only having to apply this foam version that is 5% minoxidil once a day really encourages me to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>The Women&#x27;s Rogaine is so light and fluffy to apply with no build up problem on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair still soft in the morning.roblem on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair still soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>The liquid dripped near my eyes too often.</li>
            <li>OR I spray directly on my scalp and massage into the scalp.</li>
            <li>I followed their instructions completely.  </li>
            <li>so far so goo its has not been two months yet.</li>
            <li>I need to gently hold my fingers down on top of foam to get it to &#x27;melt&#x27; into liquid to seep down to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I mean it take like 2 months to start seeing more baby hairs</li>
            <li>With this 5% I am really excited to see all the extra little hairs that particularly grow in the front.</li>
            <li>I first started using it, it made my scalp itchy but that subsided a short time later.</li>
            <li>So if you have grey hair the new growth will be your natural color.</li>
            <li>It certainly does as expected.  </li>
            <li>She was unable to have anything nice for a while.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to cover all the necessary areas with just one half of a cap full.</li>
            <li>Going back to liquid Rogaine for Women... Find this one harder to apply and messy... and its too strong... makes my scalp itch and gives me headaches...</li>
            <li>it gets rid of the old dead strand and makes a new thicker healthier,and stronger one.i</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , it works, I see new hair growing where there was none!</li>
            <li> The liquid, although it needs to be applied twice daily dries quickly with no residue.  </li>

            <li> Started seeing new growth in a month.</li>
            <li> This was touted as a new and improved method for application.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using new women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> a new house.  </li>
            <li> your new har growth falls  out.</li>
            <li> Less hair is falling out and the foam is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair twice a week but had to do it more when I started using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months and it seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li> The hair that grew was a darker brown than my natural color which I did like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rogaine for approx 4-5 months so far.  </li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t  care to use the Foam simply because as soon as you put it on your fingers to put on your scalp</li>
            <li> Only having to apply this foam version that is 5% minoxidil once a day really encourages me to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> The Women&#x27;s Rogaine is so light and fluffy to apply with no build up problem on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair still soft in the morning.roblem on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair still soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> The liquid dripped near my eyes too often.</li>
            <li> OR I spray directly on my scalp and massage into the scalp.</li>
            <li> I followed their instructions completely.  </li>
            <li> so far so goo its has not been two months yet.</li>
            <li> I need to gently hold my fingers down on top of foam to get it to &#x27;melt&#x27; into liquid to seep down to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I mean it take like 2 months to start seeing more baby hairs</li>
            <li> With this 5% I am really excited to see all the extra little hairs that particularly grow in the front.</li>
            <li> I first started using it, it made my scalp itchy but that subsided a short time later.</li>
            <li> So if you have grey hair the new growth will be your natural color.</li>
            <li> It certainly does as expected.  </li>
            <li> She was unable to have anything nice for a while.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to cover all the necessary areas with just one half of a cap full.</li>
            <li> Going back to liquid Rogaine for Women... Find this one harder to apply and messy... and its too strong... makes my scalp itch and gives me headaches...</li>
            <li> it gets rid of the old dead strand and makes a new thicker healthier,and stronger one.i</li>
            <li> does not weight down my har and can style as normal after applying the Rogaine to scalp.</li>
            <li> Do not wet your hair after you apply it and let it dry some if you apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive or allergic to any other products, do not try this product.</li>
            <li> Can only use on dry hair twice a day so had no use for it</li>
            <li> I part my hair very well before doing it, and it&#x27;s still hard to do.</li>
            <li> I guess it will continue to work as long as I continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine for a long time because of hair loss from medication.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and flaky after application.</li>
            <li> For my curly haired ladies, we do not wash our hair every day, so this product ends up dry on the hair and can cause flakes/flaking.</li>
            <li> just forgot to reorder, no particular reason.  </li>
            <li> I could only use half because the applicator stop working.</li>
            <li> Had bought 4 month supply and won&#x27;t be able to use it... bad investment...</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning as I age and like a lot of women I was kind of desperate to find a product to at least stop the process.</li>
            <li> Not really what  I need, therefore it is still in the box.</li>
            <li> By month four I started actually feeling hair in an area where very little had been before.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Rogaine Foam for approximately 1 month and my hair dresser sees new growth.</li>
            <li> It was not mentioned that this was only 30 day  and would take at least 90 to see any results and the  when you  stop taking it</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the foam makes your hair weighed down and sticky.</li>
            <li> My two pissers have calmed down and are sleeping in the house.</li>
            <li> brand 5% Minoxidil from Walmart, which is half the cost of this Women&#x27;s Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> A bonus is that the men&#x27;s formula seems to be a little heavier than the women&#x27;s which means it is just a little less runny.  </li>
            <li> However, it leaves a residue on my hair, seems a little gummy and somewhat sticky.  </li>
            <li> I had results of hair growth after a few months.  </li>
            <li> My hair was starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> Started hating how it gunked up and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Started hating how it gunked up and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> It is messy, not easy to use, hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> My kinky/curly hair was just starting to thin (menopause is hell!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin hair but have noticed as I aged my hair was thinning.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I realized I didn&#x27;t have enough determination to use this every day as directed so I can&#x27;t attest to its efficacy.</li>
            <li> I found it to be messy, wasteful, and clumsy.  </li>
            <li> Google, it, other people have this issue and worse.</li>
            <li> also, with the foam its hard to know the quantity to use... not for me....</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about 3wks ago hard to let if working yet,</li>
            <li> but I do see a difference and growing in slowly</li>
            <li> If your hair grows slowly, don&#x27;t get discouraged, keep using it.  </li>
            <li> This foam is difficult to get down onto your scalp.</li>
            <li> I did read someone else&#x27;s review that said to wash your hands in cold water before applying to the dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> It the least expensive option that works without surgery or hair extensions.  </li>
            <li> I will never be a hair model, but I am no longer self-conscious about my extremely thin crown area.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would have to use it for a year to see results and didn&#x27;t think a dramatic improvement would</li>
            <li> I am shocked, I am very skeptical of these types of claims &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; but I am a female and my hair is receding</li>
            <li> a little, so feeling desperate and after reading reviews, I ordered it, and I am seeing results!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> But it is difficult to apply to the scalp  even when using caution.</li>
            <li> That is an expensive commitment that people should know before they press the &amp;#34;Add to cart&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> but id rather not go blind.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product - it&#x27;s waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells bad  also.</li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> Caused me horrible insomnia.</li>
            <li> The item did not state to use for 3-4 months before any results and the smell was awful -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has worked for me! My kinky/curly hair was just starting to thin (menopause is hell!) in the crown area. I started using this Rogaine foam along with Visvical on the recommendation of my dermatologist. Started seeing new growth in a month. While my head of hair will never be as lush as it was when I was 35, after 10 weeks of regular use, I am very pleased with the results.I am told by my physician that I can expect to see &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; results by 4 months. I guess it will continue to work as long as I continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> I will tell you in 90 days</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply.  You have to give it time to see full growth. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF AND IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> It takes time.  I thought I saw a difference after about three months but I decided to wait before making a decision.  Sure enough!  By month four I started actually feeling hair in an area where very little had been before.  Now, at almost six months I have a noted fullness and I am thrilled.  Patience!</li>
            <li> I actually been using the men&#x27;s 5% foam for the last 4 months, but the formula is the same as the women&#x27;s. I use it once a day about 5 times a week. At about 2 months, I started seeing some regrowth at my hairline and temples. At about 3 months, the shedding noticeably got reduced. At 4 months, I noticed my part is NOTICEBLY tighter (that is where I needed the most improvement). I was very surprised and happy that I saw results this quick. I thought I would have to use it for a year to see results and didn&#x27;t think a dramatic improvement would happen.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and can&#x27;t wait to see where I will be at the one year mark which is where you will see the max results. I find it easy to use, and the new hair that is growing is thicker and darker. My hair definitely has more volume and when I wash it takes longer to dry it than it used to (which is a good sign. It means more hair). I am at a point where even if don&#x27;t see anymore improvements and get to keep the improvements I have so far, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> After using regular Women&#x27;s Rogaine for several years, I was seduced by the possibility of only having to apply it once a day.  Turns out that I really don&#x27;t like the foam formula.  Squirting it into the cap to measure it, and then trying to scoop it out of the cap to apply it was just more of a mess than I wanted to deal with.  It&#x27;s also more of a mess trying to rub it into my hairline.  But I figured since this formula is 5% and you only need to use it once a day, that I could use the Men&#x27;s regular formula once a day, which is also 5%.  So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.  A bonus is that the men&#x27;s formula seems to be a little heavier than the women&#x27;s which means it is just a little less runny.  It&#x27;s been a few months and it seems to be working fine.  It also seems like there is a lot less hair lost when washing it, which is a HUGE bonus :)</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but you have to take it  for 3-6 months. I also take it with  [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and my hair has never looked better! Adding the mynoxidrin really helped. Perfect combo.</li>
            <li> The thing about this product is that it is a preventative meaning if uve lost hair that hasnt grown back in years this not help u because dht.has already killed that hair folicile but what it does is help the rest of.the hair remaining to stay in the growing stage for a longer period of.time resulting in longer hair,it also rejuvinates the remaining hair ,sometimes at first use u may.notice a bit more shedding that is only.because it gets rid of the old dead strand and makes a new thicker healthier,and stronger one.i would recommend this to.anyone . trust me when i say give it  four monthes of use and try not to skip doses. U wont be disappointed.just remember as ive said if you are already bald this product will not work for u. Its also a very good product for someone who has just cut their hair short and wants to grow it back faster.</li>
            <li> Not really what  I need, therefore it is still in the box.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works so well that I bought a second  one for myself. I just sent one to my son in Washington. I have been having problems with my male cats spraying. This light picks up o. All the sprayed areas. I also bought the feliway diffuser. It works so well that I  bought two more.  My two pissers have calmed down and are sleeping in the house. Santini is sleeping on the cat post now.  He would come in and growl and scream to get out right after he ate.  The black light  showed me exactly where they had urinated.  I used rocco &amp; roxie stain and oder eliminator to remove the urine stains. It also picks up vomit. Just turn off the lights and shine the flashlight on any surface and you will find the stain.  Great products all from amazon.</li>
            <li> It is to early on to know whether this product will make a difference or not, but what I do know it is not sticky it is easy to use and I will continue to use this product an see where it goes.  It is worth he try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a commitment you have to make but I do see a difference and growing in slowly so I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Hopeful. just started using</li>
            <li> I initially used the Rogaine in liquid form, then switched to the foam.  I&#x27;ve always had thin hair but have noticed as I aged my hair was thinning.  My hair loss is hereditary which per the instructions make me a candidate for this product.  I had results of hair growth after a few months.  However my hair grows an inch per month so the results were noticeable fairly immediately.  If your hair grows slowly, don&#x27;t get discouraged, keep using it.  I did stop using the product- just forgot to reorder, no particular reason.  That was over a year ago.  The hair that resulted from the use of Rogaine still remains. However, the hair stopped growing.  It&#x27;s the same length as it was prior to stopping using this product. The hair that grew was a darker brown than my natural color which I did like. So if you have grey hair the new growth will be your natural color. I&#x27;m ordering it again and plan on keeping a regimen. It the least expensive option that works without surgery or hair extensions.  Ladies can get clip on hair (very affordable) to add some fullness while waiting for the Rogaine to show results.</li>
            <li> Caused me horrible insomnia. I didn&#x27;t sleep for four days. Google, it, other people have this issue and worse. I&#x27;m throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> I switched from the Rogaine liquid to this foam because once per day use instead of twice seemed appealing. It is messy, not easy to use, hard to apply evenly. Although the impact seems to be the same as with the twice per day drops, the alcohol in this product leaves my hair feeling like straw. I went back to the twice per day liquid</li>
            <li> I started seeing results in about 8-10 weeks. It works.</li>
            <li> It does what it says... I&#x27;ve been using this rogaine for approx 4-5 months so far.  I see some really good progress on some parts and no progress in other parts.  The product itself comes in official box, very fancy for a product like this.  Each box has  had a $10 off coupon if you decide to buy it in-store.</li>
            <li> I could not use it I have health issues</li>
            <li> Not working for me yet, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to use than the liquid. BUT, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to cover all the necessary areas with just one half of a cap full.</li>
            <li> dont know if its working...takes about 90 days to find out.</li>
            <li> This works great and I&#x27;m already seeing baby here&#x27;s filling in. The only complaint I have is the foam makes your hair weighed down and sticky. Just have to make sure and get it directly onto your scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning as I age and like a lot of women I was kind of desperate to find a product to at least stop the process. Unfortunately I realized I didn&#x27;t have enough determination to use this every day as directed so I can&#x27;t attest to its efficacy.</li>
            <li> it works but i don&#x27;t care for the off smelling fragrance</li>
            <li> A great product. This is specifically purposed for certain hairloss treatment since it has a higer (5%) minoxidil content. The fact that it is a foam presentation makes it easier and faster to apply. My wife has been using it for almost six months now and can gladly say that I have noticed considerable new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Yes, absolutely this stuff works.  The hair growing back is stronger and fuller.  Please do yourself a favor and start using it today.</li>
            <li> This was touted as a new and improved method for application. I found it to be messy, wasteful, and clumsy.  There&#x27;s no applicator. You use your finger and hope the foam doesn&#x27;t melt before applying and that you get it on the right places. It is beyond me that Rogaine considers this an improvement. I would never purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Liked other Rogaine products but hadn&#x27;t tried foam. Husband likes men&#x27;s product foam so I&#x27;m using new women&#x27;s version. Like it so far.</li>
            <li> i like the drops better.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it made my hair very dry. I have discontinued usr</li>
            <li> Have not seen any hair growth.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the higher price over regular Rogaine that&#x27;s liquid.  Unless I start seeing some growth, I will not be buying anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Not the best for ethnic hair because of the alcohol in it. My hair was dry and flaky after application. I used it for the time instructed and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Just started using, have not seen any results yet, but I haven&#x27;t ben using as much as I should.</li>
            <li> It certainly does as expected.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  Less hair is falling out and the foam is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Going back to liquid Rogaine for Women... Find this one harder to apply and messy... and its too strong... makes my scalp itch and gives me headaches... Had bought 4 month supply and won&#x27;t be able to use it... bad investment... Liquid Romaine never gave me any problems and it works... would rather use a more gentle liquid than a strong foam... also, with the foam its hard to know the quantity to use... not for me....</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sticky. I prefer the liquid one with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product!  This is my second order and I know it will take time but, I see it&#x27;s working. Know that my hair with never be what it was but I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to thin.  I read where one of the movie stars was having the same problem and it was working for her so decided to try it.  Glad I did.  I even set up on repeat ordering so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Can only use on dry hair twice a day so had no use for it and I&#x27;ll probably never know if it works.</li>
            <li> I am at the stage where I am losing my hair .Went  to see my Dermatologist .and  she recommend I use Rogaine Foam. I really don&#x27;t  care to use the Foam simply because as soon as you put it on your fingers to put on your scalp it melts.I  prefer the liquid form. The foam is once a day, where the liquid is twice a day. ..</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would work better than the regular Women&#x27;s Rogaine. Unfortunately it did not. I used it for 5 months and did not experience any reqrowth. A lot of the applied foam ended up in my hair instead of on my scalp which is part of the problem. I used the product in the front of my hairline where I have thinning. But it is difficult to apply to the scalp  even when using caution. As a side note,  I never had success with the  Rogaine liquid either. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> They should tell you up front that you have to use it every day for the rest of your life, or the hair that did grow (if any) will fall out if you stop using it.  That is an expensive commitment that people should know before they press the &amp;#34;Add to cart&amp;#34; button. You can&#x27;t skip one day or if you have to start all over again.</li>
            <li> Made quite a bit of my hair fall out.  Stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I could only use half because the applicator stop working.</li>
            <li> Foam stopped working after several uses only comes out in drops</li>
            <li> It was for my mom,she liked it.</li>
            <li> Update Review:  Been using for about eight months and have definitely had hair growth.  Every time I go to my hairdresser she comments on her amazement at how much thicker my hair has grown. Even missed doses without a problem.</li>
            <li> It actually works I mean it take like 2 months to start seeing more baby hairs but it works I love this product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for 1 month.  I love the foam application! Have used the runny liquid before and I hated it. It made my hair greasy, my scalp burn, and had to be applied 2 times a day. This caused me to stop using it. Only having to apply this foam version that is 5% minoxidil once a day really encourages me to continue using it.  I apply it at night before going to bed and in the morning my hair looks fine. No greasyness whatsoever. I have always noticed almost instant results with monoxidil - even the 2%. With this 5% I am really excited to see all the extra little hairs that particularly grow in the front. I think it will take longer to see the results on the crown area. Unfortunately, that is where I need it the most. So for now, I am very pleased with how easily it applies to my scalp, causes no irritation, and is showing very promising results in only one month.  I did read someone else&#x27;s review that said to wash your hands in cold water before applying to the dry scalp.  This does seem to help the foam not disintegrate so quickly by having cool fingertips.  I will definitely keep using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/6/2015:  I have been using the product for almost 3 months now and am still very excited about the new hair growth.  I will never be a hair model, but I am no longer self-conscious about my extremely thin crown area.  The front has filled in nicely and the crown area no longer shows bare scalp.  I have before and after pictures starting from day one but you can only upload video to this.  To save money, I did buy the Men&#x27;s &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; brand 5% Minoxidil from Walmart, which is half the cost of this Women&#x27;s Rogaine.  I am sure the chemical make-up would be identical.  The difference I am noticing by using the Men&#x27;s version is that the foam seems thicker and messier to apply.  Takes a lot more time to get it directly on my scalp while trying to keep it out of my hair.  The Women&#x27;s Rogaine is so light and fluffy to apply with no build up problem on my hair.  I will finish up the Men&#x27;s containers that I&#x27;ve already bought, but will probably spend the money on the genuine Women&#x27;s Rogaine next time just because it feels much lighter on my hair.  I also thought there was no way that slender light can would last two months.  It actually lasted a little over two months, even though I am sure I was using more than the half cap full they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/3/15 update:  returned the Equate brand for men by Walmart. Started hating how it gunked up and dried out my hair. Bit the bullet and paid the higher price for the brand name made specifically for women. So much better than the generic brand. Still very pleased with the results and ease of use.  I apply one time before bed each night.  Hair still soft in the morning.roblem on my hair.

            <li> Easy to use, does not smell</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about 3wks ago hard to let if working yet,</li>
            <li> I likes the ease of application of the foam much better than the liquid. The liquid dripped near my eyes too often.</li>
            <li> My12 daughter has alopecia and non responsive to topical steroidsand injections. After 2 years,  I did my  own research and after 3 dermatologist whom agreed to use Rogaine her bald spot has shown hair growth.</li>
            <li> easy to use does not weight down my har and can style as normal after applying the Rogaine to scalp.</li>
            <li> This works well, but you have to take it twice a day for 6 months, and you have to be VERY consistent. . I also take it [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]. The finoxidrin REALLY helped. I can see a big difference in hair growth and health vs. just taking the rogaine alone. If you have the money, take both of these for 6 months and watch what it does to your hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished using it,so jury still out on this product.</li>
            <li> my vision went blurry the third day of using it- my forehead became super sensitive - who nows if to works but id rather not go blind.</li>
            <li> I got sudden Allopicia Aretha in some areas on my scalp several months ago and after using this product (5% not the 2% as recommended by my dermatologiest) for about 3 months now I&#x27;m excited to say I can actually see new hair growth!!!</li>
            <li> I was allergic to it so gave it to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> It is almost three months and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Maybe I have to wait longer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that is really does work! I am shocked, I am very skeptical of these types of claims &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; but I am a female and my hair is receding a little, so feeling desperate and after reading reviews, I ordered it, and I am seeing results! It took about 6 weeks, I have applied it faithfully every night, it works, I see new hair growing where there was none!</li>
            <li> I want to take cans for one year.. when it will expire ??</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested that this product would help me. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the pharmacy. And I thank God for you. And a great price you made my day.:-) After receiving the rogaine for women hair it was to strong for my scalp so that&#x27;s why I am canceled my order.</li>
            <li> Curly Hair review-- I just started using this about two months ago so I have no noticed any changes yet but I will continue like my doctor advised. This has the consistency of hair mousse. I have really curly hair, type 3C, and I either squirt it on to a surface and put on my fingertip and massage into my scalp (making parts with a comb) OR I spray directly on my scalp and massage into the scalp. It is better to part the hair and then apply the product so it gets a better distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it, it made my scalp itchy but that subsided a short time later. For my curly haired ladies, we do not wash our hair every day, so this product ends up dry on the hair and can cause flakes/flaking. I usually wash my hair twice a week but had to do it more when I started using this. Do not wet your hair after you apply it and let it dry some if you apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li> The item did not state to use for 3-4 months before any results and the smell was awful - DO NOT buy this product - it&#x27;s waste of money!!!!! And you have to buy it forever to keep any hair, if you have the money to spend constantly and can tolerate the smell, then buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it for 2 months and it seems to be working fine. Prior to that I had been using the liquid for a number of years successfully, I like the foam because it&#x27;s only once a day and as I say it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to use it, it takes 6 weeks or more, just move out of state&lt;br /&gt;into a new house.  Ask me in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Rogain for 1 year.  My result has been good.  At first I tried the liquid, that needs to be applied 2x a day.  I thought I would try the foam as it needs to be applied only 1x daily.  They each have their pros&amp;cons.  The foam is easier to apply and only requires one application a day which is nice.  However, it leaves a residue on my hair, seems a little gummy and somewhat sticky.  The liquid, although it needs to be applied twice daily dries quickly with no residue.  So, its a tuff decision.......but they both work!!!</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with Alopecia Areata. This has helped in correcting my problem spot in addition to steroid shots with my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT A 2 MONTH SUPPLY, AND IT DOES NOT WORK.  I USE ROGAINE LIQUID AND IT WORKS, BUT THIS FOAM DID NOT</li>
            <li> This foam is difficult to get down onto your scalp. It wants to float on top of any hair you have left and therefore stays mostly on the hair rather than getting down into the scalp. I part my hair very well before doing it, and it&#x27;s still hard to do. I need to gently hold my fingers down on top of foam to get it to &#x27;melt&#x27; into liquid to seep down to my scalp. Too much work.  I&#x27;ll get the liquid next time.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product.  Used it two days per package instructions.  Got severe chemical burn on my scalp and face. Eyes were swollen shut.  I followed their instructions completely.  Had to go to the doctor to get two prescriptions to heal the burn.  If you are sensitive or allergic to any other products, do not try this product. Been over a week and still is pain with itching rash.</li>
            <li> Finally 5% for women! Works great!</li>
            <li> Gross Poison scam. Highly toxic and goes thru skin and is filtered by the liver. It was not mentioned that this was only 30 day  and would take at least 90 to see any results and the  when you  stop taking it your new har growth falls  out. My Dr. took me  off  it  immediately and said  anyone with a compromised liver would be killing themselves as it it has to be daily thing forever???? Smells bad  also.I WANT MY MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li> so far so goo its has not been two months yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine for a long time because of hair loss from medication.  This is easy to use and only once a day.  I like that one bottle lasts for several months which saves money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister.  She was unable to have anything nice for a while.  I hope it worked.  She requested it specifically.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rogaine Foam for approximately 1 month and my hair dresser sees new growth. Hurrah!!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use and I can apply it and style my hair easily without a wait because the foam dries very quickly.</li>
