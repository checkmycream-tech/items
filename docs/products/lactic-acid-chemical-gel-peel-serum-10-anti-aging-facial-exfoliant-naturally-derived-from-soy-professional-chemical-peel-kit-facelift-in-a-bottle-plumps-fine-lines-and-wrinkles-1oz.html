            <li>He did too! :D  </li>
            <li>The Refresh website has excellent instructions on how to use it</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and have some sun damaged areas from years of sunshine and abuse.</li>
            <li>That is a good thing!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this peel would help lighten the underlying skin, and I am happy to report that it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist says I have great skin for being 59.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the willow bark</li>
            <li>I was happy to come across this product that is a peel you can do at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>1-2 hours is good if you would like that skin peeling effect.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face with a herbal face cleanser before and after, and follow up with a good hyaluronic acid serum and a soothing seaweed night cream.</li>
            <li>When asked to test this peel, I approached it with some caution, but am very glad to have given it a try.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how my skin feels after I wash it.  </li>
            <li>I was offered a sample of this product so I could give my fair and honest opinion of the results.</li>
            <li>Very good product, that works very well and arrives on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The product claims to be effective without the peeling</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any kind of burning (which I expexted)</li>
            <li>I love it! :)of my freckles are also looking lighter as well.</li>
            <li>I love it! :)</li>
            <li>Nice light refresher !</li>
            <li>So when i was able to review one in exchange for my honest review i couldnt wait for it to come in the mail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strongly recommended that you use the ReFresh Rose Glow Cleanser in preparation for the peel.</li>
            <li>When I layer on targeted areas, it peels more there.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have even had a couple of biopsies to make sure I didn&#x27;t have skin cancer as that does run in my family.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product and will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product and will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was VERY impressed with the included sheet of directions on using the product and information provided about the product, including that it is made in the USA, not tested on animals, contains no fragrance and contains only purified water, lactic acid and xantham gum (a thickener often used in food</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it makes my milia much more noticeable</li>
            <li>My pores seems to be more enlarged and congested using this product.  </li>
            <li>but this item is a bit more assertive.  </li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this and am very excited about how well it worked.</li>
            <li>you would like to see a more detailed video on this product, including a reading of the instructions included with the peel, go to my profile and find the link to my YouTube channel.</li>
            <li>used a glycolic acid peel years ago that really did a number on my face, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>The xanthan gum in the formula is also found in food and is used to increase the viscosity of the solution for easy application.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good idea to read them in full before your first application.</li>
            <li>It can be used for a special occasion or spa day, but repeated use over many weeks will increase the benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super  excited to try this product!</li>
            <li>but I have almost silky smooth arms in 5 days.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li>it was more refreshing Very relieved</li>
            <li>For me this is very exciting and I will continue to use this</li>
            <li>For me this is very exciting and I will continue to use this</li>
            <li>It is suitable for use on all but the most sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always clean my skin with a charcoal cleanser before I use it</li>
            <li>and it is nice that it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something more intense, try the glycolic acid peel instead.</li>
            <li>The stains are fading really quickly and my skin looks tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the dropper to place some product on my hands, quickly rubbed it between my palms and applied it evenly on my face and also on my neck.</li>
            <li>I can &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; it (cause it to fairly quickly slough off) by using a mixture of fresh lemon juice, salt, and hydrogen peroxide, but there is still discoloration on my skin after I do that.</li>
            <li>you want to gently brighten your face, you will enjoy this</li>
            <li>think the product is worth the price</li>
            <li>I used this along with the companys rose glow facial cleanser and moisturizing</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this safe and gentle product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll start seeing progress right way.</li>
            <li>This is the first peel I have ever used/purchased</li>
            <li>, I had much more burning when using this 10% lactic acid product on my face than I&#x27;ve ever had with Peter Thomas Roth Unwrinkle Peel Pads, which contain multiple acids (as well as lactic acid) at 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to love to get facial peels at a salon, but my budget doesn&#x27;t allow for that these days.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling nice and soft</li>
            <li>Maybe if there was a higher % acid they make that would be better as my skin is not sensitive at all and can handle a lot.  </li>
            <li>It is good, burns a little bit but cleans my skin very deep, I use it with my led light and I can see an improvement on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have a similar reaction, but this peel is very mild.</li>
            <li>I followed this peel with Refresh Skin Therapy&#x27;s Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream (Post-peel Repair and Restore), which is soothing after doing the peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fine for a basic exfoliator,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take very much of this peel to completely treat my face and neck, so I know the bottle is going to last a good long while.</li>
            <li>and I found this peel to be very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has no odor and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The exfoliation process removes old skin cells and reveals fresh skin cells, improving the appearance of the skin.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle product, this one is it.</li>
            <li>but I think this peel has added some real muscle to the task.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I started very conservatively three weeks ago, with a 1-minute application.</li>
            <li>I was kind of afraid to try this lactic acid peel (given to me in return for an honest review) for fear</li>
            <li>glass bottle has a dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it for the first time, apply a drop to the inside of the arm to test how sensitive your skin is to it.</li>
            <li>Mild enough to use on my teenager.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lactic acid is not only mild, but it is also germicidal and hygroscopic.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>AHA can increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sun, so you should always wear a highly protective sunscreen after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and feels smoother, plus my laugh lines are definitely lessened.</li>
            <li>I have been trying all kinda of new items</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin---</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and this product is said to be good for dry skin, but I just haven&#x27;t seen results based on the long list of promises made by this</li>
            <li>It will also slightly firm the skin and reduce the effect of fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you only need a small amount, so the price works out to be very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The product is an almost clear gel with a smell that reminds me of lotions for acne.</li>
            <li>It is produced by the natural fermentation of sugars.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then this product might be for you.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The lactic acid is naturally derived from soy beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the 3 minutes I rinsed my face with cool water, patted dry, then added a tiny bit of the moisturizing cream to sooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry skin on my face in the winter, and this gel pal helped me with that so much!</li>
            <li>I have seen a minimal lightening of my dark spots (though I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>I cleaned my face with Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser, then applied a thin film of this Lactic Acid 10% Gel Peel Exfoliant Anti-aging Serum, rinsed after the 3 minutes, then followed up with Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>Wait a few minutes and then rinse well, and then apply a moisturizer such as the {Re} Fresh Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>There is a very slight tingling sensation but the peel is very mild and my skin seems to tolerate it well without getting red.</li>
            <li>It works, yet it is gentle on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the simple formula of this gentle exfoliating peel, which uses only water, lactic acid 10%, and xanthan gum.</li>
            <li>and you can barely see it!</li>
            <li>It was only after about five uses that I began to feel that tingling feeling that indicates it is working deep down on my fresh, new skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone oily skin along with facial eczema</li>
            <li>In fact, the first few times I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice anything happening at all.</li>
            <li>I actually added a bit to the trouble spots first before adding to the rest of my face so it would be on those areas longer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is the first peel I have ever used/purchased and I got it to treat my post-acne hyperpigmentation.  I have sensitive, acne-prone oily skin along with facial eczema and I found this peel to be very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon initial use, I used as instructed.  However, I found this to be ineffective.  I began to experiment with the time limits.  DO NOT wear it over night, you will experience a chemical burn.  1-2 hours is good if you would like that skin peeling effect.  The product claims to be effective without the peeling but I was not able to see that during my first 4 uses or so.  Upon application, there is very little sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the layering lactic acid is a waste of product; but, in my experience, it works.  When I layer on targeted areas, it peels more there.  Over time, the product does lighten my dark spots; however, it is difficult to tell how fast the product is doing this as I also use a variety of other products, including vitamin C, aldapene gel, hydroquinone, and desonide lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is worth the price and it is nice that it is a natural product.  I would recommend it for anyone who is a novice peel user.</li>
            <li> Nice light refresher !</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face in the winter, and this gel pal helped me with that so much! I love it.</li>
            <li> Works. I have very sensitive skin--- but I can stand this product. Mild enough to use on my teenager.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this and am very excited about how well it worked. It worked wonders for the &amp;#34;chicken bump&amp;#34; arms(keratosis pilaris). About 50% of people have this raised bumpy area on their arms. After using the Lactic Acid Peel I then washed it off and applied the Re Store Hyaluronic moisturizing cream. I was told it would take two weeks to see results but I have almost silky smooth arms in 5 days. Wikipedia even recommends the Lactic acid peel for treatment of the &amp;#34;chicken arms&amp;#34;. This product has no odor and is gentle on the skin. I did not feel any tingling or burning. I would highly recommend this safe and gentle product.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample of this product so I could give my fair and honest opinion of the results. I have very fair skin and have some sun damaged areas from years of sunshine and abuse. I have even had a couple of biopsies to make sure I didn&#x27;t have skin cancer as that does run in my family. I agreed to try this product but even though I had doubts it would improve my skin I still had that tiny bit of hope in the back of my mind that it would. I used this along with the companys rose glow facial cleanser and moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a few seborrheic keratosis&#x27; removed by freezing and biopsy...can be painful at times so I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give this stuff a try and if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll just go back to the Dr.&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Before bed I cleaned my face with Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser, then applied a thin film of this Lactic Acid 10% Gel Peel Exfoliant Anti-aging Serum, rinsed after the 3 minutes, then followed up with Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream. I actually added a bit to the trouble spots first before adding to the rest of my face so it would be on those areas longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lactic acid gel peel felt a bit stingy on my face, nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle though. After the 3 minutes I rinsed my face with cool water, patted dry, then added a tiny bit of the moisturizing cream to sooth my skin.  I did this every night for about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after the 1st week that my face had broken out in a few places, I don&#x27;t get acne so that was strange. I suppose my new skin care habits were bringing hidden  things to the surface after who knows how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird part is I have a small keratosis spot on my cheek that the Dr. wanted to remove and biopsy and I noticed today it is about half the size it was a week ago and you can barely see it! I thought it was just wishful thinking on my part so I had my husband look close and tell me if he thinks it looks smaller. He did too! :D  A few of my freckles are also looking lighter as well. For me this is very exciting and I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and will purchase more when I run out. I love it! :)of my freckles are also looking lighter as well. For me this is very exciting and I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and will purchase more when I run out. I love it! :)</li>
            <li> I appreciate the simple formula of this gentle exfoliating peel, which uses only water, lactic acid 10%, and xanthan gum. It is suitable for use on all but the most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lactic acid is not only mild, but it is also germicidal and hygroscopic. It is produced by the natural fermentation of sugars. The xanthan gum in the formula is also found in food and is used to increase the viscosity of the solution for easy application. The 1 oz. glass bottle has a dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it for the first time, apply a drop to the inside of the arm to test how sensitive your skin is to it. Wash and dry the face and gently massage a few drops of the solution into the skin, keeping it away from the eyes. Wait a few minutes and then rinse well, and then apply a moisturizer such as the {Re} Fresh Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream. After using the peel a few times, it can safely be left on the skin for up to ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation process removes old skin cells and reveals fresh skin cells, improving the appearance of the skin. It will also slightly firm the skin and reduce the effect of fine wrinkles. It can be used for a special occasion or spa day, but repeated use over many weeks will increase the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boutique Buys provided gel peel for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61, and I have not taken care of my skin well at all over the years. While I&#x27;ve stayed out of the sun, I do have a fingernail-sized patch of what I think is probably a seborrheic keratosis on my cheek. I can &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; it (cause it to fairly quickly slough off) by using a mixture of fresh lemon juice, salt, and hydrogen peroxide, but there is still discoloration on my skin after I do that. I was hoping this peel would help lighten the underlying skin, and I am happy to report that it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a glycolic acid peel years ago that really did a number on my face, and not in a good way. I was kind of afraid to try this lactic acid peel (given to me in return for an honest review) for fear I&#x27;d have a similar reaction, but this peel is very mild. In fact, the first few times I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice anything happening at all. It was only after about five uses that I began to feel that tingling feeling that indicates it is working deep down on my fresh, new skin. (This is more an indictment of my sorry skin care regimen, I expect, than of the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take very much of this peel to completely treat my face and neck, so I know the bottle is going to last a good long while. I followed this peel with Refresh Skin Therapy&#x27;s Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream (Post-peel Repair and Restore), which is soothing after doing the peel. If you are looking for a gentle product, this one is it. If you are looking for something more intense, try the glycolic acid peel instead.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3M1YB46FDOZ5U]]While the instructional sheet I received with the peel states that this is the company&#x27;s gentlest product, I had much more burning when using this 10% lactic acid product on my face than I&#x27;ve ever had with Peter Thomas Roth Unwrinkle Peel Pads, which contain multiple acids (as well as lactic acid) at 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY impressed with the included sheet of directions on using the product and information provided about the product, including that it is made in the USA, not tested on animals, contains no fragrance and contains only purified water, lactic acid and xantham gum (a thickener often used in food products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends using the peel at night so that the face has time to heal and for any redness to reduce. However, when I used it before bedtime, after washing off my makeup, it burned like crazy, but I did not experience much if any redness. When I used the peel during the day just out of the shower, I had no burning from the peel nor any redness either. I found that curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen almost no results after using this product for about 6 weeks. I have seen a minimal lightening of my dark spots (though I can&#x27;t say for sure that&#x27;s due to this product), and I&#x27;ve seen no reduction in wrinkles, no additional moisturization/hydration, etc. I have dry skin, and this product is said to be good for dry skin, but I just haven&#x27;t seen results based on the long list of promises made by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for a basic exfoliator, but I see very few benefits beyond that, especially for something that burns as much as it does while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to see a more detailed video on this product, including a reading of the instructions included with the peel, go to my profile and find the link to my YouTube channel. Amazon will not allow me to post it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.25 stars</li>
            <li> Great product.  I do a peel once a month and my skin looks great.  I use other products also, but I like the feel of this.  My dermatologist says I have great skin for being 59.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my blackheads</li>
            <li> When asked to test this peel, I approached it with some caution, but am very glad to have given it a try. It is now a regular part of my skin care routine. The product is an almost clear gel with a smell that reminds me of lotions for acne. The Refresh website has excellent instructions on how to use it and it&#x27;s a good idea to read them in full before your first application. My skin at 61 has become very sensitive and fragile, but it also needs a lot of help to keep all the unpleasant signs of ageing from taking over. I have been trying to reverse some extensive sun damage on my cheeks. Essentially, I had irregular, brown stains that looked particularly ugly in the winter. My other skin care had already improved things but I think this peel has added some real muscle to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started very conservatively three weeks ago, with a 1-minute application. My skin did not react, so a few days later, I left the peel on for 2 minutes, and gradually worked up to 5 minutes (I use a timer for accuracy). I am now using it every other night before going to sleep and even put a bit on my hands. I wash my face with a herbal face cleanser before and after, and follow up with a good hyaluronic acid serum and a soothing seaweed night cream. There is a very slight tingling sensation but the peel is very mild and my skin seems to tolerate it well without getting red. The stains are fading really quickly and my skin looks tighter and smoother. The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you only need a small amount, so the price works out to be very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is good, burns a little bit but cleans my skin very deep, I use it with my led light and I can see an improvement on my face</li>
            <li> Too drying for me.  It only tingles a little but it irritates my skin.  I have noticed that it makes my milia much more noticeable and unfortunately I cannot afford to go to a dermatologist and have it extracted.  My pores seems to be more enlarged and congested using this product.  I always clean my skin with a charcoal cleanser before I use it so I am not putting the product on unclean skin.  I had high hopes for this product.  If anything it made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I was super  excited to try this product! I have never done a chemical peel in my life So when i was able to review one in exchange for my honest review i couldnt wait for it to come in the mail. I have been trying all kinda of new items becuse i want to expand my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the dropper to place some product on my hands, quickly rubbed it between my palms and applied it evenly on my face and also on my neck. It which feels actually just like water and has no smell at all.  Ii didnt bother my skin or feel weird at all it was more refreshing Very relieved I washed the peel of with cold water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i like this and would use it again My skin was left feeling nice and soft</li>
            <li> It definitely feels like its working while its on your face, but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference at all over the last 2 weeks unfortunately.  Maybe if there was a higher % acid they make that would be better as my skin is not sensitive at all and can handle a lot.  If you have sensitive skin then this product might be for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lactic acid peel before so I went with the recommendation of starting with a low percent. I didn&#x27;t feel any kind of burning (which I expexted) when I applied it to my face.  But I also didn&#x27;t feel like it was removing anything from the surface of my skin either. It just wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Very good product, that works very well and arrives on time and in good condition. You&#x27;ll start seeing progress right way.</li>
            <li> I have been using another [re]fresh product (2% willow bark) for several months and decided to try this 10% lactic acid peel.  I was happy with the willow bark but this item is a bit more assertive.  My face does get rosy for several hours, but that goes away.  I am very pleased with how my skin feels after I wash it.  It looks and feels smoother, plus my laugh lines are definitely lessened. That is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I used to love to get facial peels at a salon, but my budget doesn&#x27;t allow for that these days. I was happy to come across this product that is a peel you can do at home.&lt;br /&gt;It is strongly recommended that you use the ReFresh Rose Glow Cleanser in preparation for the peel. You should also follow up the peel with ReFresh Hyaluronic Acid Cream as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works, yet it is gentle on dry skin. I didn&#x27;t feel any stinging or dryness after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;* You only have to leave it on for 1-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients. The lactic acid is naturally derived from soy beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product contains Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA), you should be careful in the sun. AHA can increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sun, so you should always wear a highly protective sunscreen after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to gently brighten your face, you will enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
