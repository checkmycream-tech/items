            <li> Bought this perfume in Aruba and was unable to get it here. My favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife and she loves it, I will recomended to a friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamil</li>
            <li> Buen d&amp;iacute;a. A la fecha, a&amp;uacute;n no recibo este producto comprado en diciembre junto con varios m&amp;aacute;s, los cuales ya recib&amp;iacute; desde hace mucho, incluso compre un producto en febrero y ya lo recib&amp;iacute; hace m&amp;aacute;s de 3 semanas. como es posible que este producto no llega. Escrib&amp;iacute; a transexpress un ticket y me respondieron que tuviera paciencia, por la demanda de diciembre, cosa que queda sin sentido cuando ya hab&amp;iacute;a recibido un producto comprado en febrero. Luego verifico mi cuenta a la semana y dice que debo cancelar un impuesto por este producto y que yo hab&amp;iacute;a sido notificada, cosa que fue falsa, en ning&amp;uacute;n momento se me notific&amp;oacute;. Decid&amp;iacute; a pesar de no haber recibido el correo hacer la cancelaci&amp;oacute;n y envi&amp;eacute; el correo con el soporte de la transferencia y una nota de mi queja por la falla en la entrega y notificaciones y a&amp;uacute;n no recibo el correo diciendo que ya verificaron el pago, el cual tiene varios d&amp;iacute;as, as&amp;iacute; como tampoco respuesta  a mi queja. Sino est&amp;aacute;n en capacidad de hacerme llegar este producto, entonces notifiquenme para que me realicen el reintegro. Estoy muy molesta por la falta de respuesta y de seriedad.&lt;br /&gt;Espero que ustedes si respondan.&lt;br /&gt;Ana Le&amp;oacute;n.</li>
            <li> I get ooo many compliemnts on this perfume. Its has a veryyyy long staying power that is suble enough. I just wish Tous had a body cream to go with it...</li>
            <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been waiting for quite a while to get this perfume and I finally did. A-ma-zing! Everybody compliments me and it lasts a looong time. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> I got it from my husband on Christmas and it smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The box and the bottle it self are very nice, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is sexy and light on the senses. Best price ever buying it through Amazon. it is the real thing. Tous needs to open a wider market for their products.</li>
            <li> Its a very soft scent, delicate, but sexy at the same time. Its preatty much a day perfume. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great value.  Love the Fragrance and I always get a good value when I uttilize Amazon.  I find all kinds of things that I am looking for at a competitive prices.</li>
            <li> my grandma asked me to purchase this for her. it was for a great price plus free shipping with prime. the only down fall to this product is that the carry bag wasnt in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to perfume. So the spray is a kind of hard to me. Some droped on my night skirt. So when my roommate came home, she said did you use perfume? It&#x27;s smell so good!!!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping, but really bad packagging!! my perfume came in a paper envelope, the box was completly damage, the paper was broken and it didn&#x27;t have the bag that came with this fragrance. Was for a present and it was really dessapointing...</li>
            <li> This perfume is really good. I strongly recommend it to any one. This is a really good fragrance from tous.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for my wife and she loves it, but she&#x27;s been telling me that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands she&#x27;s bought in the past. I don&#x27;t know if it is the formula for the perfume itself or if it is something else, but according to her one you put it on the fragrance won&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> its smell is not the same as I&#x27;m used to buy and the packaging looks fake, not like me.&lt;br /&gt;not brought me the bag</li>
