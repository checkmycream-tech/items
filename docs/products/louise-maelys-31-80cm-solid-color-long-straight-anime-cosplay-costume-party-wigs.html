            <li>Hope this helps ladies :)</li>
            <li>and I love love love their service.</li>
            <li>After fitting I had to comb it</li>
            <li>but I was able to tie my hair into a bun and get it fitted into the cap without the wig looking unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But last minute I decided to cosplay as Poison Ivy and this wig was perfect.</li>
            <li>And at a slightly better price.</li>
            <li>I got the wig within the estimated time and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It came nicely packaged so that when I took the hair out of the bag, there was no ugly folds like you find in those Halloween stores.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it gets tangled fairly easily.</li>
            <li>This is good, but it does get very tangled.</li>
            <li>I am by no means a wig expert, but this wig seems to be very good quality and easy enough to put on even for a beginner.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY easy.</li>
            <li>And for those of you who said it knots easily, it doesn&#x27;t if you brush from the bottom up.</li>
            <li>The part was nice and straight too, no bumps or anything like that anywhere.</li>
            <li>Will need to be styled in and cut to fit the character (Kurisu Steins Gate)</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to wigs and extensions and for the price you cannot beat it!!!</li>
            <li>HOT MOMMA!!</li>
            <li>The color is a deep, bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this wig wore it as a starfire cosplay and normally i have alot of hair and cannot fit under</li>
            <li>issue, the bangs were NOT side swept but full frontal; nothing as the picture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great color, a bright red orange and its pretty long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this wig was surprisingly comfortable and didn’t make me feel hot or confined.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do this little video review to show you guys how great this wig is.</li>
            <li>Fit very well.</li>
            <li>There were a couple of knots and tangles that I was easily able to comb through without losing too many strands, and there was minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>This is a fun wig.</li>
            <li>a wig photos are right here for reference</li>
            <li>so it can be adjusted to fit pretty much all head sizes.</li>
            <li>Wig looks exactly as pictured and isn&#x27;t too shiny at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wig</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for comic con and to cosplay as Crimson viper.</li>
            <li>This wig came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Definitely got more out of it</li>
            <li>It is my first cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>Even without a hair net, I was able to adorn this long costume party wig and attach it to my head quickly and easy with no problems.</li>
            <li>And super soft.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li>But it really gets Zero stars.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely take it to party.</li>
            <li>It was very impressive, soft hair, not too shiny, true to color, amazing base that they show off in the pictures made of soft material unlike other wigs.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me a question if there was something I missed that you&#x27;re curious about.</li>
            <li>and they both are very much worth it especially for the price!!!  </li>
            <li>The synthetic hair strands are very soft and they move and sway like realistic hair.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try to curl the hair with a curling iron, but it should be relatively simple to do that considering this is made from a high temperature synthetic material that can withstand higher temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought the red one two years ago as a replacement for a cheap red wig I had gotten at the time.</li>
            <li>It felt almost natural on my head, so it’s entirely possible to wear this the whole day and forget it is not your real hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like fake or too shiny, so a pleasant somewhat natural looking.</li>
            <li>Red color is just ad pictured slightly lighter but still looks nice, it looks like a natural color red.</li>
            <li>(You cannot comb wigs like you comb natural hair)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick and doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig in the red color and it looks very well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I posted a picture of me wearing it to facebook and had several people asking if I really dyed my hair that red!!!</li>
            <li>Although I’m not certain whether red is my color or not, it certainly is fun wearing this.</li>
            <li>First of all, this fire red wig was way too big for a human head.  </li>
            <li>received the vivid red long costume party wig at no cost for testing and review and have found this hair to be easy to style and tame.</li>
            <li>It is pretty long and has long bangs.</li>
            <li>I normally have long hair</li>
            <li>The hair is a little rougher at the bottom (which helps to give it fullness but makes it a little harder to brush and keep tidy).</li>
            <li>so I can use it for future costume parties and just dressing up in general.</li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy in the back</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As long aa u use the proper comb and techniques to comb</li>
            <li> Thick and very realistic.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described, has enough hair, a little rough to the touch but not too rough (just a bit rougher compared to the other wigs I owned).</li>
            <li> The hair is much thinner than on the red one, the base is not the same material and is actually really scratchy like the bases on other wigs and it came out of the package very tangled.</li>
            <li> so it needs some pinning to your head so that it doesn&#x27;t keep slipping back.</li>
            <li> I think I will buy a pink one later.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a black one for my husband</li>
            <li> Just one point, it is a little longer for me.</li>
            <li> There are places where it can be a little thin and the cap itself can be a little big on your head</li>
            <li> but basically what I wanted to say (sorry I was nervous) was that it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> Definitely not as impressed with the white one, maybe quality has just gone down with time?</li>
            <li> The wig has some shedding, as all wigs do, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s excessive, the hair is thick anyway.</li>
            <li> Which wouldn&#x27;t be so horrible, IF the wig actually fit.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing, because it was not as advertised and I am now stuck with it.</li>

            <li> Timely shipping, came 2 weeks than what Amazon estimated. Wig looks exactly as pictured and isn&#x27;t too shiny at all. Perfect length for my Katarina cosplay! Red color is just ad pictured slightly lighter but still looks nice, it looks like a natural color red. The seller was very helpful and answered each one of my questions 5/5 experience love the wig, great buy at a great price!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1142e957e8ca8817499a3d3f6a695ca8]] I wanted to do this little video review to show you guys how great this wig is. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was $17.99 and on prime! It&#x27;s my first wig so I hope I gave good information but basically what I wanted to say (sorry I was nervous) was that it&#x27;s soft, it didn&#x27;t shed anymore after I brushed it once and there was a lot of hair so you couldn&#x27;t see the cap anywhere. The part was nice and straight too, no bumps or anything like that anywhere. Feel free to ask me a question if there was something I missed that you&#x27;re curious about. Hope this helps ladies :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING WIG. IT&#x27;S SO GORGEOUS AND VERY COMFORTABLE. Exactly what I needed. Very good material and easy to handle. EXTREMELY easy. The seller is also such an angel and I love love love their service. Would definitely buy again. Do not hesitate to purchase. I garuntee you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;-Kat</li>
            <li> Excellent cosplay wig! Much better than I was expecting honestly. Thick and very realistic. I am very picky when it comes to wigs and extensions and for the price you cannot beat it!!! I was worried both would look like crappy Halloween wigs but they definitely dont! I would not hesitate to pay even more for this wig!!!! VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE! Will need to be styled in and cut to fit the character (Kurisu Steins Gate) but I was expecting that when I bought it. I also purchased a black one for my husband and they both are very much worth it especially for the price!!!  After fitting I had to comb it and again I was very satisfied, of course there was some fallout but that is to be expected. As long aa u use the proper comb and techniques to comb it is perfect. (You cannot comb wigs like you comb natural hair)</li>
            <li> Bought the red one two years ago as a replacement for a cheap red wig I had gotten at the time. It was very impressive, soft hair, not too shiny, true to color, amazing base that they show off in the pictures made of soft material unlike other wigs. Just received the white one today. The hair is much thinner than on the red one, the base is not the same material and is actually really scratchy like the bases on other wigs and it came out of the package very tangled. Definitely not as impressed with the white one, maybe quality has just gone down with time? Five stars for the red one three stars for the white one</li>
            <li> I am by no means a wig expert, but this wig seems to be very good quality and easy enough to put on even for a beginner. Even without a hair net, I was able to adorn this long costume party wig and attach it to my head quickly and easy with no problems. The synthetic hair strands are very soft and they move and sway like realistic hair. The cap inside is adjustable so it can be adjusted to fit pretty much all head sizes. I normally have long hair but I was able to tie my hair into a bun and get it fitted into the cap without the wig looking unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the vivid red long costume party wig at no cost for testing and review and have found this hair to be easy to style and tame. There were a couple of knots and tangles that I was easily able to comb through without losing too many strands, and there was minimal shedding.

It felt almost natural on my head, so it’s entirely possible to wear this the whole day and forget it is not your real hair. Although I’m not certain whether red is my color or not, it certainly is fun wearing this. I’ll definitely take care of this wig so I can use it for future costume parties and just dressing up in general.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for comic con and to cosplay as Crimson viper. But last minute I decided to cosplay as Poison Ivy and this wig was perfect. Will def buy again for different cosplay. Will update with picture when I find one</li>
            <li> Fit very well. Hair isn&#x27;t shiny. Perfect for cosplay.</li>
            <li> This wig came exactly as pictured. It&#x27;s beautiful and extremely soft. When it gets tangled it&#x27;s very easy to comb through it and untangle it. There&#x27;s no bald spots at all so that&#x27;s good. Uhhh&lt;br /&gt;Okay that&#x27;s about all I have to say but 10/10.</li>
            <li> This is a fun wig. It is pretty long and has long bangs. The hair is a little rougher at the bottom (which helps to give it fullness but makes it a little harder to brush and keep tidy). The color is a deep, bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a net for storing it. It is pretty heavy in the back so it needs some pinning to your head so that it doesn&#x27;t keep slipping back. Great for parties, costumes, role playing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in the red color and it looks very well, especially for the price.

It doesn&#x27;t look like fake or too shiny, so a pleasant somewhat natural looking. I would definitely recommend. Perfect for the price. Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo pretty!!!! And super soft. It came nicely packaged so that when I took the hair out of the bag, there was no ugly folds like you find in those Halloween stores. And at a slightly better price. Definitely got more out of it then I thought.</li>
            <li> First of all, this fire red wig was way too big for a human head.  WAY TOO BIG!&lt;br /&gt;Second issue, the bangs were NOT side swept but full frontal; nothing as the picture.  Which wouldn&#x27;t be so horrible, IF the wig actually fit.  So disappointing, because it was not as advertised and I am now stuck with it. It gets one star because I had to pick it to make this review. But it really gets Zero stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself for a costume but ended up giving it to my mom for hers, Jessica Rabbit!!! HOT MOMMA!!! The Wig was fantastic though, looked great and felt great. I posted a picture of me wearing it to facebook and had several people asking if I really dyed my hair that red!!!</li>
            <li> This is good, but it does get very tangled. Has a really great amount of hair though! It&#x27;s so thick and doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all!</li>
            <li> Love this wig, it&#x27;s amazing. And for those of you who said it knots easily, it doesn&#x27;t if you brush from the bottom up.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the wig. Compared with the price, this wig is beaaaaaautiful! It is my first cosplay wigs. I will absolutely take it to party. I think I will buy a pink one later. Just one point, it is a little longer for me.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it gets tangled fairly easily. Nice colour. Nice feel.</li>
            <li> I got the wig within the estimated time and it was fantastic! It&#x27;s a really great color, a bright red orange and its pretty long. The wig has some shedding, as all wigs do, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s excessive, the hair is thick anyway. There are places where it can be a little thin and the cap itself can be a little big on your head but you can style around it. I&#x27;m using it for a homestuck cosplay (tricksterdirk)!</li>
            <li> Hey ladies, so I just posted the video review on my husbands account and I wanted to post some pictures of the wig as well if anyone didn&#x27;t want to watch me saying &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; 30 times lol&lt;br /&gt;Anyway great wig, high quality, comfortable, loving it!</li>
            <li> Love this wig wore it as a starfire cosplay and normally i have alot of hair and cannot fit under a wig photos are right here for reference</li>
