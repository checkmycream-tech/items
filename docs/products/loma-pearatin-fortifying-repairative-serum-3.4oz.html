            <li>Used to Love.</li>
            <li>and then I started seeing more and more hair in my brush, shower drain and in my hands when I did my hair.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone and everyone! :-)</li>
            <li>It feels even better after I have curled it.</li>
            <li>After using this product for awhile, I noticed that my hair had a lot more elasticity, which eliminated breakage, it felt better conditioned</li>
            <li>The product also helped me achieve a nice smooth look when blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using it for many years as has my daughter and granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair products when blowdrying and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>You just look like you have naturally healthy, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and when i flat iron it feels wonderful..</li>
            <li>This is the best product out there for dry hair that needs repairing.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair super soft and shiny, both of my daughters have had people compliment them on how beautiful their hair looks.</li>
            <li>I cannot brush through my baby fine and breakable hair without it</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair that is split and fine.  </li>
            <li>I also use a flatiron, and my curly, frizzy hair is sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>It works to smooth out the ends and is not sticky..</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair so silky and feels so nice and smooth when I use it , its really like night and day for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This means that the bottle will last you a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it make my long, gray hair shinny  and healthy.</li>
            <li>Yep - it&#x27;s worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless, you can afford, then worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth a try once.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels so soft and makes the frizzes go away.</li>
            <li>It stopped the breakage and my hair feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair more shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that likes to lay flat and tangle up,  this product conditions it and allows it to still have body without buildup.</li>
            <li>It should only be used once a week at most.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and shiny, but not heavy.</li>
            <li>then when I purchased a few years ago, maybe that&#x27;s why doesn&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>My hair takes such abuse between the blow dryer and the flat iron; the Pearatin keeps my hair looking soft, silky and most importantly - HEALTHY.  </li>
            <li>However, I stumbled upon something else that is just as good and costs far less:  Schwarzkopf Got 2b glossy</li>
            <li>It is great for use when flat ironing and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It smooths fly-aways and makes hair shiny and straight when blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>It really makes it easier for her to comb and brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>Whether I curl or leave my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Now, I really notice the difference if I run out and have to try something else.  </li>
            <li>I had a loma product I bought several years ago and loved, so I purchased what I thought was the same product, same name and most of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>Better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li>We have tried many other products even one that was suggested at an upscale salon and none of them work as well as this one.</li>
            <li>Or should I say my hair cant live with this!?  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product i will never be with out this..</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been processed more in last few years, much dryer</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair feel so soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li>It provides my hair with enough moisture and protecting from styling with my hot tools.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect blend of ingredients for thick, heavy, medium to coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I love pairatin... makes my hair soft and helps tame the frizz!</li>
            <li>buy it if you have curly hair and want to use it to flat iron your hair and make it straight...</li>
            <li>So much for growing my hair long.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, hair that is so manageable and healthy from using this product.</li>

            <li> I do not color my hair, only blow dry and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, wavy-ish hair which breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> This Loma Pearatin Fortifying Repairative Serum is a long title but the Woman uses it on her long hair and loves it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and it helps with the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; as well as split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel as dry and damaged since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> It says that you can apply to dry hair, but I feel like it weighs it down a lot, so I only use it on wet.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, you cannot drag a brush or comb through it.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my wet hair and my brush goes through like there were never any tangles.</li>
            <li> Shipeent arrived as expected and would definately order this product again.</li>
            <li> Way way to expensive, purchased large bottle from salon a few years ago, thought for price was getting large bottle, couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was.</li>
            <li> When I ran out the other day</li>
            <li> whatever other hair products you might use.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and gives your hair life if it is dry.  </li>
            <li> No weighing down.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of wavy hair and this stuff helps to keep it from looking frizzy but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and used a small amount every time.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this hair serum, you are missing out.  </li>
            <li> It detangles, repairs, shines but doesn&#x27;t weigh down already very heavy hair.</li>
            <li> This product will tame the frizziest of hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and thin hair with some kinks in it.  </li>
            <li> It works well, yet not much better than brands you can purchase at department stores.</li>
            <li> I had to get my hair cut and found out from another stylist that protein products if used too often make the hair hard.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it as well for his thin, flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> the bad hair days just kept coming.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that there is no warning on this product.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend and when i ran out my hair felt terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have frizzy or flyaway hair, you must own this product. I have both hair types and use this after a shampoo. I also use a flatiron, and my curly, frizzy hair is sleek and smooth. My husband uses it as well for his thin, flyaway hair. Out of all the hair products I&#x27;ve pushed on him, he loves this one the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING on the market. When I wash my hair, you cannot drag a brush or comb through it. This stuff is amazing. I apply it to my wet hair and my brush goes through like there were never any tangles. It says that you can apply to dry hair, but I feel like it weighs it down a lot, so I only use it on wet. When blow-dried, you can&#x27;t tell that there was ever any product in it, which I love.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product. I cannot do without it. I cannot brush through my baby fine and breakable hair without it</li>
            <li> I just got my hair permed when I purchased this.  I am really glad I did.  It is not too heavy and gives your hair life if it is dry.  I will keep this on hand always.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  However, I stumbled upon something else that is just as good and costs far less:  Schwarzkopf Got 2b glossy anti-frizz shine serum.  It does the same job, at a fraction of the price and it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> Smells so awesome and clean I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it make my long, gray hair shinny  and healthy. Was recommended to me by my hairstylist, used it once and loved it every since.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair serum....  buy it if you have curly hair and want to use it to flat iron your hair and make it straight... It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I love the Pearatin.  My hair takes such abuse between the blow dryer and the flat iron; the Pearatin keeps my hair looking soft, silky and most importantly - HEALTHY.  Yep - it&#x27;s worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that likes to lay flat and tangle up,  this product conditions it and allows it to still have body without buildup.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Protects my hair without buildup or greasy feeling. Makes blow drying faster too. Definitely helps damaged hair. A great buy as well</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend and when i ran out my hair felt terrible. I just ordered it again i love this my hair shines smells great and when i flat iron it feels wonderful.. I would highly recommend this product i will never be with out this..</li>
            <li> Or should I say my hair cant live with this!?  I have used this product for years.  When I ran out the other day the bad hair days just kept coming.  I have very dry and thin hair with some kinks in it.  This makes my hair so silky and feels so nice and smooth when I use it , its really like night and day for my hair.  I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> It the best light weight product for my hair and it makes it silky. Better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this hair serum, you are missing out.  This is the best product out there for dry hair that needs repairing.  It smooths fly-aways and makes hair shiny and straight when blowdrying.  I have long, thick, hair that is so manageable and healthy from using this product. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> Loma is great if you get what you paid for. Wa chbout for cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> Way way to expensive, purchased large bottle from salon a few years ago, thought for price was getting large bottle, couldn&#x27;t believe how small it was. Product has been changed. Purchased another time, sent back, smelled different, like alcohol. This one smells good, doesn&#x27;t work as good as before. Would recommend purchasing in a store if you can.&lt;br /&gt;Unless, you can afford, then worth a try. My hair has been processed more in last few years, much dryer then when I purchased a few years ago, maybe that&#x27;s why doesn&#x27;t work as good. Don&#x27;t know. Worth a try once. Used to Love.</li>
            <li> This Loma Pearatin Fortifying Repairative Serum is a long title but the Woman uses it on her long hair and loves it.  It really makes it easier for her to comb and brush her hair.  And what makes the Woman happy makes me happy!</li>
            <li> After using this product several time I didn&#x27;t see any results. Will continue with Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask- it works great for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the only de-tangler that has worked in my daughters&#x27; hair. We have tried many other products even one that was suggested at an upscale salon and none of them work as well as this one. It makes the hair super soft and shiny, both of my daughters have had people compliment them on how beautiful their hair looks. You will not be disappointed and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was disappappointed that the Serum isn&#x27; being made anymore, the tonic does do the same as the serum just wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This hair serum is the best I have ever tried! It works to smooth out the ends and is not sticky.., it finishes off my styles... Whether I curl or leave my hair straight. No weighing down. Great product!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on my hair when I came in for a haircut.  I loved the results and began using it.  I wash my hair every other day and used a small amount every time.  Months went by and I was no longer getting the same results.  My hair felt itchy on my neck and then I started seeing more and more hair in my brush, shower drain and in my hands when I did my hair.  Then I noticed a big hole in my layers in the back.  I do not color my hair, only blow dry and curling iron.  I had to get my hair cut and found out from another stylist that protein products if used too often make the hair hard.  It should only be used once a week at most.  So much for growing my hair long.  I am very disappointed that there is no warning on this product.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and need to purchase more. I love the way my hair feels so soft and makes the frizzes go away.</li>
            <li> I love pairatin... makes my hair soft and helps tame the frizz! i would recommend this product to anyone and everyone! :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel so soft without being greasy! It feels even better after I have curled it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of my stylist.  I have very thin, wavy-ish hair which breaks easily.  I use this product on my damp hair before blowdrying.  A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much.  This means that the bottle will last you a good amount of time.  After using this product for awhile, I noticed that my hair had a lot more elasticity, which eliminated breakage, it felt better conditioned and I had fewer split ends.  The product also helped me achieve a nice smooth look when blowdrying.  Now, I really notice the difference if I run out and have to try something else.  I higly recommend this product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This product will tame the frizziest of hair. Ive been using it for many years as has my daughter and granddaughter.  They have waist length hair and Pearatin is a wonderful leave-in fortifyer that helps detangle and it adds a beautiful sheen to our hair.  My hairdresser reccommended it to me years ago and nothing else comes close to it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for flat iron styling. Leaves hair smooth and shiny, but not heavy. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair with Japanese thermal system. My hairdresser recommended this to me. This is a wonderful product. It stopped the breakage and my hair feels soft and looks healthy. It is a little bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave-in product mixed with It&#x27;s-a-ten cream moisturizer. I think it helps with the frizzies and contributes to a smoother look on aging, processed hair.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect blend of ingredients for thick, heavy, medium to coarse hair.  It detangles, repairs, shines but doesn&#x27;t weigh down already very heavy hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I had a loma product I bought several years ago and loved, so I purchased what I thought was the same product, same name and most of the same ingredients. Its a good product just not as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products when blowdrying and straightening my hair. It provides my hair with enough moisture and protecting from styling with my hot tools. My hair does not feel as dry and damaged since I have been using this product. It is great for use when flat ironing and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have medium length hair that is split and fine.  The Pearatin makes it feel healthier and silky, taming the frizz and fly aways.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have found..My hair is long and it helps with the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; as well as split ends.</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it leaves an amazing gloss on your hair without making it look oily.  You just look like you have naturally healthy, shiny hair.  I would definitely buy it again and I highly recommend it.  I also recommend buying a clarifying shampoo to use once a week with this product.  You want to wash out the serum as well whatever other hair products you might use.</li>
            <li> good, but not as good as the one in the bronze container</li>
            <li> Product met all my expectations. Great product and great price! Shipeent arrived as expected and would definately order this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years now and I love this stuff. I have a LOT of wavy hair and this stuff helps to keep it from looking frizzy but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. Smells amazing too. Not at all greasy to me. Makes my hair more shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It works well, yet not much better than brands you can purchase at department stores.</li>
