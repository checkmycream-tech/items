            <li>Not 100% potent.</li>
            <li>I love the TimeWiseÂ® 3-In-1 Cleanser &amp; the Age-Fighting Moisturizer, but never replaced the Day Solution with Sunscreen or the Night Solution.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay&#x27;s Age-Fighting Moisturizer is my favorite.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>My face loves it :)</li>
            <li>She must as she sure pays a lot for them.</li>
            <li>Most of the items that are shown are expired products, you can tell by the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I love that they have the normal/dry line.</li>
            <li>is AMAZING and light.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I switched things around a bit and paired the normal/dry cleanser with the combo/oily moisturizer and love the outcome.  </li>
            <li>mary kay works like magic...</li>
            <li>its been more than a month for me that i have gone for a skin treatment to the parlor</li>
            <li>I like most all of the products that I use from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>Great deal fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better face wash products than the Timewise, that exfoliate and leave my skin</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products, and will always buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the price.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>my face is like a baby&#x27;s bum in the morning :)</li>
            <li>I have used it for years, but it was a stretch to be able to afford it.</li>
            <li>I love that they have the normal/dry line.</li>
            <li>However after adding the protection (spf day cream) and the moisturizer, I was in love.</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t yet if only to learn what color of foundation will work best for you.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, but I won&#x27;t buy Mary Kay through them again.</li>
            <li>I  love the product and it was shipped to me within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;paying more for.</li>
            <li>She had a stunning hair-color combo, and I wanted to know more.</li>
            <li>I love this set of product.</li>
            <li>I also love that day serum has SPF 35.</li>
            <li>Love all Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li>I love most of the Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin is looking.  </li>
            <li>love how It makes my scan look and feel.</li>
            <li>More moisturizing than I needed.</li>
            <li>I will use the product but continue my search for something better.</li>
            <li>Just a better deal than a consultant can give me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my MK</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my mother and she likes it, not in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love my Mary Kay</li>
            <li>I love the Timewise Miracle Set because it has everything to start off right with a good skin  care routine.</li>
            <li>Very good product as always ,and the shipping was early than expected, very happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>Moistures my skin and makes it feel wonderful all day long in any humidity.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is a great way to keep the face looking shiny and young.</li>
            <li>, I made sure it was a reputable online seller, that the exp was the freshest available</li>
            <li>I use it every single day and it is awesome on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>but so far I am happy with my purchase and even happier that it&#x27;s $30 cheaper than buying from a MK Rep.</li>
            <li>, the Cleanser is thick and creamy, perfect if you like to rinse your face and drown yourself in the sink, or like me its perfect to remove with a warm wet cloth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to buying the products I love separate for now on, but if you love this set, I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked the price very much.</li>
            <li>my skin is looking more youth full since I started this beauty regiment morning and night.</li>
            <li>these all seemed fine and were in boxes, but the moisturizer seemed watery.  </li>
            <li>All seems fine.</li>
            <li>(I may or may not continue to use my own concoctions -- pure Vitamin E, oatmeal masks, 100 percent cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>and it was a huge savings even with shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mary Kay Timewise since it became available.</li>
            <li>I ran out of several items this was a great price.</li>
            <li>Even though when they sell Mary Kay, MK will give consultants free goody bags, discounts, and free products and not to mention they get paid for selling MK.</li>
            <li>I have smooth even toned skin now</li>
            <li>I think many of us assume we have the right color</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very useful, but I would recommend buying it by itself.</li>
            <li>that I will start using on winter time for my dark spots, it better work after all the great reviews I read</li>
            <li>Many of the sellers here are Mary Kay consultants that do fresh product and respond quickly</li>
            <li>So if anything else I am grateful that I now know exactly what color to use with foundation, but its more than that.</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin feel amazing, I feel more comfortable not wearing makeup on the weekends...</li>
            <li>Ultimately it was a great purchase for the right price.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to how its changed my face, but the quality and feel of it is what is impressing me right off!</li>
            <li>Right now, the Timewise collection is doing a fine job.)</li>
            <li>after usein for just 3 weeks i can see my face lookin brighter and healther love it,Mary Kay work for me fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of the stuff</li>
            <li>It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products.</li>
            <li>It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly before we talked purchasing, the woman actually let me use the product.</li>
            <li>I love the Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser, gives a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and buying it thru Amazon is much easier.</li>
            <li>thank you so much will need more soon</li>
            <li>No bad skin reactions at all with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be surprised if you finish your set without wanting to take SOMETHING home - it really is that good.</li>
            <li>This Mary Kay set is a super value.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was what my wife was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and I think my 68 year old very sensitive skin shows that they have been kind to me.</li>
            <li>its my new favorite</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and helped my skin feel softer without being to much.  </li>
            <li>[There is actually more but its all pretty much don&#x27;t rub it in your eyes or huff the stuff.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Mary Kay!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and am in my early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>were you can get product worth your money,</li>
            <li>I just had a MK pampering session and the products were fresh and looked like this.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like the set, and it wasn&#x27;t really worth it to me.</li>
            <li>And, because I&amp;#34;m worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I started using all these things my face is so nice to touch and look at, I do look younger!</li>
            <li>it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li>I love it even more when I can get it for less than full price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with some scarring on my face and the product has given my skin a softer, more moisturized look making the scars less prominent.</li>
            <li>I told her upfront that I was an extremely satisfied Bare Escentuals customer, and she would have to do a lot to impress</li>
            <li>but they are very helpful and its good to remember that they really do want to help you if only to get that sale.</li>
            <li>I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommended for women of a certain age, more or less:).</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>They very much do animal testing and try to cover it up.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mary Kay Cosmetics!</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft and blemish free all the time.</li>
            <li>My face definitely has a healthy glow to it when I use these two products.</li>
            <li>;D  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything in this kit serves a purpose, and every layer you apply once it finishes and drys my face feels so much lighter, fresher, and breathable!</li>
            <li>skin looks more radiant and younger.</li>
            <li>Did not smell funny.</li>
            <li>After the first use, you can see and feel the difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, however it isn&#x27;t worth the asking price from Mary Kay or Amazon.</li>
            <li>So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are pretty chatty which can be off putting</li>
            <li>This product is light, non greasy and makes the skin feel soft and moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li>I saved dollars by purchasing my Mary Kay from Amazon and it was exactly what I had been</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I will definitely make this my top skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>First, I must say that I am reviewing product purchased from a Mary Kay consultant, not from a third-party seller.</li>
            <li>Third, I can&#x27;t believe how much I love with the Mary Kay Timewise line.</li>
            <li>so I could get my money back or exchanged it for something that would work better for my skin.</li>
            <li>The TimeWise Miracle Set for normal/dry skin I ordered was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like a lot of items to put on and in what order etc</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I sure missed it and felt a difference in my face especially not having the items for night.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and the night gel is really comfortable.  </li>
            <li>i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li>She stated she needs more time to notice a difference, she has only been using for two weeks.</li>
            <li>They went against their word in order to be able to sell to the Chinese market.  </li>
            <li>Helps with acne and just plain smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried products by other popular brands on the market, but they don&#x27;t even come close to nourishing and moisturizing the skin the way the Miracle Set does.</li>
            <li>The same product ordered from different seller works good.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten anything I absolutely did not like, although I do use mostly the same things all the time.</li>
            <li>So far so good, there is no difference from other products I have been using, I hope to see a difference with the Microdermabrasion Set  </li>
            <li>so I had very high hopes for this set.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a little while now but never seen it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I never noticed much difference when I used the Night Solution</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was not damaged.  </li>
            <li>The consultants are very accomodating.</li>
            <li>But I always buy them from Mary Kay agent which was very pricey.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem dropping that much money on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The night time syrum really gave my skin</li>
            <li>As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products.</li>
            <li>So really what is the real difference?</li>
            <li>So you know this review is from a real consultant ....</li>
            <li>If you want a REAL Mary Kay review, all you have to do is find an MK sales representative in her 30s or 40s with 10 or so years of experience.</li>
            <li>The product it&#x27;s very good&lt;</li>
            <li>The price was 95$ for the whole set through mary kay.</li>
            <li>I actually feel comfortable doing just that.</li>
            <li>its really a dependable product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>It really works too.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the sunscreen as much leaves my face shiny.</li>
            <li>so great...got it very soon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really off putting and aside from upping my liquid intake</li>
            <li>My face was so soft and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>much like my face had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as it pains me to say, I do suggest you visit a mary kay consultant if you have</li>
            <li>The product really does sell itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>but I am really 32.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li>The product received is the real deal and not expired as some others had posted</li>
            <li>I am very happpy with this choice.</li>
            <li>you much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Second, as someone who has been accosted by overzealous Mary Kay reps over the years, I have steadfastly eschewed the company.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a differents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 10+ years and it helps to prevent wrinkles and keeps my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and works very well.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s a great deal more expensive (though MUCH cheaper here than ANYWHERE else) than the other brands, it is so worth it, because it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, it has SERIOUSLY helped to smooth out my skin, lines wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>I would suggest other products which in the end will be a lot cheaper and show more results.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>Price on amazon significantly lower than from a personal Mary Kay consultant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and love it!</li>
            <li>agreed to a make-over, although I went into the experience thinking, yes, I&#x27;ll do the facial and smile politely, but I&#x27;m just interested in checking out the mineral powder line.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I still had the old one from my old bottle, so all I needed to do was switch them out.</li>
            <li>I am honestly shocked that this line works this well and feels SO good, it is for SURE worth the $100 from a Rep in your area, and you&#x27;re supporting someone local.  </li>
            <li>This has actually made me have more acne than I had before, right in the center of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Brand new!</li>
            <li>After using this set for 2-3 weeks my skin started breaking out more, skin has less even tone than before.</li>
            <li>I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I love the sirem it is also now part of my daily facial routine.</li>
            <li>only 35 and have skin that is in super shape</li>
            <li>I did not buy this particular set from amazon, I&#x27;m reviewing the product otherwise.</li>
            <li>I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest buying Mary Kay off Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>is OLD product - buyer beware!!  </li>
            <li>the age of 51, I have used nothing but water to cleanse my skin for years as most cleansers have a harsh, drying effect.</li>
            <li>MK made a change to the Day Solution a few years ago which changed the consistency of the lotion, it is much runnier where I preferred the old consistency which was more like the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that my skin would tighten or appear more firm.  </li>
            <li>Time Wise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled to find Mary Kay products here at Amazon where I make upwards of 80% of my purchases of all kinds: shoes, dog gear, movies, gifts, tools, auto parts, mechanical items, electronics,  I mean almost everything I buy comes from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the TimeWise Miracle Set, especially for normal to dry skin!</li>
            <li>In new condition.</li>
            <li>I saw results sooner than that, but after two weeks I felt like I had brand new skin.</li>
            <li>Perfectly new bottles in new boxes.</li>
            <li>It all came sealed in new boxes.  </li>
            <li>She went the extra mile and showed me just why it&#x27;s important to take all these steps before applying makeup by doing a simple test on my arm.</li>
            <li>have your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I try to use as little as possible to make sure I&#x27;m not putting too much</li>
            <li>I know a personal representative, but better price with Amazon was the way I had to go due to budget resprictions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same exact product, with the same exact quality.</li>
            <li>in short I will definitely continue to use this product to clean my face</li>
            <li>Someone told me the other day it looked like a chemical burn, that&#x27;s how bad this messed my skin up, and my skin wasn&#x27;t great to begin with, but it was better than it is now.</li>
            <li>It works well and lasts a long time using it twice per day, as I don&#x27;t really need to use much.</li>
            <li>The foundation went on smoothly and evenly on the clean wrist and on the other it wouldn&#x27;t spread, looked blotchy and was just a complete mess -</li>
            <li>I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally.</li>
            <li>considering I saved about half off the original price.</li>
            <li>and this clearly helped me having a healthier skin</li>
            <li>keep my skin clear even during the driest season.</li>
            <li>this is an old set.</li>
            <li>You can find a consultant near you.</li>
            <li>I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days??</li>
            <li>Firm, smooth and even glowing.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You can get as much hydration and same results from cheaper products.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper then buying them from the actual Mary Kay website!</li>
            <li>the box looks old and has no seal.</li>
            <li>My skin feels as dewy and soft now as it was in my 30s.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensative skin which getting used to the same skin care line, so I have to change my routine every year.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to help with early signs of aging but this leaves a film like cover on my face.</li>
            <li>I also like that it keeps my skin really moist, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the dry patches I normally have.</li>
            <li>but then I found this same product on here at half the price I grabbed it right away its a great product and at 60 percent off you cant go wrong grab yours today before theyre gone</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and highly recommend for any age including 60 plus.</li>
            <li>Not sure if you can post pictures on here, but if I could I would post a picture of my friend&#x27;s grandma who has been using Mary Kay since it&#x27;s been available.</li>
            <li>know these are present at very low levels (~3%), but those last two still made me laugh as I threw out my Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>but not least I bought my product straight from the Mary Kay dealer, so if any of the other comments are an indication it may just be safest to go that route as they will have non-expired product.</li>
            <li>The only thing I still can&#x27;t live without is my Estee Lauder Night Repair and</li>
            <li>my face either remains really dry, or it becomes very greasy feeling to the point where I can rub my skin and the stuff ROLLS OFF.</li>
            <li>Really works on my skin which is sensitive to other product brands.</li>
            <li>This Miracle Set is shown in the OLD packaging and that Day Solution IS DEFINITELY EXPIRED!  </li>
            <li>Go to Mary Kay actual website to find a consultant near you</li>
            <li>As i expected it thanks</li>
            <li>my skin seems to feel really soft the next moring.</li>
            <li>I suppose though, for the price, it was all worth the trouble</li>
            <li>I assumed I was just destined to have gross dry skin or really caked on makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often when I am in public with my granddaughter people think she is my daughter, though I am definitely old enough to have a grandchild.</li>
            <li>I used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics and loved their product, but am disappointed in their NEW products.  </li>
            <li>The Day Solution SPF 35 is a very thin fluid, like the Lancome SPF 50 Fluid, and I love that!  </li>
            <li>The dry skin line is the only one that gets rid of my adult acne and calms my rosacea!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other brands and systems, but the ONLY time I actually see and feel a difference, and much improvement, is when I use Mary Kay</li>
            <li>Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin</li>

            <li> However after adding the protection (spf day cream) and the moisturizer, I was in love.</li>

            <li> I love the Timewise Miracle Set because it has everything to start off right with a good skin  care routine.</li>
            <li> Very good product as always ,and the shipping was early than expected, very happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Moistures my skin and makes it feel wonderful all day long in any humidity.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is a great way to keep the face looking shiny and young.</li>
            <li> , I made sure it was a reputable online seller, that the exp was the freshest available</li>
            <li> I use it every single day and it is awesome on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> but so far I am happy with my purchase and even happier that it&#x27;s $30 cheaper than buying from a MK Rep.</li>
            <li> , the Cleanser is thick and creamy, perfect if you like to rinse your face and drown yourself in the sink, or like me its perfect to remove with a warm wet cloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to buying the products I love separate for now on, but if you love this set, I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked the price very much.</li>
            <li> my skin is looking more youth full since I started this beauty regiment morning and night.</li>
            <li> these all seemed fine and were in boxes, but the moisturizer seemed watery.  </li>
            <li> All seems fine.</li>
            <li> (I may or may not continue to use my own concoctions -- pure Vitamin E, oatmeal masks, 100 percent cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> and it was a huge savings even with shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay Timewise since it became available.</li>
            <li> I ran out of several items this was a great price.</li>
            <li> Even though when they sell Mary Kay, MK will give consultants free goody bags, discounts, and free products and not to mention they get paid for selling MK.</li>
            <li> I have smooth even toned skin now</li>
            <li> I think many of us assume we have the right color</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very useful, but I would recommend buying it by itself.</li>
            <li> that I will start using on winter time for my dark spots, it better work after all the great reviews I read</li>
            <li> Many of the sellers here are Mary Kay consultants that do fresh product and respond quickly</li>
            <li> So if anything else I am grateful that I now know exactly what color to use with foundation, but its more than that.</li>
            <li> Not only does my skin feel amazing, I feel more comfortable not wearing makeup on the weekends...</li>
            <li> Ultimately it was a great purchase for the right price.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to how its changed my face, but the quality and feel of it is what is impressing me right off!</li>
            <li> Right now, the Timewise collection is doing a fine job.)</li>
            <li> after usein for just 3 weeks i can see my face lookin brighter and healther love it,Mary Kay work for me fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have a closet full of the stuff</li>
            <li> It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products.</li>
            <li> It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly before we talked purchasing, the woman actually let me use the product.</li>
            <li> I love the Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser, gives a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and buying it thru Amazon is much easier.</li>
            <li> thank you so much will need more soon</li>
            <li> No bad skin reactions at all with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be surprised if you finish your set without wanting to take SOMETHING home - it really is that good.</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay set is a super value.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was what my wife was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and I think my 68 year old very sensitive skin shows that they have been kind to me.</li>
            <li> its my new favorite</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and helped my skin feel softer without being to much.  </li>
            <li> [There is actually more but its all pretty much don&#x27;t rub it in your eyes or huff the stuff.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Mary Kay!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and am in my early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> were you can get product worth your money,</li>
            <li> I just had a MK pampering session and the products were fresh and looked like this.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the set, and it wasn&#x27;t really worth it to me.</li>
            <li> And, because I&amp;#34;m worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I started using all these things my face is so nice to touch and look at, I do look younger!</li>
            <li> it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li> I love it even more when I can get it for less than full price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with some scarring on my face and the product has given my skin a softer, more moisturized look making the scars less prominent.</li>
            <li> I told her upfront that I was an extremely satisfied Bare Escentuals customer, and she would have to do a lot to impress</li>
            <li> but they are very helpful and its good to remember that they really do want to help you if only to get that sale.</li>
            <li> I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommended for women of a certain age, more or less:).</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> They very much do animal testing and try to cover it up.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Mary Kay Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft and blemish free all the time.</li>
            <li> My face definitely has a healthy glow to it when I use these two products.</li>
            <li> ;D  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything in this kit serves a purpose, and every layer you apply once it finishes and drys my face feels so much lighter, fresher, and breathable!</li>
            <li> skin looks more radiant and younger.</li>
            <li> Did not smell funny.</li>
            <li> After the first use, you can see and feel the difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, however it isn&#x27;t worth the asking price from Mary Kay or Amazon.</li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are pretty chatty which can be off putting</li>
            <li> This product is light, non greasy and makes the skin feel soft and moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li> I saved dollars by purchasing my Mary Kay from Amazon and it was exactly what I had been</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I will definitely make this my top skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> First, I must say that I am reviewing product purchased from a Mary Kay consultant, not from a third-party seller.</li>
            <li> Third, I can&#x27;t believe how much I love with the Mary Kay Timewise line.</li>
            <li> so I could get my money back or exchanged it for something that would work better for my skin.</li>
            <li> The TimeWise Miracle Set for normal/dry skin I ordered was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like a lot of items to put on and in what order etc</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I sure missed it and felt a difference in my face especially not having the items for night.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and the night gel is really comfortable.  </li>
            <li> i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li> She stated she needs more time to notice a difference, she has only been using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> They went against their word in order to be able to sell to the Chinese market.  </li>
            <li> Helps with acne and just plain smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried products by other popular brands on the market, but they don&#x27;t even come close to nourishing and moisturizing the skin the way the Miracle Set does.</li>
            <li> The same product ordered from different seller works good.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten anything I absolutely did not like, although I do use mostly the same things all the time.</li>
            <li> So far so good, there is no difference from other products I have been using, I hope to see a difference with the Microdermabrasion Set  </li>
            <li> so I had very high hopes for this set.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a little while now but never seen it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I never noticed much difference when I used the Night Solution</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was not damaged.  </li>
            <li> The consultants are very accomodating.</li>
            <li> But I always buy them from Mary Kay agent which was very pricey.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem dropping that much money on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The night time syrum really gave my skin</li>
            <li> As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products.</li>
            <li> So really what is the real difference?</li>
            <li> So you know this review is from a real consultant ....</li>
            <li> If you want a REAL Mary Kay review, all you have to do is find an MK sales representative in her 30s or 40s with 10 or so years of experience.</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s very good&lt;</li>
            <li> The price was 95$ for the whole set through mary kay.</li>
            <li> I actually feel comfortable doing just that.</li>
            <li> its really a dependable product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> It really works too.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the sunscreen as much leaves my face shiny.</li>
            <li> so great...got it very soon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really off putting and aside from upping my liquid intake</li>
            <li> My face was so soft and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> much like my face had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as it pains me to say, I do suggest you visit a mary kay consultant if you have</li>
            <li> The product really does sell itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> but I am really 32.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> The product received is the real deal and not expired as some others had posted</li>
            <li> I am very happpy with this choice.</li>
            <li> you much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Second, as someone who has been accosted by overzealous Mary Kay reps over the years, I have steadfastly eschewed the company.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a differents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 10+ years and it helps to prevent wrinkles and keeps my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and works very well.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a great deal more expensive (though MUCH cheaper here than ANYWHERE else) than the other brands, it is so worth it, because it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has SERIOUSLY helped to smooth out my skin, lines wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I would suggest other products which in the end will be a lot cheaper and show more results.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Price on amazon significantly lower than from a personal Mary Kay consultant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and love it!</li>
            <li> agreed to a make-over, although I went into the experience thinking, yes, I&#x27;ll do the facial and smile politely, but I&#x27;m just interested in checking out the mineral powder line.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I still had the old one from my old bottle, so all I needed to do was switch them out.</li>
            <li> I am honestly shocked that this line works this well and feels SO good, it is for SURE worth the $100 from a Rep in your area, and you&#x27;re supporting someone local.  </li>
            <li> This has actually made me have more acne than I had before, right in the center of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Brand new!</li>
            <li> After using this set for 2-3 weeks my skin started breaking out more, skin has less even tone than before.</li>
            <li> I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I love the sirem it is also now part of my daily facial routine.</li>
            <li> only 35 and have skin that is in super shape</li>
            <li> I did not buy this particular set from amazon, I&#x27;m reviewing the product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest buying Mary Kay off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> is OLD product - buyer beware!!  </li>
            <li> the age of 51, I have used nothing but water to cleanse my skin for years as most cleansers have a harsh, drying effect.</li>
            <li> MK made a change to the Day Solution a few years ago which changed the consistency of the lotion, it is much runnier where I preferred the old consistency which was more like the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that my skin would tighten or appear more firm.  </li>
            <li> Time Wise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled to find Mary Kay products here at Amazon where I make upwards of 80% of my purchases of all kinds: shoes, dog gear, movies, gifts, tools, auto parts, mechanical items, electronics,  I mean almost everything I buy comes from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the TimeWise Miracle Set, especially for normal to dry skin!</li>
            <li> In new condition.</li>
            <li> I saw results sooner than that, but after two weeks I felt like I had brand new skin.</li>
            <li> Perfectly new bottles in new boxes.</li>
            <li> It all came sealed in new boxes.  </li>
            <li> She went the extra mile and showed me just why it&#x27;s important to take all these steps before applying makeup by doing a simple test on my arm.</li>
            <li> have your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I try to use as little as possible to make sure I&#x27;m not putting too much</li>
            <li> I know a personal representative, but better price with Amazon was the way I had to go due to budget resprictions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same exact product, with the same exact quality.</li>
            <li> in short I will definitely continue to use this product to clean my face</li>
            <li> Someone told me the other day it looked like a chemical burn, that&#x27;s how bad this messed my skin up, and my skin wasn&#x27;t great to begin with, but it was better than it is now.</li>
            <li> It works well and lasts a long time using it twice per day, as I don&#x27;t really need to use much.</li>
            <li> The foundation went on smoothly and evenly on the clean wrist and on the other it wouldn&#x27;t spread, looked blotchy and was just a complete mess -</li>
            <li> I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally.</li>
            <li> considering I saved about half off the original price.</li>
            <li> and this clearly helped me having a healthier skin</li>
            <li> keep my skin clear even during the driest season.</li>
            <li> this is an old set.</li>
            <li> You can find a consultant near you.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days??</li>
            <li> Firm, smooth and even glowing.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You can get as much hydration and same results from cheaper products.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper then buying them from the actual Mary Kay website!</li>
            <li> the box looks old and has no seal.</li>
            <li> My skin feels as dewy and soft now as it was in my 30s.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensative skin which getting used to the same skin care line, so I have to change my routine every year.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help with early signs of aging but this leaves a film like cover on my face.</li>
            <li> I also like that it keeps my skin really moist, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the dry patches I normally have.</li>
            <li> but then I found this same product on here at half the price I grabbed it right away its a great product and at 60 percent off you cant go wrong grab yours today before theyre gone</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and highly recommend for any age including 60 plus.</li>
            <li> Not sure if you can post pictures on here, but if I could I would post a picture of my friend&#x27;s grandma who has been using Mary Kay since it&#x27;s been available.</li>
            <li> know these are present at very low levels (~3%), but those last two still made me laugh as I threw out my Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> but not least I bought my product straight from the Mary Kay dealer, so if any of the other comments are an indication it may just be safest to go that route as they will have non-expired product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I still can&#x27;t live without is my Estee Lauder Night Repair and</li>
            <li> my face either remains really dry, or it becomes very greasy feeling to the point where I can rub my skin and the stuff ROLLS OFF.</li>
            <li> Really works on my skin which is sensitive to other product brands.</li>
            <li> This Miracle Set is shown in the OLD packaging and that Day Solution IS DEFINITELY EXPIRED!  </li>
            <li> Go to Mary Kay actual website to find a consultant near you</li>
            <li> As i expected it thanks</li>
            <li> my skin seems to feel really soft the next moring.</li>
            <li> I suppose though, for the price, it was all worth the trouble</li>
            <li> I assumed I was just destined to have gross dry skin or really caked on makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often when I am in public with my granddaughter people think she is my daughter, though I am definitely old enough to have a grandchild.</li>
            <li> I used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics and loved their product, but am disappointed in their NEW products.  </li>
            <li> The Day Solution SPF 35 is a very thin fluid, like the Lancome SPF 50 Fluid, and I love that!  </li>
            <li> The dry skin line is the only one that gets rid of my adult acne and calms my rosacea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other brands and systems, but the ONLY time I actually see and feel a difference, and much improvement, is when I use Mary Kay</li>
            <li> Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have what I would consider normal skin, but I can&#x27;t handle it feeling tight at all -</li>
            <li> My face is dry and I had problems finding products that did not dry my face out.</li>
            <li> My face is dry and I had problems finding products that did not dry my face out.</li>
            <li> Not certain how fresh the product is, as I have not had the usual results.</li>
            <li> The slight wrinkle that only I could see, I can barely see anymore, and I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> We went through the motions on our wrists, cleaning and applying moisturizer on one arm while leaving the other completely bare.</li>
            <li> Using for long time.</li>
            <li> it take too long, so please check.</li>
            <li> &quot; Mary Kay consultant I know that has been selling and using all of the products for a long time are a walking/breathing review.</li>
            <li> It cleared all the acne I&#x27;ve struggled long ago to get rid of. ..</li>
            <li> The product seems like it have been setting in storage too long , it had a damp basement smell</li>
            <li> This set was not old or expired.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my very dry and sensitive skin for a few years.</li>
            <li> The items were not old, expired or anything but what was advertised!</li>
            <li> I sent this to a soldier in Afghanistan who was complaining about dry skin</li>
            <li> so I always purchase all my skincare for Dry Skin, it does not make me oily</li>
            <li> dry, not oily, and neither set</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do that though, and all of the dry patches were gone.</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t dry in some places and oily in others.</li>
            <li> It can be bought as a set or single what ever you need</li>
            <li> even if you think you&#x27;re oily, face wash for oily skin will dry your face out!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 30 with one slight wrinkle that apparently only I can see (according to my friends and family)</li>
            <li> I switched to the timewise combo/oily set and felt my face was often left feeling dehydrated and tight.</li>
            <li> Recently I was told that I looked at least 10 years younger than I am...</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday for the last 4-5 years.  </li>
            <li> the CURRENT Day Solutions are in pink bottles with black writing and a black pump....</li>
            <li> It is a little strange that none of the ingredients are posted on any of the packaging except for on the spf lotion.</li>
            <li> I have dry, trouble and acne prone skin along with minimal signs of aging.</li>
            <li> this is against Mary Kay policy to sell product on websites like this and you will receive old, no good product.</li>
            <li> She ended up having a bunch of other soldiers ordering it for themselves because it worked soooooo well.</li>
            <li> Always have to follow up with other products to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product and wish I had gotten it through a Mary Kay consultant</li>
            <li> like I do with other products</li>
            <li> but I thought I would look at other products.</li>
            <li> Every night before bed, I go into the bathroom, close the door behind me and pamper myself --just a little, doesn&#x27;t take too much time at all, so NO guilt.</li>
            <li> so I keep using it in hopes that it will clear up, but it just gets worse, now I&#x27;ve got cystic acne on my jaw that I have to take an antibiotic to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Usually exfoliants make my face turn a burning red color and leave me looking like I baked my face at uneven temps.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lotions all had that old-lotion smell and my face did not feel fresh as usual after application.</li>
            <li> It decreases wrinkle appearance and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay has skincare down.</li>
            <li> I was severely let down by this</li>
            <li> My skin freaks out from other products!</li>
            <li> Seriously every \\&quot;middle aged\\</li>
            <li> I suppose - but seems to have a slightly oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> It was not expired and came really quickly so no issue there like everyone says.</li>
            <li> it was full of wrinkles and bad chapped..</li>
            <li> i was a little worried because&lt;</li>
            <li> ahead, get yourself a little something.</li>
            <li> My skin appears to sag a little.</li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using the TimeWise Miracle set, I started to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Now, a few years since I stared using TimeWise , I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product and I had heavy rashes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin</li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using the TimeWise Miracle set, I started to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Now, a few years since I stared using TimeWise , I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would save a few dollars and buy the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle set through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Im using it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this TimeWise for a few years now, I like how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s pore-clogging and too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other moisturizers and never liked the feel of them on my face</li>
            <li> Also, ignore the comments and ratings left by angry consultants (typically they rated the item a 1).</li>
            <li> As long as I continue to get dramatic results like these, I will remain a devoted Mary Kay customer.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Mary Kay in the past.</li>
            <li> Not what I had remembered from past</li>
            <li> Wife like this, not sure why.</li>
            <li> - I will always purchase an expensive Lancome night cream to go over this set at night, but I am DONE paying super crazy prices for all the steps before my night creams.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have one wrinkle in her neck and hardly any in her face.</li>
            <li> Follow the regime for at least two weeks before you make any judgement calls.</li>
            <li> No nice scent, face wash feels like plastic and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bad batch, or maybe I need to buy it from an actual seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Im not sure why people think that this product is expired or in the wrong packaging.</li>
            <li> but I gave one star off because it took forever to get to me and arrived 5 days after the EDA, and another star because the pump on my night solution was broken.</li>
            <li> BUT In exchange for those 2 things I have disgusting breakout along my chin line and all over my cheeks ( a place I usually never have acne)</li>
            <li> Per Mary Kay policy it is illegal to sell any of their products on Amazon, eBay etc.....</li>
            <li> but I got the wrong cleanser.  </li>
            <li> how can you go wrong with mary kay?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal to sell Mary Kay on here and eBay</li>
            <li> I hate doing these things because I know they are just concerned with a sale</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Used for a month, and my skin was the worst it has ever been.</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Using for long time. Really works on my skin which is sensitive to other product brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay Timewise since it became available. I credit this skin care system for the condition of my skin. Often when I am in public with my granddaughter people think she is my daughter, though I am definitely old enough to have a grandchild. Thanks, Mary Kay Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> So far so good, there is no difference from other products I have been using, I hope to see a difference with the Microdermabrasion Set  that I will start using on winter time for my dark spots, it better work after all the great reviews I read</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep my skin in good condition when I used it day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love love Mary Kay,i have used MK in the pass and i had stop nothing work for my face the was MK works for my face,after usein for just 3 weeks i can see my face lookin brighter and healther love it,Mary Kay work for me fast shipping too glad that i can get them on amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look younger and feel softer.</li>
            <li> I joined Mary Kay because I wanted to use the product, not sell it.  I have a closet full of the stuff and I use it everyday for the last 4-5 years.  My skin is baby soft and blemish free all the time. My husband compliments my skin and so do strangers. I love this set!!</li>
            <li> Received before scheduled and everything was as stated.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! My skin freaks out from other products! Mary Kay has skincare down. I will never switch face products again!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  excellent price.</li>
            <li> Per Mary Kay policy it is illegal to sell any of their products on Amazon, eBay etc.....</li>
            <li> Awesome. Not 100% potent. Not certain how fresh the product is, as I have not had the usual results. However, I have been off MK for over a year. Maybe it&#x27;s just the adjustment period. AMAZING fast Shipping and great packaging. Probably Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products and am happy that I can purchase them through Amazon.com. I know a personal representative, but better price with Amazon was the way I had to go due to budget resprictions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set from my Mary Kay consultant. I love the TimeWiseÂ® 3-In-1 Cleanser &amp; the Age-Fighting Moisturizer, but never replaced the Day Solution with Sunscreen or the Night Solution. When I need sunscreen I use a store bought brand &amp; apply it when necessary. I never noticed much difference when I used the Night Solution so I use the age-fighting moisturizer twice a day. Throughout the years, I was never one to take extra care of my skin &amp; have never had any problems with it. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles and am in my early 60&#x27;s. Having said all that, I can see a difference in my skin when I use the cleanser and the age-fighting moisturizer. My face definitely has a healthy glow to it when I use these two products. I&#x27;ve tried a few other moisturizers and never liked the feel of them on my face &amp; I don&#x27;t like the smell of them. Mary Kay&#x27;s Age-Fighting Moisturizer is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for many years and am very satisfied with the product. It is a good moisturizer, without a greasy feel.  I use it every day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> This Miracle Set is shown in the OLD packaging and that Day Solution IS DEFINITELY EXPIRED!  There is a sticker on the bottom of the bottle that has the expiration date...it is a white bottle with a gold pump....the CURRENT Day Solutions are in pink bottles with black writing and a black pump....so don&#x27;t buy these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is OLD product - buyer beware!!  Buy from a CURRENT Mary Kay Consultant whose products are CURRENT!!</li>
            <li> Great! The product was good. In new condition. I liked the price very much. Great buy must go for it!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. this is against Mary Kay policy to sell product on websites like this and you will receive old, no good product. Go to Mary Kay actual website to find a consultant near you were you can get product worth your money,</li>
            <li> I tried everything for my acne  and this clearly helped me having a healthier skin</li>
            <li> this is an old set. This is NOT the current Miracle Set Packaging. Go to Marykay.com. You can find a consultant near you.</li>
            <li> excellent, i have used this product for 5 years, am very pleased with the results.  i especially like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Will be ordering again. Fast shipping and great product. My face loves it :)</li>
            <li> My wife buys it every time it ends, so, try figure it out if she likes it or not! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was not damaged.  I would buy this again (this is my second purchase).</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  Perfectly packaged so no damage could occur, new boxes, a bag inside another bag!  Will order from this venue again!</li>
            <li> Awesome products and my skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the products she gets from Mary Kay.  She must as she sure pays a lot for them.</li>
            <li> Miracle was sending one of a set of separately Why are you not there yet?&lt;br /&gt;Does it take too long, so please check.</li>
            <li> These products should not be bought on this website.  Most of the items that are shown are expired products, you can tell by the packaging.  If you do not like what you buy or buy something that is expired you have no recourse.  However if you buy from a Mary Kay consultant you have 100% guarantee by either a refund or a replacement.  I noticed that one person on the comment section from the above comment said she didn&#x27;t like pushy sales people.  The sales people are not being pushy, they are trying to help you purchase what you need.  If you do not want something, simply say \\&quot;no thank you\\&quot;.  You can always buy on a consultants website through Mary Kay and just ask them to deliver to your home and that you will just order from the website when you want something.  The consultants are very accomodating.</li>
            <li> This is a great prouct at bargain price given its results. It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products. I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out. I even had a prescription medication that did not work. I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products. A few weeks after I started using the TimeWise Miracle set, I started to see a difference. Now, a few years since I stared using TimeWise , I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore. And my skin looks amazing.  I love that they have the normal/dry line. My face is dry and I had problems finding products that did not dry my face out. I recommend the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set to anyone having trouble with breakouts, or to anyone who wants to have younger, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this set before and I know that my skin loved it. But I always buy them from Mary Kay agent which was very pricey.  When I saw this set, I crossed my finger for the same quality.  It was the same quality but I got the wrong cleanser.  Ultimately it was a great purchase for the right price.</li>
            <li> This was awesome for the price. It is affordable and a great product. I will continue to use it and buy it online.</li>
            <li> I sent this to a soldier in Afghanistan who was complaining about dry skin and she loved it! She said it was a life saver.  The product arrived very quickly and was in perfect shape.  She ended up having a bunch of other soldiers ordering it for themselves because it worked soooooo well.</li>
            <li> Im not sure why people think that this product is expired or in the wrong packaging. I just had a MK pampering session and the products were fresh and looked like this. Anyhow I&#x27;ve been using the product only two days and already see a difference in my skin. I will be a longtime customer of Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I love the sirem it is also now part of my daily facial routine. Gives firmness I&#x27;m almost 50 so I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Mary Kay - when I couldn&#x27;t get a call back locally from a rep, I made sure it was a reputable online seller, that the exp was the freshest available and I ordered at 50% OFF Online! :D  Happy!! :D  I have what I would consider normal skin, but I can&#x27;t handle it feeling tight at all - so I always purchase all my skincare for Dry Skin, it does not make me oily so it works for me.  I ordered this set in the Normal/Dry and I purchased the Timewise Firming Eye Cream to go with it, also at 50%off.  I have been SO blown away and beyond impressed with each piece, the Cleanser is thick and creamy, perfect if you like to rinse your face and drown yourself in the sink, or like me its perfect to remove with a warm wet cloth.  The Night Solution (I just purchased another so I can use it all over my chest and neck and not run out) is AMAZING and light.  The Day Solution SPF 35 is a very thin fluid, like the Lancome SPF 50 Fluid, and I love that!  I do put the Anti-Aging Cream over it (that comes with this set) and it gives the most AMAZING primer/dewy effect to your makeup (Estee Doublewear.)  All in all I am beyond impressed with everything here - I will always purchase an expensive Lancome night cream to go over this set at night, but I am DONE paying super crazy prices for all the steps before my night creams.  The only thing I still can&#x27;t live without is my Estee Lauder Night Repair and my amazing smelling Lancome Night Creams.  I am honestly shocked that this line works this well and feels SO good, it is for SURE worth the $100 from a Rep in your area, and you&#x27;re supporting someone local.  I&#x27;m a skincare snob and I was almost against Mary Kay, I have always been grossed out when people talk about it or suggest me using it - shame on me! ;D  I&amp;#34;m only 35 and have skin that is in super shape so I can&#x27;t attest to how its changed my face, but the quality and feel of it is what is impressing me right off!</li>
            <li> Been using MK Timewise for over 12 years now, nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product and I had heavy rashes on my skin. The same product ordered from different seller works good. Will never order from this site.</li>
            <li> these all seemed fine and were in boxes, but the moisturizer seemed watery.  I might buy them again, but I felt they could have been compromised.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through my consultant, even though its cheaper here I had no problem dropping that much money on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything in this kit serves a purpose, and every layer you apply once it finishes and drys my face feels so much lighter, fresher, and breathable! The night time syrum really gave my skin the extra &amp;#34;unf&amp;#34; after wearing my make up all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. I ran out of several items this was a great price. win win situation:)</li>
            <li> best face wash ever used!!</li>
            <li> This review is regarding the product, not the amazon seller. Iâve been on Mary Kay for about 7 years now. I started my MK regime on the timewise normal/dry set and felt my face was often left feeling greasy and looking shiny. I switched to the timewise combo/oily set and felt my face was often left feeling dehydrated and tight. I switched things around a bit and paired the normal/dry cleanser with the combo/oily moisturizer and love the outcome.  If your skin is in the middleâ¦.not dry, not oily, and neither set works for youâ¦try combing the sets. It worked for me and I couldnât be happier.</li>
            <li> mary kay works like magic... you can start noticing the difference form the 3rd day itself...skin looks more radiant and younger. its been more than a month for me that i have gone for a skin treatment to the parlor and i don&#x27;t thing i even need one...the skin renewal process that takes place in the night after you have applied the night solution is drastic...you wake up looking one tone fairer. mary kay  has always been my choice ...its been my brand since 3 years now and i don&#x27;t think i am going back to any thing else.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days?? As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products. I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally. I even hold phone consultations to talk about their skin needs and check up with them weekly over the phone or email, so sometimes I never meet my clients person to person. So really what is the real difference? Our job is to help educate and help women with feeling more beautiful about themselves no matter where they are located or what their \\&quot; Budget\\&quot; is. Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide. Just don&#x27;t get caught! &#x3D;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know if something is current just go to our website. I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coty Geiser&lt;br /&gt; So you know this review is from a real consultant .... Marykay.com/CotyGeiser</li>
            <li> The product was perfect! The expiration date was stamped on the night solution with plenty of time to spare.  Did not smell funny. The consistency of the products are what I would get from a MK Consultant. I will purchase my products from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> If you want a REAL Mary Kay review, all you have to do is find an MK sales representative in her 30s or 40s with 10 or so years of experience. Seriously every \\&quot;middle aged\\&quot; Mary Kay consultant I know that has been selling and using all of the products for a long time are a walking/breathing review. They all look amazing and so youthful. Not sure if you can post pictures on here, but if I could I would post a picture of my friend&#x27;s grandma who has been using Mary Kay since it&#x27;s been available. She&#x27;s 70 and I swear she looks like she is 40. She doesn&#x27;t have one wrinkle in her neck and hardly any in her face.</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;i been using it so its good&lt;br /&gt;now.. the delivery.. i was a little worried because&lt;br /&gt;i can track me package but.. it was earlier&lt;br /&gt;one of the boxes inside was ruined..&lt;br /&gt;Bad presentation! it came in a Mary Kay bag&lt;br /&gt;but it was full of wrinkles and bad chapped..</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a little while now but never seen it at such a great price.  Everything came as decribed, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I like most all of the products that I use from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bad batch, or maybe I need to buy it from an actual seller. This stuff is horrible if you have oily skin. Used for a month, and my skin was the worst it has ever been. Breakouts, and redness. Would definitely not repurchase, definitely not Suggs to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I love the TimeWise Miracle Set, especially for normal to dry skin! I&#x27;ve tried products by other popular brands on the market, but they don&#x27;t even come close to nourishing and moisturizing the skin the way the Miracle Set does. I&#x27;ve turned my mother on to the set also. After the first use, you can see and feel the difference in your skin.  I can see myself using this product for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> All seems fine. Expiration date had passed though.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this particular set from amazon, I&#x27;m reviewing the product otherwise. I have had trouble skin, I&#x27;m 30 with one slight wrinkle that apparently only I can see (according to my friends and family) I tried this and bought this from a mary kay consultant. The price was 95$ for the whole set through mary kay. Now when I tried this it made my skin feel great. I have dry, trouble and acne prone skin along with minimal signs of aging. This made my skin break out terribly. There are things I like about it though as well. The slight wrinkle that only I could see, I can barely see anymore, and I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 3 weeks. I also like that it keeps my skin really moist, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the dry patches I normally have. BUT In exchange for those 2 things I have disgusting breakout along my chin line and all over my cheeks ( a place I usually never have acne) This has actually made me have more acne than I had before, right in the center of my cheeks. Someone told me the other day it looked like a chemical burn, that&#x27;s how bad this messed my skin up, and my skin wasn&#x27;t great to begin with, but it was better than it is now. I do like the anti aging effects though so I keep using it in hopes that it will clear up, but it just gets worse, now I&#x27;ve got cystic acne on my jaw that I have to take an antibiotic to get rid of. I was severely let down by this, I had great hopes for it. I&#x27;ll be contacting the consultant to get my money back. I have a wedding in a month that I need to get my skin cleared up for. Its a shame because I did notice the anti-aging effects, but whatever is in this is killing my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels brighter and healthier. It&#x27;s still adjusting so I still get a pimple here and there but so far I am happy with my purchase and even happier that it&#x27;s $30 cheaper than buying from a MK Rep.</li>
            <li> Great deal fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has SERIOUSLY helped to smooth out my skin, lines wrinkles, etc. Follow the regime for at least two weeks before you make any judgement calls. I saw results sooner than that, but after two weeks I felt like I had brand new skin. Firm, smooth and even glowing. I never ever leave the house without makeup and with timewise...I actually feel comfortable doing just that.</li>
            <li> Made me break out!!! Would not recommend for people with sensitive skin. Faithful mary kay user but this did not work for me</li>
            <li> I really like this product, however it isn&#x27;t worth the asking price from Mary Kay or Amazon. You can get as much hydration and same results from cheaper products. I&#x27;ve used better face wash products than the Timewise, that exfoliate and leave my skin a lot smoother and softer. The lotion is very useful, but I would recommend buying it by itself. I would suggest other products which in the end will be a lot cheaper and show more results. Also, ignore the comments and ratings left by angry consultants (typically they rated the item a 1). They come on here and purposely rate the products as low scores, because they lose business when someone buys on here instead of them. Even though when they sell Mary Kay, MK will give consultants free goody bags, discounts, and free products and not to mention they get paid for selling MK. I would highly suggest buying Mary Kay off Amazon. It&#x27;s the same exact product, with the same exact quality. If you have problems with your amazon order, then request a refund or contact your seller. If the problem isn&#x27;t resolved you can always write an Amazon A-Z guarantee form which has Amazon resolve the issue. I love Mary Kay products, and will always buy them on Amazon. I just didn&#x27;t like the set, and it wasn&#x27;t really worth it to me. I&#x27;ll stick to buying the products I love separate for now on, but if you love this set, I guess it&#x27;s worth it. But don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t tell ya so!</li>
            <li> Great products at Bargain Prices, these products are fresh and not expired. Many of the sellers here are Mary Kay consultants that do fresh product and respond quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.....recive on time....</li>
            <li> As i expected it thanks</li>
            <li> Love it.  Love the price.  Hope to buy again online.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 star rating because this product is good for my face as my maintenance.  I can rececommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> It cleared all the acne I&#x27;ve struggled long ago to get rid of. ..its really a dependable product. Thanks to Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Very good product as always ,and the shipping was early than expected, very happy with the product and the seller. Will buy from here again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is for my daughter..can&#x27;t wait to get her started on Mary Kaye....</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the products.  I felt I saved money by buying the combined products rather than ordering individual ones.</li>
            <li> Love ALL Mary Kay products!</li>
            <li> LOVE this set!  It really works too.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Have used Mary Kay products for 30+ years.  I continually get compliments on my complexion.  &#x27;Believe the 3-in-1 Cleanser is very effective.</li>
            <li> Great product!  The items were not old, expired or anything but what was advertised!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!  Love the product.  Works amazing for me.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from a consultant that charged me 30 dollars extra. I&#x27;m the kind of person that are good with products at the beginning so I had very high hopes for this set. I feel like the products are generic. Nothing special. No nice scent, face wash feels like plastic and even if you think you&#x27;re oily, face wash for oily skin will dry your face out! The day cream feels like watery sun screen that&#x27;s all..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for every age! It is gentle on skin. Helps with acne and just plain smells good. I use the night creamand my face is like a baby&#x27;s bum in the morning :)</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for years</li>
            <li> Works well on my skin - and I&#x27;ve used this product before. Recommended for women of a certain age, more or less:).</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and helped my skin feel softer without being to much.  I don&#x27;t use the sunscreen as much leaves my face shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, but it was a stretch to be able to afford it. Now through Amazon, I can afford it. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> This is a great prouct at bargain price given its results. It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products. I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out. I even had a prescription medication that did not work. I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s other products. A few weeks after I started using the TimeWise Miracle set, I started to see a difference. Now, a few years since I stared using TimeWise , I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore. And my skin looks amazing.  I love that they have the normal/dry line. My face is dry and I had problems finding products that did not dry my face out. I recommend the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set to anyone having trouble with breakouts, or to anyone who wants to have younger, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Mary Kay in the past. After rumors of carcinogens in their products I decided to investigate myself. It is a little strange that none of the ingredients are posted on any of the packaging except for on the spf lotion. I looked up the msds on sigmaaldrich.com (a chemical supply company) for any hazards on the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;octinoxate (7.5%W/W) - none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;octisalate (5%W/W) - none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc oxide (3.88% W/W) - toxic to aquatic life. May have harmful long-lasting effects to aquatic life. Avoid release into the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oxybenzone (3% W/W) - Causes skin irritation. Wash skin thoroughly after handling. IF ON SKIN: wash with plenty of soap and water. Causes eye irritation. May cause respiratory irritation. Avoid breathing dust/fume/gas/mist/vapours/spray. Wear protective gloves/eye protection/face protection. [There is actually more but its all pretty much don&#x27;t rub it in your eyes or huff the stuff.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these are present at very low levels (~3%), but those last two still made me laugh as I threw out my Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin and this product is a wonder. Very gentle on skin and very refreshing. Moistures my skin and makes it feel wonderful all day long in any humidity. Price on amazon significantly lower than from a personal Mary Kay consultant.</li>
            <li> Brand new! I love it!</li>
            <li> What a great way to treat you face. Others will definately notice the difference. You will too! So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> so great...got it very soon and it is just as it was described. how can you go wrong with mary kay?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal to sell Mary Kay on here and eBay</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price!!!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin. Always have, and it seems that regardless of what I use, my face either remains really dry, or it becomes very greasy feeling to the point where I can rub my skin and the stuff ROLLS OFF. It&#x27;s really off putting and aside from upping my liquid intake I assumed I was just destined to have gross dry skin or really caked on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product ONCE and noticed an instant difference. I visited a Mary Kay consultant on a whim through a friend. I hate doing these things because I know they are just concerned with a sale so they will say whatever I want to hear to convince me to shell out the money. Surprisingly before we talked purchasing, the woman actually let me use the product. Immediately after just using the face wash I noticed a difference. Usually exfoliants make my face turn a burning red color and leave me looking like I baked my face at uneven temps. This didn&#x27;t do that though, and all of the dry patches were gone. So I was already amazed. However after adding the protection (spf day cream) and the moisturizer, I was in love. My face was so soft and fresh looking. I followed it up with foundation (the only reason I visited was because I was hoping I would get some tips on what color I should use for my face as I seem to fail at even the most simple of tasks) and she must have selected the most perfect match because I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had it on but my face was all one color. So if anything else I am grateful that I now know exactly what color to use with foundation, but its more than that. She went the extra mile and showed me just why it&#x27;s important to take all these steps before applying makeup by doing a simple test on my arm. We went through the motions on our wrists, cleaning and applying moisturizer on one arm while leaving the other completely bare. Then we added some foundation. It was painfully obvious why the extra steps before are needed. The foundation went on smoothly and evenly on the clean wrist and on the other it wouldn&#x27;t spread, looked blotchy and was just a complete mess - much like my face had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short I will definitely continue to use this product to clean my face and I do recommend getting foundation to use afterward. As much as it pains me to say, I do suggest you visit a mary kay consultant if you haven&#x27;t yet if only to learn what color of foundation will work best for you. I think many of us assume we have the right color but when you see the difference the *perfect* color makes, you&#x27;ll be amazed. They are pretty chatty which can be off putting but they are very helpful and its good to remember that they really do want to help you if only to get that sale. You are under no obligation to buy but I&#x27;ll be surprised if you finish your set without wanting to take SOMETHING home - it really is that good. The product really does sell itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least I bought my product straight from the Mary Kay dealer, so if any of the other comments are an indication it may just be safest to go that route as they will have non-expired product.</li>
            <li> I have not used all of the set yet.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the cleanser - WHICH IS BEYOND GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I have used the daytime cream with spf - It was runny.  Not what I had remembered from past purchases.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the nightime or the daily lotion.  I am hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> This is Chris&#x27; wife writing this review.  I have been using this product since I was 21 and people still think I am 21 but I am really 32.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for years, this products are the best for my skin.. I love the Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser, gives a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> This product is light, non greasy and makes the skin feel soft and moisturized immediately.  I have used this for several years and highly recommend for any age including 60 plus.</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay set is a super value.  It was the best price that I had found anywhere.  My wife really likes Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> These products are usually great. I thought that I would save a few dollars and buy the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle set through Amazon. Unfortunately, the lotions all had that old-lotion smell and my face did not feel fresh as usual after application. I love Amazon, but I won&#x27;t buy Mary Kay through them again.</li>
            <li> The product received is the real deal and not expired as some others had posted but I gave one star off because it took forever to get to me and arrived 5 days after the EDA, and another star because the pump on my night solution was broken. Luckily, I still had the old one from my old bottle, so all I needed to do was switch them out. I suppose though, for the price, it was all worth the trouble considering I saved about half off the original price.</li>
            <li> I  love the product and it was shipped to me within a couple of days.  I am very happpy with this choice.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was what my wife was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy, therefore I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
            <li> I saved dollars by purchasing my Mary Kay from Amazon and it was exactly what I had been&lt;br /&gt;paying more for.</li>
            <li> Love it, I have used this product before and it does a great job on my skin. It decreases wrinkle appearance and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m especially fond of the sun screen protection&lt;br /&gt;which is SPF 35...awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you much.</li>
            <li> The product seems like it have been setting in storage too long , it had a damp basement smell</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom she loves it! So much cheaper then buying them from the actual Mary Kay website! definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.  Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love it! Im using it everyday and I can see the improvement.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for years. These prices are cheaper than the reps prices.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  My skin has shown great improvement since I started using this product.  I will definitely make this my top skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay products are the best for my skin ( normal /dry skin) . Highly recommend the product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> this product is really good to all skin types  the best</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift (I&#x27;ve been asking for it for a couple of years now) that I adore. Every night before bed, I go into the bathroom, close the door behind me and pamper myself --just a little, doesn&#x27;t take too much time at all, so NO guilt. I used to sell Mary Kay years and years ago--I know how well the system and products work. (Beautifully! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other brands and systems, but the ONLY time I actually see and feel a difference, and much improvement, is when I use Mary Kay Time Wise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled to find Mary Kay products here at Amazon where I make upwards of 80% of my purchases of all kinds: shoes, dog gear, movies, gifts, tools, auto parts, mechanical items, electronics,  I mean almost everything I buy comes from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s a great deal more expensive (though MUCH cheaper here than ANYWHERE else) than the other brands, it is so worth it, because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to steal from another ad campaign: And, because I&amp;#34;m worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, get yourself a little something. YOU deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;(The eye/firming cream and zit cream also work incredibly well--if you&#x27;re in the market.(</li>
            <li> I have use these products for years.  I have never gotten anything I absolutely did not like, although I do use mostly the same things all the time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years &amp; the pricing has gone out of the roof, to find it at a discounted price is a great find.</li>
            <li> The Miracle set is just so-so for me. I like the lotion and night solution - when used to together my skin seems to feel really soft the next moring. The day solution smells like sunscreen - but that is it&#x27;s purpose I suppose - but seems to have a slightly oily feel to it. I do not like the cleanser. There is no cleaning to it - leaves make up everywhere. Always have to follow up with other products to finish the job.  Won&#x27;t by set again - maybe just the two I like from it seperately. But the price on amazon def. cheaper than Mary Kay website/consultant.</li>
            <li> I like this set but it&#x27;s great if they have seal. the box looks old and has no seal. the bottle also has no seal. It&#x27;s not good. if i come back again, how can you solve this problem for me? Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. I use it every single day and it is awesome on my skin.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother. She said is was ok.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would buy it again. But I don&#x27;t think anything works as well as people claim.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so Dewey.</li>
            <li> First, I must say that I am reviewing product purchased from a Mary Kay consultant, not from a third-party seller. Second, as someone who has been accosted by overzealous Mary Kay reps over the years, I have steadfastly eschewed the company. Third, I can&#x27;t believe how much I love with the Mary Kay Timewise line. I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what happened. I actually accosted a Mary Kay salesperson on the street. She had a stunning hair-color combo, and I wanted to know more. In turn, she gave me her card, and I felt obligated to return the favor. I told her upfront that I was an extremely satisfied Bare Escentuals customer, and she would have to do a lot to impress me.&lt;br /&gt;I agreed to a make-over, although I went into the experience thinking, yes, I&#x27;ll do the facial and smile politely, but I&#x27;m just interested in checking out the mineral powder line. But after trying the cleanser, moisturizer, eye cream and primer, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;At the age of 51, I have used nothing but water to cleanse my skin for years as most cleansers have a harsh, drying effect. Not only am I now cleansing daily with MK but am also exfoliating every third day. The difference is remarkable. My skin feels as dewy and soft now as it was in my 30s. As long as I continue to get dramatic results like these, I will remain a devoted Mary Kay customer. (I may or may not continue to use my own concoctions -- pure Vitamin E, oatmeal masks, 100 percent cocoa butter. Right now, the Timewise collection is doing a fine job.)</li>
            <li> I love the Timewise Miracle Set because it has everything to start off right with a good skin  care routine. Since I started using all these things my face is so nice to touch and look at, I do look younger!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is a great way to keep the face looking shiny and young. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this TimeWise for a few years now, I like how it makes my skin look and feel. I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it. This set was not old or expired.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a Mary Kay consultant but I took a risk and bought it on Amazon because it was cheaper. After using this set for 2-3 weeks my skin started breaking out more, skin has less even tone than before. My skin also feels &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; or soapy after using it. I try to use as little as possible to make sure I&#x27;m not putting too much but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I feel like it&#x27;s pore-clogging and too heavy for me. Overall I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product and wish I had gotten it through a Mary Kay consultant so I could get my money back or exchanged it for something that would work better for my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy and excited to get Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle set for Christmas THANKS AMAZON For your incredible service...</li>
            <li> I love this set of product.</li>
            <li> The TimeWise Miracle Set for normal/dry skin I ordered was exactly as described. Perfectly new bottles in new boxes. I have always been a fan of Mary Kay. I will order from the seller again. Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and buying it thru Amazon is much easier. It can be bought as a set or single what ever you need</li>
            <li> I think it is very important to have a good skin care product and routine and have been very happy with these items.  At first it seemed like a lot of items to put on and in what order etc but once you get it into your routine you don&#x27;t even have to think about it, it&#x27;s like second nature.  When I ran out, I sure missed it and felt a difference in my face especially not having the items for night.  MK made a change to the Day Solution a few years ago which changed the consistency of the lotion, it is much runnier where I preferred the old consistency which was more like the moisturizer.  But all in all I like it and I just recently purchased it via Amazon and it was a huge savings even with shipping.</li>
            <li> ive been wanting to buy this product but I had held back cus this product from mar kay costs about double the price but then I found this same product on here at half the price I grabbed it right away its a great product and at 60 percent off you cant go wrong grab yours today before theyre gone</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.  My skin is so soft and the night gel is really comfortable.  No bad skin reactions at all with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensative skin which getting used to the same skin care line, so I have to change my routine every year. I used this mary Kay set - ot works great: not greasy, skin absiorb it very quick. And I do see results: skin looks smoother, brighter. I also love that day serum has SPF 35.</li>
            <li> Always come back to MK</li>
            <li> Love all Mary Kay products.  Great for my skin</li>
            <li> I like Mary Kay lotions for my face, I don&#x27;t have break outs like I do with other products but they sent me a mix of skin type instead of all one skin type.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this! The dry skin line is the only one that gets rid of my adult acne and calms my rosacea!</li>
            <li> Very good products satisfaction guaranteed</li>
            <li> I am in my mid twenties and wanted to start taking care of my skin and start preventing before wrinkles started. This line is amazing. Not only does my skin feel amazing, I feel more comfortable not wearing makeup on the weekends...I have smooth even toned skin now that isn&#x27;t dry in some places and oily in others. Thanks Mary Kay!!</li>
            <li> I love most of the Mary Kay products.  I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and I think my 68 year old very sensitive skin shows that they have been kind to me.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and brighter almost immediately after using it. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and I love the way my skin is looking.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with some scarring on my face and the product has given my skin a softer, more moisturized look making the scars less prominent.</li>
            <li> love how It makes my scan look and feel. its my new favorite</li>
            <li> I used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics and loved their product, but am disappointed in their NEW products.  Not the same.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a differents.  My skin appears to sag a little. I was hoping that my skin would tighten or appear more firm.  I may come back to using this product but I thought I would look at other products.</li>
            <li> While this is a wonderful product, it is not what I was looking for.I wanted something to help with early signs of aging but this leaves a film like cover on my face. More moisturizing than I needed. I will use the product but continue my search for something better. It was not expired and came really quickly so no issue there like everyone says. Just a better deal than a consultant can give me.</li>
            <li> Always have liked these products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my MK Timewise set.  I love it even more when I can get it for less than full price.  This came with an expiration date 18 months out!  It all came sealed in new boxes.  Unless something drastic happens when I use this, I will happily buy more MK this way!</li>
            <li> The cream smelled like it was old.&lt;br /&gt;I still give a four since its still doing wonders on my face.</li>
            <li> For age spots, this product - 3 in 1 cleanser - does what it says!  age spots are fading, skin is softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for years and am so thankful I can purchase now through Amazon.  I have rosaecia in the winter and this in combination with my prescription help keep my skin clear even during the driest season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 10+ years and it helps to prevent wrinkles and keeps my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  Recently I was told that I looked at least 10 years younger than I am...I think this is a wonderful testament to how well Mary Kay TimeWise is working!</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price. my skin is looking more youth full since I started this beauty regiment morning and night.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quick.  I definitely recommend!  I was very satisfied with ny purchase.</li>
            <li> this product looked good on the web page so i gave it a try. when i got it, it is everything the ad said it was and more!! it works far better than i thought it would. i am very please with my purchase and will buy again! so people give this a try you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and works very well. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The price was very reasonable. I recommend all Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> Wife like this, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my very dry and sensitive skin for a few years. It works well and lasts a long time using it twice per day, as I don&#x27;t really need to use much.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my mother and she likes it, not in love with it. She stated she needs more time to notice a difference, she has only been using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 years and love it! This set I bought here was NOT expired and it came in a perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I purchased from Mary Kay because they stated that they do not do animal testing and never will. They went against their word in order to be able to sell to the Chinese market.  China requires animal testing and in order to not pass up the money, MK went against it&#x27;s word.  Consultants are still telling customers that Mary Kay does not do animal testing but the key word is in the USA.  They very much do animal testing and try to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I love my Mary Kay thank you so much will need more soon have your skin very soft.</li>
