            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old and my memory is going.</li>
            <li>Colors is Benetton&#x27;s first fragrance launched in 1987, very long time ago.</li>
            <li>The first note of lavender stays very long before it gives place for other note which I cannot identify very clearly.</li>

            <li> Colors is Benetton&#x27;s first fragrance launched in 1987, very long time ago.</li>
            <li> The first note of lavender stays very long before it gives place for other note which I cannot identify very clearly.</li>
            <li> My son has used colors cologne for as long as I can remember and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if i got the same product as the other who reviewed.</li>
            <li> The scent stays with you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Just no real scent --</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and though the cost has dropped a little all the rest looks the same.  </li>
            <li> what I used to buy, it smells like your average cheapo aftershave.</li>
            <li> Since you get used to the cologne&#x27;s smell and cannot tell, after a few minutes, I just go by verbal and non-verbal feedback from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .wonder if those good reviews are real or fake?! didnt like the smell.not too terrible</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but def.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t get disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!</li>

            <li> Good Fragrance...Nothing special but still good for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the best value for money - No, you can find better ones on sale.</li>
            <li> I bought for someone but I gave it 4 stars because it was a great price and the person who ordered it can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Colors is Benetton&#x27;s first fragrance launched in 1987, very long time ago. The smell now has become too &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; but I enjoy it. The first note of lavender stays very long before it gives place for other note which I cannot identify very clearly. But overall, it is a good and not expensive fragrance, gives me a feeling of comfort and happiness.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements and can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters always ask me about the name of the fragrance and add \\&quot;I like it&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it while you can.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and though the cost has dropped a little all the rest looks the same.  This is about bottle number 9 and I will very likely buy again.</li>

            <li> I have been using colors for years now. Never had anyone complain. Since you get used to the cologne&#x27;s smell and cannot tell, after a few minutes, I just go by verbal and non-verbal feedback from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
