            <li> Why are you charging $27.00 for this same lipstick that the department stores sold for $16.00...highway robbery! as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>

            <li> Buy MAC lipsticks from MAC. They&#x27;re only $16 while this is twice as much. The color is beautiful, though, the formula a little waxy.</li>
            <li> I see why this lipstick color was sold out on Mac&#x27;s website and in their store.  It literally looks great on EVERYONE and applies smoothly onto lips after putting chap stick on.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
