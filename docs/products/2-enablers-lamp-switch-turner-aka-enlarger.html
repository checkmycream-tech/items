            <li>A great idea, product, and price.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a family member with arthritis in their hands and they work great.</li>
            <li>Great item.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars because they work, however, they don&#x27;t stay on that good.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>A good price for a good idea</li>
            <li>They appear to be a good quality</li>
            <li>My mother is very pleased and no longer almost knocks the lamp over in trying to turn it off and on.  </li>
            <li>This adapter works fabulously!!</li>
            <li>Great product, but don&#x27;t buy unless you have someone with strong hands to put them on for you.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Would be great if they fit.</li>
            <li>It took a good deal of thought and ingenuity to be able to use these.</li>
            <li>I think they get warm and stretch out.  </li>
            <li>Mom is 90 and needed some help with lamps.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect and very helpful to her.</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>Made turning it on on and off very easy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to use them on something else.</li>
            <li>Would be better if adapter sleeve came with product.</li>
            <li>Now my mom can turn the light on and off with ease!</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I tried 2 of them on every lamp in the house, in case one happened to be defective; all these Enablers did was twirl around.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>They some times slip on the switch, but over all work ok.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to stop as soon as it snaps into place.</li>
            <li>A better solution than having to grip the switch with a cloth or part of my shirt to turn on the light (which was what I had been doing before).</li>
            <li>I am getting some for myself, sure makes turning on or off a light easier after I put on hand cream.</li>
            <li>The switch turner was supposed to fit most lamps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These units make it easy and painless.  </li>
            <li>The shape is easy for arthritic hands to turn, and the texture is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>This triangle shape wonder is easy to put on and use.  </li>
            <li>it was easy to install as well....</li>
            <li>device is easily pushed onto the plastic turn knob on a lamp fixture and snaps into place.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit, just spun around and around... returned it, which was easy already credited my account.</li>
            <li>lamp light switch knobs turn easily, some don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>I worried these would not work well because they do not seem to fit on securely, but they have worked well</li>
            <li>The enabler is designed to fit over the lamp switch and uses a push through hole so the switch can be held and the enabler the be castened securely over the switch handle on the lamp.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit the lamp knobs.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t fit my lamps.  </li>
            <li>These work great for those tiny lamp switches.</li>
            <li>The lamp turners worked fantastic and now my grandparent can turn on and off lamps with ease.</li>
            <li>so it is level; making one smooth surface.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very useful.</li>
            <li>The triangular size also makes it easy to reach under the lamp shade and find the turner quickly.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and now I am able to turn my older lamp know with little effort.</li>
            <li>This is the only honest seller that I have found because of the reasonable price and shipping charges, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, have used them for a very long time, and they are great helps.</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect add-on to lamps with hard to turn switches for those with arthritis in their hands.  </li>
            <li>seller was quite accomadating and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Then try to quickly squeeze and release.</li>
            <li>If you have a rotating switch that is too narrow to fit well, just wrap tape around the switch to increase the diameter until these enablers fit snugly.... and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>better, to get the best deal on a large black replacement switch, on Amazon see the Maddak Big Lamp Switch, from Therapy Connection, package of 3 for $24.69 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend that you search for the similar ones that are an all-one-piece lamp switch - screw them right in on their own and no fussing with the original switch.  </li>
            <li>First, these must have been someone else&#x27;s return since they were not in original packaging as pictured - they were in a tacky piece of plastic wrap with a bar code sticker on it.</li>
            <li>Great if you have a problem turning those little knobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great, but they keep falling off in my hand after every few uses.</li>
            <li>Idea great, but did not fit the knob for which I had purchased the item.</li>
            <li>You have to position them just right so that they stay on.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>They look like they would fit a classic 3/8&amp;#34;x 3/4&amp;#34; or so, stem type screw-on switch.  </li>
            <li>When you are ready for something really strong, try the Cando Fixed Grip exerciser, set of five, $31.35 (free shipping), also from Therapy Connection on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 91 yo mother because her grip isn&#x27;t strong enough on the floor lamp Ott light she uses for reading.  </li>
            <li>The Enabler Lamp Switch Turner easily fits over the lamp switch knob, and once attached, provides an easy, smooth way to turn a once hard to grasp light knob.</li>
            <li>Easy and inexpensive way to solve a real problem, particularly for the elderly.</li>
            <li>my arthritic 88 year old mother in law thinks that these are the greatest/  easy to</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this item -- it would be a great help on a lamp that is very hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li>So many folks have problems turning light switches due to pain or weakness in their fingers.  </li>
            <li>you put them on the old lamps they work just fine.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit on any of four different light switches in my home because the opening on the turner is too large.</li>
            <li>However, they really do help!</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this out there for us!</li>
            <li>What a really helpful gizmo!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Now it is much easier!</li>
            <li>When I pressed it on too far, it just went around and around without turning on the light.    </li>
            <li>It should now last many years without wearing out.</li>
            <li>It should now last many years without wearing out.</li>
            <li>so I could make sure I had covered all the lamps I forgot to count and still have some left over.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to work at first.</li>
            <li>This product works best with longer switch knobs, that will allow it to fit securely against the socket base.  </li>
            <li>Use them on my bed side wall lamps, easy to find in the dark and easy to turn.</li>
            <li>With three large surfaces, it works even better than a metal key replacement knob.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>It would be Useful if the manufacturer  or seller showed a picture of the typical switches they fit and or give the dimensions of switches they fit.</li>
            <li>I would ideally like this item to come in two different sizes so that it could be used on smaller knobs &amp; larger ones.  </li>
            <li>i purchased super glue gel and carefully glued in place.its been about three weeks and are working fine.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re too large for my lamp switches.</li>
            <li>but my knobs seem to be a bit too large.  </li>
            <li>These are too large for my lamps...</li>
            <li>on two of the lamps turners proved too loose and were more of a hindrance.</li>
            <li>Lamps are much easier to turn on now.</li>
            <li>I was able to epoxy it into the center well.  </li>
            <li>The switch turner really helps me turn on</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t grab it or fit over it</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Out of the four Lamp Switch Turners I ordered, only one fit the four lamps I have..  </li>
            <li>reasonably priced..</li>
            <li>On the newer lamps it seems the piece they fit on are smaller</li>
            <li>so much easier to turn the knob</li>
            <li>really helped my elderly grandparent.</li>
            <li>I found this to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>Amazon, see the Westinghouse Lighting 70160 Socket key Brass, buy from GATZIE&#x27;S $4.97 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I did have my son super glue it to the existing knob as it slipped a little, but that was easy to do.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, see the Gripmaster Original 5 pack, $46.40(free shipping) from Weiss Medical.</li>
            <li>This will result in the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges wearing down, becoming loose, and no longer being able to turn on the light.</li>
            <li>This will result in the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges wearing down, becoming loose, and no longer being able to turn on the light.</li>
            <li>These did not come with instructions, but with my experience, I realized that some lamps were easy to fit and on other lamps I had to unscrew the switch, put it through the opening, and then screw it back into the lamp.</li>
            <li>An entirely new problem!  </li>
            <li>I know when I get older I’ll be buying more of these little wonders.</li>
            <li>turners are too large for nearly all of my lamp switches.</li>
            <li>The washers should be loose and not trapped between the brown lamp switch and the brass (or aluminum) wall of the light fixture.  </li>

            <li>But with a light squeeze it makes turning older stiff knobs much easier.</li>
            <li>Every time I purchase new lamps, I try to find new switches like these for them.</li>
            <li>Folks, while watching tv, you probably aren&#x27;t doing much of anything else anyway, so at least do something worthwhile by doing exercises to help in regaining the use of your fingers and hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>the switch turners do not fit on the original &#x27;knob&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li>You can squeeze them on the tips of your fingers, and the first or second pads of your fingers.</li>
            <li>to arthritis, I had lost the use of all but the thumb and first finger of my left hand.</li>
            <li>x 10/16\\&quot;W (or wider) flat washers (not lock washers) onto the shaft of the brown lamp switch, and screw the brown lamp switch back onto the light fixture.</li>
            <li>x 10/16\\&quot;W (or wider) flat washers (not lock washers) onto the shaft of the brown lamp switch, and screw the brown lamp switch back onto the light fixture.</li>
            <li>Does not fit all lamps but easy on hands</li>
            <li>They are also sold a little cheaper by Isokinetics, Inc. , $30.75 (free shipping), on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>Fixed it by putting drafting tape on the switch to &amp;#34;enlarge&amp;#34; the diameter.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised that they are made with a &amp;#34;soft-touch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The two flat washers will maintain the proper setback distance between the light fixture and the Enabler, and keep the Enabler from wearing out its internal ridges.  </li>

            <li>This is a wonderful product for people unable to handle a small turning switch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I added a few drops of super glue.</li>
            <li>lamp light switches much more easily especially since I have really bad arthritis in my hands.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was that some of the lamp switches were too small for the knob to fit on</li>
            <li>I hope I have written this clear enough</li>
            <li>He tells me he has &#x27;begged&#x27; Amazon to change the shipping weight to coincide with the actual weight of the item, but they have thus far ignored his request.</li>
            <li>and they can actually go over it too far and just spin.</li>
            <li>Over time, with use, you will inadvertently push the Enabler too far onto the brown lamp turn switch, and the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges will lose contact with the ridges on the lamp turn switch.  </li>

            <li>Wrapping the knob with layers of tape works, but it is pretty ugly - this is much nicer and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Relax and try again and again, moving your arm up and down and turning your hand left and right.</li>
            <li>This same exact product was overpriced from other sellers on the web.</li>
            <li>So, here you have item that weighs only a few ounces with a shipping cost higher than a unabridged dictionary and a vendor protesting the hight cost of shipping.</li>
            <li>Some turners are either too small or two large and are not a good fit.</li>

            <li> better, to get the best deal on a large black replacement switch, on Amazon see the Maddak Big Lamp Switch, from Therapy Connection, package of 3 for $24.69 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend that you search for the similar ones that are an all-one-piece lamp switch - screw them right in on their own and no fussing with the original switch.  </li>
            <li> First, these must have been someone else&#x27;s return since they were not in original packaging as pictured - they were in a tacky piece of plastic wrap with a bar code sticker on it.</li>
            <li> Great if you have a problem turning those little knobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great, but they keep falling off in my hand after every few uses.</li>
            <li> Idea great, but did not fit the knob for which I had purchased the item.</li>
            <li> You have to position them just right so that they stay on.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> They look like they would fit a classic 3/8&amp;#34;x 3/4&amp;#34; or so, stem type screw-on switch.  </li>
            <li> When you are ready for something really strong, try the Cando Fixed Grip exerciser, set of five, $31.35 (free shipping), also from Therapy Connection on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 91 yo mother because her grip isn&#x27;t strong enough on the floor lamp Ott light she uses for reading.  </li>
            <li> The Enabler Lamp Switch Turner easily fits over the lamp switch knob, and once attached, provides an easy, smooth way to turn a once hard to grasp light knob.</li>
            <li> Easy and inexpensive way to solve a real problem, particularly for the elderly.</li>
            <li> my arthritic 88 year old mother in law thinks that these are the greatest/  easy to</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this item -- it would be a great help on a lamp that is very hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li> So many folks have problems turning light switches due to pain or weakness in their fingers.  </li>
            <li> you put them on the old lamps they work just fine.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit on any of four different light switches in my home because the opening on the turner is too large.</li>
            <li> However, they really do help!</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this out there for us!</li>
            <li> What a really helpful gizmo!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Now it is much easier!</li>
            <li> When I pressed it on too far, it just went around and around without turning on the light.    </li>
            <li> It should now last many years without wearing out.</li>
            <li> It should now last many years without wearing out.</li>
            <li> so I could make sure I had covered all the lamps I forgot to count and still have some left over.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to work at first.</li>
            <li> This product works best with longer switch knobs, that will allow it to fit securely against the socket base.  </li>
            <li> Use them on my bed side wall lamps, easy to find in the dark and easy to turn.</li>
            <li> With three large surfaces, it works even better than a metal key replacement knob.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> It would be Useful if the manufacturer  or seller showed a picture of the typical switches they fit and or give the dimensions of switches they fit.</li>
            <li> I would ideally like this item to come in two different sizes so that it could be used on smaller knobs &amp; larger ones.  </li>
            <li> i purchased super glue gel and carefully glued in place.its been about three weeks and are working fine.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re too large for my lamp switches.</li>
            <li> but my knobs seem to be a bit too large.  </li>
            <li> These are too large for my lamps...</li>
            <li> on two of the lamps turners proved too loose and were more of a hindrance.</li>
            <li> Lamps are much easier to turn on now.</li>
            <li> I was able to epoxy it into the center well.  </li>
            <li> The switch turner really helps me turn on</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t grab it or fit over it</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Out of the four Lamp Switch Turners I ordered, only one fit the four lamps I have..  </li>
            <li> reasonably priced..</li>
            <li> On the newer lamps it seems the piece they fit on are smaller</li>
            <li> so much easier to turn the knob</li>
            <li> really helped my elderly grandparent.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Amazon, see the Westinghouse Lighting 70160 Socket key Brass, buy from GATZIE&#x27;S $4.97 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I did have my son super glue it to the existing knob as it slipped a little, but that was easy to do.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, see the Gripmaster Original 5 pack, $46.40(free shipping) from Weiss Medical.</li>
            <li> This will result in the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges wearing down, becoming loose, and no longer being able to turn on the light.</li>

            <li> These did not come with instructions, but with my experience, I realized that some lamps were easy to fit and on other lamps I had to unscrew the switch, put it through the opening, and then screw it back into the lamp.</li>
            <li> An entirely new problem!  </li>
            <li> I know when I get older I’ll be buying more of these little wonders.</li>
            <li> turners are too large for nearly all of my lamp switches.</li>
            <li> The washers should be loose and not trapped between the brown lamp switch and the brass (or aluminum) wall of the light fixture.  </li>
            <li> The washers should be loose and not trapped between the brown lamp switch and the brass (or aluminum) wall of the light fixture.  </li>
            <li> But with a light squeeze it makes turning older stiff knobs much easier.</li>
            <li> Every time I purchase new lamps, I try to find new switches like these for them.</li>
            <li> Folks, while watching tv, you probably aren&#x27;t doing much of anything else anyway, so at least do something worthwhile by doing exercises to help in regaining the use of your fingers and hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the switch turners do not fit on the original &#x27;knob&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li> You can squeeze them on the tips of your fingers, and the first or second pads of your fingers.</li>
            <li> to arthritis, I had lost the use of all but the thumb and first finger of my left hand.</li>
            <li> x 10/16\\&quot;W (or wider) flat washers (not lock washers) onto the shaft of the brown lamp switch, and screw the brown lamp switch back onto the light fixture.</li>
            <li> x 10/16\\&quot;W (or wider) flat washers (not lock washers) onto the shaft of the brown lamp switch, and screw the brown lamp switch back onto the light fixture.</li>
            <li> Does not fit all lamps but easy on hands</li>
            <li> They are also sold a little cheaper by Isokinetics, Inc. , $30.75 (free shipping), on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> Fixed it by putting drafting tape on the switch to &amp;#34;enlarge&amp;#34; the diameter.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised that they are made with a &amp;#34;soft-touch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The two flat washers will maintain the proper setback distance between the light fixture and the Enabler, and keep the Enabler from wearing out its internal ridges.  </li>

            <li> This is a wonderful product for people unable to handle a small turning switch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of super glue.</li>
            <li> lamp light switches much more easily especially since I have really bad arthritis in my hands.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that some of the lamp switches were too small for the knob to fit on</li>
            <li> I hope I have written this clear enough</li>
            <li> He tells me he has &#x27;begged&#x27; Amazon to change the shipping weight to coincide with the actual weight of the item, but they have thus far ignored his request.</li>
            <li> and they can actually go over it too far and just spin.</li>
            <li> Over time, with use, you will inadvertently push the Enabler too far onto the brown lamp turn switch, and the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges will lose contact with the ridges on the lamp turn switch.  </li>

            <li> Wrapping the knob with layers of tape works, but it is pretty ugly - this is much nicer and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Relax and try again and again, moving your arm up and down and turning your hand left and right.</li>
            <li> This same exact product was overpriced from other sellers on the web.</li>
            <li> So, here you have item that weighs only a few ounces with a shipping cost higher than a unabridged dictionary and a vendor protesting the hight cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> Some turners are either too small or two large and are not a good fit.</li>
            <li> Over a period of six months of hand exercises (a few minutes on each hand), I have regained the full use and strength of all the fingers on my left hand, even if some of the little finger joint pain is still there to remind me not to slack off in doing my hand exercises.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for those having trouble turning lamp switch knobs.  </li>

            <li> If it is still loose, put some tape over the small knob, then push the large knob over it.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom who has RA; complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> i bought this product for 90 year old mother who had trouble with her lamp switches.</li>
            <li> Thought it&#x27;d be a long wait, but not - it was here in</li>
            <li> Only fits one of five lamps and can&#x27;t be adapted to other lights.  </li>
            <li> this works very well for me (old &amp; weak fingers) and my granddaughter (young &amp; weak fingers).  </li>
            <li> Over time, the plastic has become too loose, and does not catch on the lamp switch.</li>
            <li> It comes LOOSE with NO packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a new lamp with a switch that is really hard to turn for some reason.</li>
            <li> grips the regular black turner</li>
            <li> If you push it all the way in, it will be loose, so pull it back a little bit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grip tight enough to turn the lamp knobs on my lamps.</li>
            <li> This has very limited usage.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these little gizmos; only needed two but tho&#x27;t to have some extras.  </li>
            <li> I did need to wrap the little switch with duct tape as suggested by another reviewer, and it needed several layers of tape at that.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer should include the necessary two washers with the enabler.nd, even if some of the little finger joint pain is still there to remind me not to slack off in doing my hand exercises.</li>
            <li> Also, the tape is a bit soft, so I had to squeeze it hard to get all the air and &amp;#34;mushiness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (I am careful not to jostle it when turning the switch).</li>
            <li> Only problem that I have had is that they do not fit all switches.</li>
            <li> have tried them on several lamps and the turner does not fit the grooves of the knob.</li>
            <li> Some light switches are so difficult to turn, this makes it a breeze!</li>
            <li> I am going to pass along the other one to my grandparents.</li>
            <li> This makes it pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> I downgraded the Enabler to four stars due to the user fix needed.</li>
            <li> I downgraded the Enabler to four stars due to the user fix needed.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that they do not fit tightly over the existing switch, so I would worry that it would fall off or have to be readjusted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get strength back in your arthritic fingers, while watching tv, try squeezing a sponge or a brush handle, or even your clenched fist, as hard as you can.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t really work for the type of switch</li>
            <li> No matter how I positioned it on the switch, it would not hold tight.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t as tight on it and can go cockeyed.</li>
            <li> But then I got this little gadget on there</li>
            <li> It took a little modification.</li>
            <li> I had to trim off little bit of flashing so it could be seated snugly.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit the switch on the lamp</li>
            <li> These do not fit my lamps.</li>
            <li> did not fit my lamp</li>
            <li> I had trouble turning my lamps on/off.  </li>
            <li> The handle does not easily turn the lamp switch and has to be cajoled into turning.  </li>
            <li> At 92 she’s having trouble turning the small knob on the lamps.  </li>
            <li> After working with hands all day they get sore and it is hard to turn the small black knob.</li>
            <li> A little hard for someone with arthritis to push onto the I but once on works like a charm. ,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have arthritis yet but to have problems with turning small switches like on a lamp.  </li>
            <li> The reason I needed them was because the lamp switch is so small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the switch I needed to modify was a tiny 3/8&amp;#34;x3/8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we tried this on 2 different sized switches and could not get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> or it would appear to be too big and be useless.  </li>
            <li> No more fighting with the switch.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, I have arthritis and really needed the relief for a small switch on my sewing lamp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazing that something that is supposed to help arthritic hands should be so hard to get on.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to find the lamp that fits.</li>
            <li> I wanted this because my pole lamps were hard to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> I received these and it was hard to figure out how to use them.</li>
            <li> The opening was very small</li>
            <li> I am not arthritic, but could not always grip the smaller knob well to turn them, and was getting quite frustrated.</li>
            <li> I am almost sixty, but I have been using these for at least fifteen years!</li>
            <li> Depending on your lamp switch, these are incredibly tough to install.</li>
            <li> My poor hands were killing me after trying it every way I could think of.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE USELESS.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt that suffers with RA.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes found it difficult, and painful, to turn my lamps on or off.  </li>
            <li> nothing is too expensive!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not fit the switch on the lamp I got them for but I&#x27;m sure I will be able to use them on something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these little gizmos; only needed two but tho&#x27;t to have some extras.  Work great IF you don&#x27;t push them on all the way.  Took some figuring out as the instructions gave the impression you needed to push them all the way.  Lamps are much easier to turn on now.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a new lamp with a switch that is really hard to turn for some reason. I worried these would not work well because they do not seem to fit on securely, but they have worked well (I am careful not to jostle it when turning the switch). A better solution than having to grip the switch with a cloth or part of my shirt to turn on the light (which was what I had been doing before). I am going to pass along the other one to my grandparents. My only concern is that they do not fit tightly over the existing switch, so I would worry that it would fall off or have to be readjusted. But so far so good.</li>
            <li> I would ideally like this item to come in two different sizes so that it could be used on smaller knobs &amp; larger ones.  Otherwise, have used them for a very long time, and they are great helps.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt that suffers with RA. SHE LOVES THEM! She had to leave her lamps on or off until someone came by to change it for her. I am getting some for myself, sure makes turning on or off a light easier after I put on hand cream.</li>
            <li> They work great, but they keep falling off in my hand after every few uses.</li>
            <li> Only fits one of five lamps and can&#x27;t be adapted to other lights.  Would be better if adapter sleeve came with product.</li>
            <li> This works great!!! I don&#x27;t have arthritis yet but to have problems with turning small switches like on a lamp.  This adapter works fabulously!!</li>
            <li> I started to order this item for my lamps at home. Then I discovered that shipping charges were through the roof. For one $2.39 item shipping is $9.50. For two items at $4.78 shipping charges are $17.01.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since posting this review, I have exchanged email with the vendor, who tells me that the price of his shipping (according to weight) is set by Amazon. He tells me he has &#x27;begged&#x27; Amazon to change the shipping weight to coincide with the actual weight of the item, but they have thus far ignored his request. So, here you have item that weighs only a few ounces with a shipping cost higher than a unabridged dictionary and a vendor protesting the hight cost of shipping. WHAT&#x27;S THE STORY, AMAZON?</li>
            <li> Although labeled as &#x27;&#x27;universal&#x27;&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t fit on any of four different light switches in my home because the opening on the turner is too large.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my lamps. They are too big. The reason I needed them was because the lamp switch is so small. They should come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> works well on this type of lamp.</li>
            <li> So many folks have problems turning light switches due to pain or weakness in their fingers.  These units make it easy and painless.  If you have a rotating switch that is too narrow to fit well, just wrap tape around the switch to increase the diameter until these enablers fit snugly.... and you are good to go.  Easy and inexpensive way to solve a real problem, particularly for the elderly.</li>
            <li> These turners are semi-flexible rubber, not rigid.  The shape is easy for arthritic hands to turn, and the texture is easy to grip.  They look like they would fit a classic 3/8&amp;#34;x 3/4&amp;#34; or so, stem type screw-on switch.  Unfortunately, the switch I needed to modify was a tiny 3/8&amp;#34;x3/8&amp;#34; pea shape.  I was able to epoxy it into the center well.  Now my mom can turn the light on and off with ease!</li>
            <li> The switch turner really helps me turn on lamp light switches much more easily especially since I have really bad arthritis in my hands.  The only problem was that some of the lamp switches were too small for the knob to fit on so I had to put them on backwards.  However, they really do help!</li>
            <li> First, these must have been someone else&#x27;s return since they were not in original packaging as pictured - they were in a tacky piece of plastic wrap with a bar code sticker on it. And of course, no directions either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing that something that is supposed to help arthritic hands should be so hard to get on.  My poor hands were killing me after trying it every way I could think of.  Oh, it will go on alright, but when you turn it, it doesn&#x27;t turn the lamp switch.  It simply doesn&#x27;t grab it or fit over it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you search for the similar ones that are an all-one-piece lamp switch - screw them right in on their own and no fussing with the original switch.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll go for next, as these are going back.</li>
            <li> The enabler is designed to fit over the lamp switch and uses a push through hole so the switch can be held and the enabler the be castened securely over the switch handle on the lamp. Unfortunately we tried this on 2 different sized switches and could not get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t possibly beat the price. Works great for me with a muscle disorder. Would recommend to anyone needing help turning on lamps.</li>
            <li> The enabler lamp switch turners are too large for nearly all of my lamp switches. It would be Useful if the manufacturer  or seller showed a picture of the typical switches they fit and or give the dimensions of switches they fit.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 91 yo mother because her grip isn&#x27;t strong enough on the floor lamp Ott light she uses for reading.  I did need to wrap the little switch with duct tape as suggested by another reviewer, and it needed several layers of tape at that.  Also, the tape is a bit soft, so I had to squeeze it hard to get all the air and &amp;#34;mushiness&amp;#34; out of it.  But then I got this little gadget on there and it works very well.  My mother is very pleased and no longer almost knocks the lamp over in trying to turn it off and on.  Thanks for having this out there for us!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what lamps their quality control people tested these on - but nothing that I have in my house. I bought these for my mom who has RA; complete waste of money.  Just to be sure, I tried 2 of them on every lamp in the house, in case one happened to be defective; all these Enablers did was twirl around. No matter how I positioned it on the switch, it would not hold tight. Do not buy - I would give it zero stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the lamp knobs. Doesn&#x27;t grip tight enough to turn the lamp knobs on my lamps.</li>
            <li> Simple to attach.  I no longer struggle to turn-on my 2 table lamps.  The triangular size also makes it easy to reach under the lamp shade and find the turner quickly.</li>
            <li> The opening was very small so it is hard to find the lamp that fits. This has very limited usage.</li>
            <li> The handle does not easily turn the lamp switch and has to be cajoled into turning.  Not a practical solution for arthritic fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother.  At 92 she’s having trouble turning the small knob on the lamps.  This triangle shape wonder is easy to put on and use.  I know when I get older I’ll be buying more of these little wonders.</li>
            <li> This same exact product was overpriced from other sellers on the web. This is the only honest seller that I have found because of the reasonable price and shipping charges, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  You can turn on a switch with one finger.</li>
            <li> Out of the four Lamp Switch Turners I ordered, only one fit the four lamps I have..  I would not recommend this item because all switch turners are not the same. Some turners are either too small or two large and are not a good fit.</li>
            <li> Over time, the plastic has become too loose, and does not catch on the lamp switch. It just spins and doesn&#x27;t turn the lamp on or off.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and yes i would reccommend this to a friend...it was easy to install as well....reasonably priced..</li>
            <li> Great if you have a problem turning those little knobs.&lt;br /&gt;But..... lamps and these turners aren&#x27;t what they use to be.&lt;br /&gt;When you put them on the old lamps they work just fine. On the newer lamps it seems the piece they fit on are smaller and they can actually go over it too far and just spin. You have to back it out to stay on the lamp switch and they aren&#x27;t as tight on it and can go cockeyed.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect add-on to lamps with hard to turn switches for those with arthritis in their hands.  The Enabler Lamp Switch Turner easily fits over the lamp switch knob, and once attached, provides an easy, smooth way to turn a once hard to grasp light knob. Highly recommend this product for those having trouble turning lamp switch knobs.  This product works best with longer switch knobs, that will allow it to fit securely against the socket base.  Excellent arthritis helper!</li>
            <li> I wanted this because my pole lamps were hard to turn on and off. I received these and it was hard to figure out how to use them. It took a good deal of thought and ingenuity to be able to use these. Thankfully my brother could figure out a way.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re too large for my lamp switches. Just did not work.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze a bit to keep it in place when turning on sticky lamps. Means I have to think about it each time, and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;just work&#x27;. But with a light squeeze it makes turning older stiff knobs much easier.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because they work, however, they don&#x27;t stay on that good.  After using the lamp for a week, they get lose and move around and then fall off.  Plus they wouldn&#x27;t work on two of my lamps.  So I only ended up utilizing 2 of the 4 in the package.</li>
            <li> When the lamp bulb has been on for a while, the switch enablers stop turning the lamp switch.  I think they get warm and stretch out.  Then I have to pull them off, and turn it by hand.  THEY ARE USELESS.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Use them on my bed side wall lamps, easy to find in the dark and easy to turn. After working with hands all day they get sore and it is hard to turn the small black knob. Bought several packs for the house!</li>
            <li> i bought this product for 90 year old mother who had trouble with her lamp switches. installed on three different lamps. on two of the lamps turners proved too loose and were more of a hindrance. i purchased super glue gel and carefully glued in place.its been about three weeks and are working fine. seller was quite accomadating and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this item -- it would be a great help on a lamp that is very hard to turn on.  I tried it on 4 different lamp switches and the &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; that slips over the lamp switch was so big that it wouldn&#x27;t work on any of them.  This makes it pretty much useless.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful...so much easier to turn the knob</li>
            <li> Wrapping the knob with layers of tape works, but it is pretty ugly - this is much nicer and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Depending on your lamp switch, these are incredibly tough to install. Once they&#x27;re on, they make turning the lamp switch effortless. Perfect for those with arthritis. Great product, but don&#x27;t buy unless you have someone with strong hands to put them on for you.</li>
            <li> What a really helpful gizmo! Some light switches are so difficult to turn, this makes it a breeze! Good price. Quick delivery. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Mom is 90 and needed some help with lamps.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect and very helpful to her. She has shown all other&lt;br /&gt;ladies where she lives.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for people unable to handle a small turning switch.&lt;br /&gt;It grips the regular black turner great- my husband just loves it and I put the&lt;br /&gt;extra one on my lamp also.  We could not find it at a hardware store in the area&lt;br /&gt;so we had to order by mail.  Thought it&#x27;d be a long wait, but not - it was here in&lt;br /&gt;a couple of days and was the perfect solution for our problem.</li>
            <li> A good price for a good idea but they don&#x27;t fit my lamps.  They are to push on over your existing knobs but my knobs seem to be a bit too large.  An entirely new problem!  lol</li>
            <li> These work great for those tiny lamp switches. Especially when I paid $.01 for 2. A great idea, product, and price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a family member with arthritis in their hands and they work great. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Only problem that I have had is that they do not fit all switches. Fixed it by putting drafting tape on the switch to &amp;#34;enlarge&amp;#34; the diameter. Works like a charm</li>
            <li> These lamp switch turners really helped my elderly grandparent. We had tried several things such as wrapping rubber bands around the switch knobs for extra grip before discovering these lamp switch turners. The lamp turners worked fantastic and now my grandparent can turn on and off lamps with ease.</li>
            <li> These are helpful.  You have to position them just right so that they stay on. Why not give them a try?</li>
            <li> the switch turners do not fit on the original &#x27;knob&#x27; very well. have tried them on several lamps and the turner does not fit the grooves of the knob. when turned, it allows the knob to unscrew from the lamp. would not buy again  or recommend.</li>
            <li> They some times slip on the switch, but over all work ok.</li>
            <li> The switch turner was supposed to fit most lamps.&lt;br /&gt;It did not fit my lamp and so it did not help me.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very helpful.  I have arthritis in my hand and I sometimes found it difficult, and painful, to turn my lamps on or off.  Now it is much easier!</li>
            <li> Great item.  Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love this tool. I had trouble turning my lamps on/off.  With is tool, I can do so with ease.  Awesome product.    Update:  I realized while putting the item on my second lamp that it had to be lined up just right or it would appear to be too big and be useless.  The thing has to be lined up with the knob of the lamp stem so it is level; making one smooth surface. When I pressed it on too far, it just went around and around without turning on the light.    I hope I have written this clear enough so it makes sense.</li>
            <li> Would be great if they fit. These are too large for my lamps...</li>
            <li> I am not arthritic, but could not always grip the smaller knob well to turn them, and was getting quite frustrated. I found these at Amazon and they are just the trick! They fit perfectly and now I am able to turn my older lamp know with little effort. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I have arthritis and really needed the relief for a small switch on my sewing lamp. Didn&#x27;t fit, just spun around and around... returned it, which was easy already credited my account.</li>
            <li> Enablers Lamp Switch Turner.&lt;br /&gt;Some lamp light switch knobs turn easily, some don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This device is easily pushed onto the plastic turn knob on a lamp fixture and snaps into place. Just be sure to stop as soon as it snaps into place. If you push it all the way in, it will be loose, so pull it back a little bit. If it is still loose, put some tape over the small knob, then push the large knob over it.  No tools needed. With three large surfaces, it works even better than a metal key replacement knob.&lt;br /&gt;Like the look of a brass key replacement knob?&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon, see the Westinghouse Lighting 70160 Socket key Brass, buy from GATZIE&#x27;S $4.97 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;Even better, to get the best deal on a large black replacement switch, on Amazon see the Maddak Big Lamp Switch, from Therapy Connection, package of 3 for $24.69 (free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get strength back in your arthritic fingers, while watching tv, try squeezing a sponge or a brush handle, or even your clenched fist, as hard as you can. Relax and try again and again, moving your arm up and down and turning your hand left and right. Then try to quickly squeeze and release. Over a period of a month or so, move up to things offering resistance, like Gripmaster hand exercisers (or any sponge or spring exercisers). You can squeeze them on the tips of your fingers, and the first or second pads of your fingers. On Amazon, see the Gripmaster Original 5 pack, $46.40(free shipping) from Weiss Medical. When you are ready for something really strong, try the Cando Fixed Grip exerciser, set of five, $31.35 (free shipping), also from Therapy Connection on Amazon. They are also sold a little cheaper by Isokinetics, Inc. , $30.75 (free shipping), on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to arthritis, I had lost the use of all but the thumb and first finger of my left hand. Over a period of six months of hand exercises (a few minutes on each hand), I have regained the full use and strength of all the fingers on my left hand, even if some of the little finger joint pain is still there to remind me not to slack off in doing my hand exercises. Folks, while watching tv, you probably aren&#x27;t doing much of anything else anyway, so at least do something worthwhile by doing exercises to help in regaining the use of your fingers and hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/18/14 Update: Over time, with use, you will inadvertently push the Enabler too far onto the brown lamp turn switch, and the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges will lose contact with the ridges on the lamp turn switch.  This will result in the Enabler&#x27;s internal ridges wearing down, becoming loose, and no longer being able to turn on the light. As a field engineering user fix, before you install the Enabler, unscrew the brown lamp turn switch, put two flat 1/4\\&quot; x 10/16\\&quot;W (or wider) flat washers (not lock washers) onto the shaft of the brown lamp switch, and screw the brown lamp switch back onto the light fixture. The washers should be loose and not trapped between the brown lamp switch and the brass (or aluminum) wall of the light fixture.  Then, push the Enabler switch onto the brown lamp switch until it comes up against the washers. The two flat washers will maintain the proper setback distance between the light fixture and the Enabler, and keep the Enabler from wearing out its internal ridges.  It should now last many years without wearing out. I downgraded the Enabler to four stars due to the user fix needed. The manufacturer should include the necessary two washers with the enabler.nd, even if some of the little finger joint pain is still there to remind me not to slack off in doing my hand exercises.

            <li> Idea great, but did not fit the knob for which I had purchased the item.</li>
            <li> Does not fit all lamps but easy on hands</li>
            <li> Falls off when trying to turn lamp on or off.</li>
            <li> my arthritic 88 year old mother in law thinks that these are the greatest/  easy to install/ work well /  just a wee bit pricey but for your mother in law nothing is too expensive!</li>
            <li> No more fighting with the switch.  Made turning it on on and off very easy.</li>
            <li> A little hard for someone with arthritis to push onto the I but once on works like a charm. ,</li>
            <li> this works very well for me (old &amp; weak fingers) and my granddaughter (young &amp; weak fingers).  I did have my son super glue it to the existing knob as it slipped a little, but that was easy to do.</li>
            <li> Two individual switch turners come with this purchase. They appear to be a good quality and I was pleasantly surprised that they are made with a &amp;#34;soft-touch&amp;#34; type of rubber (maybe silicone). Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t really work for the type of switch I have but that was my fault;  I knew I was taking a chance that these would work when I ordered them. The seller shipped them promptly and had good communication! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Every time I purchase new lamps, I try to find new switches like these for them. This time, I finally purchased an extra eight or ten so I could make sure I had covered all the lamps I forgot to count and still have some left over. I am almost sixty, but I have been using these for at least fifteen years! These did not come with instructions, but with my experience, I realized that some lamps were easy to fit and on other lamps I had to unscrew the switch, put it through the opening, and then screw it back into the lamp. I do not have arthritis in my hands, but my hands are often swollen with fluid retention. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The product itself is very useful. It DOES NOT  come as pictured. It comes LOOSE with NO packaging. Be advised.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to work at first. It took a little modification. I had to trim off little bit of flashing so it could be seated snugly.  It seemed to wobble a bit. I added a few drops of super glue. It works just fine.</li>
