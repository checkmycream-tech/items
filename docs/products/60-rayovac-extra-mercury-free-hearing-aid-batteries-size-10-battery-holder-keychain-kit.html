            <li>Besides that issue, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the longevity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with these.  </li>
            <li>The batteries I received are very fresh, by the way, so will not be out of date before I use them all.</li>
            <li>I recently had to start using a hearing aid and bought this set of batteries as I have always had good results with Ray-o-Vac batteries.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and pleased.</li>
            <li>So far they are working better than the batteries I received with my hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>only kind i buy for ny hearing aids.</li>

            <li>exactly what I had hoped for, Thanks!</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s pretty consistent in each pack.</li>
            <li>have used them since i first tried them years ago</li>
            <li>Just received these hearing batteries and the first one out of the pack was a dud.</li>
            <li>Many times I have shopped online and at local stores looking for quality No. 10 Batteries.  </li>
            <li>Work great, last a long time at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>So far this is true.  </li>
            <li>Work very well in wife&#x27;s hearing aid.</li>

            <li>she said these are lasting much longer.  </li>
            <li>They last in my hearing aids about 5 long full days.</li>
            <li>My Audiologist includes free batteries for the life of the hearing devices purchased from him, but they are not mercury-free, and somehow almost never quite last long enough between office visits.</li>
            <li>I bought the Rayovac batteries after reading the many reviews and it looked like they would last longer than the German made batteries I used previously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really dissatisfied with your batteries, about 1/3 of them are about half strength, they last about 3 to 4 days were the others last a week</li>

            <li> Excellent batteries and excellent service. I will buy again as needed. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Work very well in wife&#x27;s hearing aid. I bought this because it came with the spare battery holder.</li>
            <li> They were good and the price was very good and make them even better.  Receipt of them was time efficient.</li>
            <li> They came with a good charge, unlike some bulk batteries I&#x27;ve gotten before. They last in my hearing aids about 5 long full days. Happy with the product, happy with the price.</li>
            <li> My Audiologist includes free batteries for the life of the hearing devices purchased from him, but they are not mercury-free, and somehow almost never quite last long enough between office visits.

The price is an excellent value in and of itself, never mind trips to the drugstore, and then often they don&#x27;t have the mercury-free in stock or whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought the Rayovac batteries after reading the many reviews and it looked like they would last longer than the German made batteries I used previously. I was getting an average of 3 days on a battery. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 packs of these so far and they are inconsistent on how long they last. I changed one out this morning and had to change it again 3 hours later. I don&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; of the batteries don&#x27;t last and some do.</li>
            <li> Longer lasting than Costco batteries.</li>
            <li> Buy these for my mother who gets about a week from her hearing aid batteries.  She loves these, says they last as long or longer than the other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased these batteries for my wife. she said these are lasting much longer.  that made me feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for your service.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I received it much faster than  they said I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I found these batteries to be inferior to the PowerOne batteries I have ordered previously. They last for significantly less time and one of the boxes received was even the wrong size.</li>
            <li> Mom has used these for the last couple years. They work well an last a long time and shopping online is so convenient.  We also appreciate that they are mercury-free.</li>
            <li> Rather than but these batteries anywhere else, buy them her and save 50%.  They are the same batteries in any store.</li>
            <li> Oh, my gosh!! I am sooo tired of spending $$$ on batteries at the grocery store to have them die the same day I put them in. Grrr. These are sooo STRONG and stay ALIVE for DAYS on end!! YAY!!! No beeping just hours after putting them in. I am soooo happy!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality for my wife &#x27;s hearing aids!</li>
            <li> Seem to last longer than Duracells bought previously. Price was very good and free shipping.</li>
            <li> My apologies for the late&lt;br /&gt;review, but everything was&lt;br /&gt;as I had hoped. A good price&lt;br /&gt;and exactly what I had hoped for, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great deal. Brought same batteries some where else. No more.</li>
            <li> By the time I get to some of the batteries they are dead or have very little life to them. Was hoping they would last longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dissatisfied with your batteries, about 1/3 of them are about half strength, they last about 3 to 4 days were the others last a week, It&#x27;s pretty consistent in each pack. According to the box their expiration date is Feb 2018 AAFPS, other code is 10AE-6ZM. I&#x27;ve used your batteries in the past with positive results, your prices are very good. Hope it&#x27;s just a bad batch situation.</li>
            <li> Expiration 2018, excellent price.AAA+++</li>
            <li> were prompt delivery and have not had any problems</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this brand since they seem to be the best available for my hearing aids.  These  batteries have a life of about five days assuming the hearing devises are turned off over night.  Amazon has the best price and delivery offerings on the market.  I&#x27;m sticking with Amazon for future purchases.  Jim C</li>
            <li> The batteries arrived sooner than I expected. So far they are working better than the batteries I received with my hearing aids.  I am getting approximately 8 days of use before I have to replace them.  I am very pleased with these batteries.</li>
            <li> only kind i buy for ny hearing aids. seem to last the longest of all brands. have used them since i first tried them years ago</li>
            <li> More than half oh these batteries were DOA (Dead on arrival).  I would place them in the earphone and they were depleted, or soon to be (minutes, not even hours).</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Delivered in timely manner.</li>
            <li> I recently had to start using a hearing aid and bought this set of batteries as I have always had good results with Ray-o-Vac batteries. Plus this set comes with a keychain battery holder to always keep a couple of spares.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been as expected. I get 5-6 days of use per battery.</li>
            <li> I researched hearing aid batteries and found that Rayovac had the longest life.  So far this is true.  I used to get 8 days with another brand.  I get 11 days with these.  I am very happy with these batteries.  While they cost a few pennies more, the extra life more than makes use for the price.</li>
            <li> I partcipated in a program that provided 6 different mfr of hearing aid batteries and a chart to track performance and longevity..for my hearing aids (and it IS probably different for different products) Rayovac was the best.  I&#x27;d been buying these from a Microbattery website and then discovered by accident that i could get the same (...a little bit cheaper but w/out shipping cost per conditions) at Amazon.  So, win win.  Best product for me; best price.  And Amazon ALWAYS delivers well</li>
            <li> Just received these hearing batteries and the first one out of the pack was a dud. A second one has fizzles out.I will keep a close check and report back as necessary. Service was very good.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Dad and the keychain holder addition is a nice extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the quantity. Fast shipping and pleased. We will purchase these again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with these.  Mine have lasted anywhere from 6-8 days.  A couple of times I&#x27;ve had a battery die overnight.  I don&#x27;t put my hearing aids on until I&#x27;m at work and the batteries tend to move around in my case.  Don&#x27;t know if the little magnet pen could have affected them or not.  Besides that issue, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the longevity.  I had used duracell batteries previously and they didn&#x27;t last as long as these.  Good batteries.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with 50% of the bateries, empty.  Because I used outsaid US I can&#x27;t change it</li>
            <li> Work great, last a long time at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they lasted extra long.  I have to wear two hearing aids, lately one 24 hours as I have a husband that is ill&lt;br /&gt;and rely on a monitor at night.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Excellent batteries will reorder as when needed .  much longer life</li>
            <li> Many times I have shopped online and at local stores looking for quality No. 10 Batteries.  I have tried all different flavors.  For me and my type of hearing aids (Audible) the Rayovac lasts the longest.  Ordering 60 at a time is not only time saving but the price was great too.  I will be reording this item again.</li>
            <li> Got the item on time. working excellent</li>
    </ol>
