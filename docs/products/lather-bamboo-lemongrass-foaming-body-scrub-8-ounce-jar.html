            <li>If is not as foamy as my favorite</li>
            <li>but It works better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok</li>
            <li>but I love how it makes my skin feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>do like I did and get it for yourself, just because! :)</li>
            <li>I collect bath products when I travel, including overseas and have used more scrubs and soaks than I can count.  </li>
            <li>So many scrubs either \\&quot;melt\\&quot; before they do anything</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that for the scrub itself, I love it because I am prone to in-grown hairs that result in scarring on my legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really works.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>,  love it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves skin so soft!</li>
            <li>it doesnt dissolve too quickly, has a great scent and keeps her skin nice and soft..</li>
            <li>Makes your body feel great immediately and has a soft light fragrance.</li>
            <li>This was discontinued by bare escentuals and it was a great foaming body cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a huge Origins scrub fan.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the 8 oz jar came with only about 4.5 oz of scrub.</li>
            <li>I felt clean when I finished my shower</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling like silk, and the scent is earthy and feminine without being too sweet or hippie-ish.</li>
            <li>This one is pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gritty scrub.</li>
            <li>If you really want scrub your skin this is probably one of the best products in the market, you have to be careful though, will sanding your skin very deeply.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife - she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>A favorite that I come back to.</li>
            <li>Really exfoliates!</li>
            <li>it never fails ,always results in smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li>It was barely more than half way full when I opened the seal.</li>
            <li>If you want to get rid of dry skin and enable lotions and self-tanners to work, then you&#x27;ll love Bamboo Lemongrass.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel or see any residue on my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really hope my bottle was a glitch</li>
            <li>This scrub is perfect--smells good, just enough exfoliation without being rough and doesn&#x27;t leave the shower greasy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend LATHER products.  </li>
            <li>Just rub it gently, in circular motions on your face, with a little water, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>so you can leave it in your shower and it has a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Even my old scars have begun to fade.</li>
            <li>If you like soft and silky, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed because I love the scrub and it works GREAT, but I am having trouble justifying paying so much and only</li>
            <li>I keep a spoon near by to remove the dry flakes and keep them clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product daily and moisturize, my skin is clear in about a month.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I ran out of my bare escentuals liquid loofah body polish.  </li>

            <li> oh, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> getting half of the amount on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a dry base, so it does not leave you feeling oily use.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic. The smell of the lemongrass is wonderful and the scrub feels good and works well.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great scrub!  The end results, the smell, everything is superior.  I thought all scrubs were alike but I was wrong.  This one is pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face. I know it is supposed to be too abrasive, but \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;face\\&quot; scrubs don&#x27;t do the job.  Just rub it gently, in circular motions on your face, with a little water, and it works fine.  Don&#x27;t try to \\&quot;SCRUB\\&quot; with it...</li>
            <li> I bought this when I ran out of my bare escentuals liquid loofah body polish.  This was discontinued by bare escentuals and it was a great foaming body cleanser.  So I searched for another and found the lather foaming scrub.  This is great stuff.  If is not as foamy as my favorite but It works better.  The smell is ok but I love how it makes my skin feel afterwards.  This is a nice gritty scrub.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Smells great and leaves skin so soft! Best body scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried and I used to be a huge Origins scrub fan. You MUST get this! Great idea for Mother&#x27;s Day, spa gift basket, etc... or do like I did and get it for yourself, just because! :)</li>
            <li> I collect bath products when I travel, including overseas and have used more scrubs and soaks than I can count.  I happened upon a LATHER store in Scottsdale recently and introduced to this product. It is awesome. So many scrubs either \\&quot;melt\\&quot; before they do anything or they can be too oily or can be extremely rough. This scrub is perfect--smells good, just enough exfoliation without being rough and doesn&#x27;t leave the shower greasy.  I highly recommend LATHER products.  Their muscle cream is also outstanding!</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to look, but when I peeled back the seal, the product was in balls and they looked dry. The container felt empty before I ever opened it. I did use it and I like the fact that it lathered up. The lather saved me a step. I felt clean when I finished my shower and I really appreciate the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel or see any residue on my skin afterwards. Good job.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel like silk.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you really want scrub your skin this is probably one of the best products in the market, you have to be careful though, will sanding your skin very deeply.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the 8 oz jar came with only about 4.5 oz of scrub. It was barely more than half way full when I opened the seal.

When I use this product daily and moisturize, my skin is clear in about a month. Even my old scars have begun to fade. I really hope my bottle was a glitch and if I choose to order it again, I won&#x27;t get shorted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife - she absolutely loves it! Smells great and really works. Scored points with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very effective exfoliator with the added bonus of no micro-beads.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating product.  It has a dry base, so it does not leave you feeling oily use.  It comes in a plastic container so you can leave it in your shower and it has a nice, subtle scent. This is as close to a spa treatment that I&#x27;ve found for use at home. A favorite that I come back to.</li>
            <li> Really exfoliates! If you like soft and silky, this product is not for you. If you want to get rid of dry skin and enable lotions and self-tanners to work, then you&#x27;ll love Bamboo Lemongrass.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It leaves your skin feeling like silk, and the scent is earthy and feminine without being too sweet or hippie-ish.

            <li> The BEST product EVER!!! I&#x27;ve used it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Ick.  Dry and not foamy.  Feels like you are rubbing sand on your body.  I had to add coconut oil to even get it to spread...</li>
            <li> Makes your body feel great immediately and has a soft light fragrance. Definitely will buy it again...oh, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, she has tried scrubs from all over and this one is her fav..it doesnt dissolve too quickly, has a great scent and keeps her skin nice and soft..</li>
            <li> so effective, great smell.,  love it. use it biweekly in the shower...it never fails ,always results in smooth soft skin.</li>
