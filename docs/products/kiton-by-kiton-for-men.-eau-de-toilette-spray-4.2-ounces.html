            <li>but then again everyone has there own opnion on things...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction.</li>
            <li>the way I love Thais fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ladies love the scent</li>
            <li>The product is perfect, but everything depends on the tastes of person individually.</li>
            <li>so make sure that you have smelled this one...</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I swear to you, there is nothing better the Kiton.  </li>
            <li>This is a wild scent, awesome pineapple/citrus smell, very linear, wears easy (20-35) ....</li>
            <li>It has a clean, slightly sweet, and refreshing smell to it that is not overbearing and does not linger after one leaves a room.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Smells Unique...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this fragrance</li>
            <li>the packaging is perfect an the product sucks.</li>
            <li>As advertised and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Everyone is complimentary and notices when I wear it.</li>
            <li>but worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I was so HAPPY Amazon carried it as my husband ran out this past summer.</li>
            <li>15 minutes after putting it on, I got on an elevator and rode down a couple of floors and a good looking gal got on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often hard to find, but is a great fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne, so my review is same what one sided.</li>
            <li>I first bought Kiton at a Nordstrom&#x27;s while traveling in Houston TX 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>and honestly i was let down.</li>
            <li>and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>To say the truth all of my family and my friends like the smell of Kiton, but personally i don&#x27;t really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Diffrent from others, However smells a little on the sweeter side and on me dosent seem that strong...</li>
            <li>first one that i have bought was a present to my family member and he was satisfied with it and the second one i bought for myself but did not knew the smell of it, its too pity that i have bought the second</li>
            <li>100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here...</li>
            <li>When the doors opened, we exited in opposite directions, and I had gone less than 50 feet when another fine lookin&#x27; lady who was walking toward me, stopped and said, &amp;#34;That fragrance you&#x27;re wearing is definitely working for you&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> this was a christmas present for my boyfriend and arrived promptly and correctly. I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I love Thais fragrance. Stays with him for a long time.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on Kiton! Can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
            <li> Smells Unique... Diffrent from others, However smells a little on the sweeter side and on me dosent seem that strong...i actually perfer my \\&quot;Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir\\&quot; because the scent seems to be stronger and i want people to notice rite away :D.. but then again everyone has there own opnion on things... so yea \\&quot;Kiton\\&quot; very Good Choice! not very well known from alot of people</li>
            <li> This is a typical bad knockoff - the packaging is perfect an the product sucks. These people should be thrown off of amazon, but there is no amazon contact to whom I can follow up. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this! Awesome juice</li>
            <li> This is a wild scent, awesome pineapple/citrus smell, very linear, wears easy (20-35) .... just doesn&#x27;t last more than 15-20 min.... to bad...</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my husband for 10 years but I could only get it in Toronto so I was so HAPPY Amazon carried it as my husband ran out this past summer. He was very happy to recieve it for Christmas This year!!</li>
            <li> Did a bit of research before purchasing, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this selection. Smells great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here... I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to buy</li>
            <li> Ladies love the scent and I received a lot of compliments from both men and women alike.  Very excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this fragrance.  It&#x27;s often hard to find, but is a great fall/winter scent. Everyone is complimentary and notices when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It has a clean, slightly sweet, and refreshing smell to it that is not overbearing and does not linger after one leaves a room. I wear it everyday and have for several years. Whenever someone is close enough to smell this scent they always complement me on it. A little expensive and difficult to find (except for on Amazon!) but worth the price.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect, but everything depends on the tastes of person individually. To say the truth all of my family and my friends like the smell of Kiton, but personally i don&#x27;t really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The first one that i have bought was a present to my family member and he was satisfied with it and the second one i bought for myself but did not knew the smell of it, its too pity that i have bought the second one.&lt;br /&gt;This smell is for the elder men i think, not for teenager or smaller. so make sure that you have smelled this one...</li>
            <li> I heard all of the reviews on YouTube and online. I was so excited to get this fragrance and honestly i was let down. It only last about an hour on my skin i&#x27;ve only gotten one compliment and i wear it alot. It smells like something generic from the eighties. I cant see why there are so many great reviews about this fragrance i guess to each is own.</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, so my review is same what one sided. I love everything about this product. As for the seller, everything was delivered on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I swear to you, there is nothing better the Kiton.  It is a Nordstrom brand exclusive, so unless you have one close by, you can&#x27;t get this spray.  Thankfully there is Amazon.  Cheaper than in the store, and the quality is just the same! Will def buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought Kiton at a Nordstrom&#x27;s while traveling in Houston TX 15 years ago. 15 minutes after putting it on, I got on an elevator and rode down a couple of floors and a good looking gal got on. Before we had traveled 2 floors, she turned and said, &amp;#34;Whatever you&#x27;re wearing..... it&#x27;s awesome&amp;#34;! When the doors opened, we exited in opposite directions, and I had gone less than 50 feet when another fine lookin&#x27; lady who was walking toward me, stopped and said, &amp;#34;That fragrance you&#x27;re wearing is definitely working for you&amp;#34;. Later that day, another Southern Belle inquired about the fragrance. A week later, in a department store, while standing in line, the lady behind me touched my shoulder and said, &amp;#34;What is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing? I HAVE to get some for my husband&amp;#34;. Add a scoop of ice cream and you&#x27;ve got &amp;#34;Chick magnet a la mode&amp;#34;. I get complimented EVERY time I go out with it on. It&#x27;s like the perfect scent......... and the ladies do love it!</li>
