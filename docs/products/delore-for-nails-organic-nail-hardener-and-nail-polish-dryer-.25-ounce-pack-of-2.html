            <li>The product got good reviews from happy customers, but it did nothing for my peeling, breaking nails.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my cuticles in good condition.. and</li>
            <li>This product helped strengthen my nails and for the 1st time in years, my nails are looking good.  </li>
            <li>In fact some are quite good.</li>
            <li>This is the best product to put on freshly polished nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten just what an amazing product this is.  </li>
            <li>This is BY far the best nail hardener on the market today.</li>
            <li>But, to be honest I don&#x27;t do enough polishing to be a great judge on this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nail conditioner for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still on the market!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon.com carries this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years; nothing matches ease of use for taking care of problem nails and cuticles--worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Now, I put it on top of another hardener and I&#x27;m seeing results.</li>
            <li>They look so much better this year, but one thing they have started to have issues with their fingernails.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife which used to use it many years ago however she had not been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love , love this stuff and had been looking for it for years.  </li>
            <li>Nail magic and OPI are two that I would recommend if your looking for a temporary fix.</li>
            <li>However, If you want healthy strong nails then Delore nails is your answer.</li>
            <li>It works from the inside out to create truly strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li>It makes them strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for your cuticles and nail growth and really prevents fresh polish from getting smudged.</li>
            <li>your nails will remain strong.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and love that it&#x27;s made with natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Along with proper filing and buffing you should have gorgeous nails in no time.</li>
            <li>I have very brittle nails that peel, crack, and bend easily.  </li>
            <li>drys polish real fast.</li>
            <li>For those unaware, most nail hardeners are topicals that are applied like nail polish.</li>
            <li>For anyone interested you can purchase it at HSN (Home Shopping Network) for about $24.00 dollars.</li>
            <li>ironic is that a lot of the reviews claim to have been using this product for 20 years?</li>
            <li>Has really helped my nails from cracking</li>
            <li>I know it works on normal situations, I will update as they use it if it helps them too!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li>I strongly believe it&#x27;s because of the other hardener.</li>
            <li>NO ODOR or fumes - completely nontoxic and organic.</li>
            <li>Just apply within a few minutes after you&#x27;ve painted your nails and gently massage in as you normally would.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I see much difference from other similar products.</li>

            <li> so long, and the tips are so white!</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t find the easy-use cuticle wand anywhere; guess it is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> i love this and will always use it because my nails would not grown and would chip like crazy...</li>
            <li> The product has been around a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as you have it on, your nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> , considering my age, I could&#x27;ve been wrong about the decade in which this item was originally purchased.  </li>
            <li> Wish it would make my nails harder, but guess i need to keep applying it.</li>
            <li> Your polish will dry in about half the time.</li>
            <li> Although used sporadically (due to availability)</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT harm the nails or leave a silicone (or any other chemical) layer that is harmful to the nails.</li>
            <li> A bonus is that it works as a top coat (do not use as a base coat b/c</li>

            <li> anyways it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You apply a small amount and massage it into the nail bed and surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within days or even hours of removing with polish remover your nails become weak again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27; go wrong with Delore.</li>
            <li> and she has given 2 away to friends who also used to use it and were unable to find it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying these are bad products.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t realize I already had one of these when I purchased it, so was disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> Worthless!</li>

            <li> This is the best product to put on freshly polished nails. It&#x27;s great for your cuticles and nail growth and really prevents fresh polish from getting smudged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail conditioner for years and love it.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have damaged my nail beds, so there are permanent splits in my nails that will last a lifetime.  This product helps me keep those splits under control.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a nail OIL. Worthless! Did nothing for my nails. Would not recommend or repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;How ironic is that a lot of the reviews claim to have been using this product for 20 years?......anyways it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have used product previously and like the manner of use and it seems to work, as I have problem nails.</li>
            <li> The product got good reviews from happy customers, but it did nothing for my peeling, breaking nails.  But nothing seems to work on them either.</li>
            <li> This is a really great nail product.  Keeps my cuticles in good condition.. and oh, yeah.. drys polish real fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon.com carries this product.  I discovered it back in the mid 1970&#x27;s.  Although used sporadically (due to availability) I&#x27;d forgotten just what an amazing product this is.  Do not expect over night results.  It takes time and effort.  Massage DeLore Nails into the fingernail beds.  There is a bit of a residue, so I just buff my nails against the palm of my hands. The results should be visible between four (4) and six (6) months.  It DOES NOT harm the nails or leave a silicone (or any other chemical) layer that is harmful to the nails. Hope this helps!  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Well, considering my age, I could&#x27;ve been wrong about the decade in which this item was originally purchased.  But, age, or not, the product works and works well!</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t realize I already had one of these when I purchased it, so was disappointed in that. I don&#x27;t feel I see much difference from other similar products. But, to be honest I don&#x27;t do enough polishing to be a great judge on this one!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and love that it&#x27;s made with natural oils.  It&#x27;s also a great dryer too.  My nails have been looking great.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years; nothing matches ease of use for taking care of problem nails and cuticles--worth the price.  I recommend this product highly.  Sorry I can&#x27;t find the easy-use cuticle wand anywhere; guess it is no longer available.  Can&#x27; go wrong with Delore.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I had a manicurist at Nieman Marcus used Delore on my nails, and I have used it ever since. I only gave it 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;because I haven&#x27;t tried everything else on the horizon, but this is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its just an oily mess. I use it everyday and it does absolutely nothing. Now, I put it on top of another hardener and I&#x27;m seeing results. I strongly believe it&#x27;s because of the other hardener.</li>
            <li> Wish it would make my nails harder, but guess i need to keep applying it.</li>
            <li> This product helped strengthen my nails and for the 1st time in years, my nails are looking good.  Used to go for weekly manicures but nails would still split and chip.  Since using this product my nails have grown and no longer split.</li>
            <li> Best for your nails. The product has been around a long time. It keeps cuticles in shape!</li>
            <li> Has really helped my nails from cracking</li>
            <li> Used for decades; great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years and it&#x27;s great to moisturize your nails and stop peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li> I used to sell this to every customer I came in contact with back in my beauty industry days. Last year my folks both had triple bypass surgery the same month! They look so much better this year, but one thing they have started to have issues with their fingernails. I ordered this for them to get the health in their nail back. I know it works on normal situations, I will update as they use it if it helps them too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife which used to use it many years ago however she had not been able to find it.  She loves it.  I bought 4 of them for her and she has given 2 away to friends who also used to use it and were unable to find it again.  They have thanked her profusely so I guess it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> helps my cracking nails</li>
            <li> This is BY far the best nail hardener on the market today. NO ODOR or fumes - completely nontoxic and organic. You get two units with this great price, I&#x27;ll buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> my nails are GORGEOUS!!! so long, and the tips are so white! it looks like i have a \\&quot;french-tip\\&quot; all the time. i love this and will always use it because my nails would not grown and would chip like crazy...i hope they never discontinue this....</li>
            <li> The best.  Use it all the time.  This product does what it says it will do.  Moisturizers your your nails.</li>
            <li> Love, love , love this stuff and had been looking for it for years.  Use it daily and recommend it to both genders.</li>
            <li> Best nail hardener ever!!!!. I have used Delore nails for over 20 years. It is in my opinion the best nail hardening product on the market. I&#x27;ve tried others for various reasons but I&#x27;ve always come back. For those unaware, most nail hardeners are topicals that are applied like nail polish. As long as you have it on, your nails are stronger. Unfortunately within days or even hours of removing with polish remover your nails become weak again. I&#x27;m not saying these are bad products. In fact some are quite good. Nail magic and OPI are two that I would recommend if your looking for a temporary fix. However, If you want healthy strong nails then Delore nails is your answer. It&#x27;s an oil infused with vitamins and minerals. You apply a small amount and massage it into the nail bed and surrounding skin. It works from the inside out to create truly strong healthy nails. And if for some reason you run out or don&#x27;t have access for a couple of days (or even weeks) your nails will remain strong. It also dries your nail polish. Just apply within a few minutes after you&#x27;ve painted your nails and gently massage in as you normally would. Your polish will dry in about half the time. Along with proper filing and buffing you should have gorgeous nails in no time. I also would recommend the Ruby Crystal nail system. Not in place of Delore nails but in addition to it. For anyone interested you can purchase it at HSN (Home Shopping Network) for about $24.00 dollars. Just go to HSN.com and type Ruby Crystal into the search bar. There&#x27;s a video you can watch that explains what it is.</li>
            <li> My mother has used this for years and we finally found it again online.  This stuff is like a little miracle in a bottle.  I have very brittle nails that peel, crack, and bend easily.  This goes on like an oil and soaks into the nails.  It makes them strong and healthy.  A bonus is that it works as a top coat (do not use as a base coat b/c it is an oil the polish won&#x27;t stick) and drys nails in minutes!  I definatly recommend this product and will be using it from now on.</li>
