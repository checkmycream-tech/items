            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old, fair skinned and have been outdoors most of my life.  </li>

            <li>that Nectifirm was worth getting a jar of.</li>
            <li>this vendor, Nectifirmt is fresh.</li>
            <li>Crepey skin is nearly GONE; fine lines remain, but area noticeably diminished.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I hope it is having a positive effect, it is too soon to evaluate.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist, the nurse who does laser skin treatments on me, and the plastic surgeon where I get Juvey Ultra injections all recommended Nectifirm for vastly reducing crepey skin and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I noticed results almost immediately; it has firmed up my neck so much</li>

            <li>But now one jar has turned into these two-packs, and I realize I can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only neck cream that really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I had sagging skin and deep wrinkles on my neck making me look older than my age.  </li>

            <li> I had sagging skin and deep wrinkles on my neck making me look older than my age.  </li>
            <li> In short, I am no longer a candidate for CO2 lasering - absolutely no way.</li>
            <li> That alone is like a minor miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams for making the wrinkles appear less obvious; however, I was wasting my money until I discovered Revision Nectifirm!  </li>
            <li> Will never live without using this cream.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot less crepe and the deep wrinkles are diminishing and my jaw line appears firmer too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this cream and absolutely swear by it.  </li>
            <li> But I simply don&#x27;t want to go that invasive route, with its inherent risk for infection and few weeks of down time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the very few products that actually work.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream instead of expensive laser treatments and it really seems to be firming my neck after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Diligently, over the past two months, I put just a small dab of Nectifirm on each trouble spot, twice a day (after showering and again before bed).</li>
            <li> I find that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with crepiness, and now I&#x27;m getting jowls, so not sure if it&#x27;s going to work for those.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had two neck lifts over the past 10 years, so I can&#x27;t say that the cream tightens that visible &amp;#34;waddle&amp;#34; - mine was removed surgically.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable till you try it!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and this price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Very nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I am very pleased. I first purchased it from a dermatologist. It is not a miracle worker but it does tighten theskin on the neck.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  Been using it for years and will continue to do so.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with crepiness, and now I&#x27;m getting jowls, so not sure if it&#x27;s going to work for those.  Wish the Revision.com site provided a bit more information about product use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m 57 years old, fair skinned and have been outdoors most of my life.  I had sagging skin and deep wrinkles on my neck making me look older than my age.  I noticed results almost immediately; it has firmed up my neck so much and I look much more youthful.</li>
            <li> Will never live without using this cream.  My Dermatolotist recommends highly!  It works, but only if you use it!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams for making the wrinkles appear less obvious; however, I was wasting my money until I discovered Revision Nectifirm!  Since I was introduced to it, about 3 years ago, I have made a promise to myself that I will apply it to the neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; areas.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist, the nurse who does laser skin treatments on me, and the plastic surgeon where I get Juvey Ultra injections all recommended Nectifirm for vastly reducing crepey skin and fine wrinkles. I picked up a brochure, surfed up to their website, and even tried out a sample given to me by the nurse. I was impressed enough after that trial sample was gone that Nectifirm was worth getting a jar of. But now one jar has turned into these two-packs, and I realize I can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kidding, I had moderate crepey skin and fine lines in several places on my 58-yr-old face: sides of mouth, chin, area between lip and nose, under-eye and smile lines and even a patch over each eyebrow! In submitting pictures of my crinkly face to the plastic surgeon two months ago, his advice was to get CO2 lasering. But I simply don&#x27;t want to go that invasive route, with its inherent risk for infection and few weeks of down time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diligently, over the past two months, I put just a small dab of Nectifirm on each trouble spot, twice a day (after showering and again before bed). I had taken pictures BEFORE, so when I saw the new shots taken AFTER, I was impressed! Crepey skin is nearly GONE; fine lines remain, but area noticeably diminished. In short, I am no longer a candidate for CO2 lasering - absolutely no way. I had already been using Nectifirm on my neck for about 6 mos, and my neck is without any crepey skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had two neck lifts over the past 10 years, so I can&#x27;t say that the cream tightens that visible &amp;#34;waddle&amp;#34; - mine was removed surgically. But I can definitely say that Nectifirm cream on my face and neck seem to just about eliminate crepey skin and greatly reduce fine lines. That alone is like a minor miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nectifirm for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;m thrilled.  I didn&#x27;t take a before picture because I didn&#x27;t want to see it but I&#x27;m no longer scowling at my aging neck in the mirror anymore.  There&#x27;s a lot less crepe and the deep wrinkles are diminishing and my jaw line appears firmer too!  I&#x27;m happy and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it. My neck looks better day by day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this cream and absolutely swear by it.  Use it twice a day and have definitely seen a difference.  One of the very few products that actually work.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Work really well.</li>
            <li> This keeps my neck skin fairly taunt!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered with expediency.  Product quality was as advertised.  I love this product.  I was really impressed with my whole experience doing business with this seller.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> The only neck cream that really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Can notice a difference after 30 days!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helping...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product I love it have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Best product on the market. I have used for over 2 years . Most reputable doctors carry this pricy but cheaper on line. Tried stopping using this for a while and that&#x27;s where you can tell it works as I started sagging again. Make sure to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> I like the size an this product has really helped my sagging neck look firmer.</li>
            <li> I hope it is having a positive effect, it is too soon to evaluate.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent service!!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream instead of expensive laser treatments and it really seems to be firming my neck after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Never leave home without it. Received both bottles in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Receiving it in the mail saves me hassle and time!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I see no improvement after 2 months.</li>
            <li> ....not so good from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this vendor, Nectifirmt is fresh. Inquire as to packaging numbers when you purchase.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable till you try it!! Give it 4 weeks and you will see a difference but then you have to keep using it&lt;br /&gt;Miracle cream</li>
