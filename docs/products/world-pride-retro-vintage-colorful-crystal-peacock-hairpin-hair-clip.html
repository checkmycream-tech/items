            <li>I love this clip.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors and like another person mentioned doesn&#x27;t weigh a lot.</li>
            <li>2 1/2 inches is about all touching the hair and both side of the clip</li>
            <li>Better for child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>...the item was satisfactory for me and the person i got it for was pleased with it....</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I loved this hairpin so much I bought the matching bracelet.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, smaller then the picture makes you think but very well put together and looks gorgeous in.</li>
            <li>Slides in smoothly, strong spring.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty when wearing adds a nice  splash of color.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice for a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>But the cheap price made me just reorder another.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be cheap looking</li>
            <li>The clip works well and is light weight .</li>
            <li>More lightweight and colorful than it looks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 13 yr old granddaughter, she loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for getting my naturally curly shoulder length out of the way with a touch of color.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>it is very pretty</li>
            <li>I give it a 5 stars because it is very pretty and is well made.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, but arrived missing one stone.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 3 of these, so pretty, and they look pricey!</li>
            <li>Well made and really pretty!  </li>
            <li>However, would have liked a little more brightness to the colors.</li>
            <li>Way too colorful for my liking.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the cost</li>
            <li>And.......ONLY $2.99 &amp; free shipping  WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Looks great with a plain outfit to add a splash of color.</li>
            <li>When I close the clip it does not close right, I have to keep fixing it.</li>
            <li>HAS AN EZ CLIPPER HOLD AND PRETTY COLORFUL CRYSTALS</li>
            <li>This barrette is really pretty</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made very well!  </li>
            <li>Pretty, looks like photo</li>
            <li>Good for those with hair that can&#x27;t handle heavy</li>
            <li>I bought more for friends with long hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want to use itlin the same way as on the picture, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this clip.</li>
            <li>Clip works great, I use it for my daughters hair which is thin.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is so beautiful.........it is made really well....</li>
            <li>and i really like.</li>
            <li>thanks i can put into my hair and i get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li>If you use lightly and don&#x27;t sleep in it, should last longer than mine did.</li>
            <li>It looks much heavier in the picture.  </li>
            <li>the gems are super bright colored and cheap, and the eyes are a creepy neon red color.</li>
            <li>Goes very well with her dark hair and makes her feel more grown up.</li>
            <li>The big rhinestones are colorful and look nice, the little ones, look very plastic and not shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I use it to clip my bangs back and because there are so many colors on the pin, it matches with a lot of different clothes.</li>
            <li>It is more for decoration that to actually hold a bigger amount of hair.</li>
            <li>So far I think I&#x27;ve spent more time looking at it than wearing it.</li>
            <li>but the stones look very cheap and one was missing when it arrived.</li>
            <li>spring is surprisingly high quality, it holds</li>
            <li>Usually when I have gotten hair &amp;#34;jewelry&amp;#34; at a low price it breaks easily or it looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute but small.</li>
            <li>but this is my second clip I&#x27;ve had to buy because the first one, the stones came out.</li>
            <li>Broke in the first second</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought it would be, doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all.</li>
            <li>Total length is about 4 inches, but of that 4 inches, the part you use to open it and and an inch of the other end won&#x27;t count as it would be under your hair, not seen and has nothing on top of that part to hold hair.</li>
            <li>are flat and it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, and holds tight.</li>
            <li>Spring type clip is more like a clamp that is is extremely tight, and heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as large as I thought so will work for a decoration or to pull back a little bit of hair</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> Wore it once and it corroded so half of the metal is black instead of antique gold color.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up everyday and use it a lot.  </li>
            <li> but I do not think it would hold thick heavy hair like mine.</li>
            <li> The jewels are all false, some missing even.</li>

            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but not what I expected. The jewels are all false, some missing even. Though it&#x27;s a nice brass work</li>
            <li> This is so cute and the price is perfect. The product is really good quality. I would recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Way too colorful for my liking. Looks cheesy and cheap in my hair. Like something a child would wear. Looks nothing like the picture. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite clip. I use it to clip my bangs back and because there are so many colors on the pin, it matches with a lot of different clothes. I lost my last one so I ordered a new one, otherwise I had that one for over a year and it&#x27;s help up perfectly well. No loss of color, no stones falling out, and the clamp still holds well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but arrived missing one stone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 yr old granddaughter, she loved it. Goes very well with her dark hair and makes her feel more grown up.</li>
            <li> I love this clip. Got Here quicker than expected.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t love it or hate it. It is a nice weight and holds well but the stones look very cheap and one was missing when it arrived. It&#x27;s not as large as I thought so will work for a decoration or to pull back a little bit of hair but I do not think it would hold thick heavy hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This barrette is really pretty and it&#x27;s made very well!  I&#x27;ve worn it several times and have gotten lots of compliments every time!!  Usually when I have gotten hair &amp;#34;jewelry&amp;#34; at a low price it breaks easily or it looks cheap.  This is well worth the cost and I have recommended it to several of my friends!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute but small. if you have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s not for you. it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair. If you want to use itlin the same way as on the picture, it&#x27;s fine. The big rhinestones are colorful and look nice, the little ones, look very plastic and not shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! should buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well. It pulls adding tension to my head. My hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> Much smaller in size, doesnt look as impressive as in picture.</li>
            <li> my daughter will love it</li>
            <li> I really like this clip. It seems to be made well and looks great in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> This is really a beautiful clip.  I love it.  The jewels, for the price paid are amazing.  You couldn&#x27;t get anything like this in a store!</li>
            <li> Wore it once and it corroded so half of the metal is black instead of antique gold color.</li>
            <li> It is just beautiful. For the cheap price, I am really happy. It matches my peacock earrings.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this was coming from overseas. Got here quickly. Beautiful hair accessory. I love it. Free shipping!</li>
            <li> This arrived within the timeline I was given and I  had no problems.  I had ordered one of these several months ago for a friend and her daughter &#x27;borrowed&#x27; it so I purchased another for my friend. She always gets a lot of compliments when she uses it in her hair.</li>
            <li> WAS GIFT AND HAS BECOME FAVORITE--DANCERS IN HER FAMILY LOVE IT AND IT STAYS IN BUN HAS AN EZ CLIPPER HOLD AND PRETTY COLORFUL CRYSTALS</li>
            <li> Clip works great, I use it for my daughters hair which is thin. It holds well but this is my second clip I&#x27;ve had to buy because the first one, the stones came out.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so beautiful.........it is made really well....great quality.....I have purchased several of this seller&#x27;s hair clips.!!!  LOVE ALL OF THEM!!  And.......ONLY $2.99 &amp; free shipping  WOW!!!</li>
            <li> it is very pretty and i really like. it. thanks i can put into my hair and i get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> This is incredibly ugly. the gems are super bright colored and cheap, and the eyes are a creepy neon red color. Dissappointed. Spring type clip is more like a clamp that is is extremely tight, and heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this clip.  I wear my hair up everyday and use it a lot.  It didn&#x27;t last very long before the center pin wore out.  But the cheap price made me just reorder another.  If you use lightly and don&#x27;t sleep in it, should last longer than mine did.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my order.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 of these, so pretty, and they look pricey! Made very well, great gift for a teacher!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very lightweight!  It looks much heavier in the picture.  Good for those with hair that can&#x27;t handle heavy things.&lt;br /&gt;-The spring is surprisingly high quality, it holds tight!&lt;br /&gt;-No sharp seams.&lt;br /&gt;-All rhinestones were intact when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The rhinestones have a definite plastic look&lt;br /&gt;-Holds only a small amount of hair.  For my hair thickness and length (4inch ponytail and tailbone length hair), it can only be used as a decoration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy for the price.  It takes awhile to arrive, but $1 for a cute hairtoy is a good deal in my book</li>
            <li> Loved it nice hair clip can&#x27;t wait to try it on!  I thought it might be cheap looking but it is actually really nice.  Love the colors and like another person mentioned doesn&#x27;t weigh a lot.</li>
            <li> good table decorations</li>
            <li> For the price it is a great clip. It is very pretty, and holds tight. It is smaller than I though. Total length is about 4 inches, but of that 4 inches, the part you use to open it and and an inch of the other end won&#x27;t count as it would be under your hair, not seen and has nothing on top of that part to hold hair. 2 1/2 inches is about all touching the hair and both side of the clip are flat and it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all. It is more for decoration that to actually hold a bigger amount of hair. I give it a 5 stars because it is very pretty and is well made.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time now</li>
            <li> Like it, but smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> Lasted me 2 years, just bought a replacement.</li>
            <li> Well made and really pretty!  It holds tight instead of slipping down and holds a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty, looks like photo</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be, doesn&#x27;t hold much hair at all. Better for child&#x27;s hair. Will not hold long hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, smaller then the picture makes you think but very well put together and looks gorgeous in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this order, waiting in it....I was going to report what I haven&#x27;t gotten and this is one of then</li>
            <li> Very pretty and good price.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty when wearing adds a nice  splash of color. The clip works well and is light weight .</li>
            <li> This item arrived when they predicted that it would and it is as seen in the picture. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> ...the item was satisfactory for me and the person i got it for was pleased with it....</li>
            <li> WAS SATISFIED WITH HAIR JEWEL. EVEN ORDERED MORE</li>
            <li> Very pretty , perfect for any occasion</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved this hairpin so much I bought the matching bracelet.  More lightweight and colorful than it looks.  Looks great with a plain outfit to add a splash of color.</li>
            <li> The colors on the clip I received are more brighter. It&#x27;s about four inches long. When I close the clip it does not close right, I have to keep fixing it.</li>
            <li> Good for getting my naturally curly shoulder length out of the way with a touch of color. However, would have liked a little more brightness to the colors.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Broke in the first second I tried to open the clip the metal broke and then the stones fell out. That&#x27;s what you get for $2.00.</li>
            <li> Love it. I bought more for friends with long hair.  So far I think I&#x27;ve spent more time looking at it than wearing it.</li>
