            <li>But I cant say which product is the best, since I started using them together.</li>

            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I don&#x27;t like to use product in my hair, but this stuff is wonderful and has made me a convert!</li>
            <li>I have never found anything else that is good for moisture, shine and bringing out the curl!</li>
            <li>It smells great; It doesnt make my hair oily and it hydrates it a</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling great.  </li>
            <li>looks great when it dries.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>waves are more defined because of Pantene Pro-V silky --- it has a good hold, but doesnt make hair look like it has gel or any product on.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it; it smells wonderful, but&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good item, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a combination of mousse and gel (neither alone does the trick) and that worked okay.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I put the whip all over my hair (even on the top of my head)and</li>
            <li>I think its with anything else, you gotta try it for yourself :)</li>
            <li>(But still not too much moisture lol)</li>
            <li>One of a kind, unique technology.</li>
            <li>I am a teenager, so my hair is literally the most important thing ever.  </li>
            <li>so squirt easy</li>
            <li>but you can use it all because it is light weight.</li>
            <li>Such a shame - otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>Omg this moose is so good that it leaves your hair feeling soft ..</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
            <li>and I was kinda excited at the idea of it giving moisture and styling</li>
            <li>, I see the other reviewers love it so for me to be that person saying its not so good</li>
            <li>When its drying but still damp I use Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil (which is SO amazing ---</li>
            <li>one more thing careful pressing the lid to dispense it shoots out fast LOL</li>
            <li>Super product, just need an acorn size for moisturizing the ends of my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE what this does for my naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li>This product worked great - didn&#x27;t weigh down my curls, and didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;messy\\&quot; when applied.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and works au naturale or with heat.</li>
            <li>I have wasted a great deal of the product.  </li>
            <li>works exceptionally well on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Unlike anything else I have ever used, a great leave in conditioner and light hold of mousse that I add to my hair after my shower and either let it air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li>That was my mistake the first time I used</li>
            <li>and they give you 15% off the first time you buy from them.  </li>
            <li>I am really sure how I feel about this product, I have used it many times, but not sure on what it does or how it&#x27;s suppose to work.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product a lot of whip came out, so I would use it in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>, it gets rid of dryness and makes my hair look pretty.</li>
            <li>but my hair is pretty greasy and looks greasy</li>
            <li>it works, however I wasn&#x27;t aware it as a foam</li>
            <li>One of the only products I have tried that I enjoyed to the last drop and bought two more bottles</li>
            <li>I think it has the right weight to really control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>love this product...makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry straight...</li>
            <li>I use this as a protectant/styler when I blow dry my hair, and it leaves it shiny, moisturized, healthy and sleek for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part: no buildup or unpleasant residue if your hair isn&#x27;t washed daily, so the great styling effect lasts as long as your hair normally lasts in between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works great on my poopy, frizzy wavy hair wet or dry!</li>
            <li>Leave hair soft and nearly tangle free</li>
            <li>It takes the proof and frizz out and emphasizes the curls gently.</li>
            <li>You really need a fraction of what you would use if this was mousse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I like it and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something to moisturize my hair but not too much, after blow drying and straightening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Id just say if your hair is fine, you might want to go with a tiny amount and figure out what it is going to do it does feel soft though.</li>
            <li>I use the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series No Crunch Curls Whip Moisturizer + Styler version when I am letting my naturally wavy hair air dry - which I bought after falling in love with the regular version I am reviewing here.</li>
            <li>Smells great but is not strong smell when hair is dried.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture Whip, Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil</li>
            <li>I use Organic Argon oil from Whole Foods but that leaves my hair oily the next day</li>
            <li>My hair is silky, shiny, and manageable without being too soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft and with no frizz</li>
            <li>Works well, smooths hair and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product my hair does not get all frizzy and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair, it comes out straight without having to use a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have fine highlighted  blonde past shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>Sometimes the dispenser is faulty and the foam keeps coming out for a certain period of time making a mess and wastage.</li>
            <li>It just pumps out way too much at a time, one little push is like a handful</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It makes your hair silky and soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Gives me soft silky finish with lots of body &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
            <li> I have low porosity, dry hair that gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> (my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I should mention that we blow dry our hair when using this product so I do not know how it works if you air dry.</li>
            <li> After letting it dry ~60%, I use a blowdryer to finish the job, then style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it in between shampoos too, to wet the ends and blow dry them out for smoothness.</li>
            <li> So I was having problems with frizz, very dry ends and curls with no shape.</li>
            <li> It dispenses like a traditional mousse, so be  careful not to get a lot as all you need is a little.  </li>
            <li> All I do is brush it through with a wet brush and my hair is done.</li>
            <li> When its not so wet, I use Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture and just use my fingers to distribute the product</li>
            <li> I follow the directions carefully</li>
            <li> I have read a few other reviews with similar problems</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not good for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> If I decide the curl my hair, curls stay longer and look healthier due to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> when you pump even for just one second you get at least five minutes of the product flowing out of the container.</li>
            <li> , I never want to be that odd person</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s the trifecta of a mess</li>
            <li> Because I do not see the difference in my thick, curly, dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I put in on very little and it still felt grimy.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair with a weird residue.  </li>
            <li> Just use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> After showering, I put a walnut sized dollop of Pantene Moisturizer + Styler, Silky Moisture Whip on my palm and rub it between my hands with a small pump of Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel Creme By Tigi.</li>
            <li> hard to explain</li>
            <li> but I also use it on my thin hair (little bit.)  </li>
            <li> Suits my hair which is curly and thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length, color treated, kinky-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I hate using hair dryers and straighteners,so I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of expensive leave in conditioners and this works just as well at fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I wanted mouse for styling but ordered the wrong item.</li>
            <li> is weird</li>
            <li> and I have a terrible time finding product that controls it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love! This works great on my poopy, frizzy wavy hair wet or dry! It takes the proof and frizz out and emphasizes the curls gently. All I do is brush it through with a wet brush and my hair is done. I have never found anything else that is good for moisture, shine and bringing out the curl! A Lot comes out so squirt easy but you can use it all because it is light weight.</li>
            <li> LOVE what this does for my naturally curly hair!! Give it body, gets rid of frizz, enhances the curl.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair with a weird residue.  I put in on very little and it still felt grimy.  I threw it away after I realized there was no hope for this product.</li>
            <li> One of a kind, unique technology. Suits my hair which is curly and thick. Sometimes the dispenser is faulty and the foam keeps coming out for a certain period of time making a mess and wastage.</li>
            <li> love this product...makes my hair soft and easy to blow dry straight...I like to use it with a bit of oil .</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/long curls and was damaged because of highlights. So I was having problems with frizz, very dry ends and curls with no shape. I bought 3 products that definitely changed this scenario: Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture Whip, Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil and It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in Plus Keratin. So, my hair now is just amazing: healthy, shiny and beautifully wavy. But I cant say which product is the best, since I started using them together. This is what I do: I shampoo and condition my hair. I use Its a 10 miracle Leave in and comb it. When its not so wet, I use Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture and just use my fingers to distribute the product -- I dont use a comb like it suggests. When its drying but still damp I use Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil (which is SO amazing --- Best oil I have ever used. It smells great; It doesnt make my hair oily and it hydrates it a lot.)&lt;br /&gt;My waves are more defined because of Pantene Pro-V silky --- it has a good hold, but doesnt make hair look like it has gel or any product on. Its really amazing and affordable.</li>
            <li> good item, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> works exceptionally well on dry hair.  It adds shine and body and emphasizes the curl.  Leave hair soft and nearly tangle free</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length, color treated, kinky-curly hair.  Yeah, it&#x27;s the trifecta of a mess and I have a terrible time finding product that controls it.  I&#x27;ve used a combination of mousse and gel (neither alone does the trick) and that worked okay.  I use Organic Argon oil from Whole Foods but that leaves my hair oily the next day (my hair is dry so I wash it every 3 days).  Then, I  got a sample of this from P&amp;G and finally tried it last week.  It&#x27;s an amazing product.  My hair is silky, shiny, and manageable without being too soft.  I think it has the right weight to really control the frizz.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and am thrilled with it.  When I blow dry my hair, it comes out straight without having to use a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the smallish size fool you.  You really need a fraction of what you would use if this was mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, don&#x27;t put a mousse size glob in your hair.  You don&#x27;t need it and you&#x27;ll be rinsing it out and starting over.  That was my mistake the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I came here to buy it thinking Amazon would have a good price but Whoa!!!  Walmart has it for $5.99.  P&amp;G online has it for $5.99 and they give you 15% off the first time you buy from them.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be going to Walmart instead of the theives who are selling it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not good for naturally curly hair. Made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair feeling great.  Soft and with no frizz and I have tried a lot of others. I do not however like the dispenser.  I have wasted a great deal of the product.  I follow the directions carefully and yet when I finish dispensing and release pressure it continues to release foam.  Once started, it can&#x27;t be manually stopped .  It spits out foam for about a minute, which is a lot of foam, and then stops.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes your hair silky and soft without weighing it down. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Omg this moose is so good that it leaves your hair feeling soft .. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine highlighted hair and this works great! Gives me soft silky finish with lots of body &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down a bit. I have tried tons of expensive leave in conditioners and this works just as well at fraction of the cost. Smells great but is not strong smell when hair is dried.</li>
            <li> I am really sure how I feel about this product, I have used it many times, but not sure on what it does or how it&#x27;s suppose to work. Because I do not see the difference in my thick, curly, dry unmanageable hair. The only good thing about it; it smells wonderful, but&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Works well, smooths hair and leaves it soft.  Great for thick hair but I also use it on my thin hair (little bit.)  Just use a small amount.  A little goes a long way.  I should mention that we blow dry our hair when using this product so I do not know how it works if you air dry. It dispenses like a traditional mousse, so be  careful not to get a lot as all you need is a little.  But I will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works very well.  This was a accidential purchase. I wanted mouse for styling but ordered the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Unlike anything else I have ever used, a great leave in conditioner and light hold of mousse that I add to my hair after my shower and either let it air dry or blow dry. If I decide the curl my hair, curls stay longer and look healthier due to the conditioner. The perfect product, absolutely!</li>
            <li> hard to explain but this is too sticky and my hair dries frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have low porosity, dry hair that gets frizzy. I hate using hair dryers and straighteners,so I let my hair air dry. When I use this product my hair does not get all frizzy and my hair is soft and shiny. The first time I used this product a lot of whip came out, so I would use it in your bathroom. I put the whip all over my hair (even on the top of my head)and my hair  looks great when it dries. I love this product because it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to, it gets rid of dryness and makes my hair look pretty.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy. This product worked great - didn&#x27;t weigh down my curls, and didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;messy\\&quot; when applied. But it took just two days for the product to run out. I have read a few other reviews with similar problems so I know it&#x27;s not just me - when you pump even for just one second you get at least five minutes of the product flowing out of the container. Such a shame - otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this with my Shampoo and I was kinda excited at the idea of it giving moisture and styling, I am not sure if it was I applied too much product but my hair is pretty greasy and looks greasy I have fine highlighted  blonde past shoulder length hair , I see the other reviewers love it so for me to be that person saying its not so good is weird, I never want to be that odd person lol..........but I must say it might have been just the conjunction to my shampoo and conditioner. It was not the same line, so maybe it was that? Id just say if your hair is fine, you might want to go with a tiny amount and figure out what it is going to do it does feel soft though. I think its with anything else, you gotta try it for yourself :)&lt;br /&gt;oh one more thing careful pressing the lid to dispense it shoots out fast LOL</li>
            <li> Super product, just need an acorn size for moisturizing the ends of my shoulder length hair. Use it in between shampoos too, to wet the ends and blow dry them out for smoothness.</li>
            <li> I am a teenager, so my hair is literally the most important thing ever.  I wanted something to moisturize my hair but not too much, after blow drying and straightening.  This stuff is aweome it works, however I wasn&#x27;t aware it as a foam lol it is.  The only problem I see with it is the way the foam comes out.  It just pumps out way too much at a time, one little push is like a handful so weather I want to or not, I end up using alot of it.  (But still not too much moisture lol)</li>
            <li> Amazing product at a great price! I use this as a protectant/styler when I blow dry my hair, and it leaves it shiny, moisturized, healthy and sleek for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene website claims that \\&quot;Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Whip helps hair feel moisturized for up to 48hours, helps protect against heat damage and regulate hair&#x27;s moisture- delivering silky hair that shines.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes and yes - this stuff delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I don&#x27;t like to use product in my hair, but this stuff is wonderful and has made me a convert! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and works au naturale or with heat. I use the Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Series No Crunch Curls Whip Moisturizer + Styler version when I am letting my naturally wavy hair air dry - which I bought after falling in love with the regular version I am reviewing here. The best part: no buildup or unpleasant residue if your hair isn&#x27;t washed daily, so the great styling effect lasts as long as your hair normally lasts in between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most often, I use it after shampooing with either Pureology, Fekkai or Nexxus shampoo and conditioner duos, which I alternate depending on how I am styling my hair. After showering, I put a walnut sized dollop of Pantene Moisturizer + Styler, Silky Moisture Whip on my palm and rub it between my hands with a small pump of Catwalk Your Highness Thickening Gel Creme By Tigi. Then I distribute it evenly throughout my hair. After letting it dry ~60%, I use a blowdryer to finish the job, then style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: A must have. One of the only products I have tried that I enjoyed to the last drop and bought two more bottles so I am never without!</li>
