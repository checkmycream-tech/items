            <li>However, it is great for making my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I received a jar of this as part of a gift and was thrilled with the scent and how well it moisturized my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>It still works as a nice cream, but it is NOT what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>Being a SWISA product, I thought it would have a really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Makes a working girls hands feel like new &amp; smells so great!  </li>

            <li>I love this body butter.  </li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing this item again, but for the price, it&#x27;s okay and will be used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, as well as it came in a very timely matter.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This cream is the best lotion for dry skin that I have ever found!</li>
            <li>The best product for dry and damaged skin!  </li>
            <li>I think the scent brings sweet dreams!</li>
            <li>Originally bought this from a kisko in the mall and didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever be able to find it again.  </li>
            <li>It does not absorb easily into the skin.   </li>
            <li>Also, the seller shipped this out very quickly, so they get a thumbs-up for that.</li>
            <li>But I tell you,I don&#x27;t know my hair is feeling pretty good right now.</li>
            <li>It smells great and perks my dry skin right up and leaves it nice and shiny (glowing).  </li>
            <li>The sales rep.  wasn&#x27;t kidding when he told me how smooth my skin would become after using it.    </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at a car show in California.</li>
            <li>My hubby loves the soft, sexy smell :)</li>
            <li>If you want compliments on your soft, healthy skin and the lovely scent that everyone notices, you&#x27;ll indulge in this body butter.</li>
            <li>It also is a much lighter lotion, I feel like my skin can breathe better.</li>
            <li>We won&#x27;t use any other kind!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>Is smooth and silky, smell lasts all day, and has done wonders for my old skin!!!</li>
            <li>i love it and plan to continue buying it as long as its available for this unbeatbale price</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and good smelling.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable Amazon value.</li>
            <li>I bought three more last month.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i have gotten it from this supplier.</li>
            <li>I have many allergies, especially excema, and was hesitant to try new products, but this body butter has not affected my skin at all.</li>
            <li>By the time I was ready to leave, it was almost gone.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s about $20 cheaper) that this was not the real deal.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows where I can purchase the real product from, PLEASE let me know.</li>
            <li>Much to my delight</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice, not strong.  </li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ve got to be devoted to using it to realize it&#x27;s full potential.  </li>
            <li>Two stars because it&#x27;s a decent cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>It was a soft scent, but very fragrant, and would draw compliments.</li>
            <li>It softens, isn&#x27;t greasy, but is my favorite all round lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick.</li>
            <li>The scent is very, very, close to that of the original, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>I purchased a jar for each of my daughters, and a new one for myself.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this Milk &amp; Honey body butter.  </li>
            <li>However, the cost is far too high.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product last year.</li>
            <li>As I was getting ready to go to Hawaii, from Idaho in the middle of the winter, I went looking in my \\&quot;collection\\&quot; of leftover creams for something to help my feet.  </li>
            <li>There were four adult women and three men staying in our condos...</li>
            <li>It immediately transformed my hair into a soft texture!Now</li>
            <li>Maybe, when this jar is done,i might try the formula for hair or try a natural shea butter product.</li>
            <li>They cost a lot, but are worth the investment if you want to rejuvenate your rough skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin and really like this</li>
            <li>The consistency should be smooth and buttery, this is just thick and super hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>This when used with the salt scrub really worked for my extremely dry and rough heels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I first tried this product last year. It is the best body cream out there.  I bought three more last month.</li>
            <li> As I was getting ready to go to Hawaii, from Idaho in the middle of the winter, I went looking in my \\&quot;collection\\&quot; of leftover creams for something to help my feet.  I saw this, which my husband had purchased for me a couple years ago, and it just kinda got lost in our moving, so I threw it in my suitcase.  There were four adult women and three men staying in our condos...and they all fell in love with this product.  By the time I was ready to leave, it was almost gone.  I purchased a jar for each of my daughters, and a new one for myself.  This is the best smelling, most soothing, creamiest body butter ever.  It is hard to imagine that anyone would not LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> In 2006, I purchased this body butter at a kiosk at my local mall.  The sales rep.  wasn&#x27;t kidding when he told me how smooth my skin would become after using it.    I can&#x27;t live without this Milk &amp; Honey body butter.  I use it every night on my neck, my feet and my hands.  But you&#x27;ve got to be devoted to using it to realize it&#x27;s full potential.  I apply it to my feet every night after showering and throughout the day on my hands.  The scent is very soothing.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Was given Swisa Beauty Body Butter, Dead Sea Body Butter a few years back for Christmas. I fell in love with it. When I gave out, I went on line to search for it. I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times and bought multiple jars each time for fear the next time I would not find it. It is too good not to keep on hand. The fragrance is beautiful and the cream itself is non-greasy and soaks right into the skin. Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a jar of this as part of a gift and was thrilled with the scent and how well it moisturized my legs and arms.  The person who gave it to me lives 700 miles away and I was afraid I would have a hard time replacing it.  I use it after every shower...I live in Pa. where winters can be cold and dry.  I cannot imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> This when used with the salt scrub really worked for my extremely dry and rough heels. So I got some for my dad, too. I highly recommend these products. They cost a lot, but are worth the investment if you want to rejuvenate your rough skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the mall plus the sea scrub.I used up all the scrub,but this I still had.I recently decided to grow out my relaxer.I am African American.I was about to give up and just relaxer my hair because it was so,so,so dry!I tried grease,kera kare,wave cream.I finally looked in my cabinet and said let me see what&#x27;s in here that might help my brittle hair.When I read the ingredients on the jar and saw it had shea butter I decided why not? Oh,my goodness,my hair drank it up.It immediately transformed my hair into a soft texture!Now,I am a bit concerned that it has Sea salt(Dead Sea).but, when I looked up the Swisa hair formula,it also has dead sea salt!With this products help,I will probably never relax my hair agan!  Maybe, when this jar is done,i might try the formula for hair or try a natural shea butter product.But I tell you,I don&#x27;t know my hair is feeling pretty good right now.I also used it on wet hair for bantu curls.It is mostly my everyday moisturizer now,not heavy or greasy,but then again my hair is very dry without this.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter.  It smells really good.  I would recomend this product to everyone.  It left my skin soft and good smelling.</li>
            <li> This a great product, I love it!!! Is smooth and silky, smell lasts all day, and has done wonders for my old skin!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start this off my stating, the product image in the picture is not what I received! The product I received is in a different shaped jar, and I really do not think it&#x27;s the same product I received from the merchants in the mall. I&#x27;m not too happy.   As some other commenters have mentioned, I just happened to stumble upon this in the mall as I was bombarded by the pushy sales people. I reluctantly purchased the item, but after use was glad I did! I have been searching for the product ever since I ran out, but let me tell you, this is not it...  Maybe the price should have been an indicator (it&#x27;s about $20 cheaper) that this was not the real deal. The scent is very, very, close to that of the original, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long. The other scent would last all day. It was a soft scent, but very fragrant, and would draw compliments. This is not as fragrant. Also, it&#x27;s so thick that it is sticky. The consistency should be smooth and buttery, this is just thick and super hard to rub in. It does not absorb easily into the skin.   I will not be purchasing this item again, but for the price, it&#x27;s okay and will be used. Also, the seller shipped this out very quickly, so they get a thumbs-up for that. Three stars.   P.S. If anyone knows where I can purchase the real product from, PLEASE let me know. My hubby loves the soft, sexy smell :)</li>
            <li> This body butter is great.  The smell is so nice, not strong.  It makes my skin soooosoft.  Will keep buying this one!</li>
            <li> The jar in the picture is wonderful and I have purchased it before.  What I got in the mail was something completely different.  Not happy that I bought 2 jars of something I never got!</li>
            <li> This body butter is a light, non greasy body butter for your skin that lasts all day, and the fragrance is wonderful. I used  Aveeno products for years until I discovered this product. I have many allergies, especially excema, and was hesitant to try new products, but this body butter has not affected my skin at all. It also is a much lighter lotion, I feel like my skin can breathe better. I am on my third jar and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct; you don&#x27;t get the product in the picture.  You get something very similar in color, but it&#x27;s a different package and it leads me to wonder if the cream is the same.  I do not think this is Swisa cream.  I haven&#x27;t read the fine-print ingredients yet, but it does not feel the same.  It still works as a nice cream, but it is NOT what I paid for.  Two stars because it&#x27;s a decent cream.</li>
            <li> If you want compliments on your soft, healthy skin and the lovely scent that everyone notices, you&#x27;ll indulge in this body butter. It&#x27;s the only gift I have to keep my daughters supplied with. We won&#x27;t use any other kind! Very reasonable Amazon value.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin! I use many Premier products and have enjoyed wonderful results with all of them.  Nice and thick. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I know it was cheaper. It was too good to be true. Should have known. I have gotten the original before and loved it. This is the first time i have gotten it from this supplier. Never again. Throwing this in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it for some time. I like it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Makes a working girls hands feel like new &amp; smells so great!  I use it at bedtime!  I think the scent brings sweet dreams!</li>
            <li> Originally bought this from a kisko in the mall and didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever be able to find it again.  Much to my delight I found it on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Being a SWISA product, I thought it would have a really nice fragrance. It didn&#x27;t. However, it is great for making my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, as well as it came in a very timely matter. I would definitely recommend this product as well as service.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at a car show in California. VERY EXPENSIVE! I just happened to find this on line and ordered it thinking it could not possibly be the same. Well it was so I will be buying it this way from now on. Great product, great price! This cream is the best lotion for dry skin that I have ever found!</li>
            <li> i use this product every day after showering and my husband notices the diffrence. i love it and plan to continue buying it as long as its available for this unbeatbale price</li>
            <li> The best product for dry and damaged skin!  However, the cost is far too high.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Great product</li>
            <li> I finally can relieve my irritated face. I found it in the bathroom of a friend in Florida. it&#x27;s asmazing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and the price was great for it! It softens, isn&#x27;t greasy, but is my favorite all round lotion. I love to put it on my legs after shaving and all over!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it is rich, it absorbs well, and it smells good.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and really like this</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  It smells great and perks my dry skin right up and leaves it nice and shiny (glowing).  I would recommend this product to anyone (unisex fragrance).</li>
            <li> Husband bought this for me at the mall for big $$$ one Christmas.  Once I ran out, found it on line and keep it orderedd regularly.  Great scent and wonderful feeling</li>
