            <li>It has a very soothing, pleasant aroma and we like that.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a great aroma to it, that I do actually find relaxing and comforting.  </li>

            <li>It has been such a joy to use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whether or not aroma provides therapy, but we do enjoy this hand soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the lotion goes on silky smooth-</li>
            <li>The one I purchased from the store originally came in 12oz bottle.</li>
            <li>This would be worth purchasing by the gallon!  </li>
            <li>To me it smells clean.</li>
            <li>love this stuff and the whole line.</li>
            <li>Everything you would want a hand soap to be!Love the super clean fragrance</li>
            <li>as always very well satisfied</li>
            <li>I firmly believe this is the best product bath and body works offers!</li>
            <li>cheaper kind that I alternate with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Only one bottle was shipped&lt;br /&gt;I paid more to buy direct with Amazon Prime...</li>
            <li>and i have been completely taken aback by how much I love</li>
            <li>nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands</li>
            <li>I think this would be useful to repel mosquitos when summer hits.  </li>
            <li>no rubbery sticky feeling from this fresh glide!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a high quality hand soap that leaves both your hands and the bathroom smelling clean, crisp and fresh.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The hand soap has a particularly strong scent, and is a bit heavier on the eucalyptus and a bit lighter on the spearmint than some of the other products, but overall it&#x27;s a good product with a scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know if it relieves stress</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for certain</li>
            <li>I like the intense scent of this liquid soap,</li>
            <li>Really likethis handsoap.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle, foaming hand soap that is both aromatic and well cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I tried this every night for about a week, but I could not get over how much it smells like cologne.  </li>
            <li>Between this and the spearmint dots on my temples, I feel refreshed and ready to face whatever comes my way at any given time.</li>
            <li>I bought a few more thinking the first was a fluke</li>
            <li>The aroma caught in the hot steam of the shower makes for a nice sensory experience, and stays with you for a little bit after you get out of the shower (not to long, maybe 20 minutes).</li>
            <li>but those came with broken dispensers also--not good if you are using these for gifts.</li>
            <li>It was as I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue using it as far as I can get it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this soap at Bath &amp; Body works a few years back.</li>

            <li> I originally bought this soap at Bath &amp; Body works a few years back.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid hand soap with a good consistency- not too thick, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> This soap is at our kitchen and bathroom sinks and we use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li> The scent and peppermint is a little less intense.</li>
            <li> You can wash your hands in this product and smell it longer than any hand wash I have used in a long time!  </li>
            <li> and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind, but I swear that I doo feel less stress using this soap.</li>
            <li> It has less fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent lingers on your hand for a little bit after you are done washing your hands.  </li>
            <li> normally haven&#x27;t like Bath &amp; Body Works products in the past because the scents seem fake and bother me</li>
            <li> they should have it year round in stores</li>
            <li> You will look like an idiot for hours walking around smelling your hands because they smell like a cool mountain cabin in a eucalyptus grove.</li>
            <li> not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at thestores.  </li>
            <li> Bottle dispenser piece was broken.  </li>
            <li> Tired of my hands smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> Very expensive considering the small amount you get.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find they did not carry this anymore in the store in my area.</li>

            <li> Excellent product and fast service.  thanks!</li>
            <li> You will look like an idiot for hours walking around smelling your hands because they smell like a cool mountain cabin in a eucalyptus grove.</li>
            <li> I like the intense scent of this liquid soap, when I use it I feel like I am pampering myself.  The scent lingers on your hand for a little bit after you are done washing your hands.  Sometimes I also use it on the body in the shower.  The aroma caught in the hot steam of the shower makes for a nice sensory experience, and stays with you for a little bit after you get out of the shower (not to long, maybe 20 minutes).</li>
            <li> This hand soap is really a favorite of mine and anyone who I&#x27;ve given it to as a gift.  You wash you&#x27;re hands and you&#x27;ll want to smell you&#x27;re hands several times as you walk away from the faucet.  Not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I keep 2 hand soaps out.  1 cheaper kind that I alternate with.  ;-)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this soap at Bath &amp; Body works a few years back. I was disappointed to find they did not carry this anymore in the store in my area. I was very happy to see they had it here on Amazon. I should have read the item description closer because these are only 8oz size bottles. The one I purchased from the store originally came in 12oz bottle. I got two bottles. Very expensive considering the small amount you get. Excellent smelling soap though. Love it.</li>
            <li> Ultimate scent in soap.</li>
            <li> This hand soap is powerfully fragrant and puts you in relief mode!!!  The product is wonderful!  I&#x27;d strongly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This soap has a great aroma to it, that I do actually find relaxing and comforting.  It is likely that I will repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Really likethis handsoap.  Smells really good and had many people like it as well.  Hard to find at thestores.  Plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Every one in the family loves this soap.  The scent is marvelous, the cleaning very good. A wonderful experience all in all</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind, but I swear that I doo feel less stress using this soap. The aroma is intoxicating! Since I don&#x27;t have a Bath and Body Works nearby, this was a nice Amazon order. I wish I had bought a dozen!</li>
            <li> enjoy the Eucalyptus Spearmint aromatherapy..&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 2 bottles for gifts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one bottle was shipped&lt;br /&gt;I paid more to buy direct with Amazon Prime...&lt;br /&gt;Arrived after the holidays... thus I am now keeping the gifts.</li>
            <li> I am currently staying at a place that has this hand soap and i have been completely taken aback by how much I love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally haven&#x27;t like Bath &amp; Body Works products in the past because the scents seem fake and bother me, however, this is completely different. When you wash your hands, this smell feels so inviting and calming. After washing my hands, I found myself smelling my hands so that I could smell the wonderful spearmint scent on them. It has been such a joy to use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont, however, find the soap to be &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going out to get my own supply of this soap!</li>

            <li> This is a liquid hand soap with a good consistency- not too thick, not too thin.  The scent is part of B&amp;BW stress relief aromatherapy line.

            <li> I just wish I could get in in a gallon refill.  Tired of my hands smelling like perfume. This is much better</li>
            <li> I love it, and I would recommend it to anyone. I have used it for some time and I&#x27;ll continue using it as far as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for the smell. I don&#x27;t notice any stress relief.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I used this soap at a friend&#x27;s house and fell in love with it. I went to amazon.com and ordered it before checking Bath &amp; Body Works, it&#x27;s only $5.50 there. Oh well I still love it.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing. Now learning to work with oils and all things relaxing! Thank you for providing this aromatherapy to my senses. I use it at work.  Lov lov lov!</li>
            <li> Great product, on time, packaged well. Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried this every night for about a week, but I could not get over how much it smells like cologne.  I think that it just how it smelled to me though, I wouldn&#x27;t say to not try it for others.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it but it is not the same as bath and body. It has less fragrance. The scent and peppermint is a little less intense.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the girls in my office and they love it.  Wish I had gotten on for myself! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Everything you would want a hand soap to be!Love the super clean fragrance</li>
            <li> I have used this soap in my bathroom for years.  I also bought another soap.  Am wondering why this sent was not a prime purchase and everything else I bought (similar items)  were.  Shipping almost doubled the cost of this item!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! I love the calming smell. I firmly believe this is the best product bath and body works offers!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Eucalyptus - great invigorator in the morning! nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands</li>
            <li> LOVE IT !!! I use it in shower. Will get more when I&#x27;m out.  I think this would be useful to repel mosquitos when summer hits.  Mosquitos don&#x27;t like mint or eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> as always very well satisfied</li>
            <li> This would be worth purchasing by the gallon!  You can wash your hands in this product and smell it longer than any hand wash I have used in a long time!  Between this and the spearmint dots on my temples, I feel refreshed and ready to face whatever comes my way at any given time.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality hand soap that leaves both your hands and the bathroom smelling clean, crisp and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  Hope it will be available for quite a while!</li>
            <li> the smell combines two of the best essential oils for stress relief.&lt;br /&gt;the lotion goes on silky smooth- no rubbery sticky feeling from this fresh glide!&lt;br /&gt;great price!</li>
