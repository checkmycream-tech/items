            <li>Very nice dermaroller.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but I am hooked on derma rolling, the results after just 1 week are amazing!</li>
            <li>I have read many wonderful reviews</li>
            <li>I kind of had to talk myself into this one!</li>
            <li>Every woman should own one of these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given this product for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly really thrilled with this, and will keep it up!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Also, the microneedle roller is a perfect size, making it easy to roll around the contours of the face and</li>
            <li>, it felt good, no pain at all, then I rolled it on my face and neck too.  </li>
            <li>It feels good once it&#x27;s over</li>
            <li>Good Product, met my expectations.</li>
            <li>The roller feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>surprisingly, it works</li>
            <li>It is good to use if you are using hydrolonic acid or a lotion afterwards because it would absorb well</li>
            <li>In addition, 1mm is the optimum needle length to treat a variety of skin concerns.</li>
            <li>Always remember to get rollers from trusted brands, I trust Petunia because the quality of their rollers are superior to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and this seems to be a good choice if you are on the lookout for one.</li>
            <li>For my scars I apply rosehip oil after derma rolling since it is good for reducing scars.  </li>
            <li>the skin around my temples looks really good -</li>
            <li>but I did get good results with my temples again where I have acne scars</li>
            <li>My face feels really good since I started using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li>This derma roller is good quality and comes in a sealed packaged.  </li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>but it feels so good in your skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon recommend some good pairings</li>
            <li>the gf loved this.</li>
            <li>Even quality of plastic storage case was of superior design and quality.</li>
            <li>Feels good on face.</li>
            <li>540 needles rolling across the face didn&#x27;t seem very appealing.</li>
            <li>very interesting product.  </li>
            <li>was really impressed with how well my moisturizer absorbed into my skin afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use this at night, apply the serum right before bed.</li>
            <li>its a very excellent product for fine lines &amp; wrinkles each time i use the derma roller my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you follow them correctly in order to achieve best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve seen them fade with prolonged use as well as with my own skin care</li>
            <li>This product arrived very quickly and seems good quality and was as described.</li>
            <li>The roller was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li>This is a  painless safe and effective home use micro needling roller, this is suitable for men and women to use on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It came in perfect conditions, nice package, just as its advertised, have used it only once, 2 weeks ago since arrival but can see already some improvement in my face</li>
            <li>Make sure you disinfect thoroughly with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, rinse it with warm water, and wash your face well before every use.&lt;br /&gt;Also important!</li>
            <li>This has helped reduce fine lines, and acne scars!</li>
            <li>received quickly; product as advertised; rolling was fairly painless...</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice plastic case with a troth for easy roller cleaning.</li>

            <li>I love this thing, gets your products INTO your skin better, &amp; gives a Rosetta glow</li>
            <li>and it hurt much more on my hand then on my face.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin looks better now than it has in 30 years.</li>
            <li>This derma roller for the face is cute &amp; slender.</li>
            <li>and I use more on my face and hands to tighten and renew the skin to get tighter, firmer skin.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought someone would ever say &amp;#34;I love rolling 540 needles all over my face?&amp;#34; -- I never thought I would have, but using a Derma Roller has become a favorite addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>This thing is actually better than my Microdermabrasion machine and my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to go searching for more information anywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that if you&#x27;re looking for more bang for your buck, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I am able to take advantage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li>The longer you use it the more it hurts</li>

            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I think with the time I will be able to see better results.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t received so many compliments in regards to my youthful appearance in years!l</li>
            <li>rolling the needles over yours skin, it leaves microscopic puncture wounds, this in turn sends a message to your body to produce more collagen.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple derma rollers and have to say this one by Petunia is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Your skin can get more refined and even toned if you keep using it in your routine.</li>
            <li>I received product free to review but this is my own opinion.</li>

            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used to have bumps all over my arms and legs and the Derma-Roller works like magic.  </li>
            <li>gave a 5 star rating because it works great and is very well built.</li>
            <li>I notice that my skin absorbs my body butter SO much more than untreated areas.</li>
            <li>The best overall effect is my skin feels so much more firmer and plumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin but you begin to notice more blood flow to that area.</li>
            <li>It will make your skin look better feel youthful and more rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>If it helps my face better absorb the moisturizer</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better</li>
            <li>more product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope the redness goes away soon, since I have to use a lot more concealer when going out now because of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review and add another star since it is rated as working for that.  </li>
            <li>love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>I assume it will just look better as the days go by</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;~ Creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products more able to penetrate the skin at a deeper level than just surface application&lt;br</li>

            <li>My wife says her skin is 100% better after using this product, but</li>
            <li>WHAT A GREAT BEAUTY TOOL,AND VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to be able to increase the pressure being used with the derma roller as well as the frequency.</li>
            <li>It is also supposed to help stimulate collagen production--which is important for helping get rid of wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I was given one free to give my honest opinion of it.</li>
            <li>I feel as if my moisturizer works better after using this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic idea that works!  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>but its looks more like a glowing skin than inflammation.</li>
            <li>my skin does feel more moisturized and looks better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my derma roller by petunia skincare.</li>
            <li>and I think it will save you a lot of money because they offer this at many derma spas and salons but why on earth would you pay them to do it when you can do it yourself?</li>
            <li>I love this derma roller.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to receive this derma roller free in return for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>received the product for free, but the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>I would say my skin is way better now.</li>
            <li>I was told that the longer needle length would produce more pronounced results but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>i am in love with it  </li>
            <li>have received these products for free my honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love dermarollers because I have acne scars and hyper pigmentation</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing great results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to learn and review this product exchange for free.</li>
            <li>Titanium has attributes most relevant in a variety of surgical applications, including micro needling.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>As much as I spend on face products, it&#x27;s nice to know they can actually penetrate my skin and give the the greatest benefit for my money when I apply them after using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li>I genuinely saw a much better absorption and results from the skin care products I had already been using.  </li>
            <li>far it has worked great</li>
            <li>Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li>never have I read so many 5 star comments in a row all by customers that receive their products free.</li>
            <li>I honestly am surprised at the great price for the product I got.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my skin really absorbs lotions and serums better, which seems to make them more effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li>So I cannot comment about it, other than the recipient was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li>The dermal roller itself has its own hard plastic case that the roller fits perfectly in.</li>
            <li>I love this Derma Roller so easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>but I did find it easy to use</li>
            <li>but I did find it easy to use</li>
            <li>They have made this an easy and convenient way to get these treatments at home.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning, no rusting after washes.</li>
            <li>If you can pluck your eyebrows, you can easily do this.  </li>
            <li>but you can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with quality materials and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Care and cleaning seem easy.</li>
            <li>rinse the roller with water, and perhaps rinse with rubbing alcohol as well to be sure its clean.</li>
            <li>it was great!It was painless for me and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a easy  to hold handle</li>
            <li>The needles are not as strong as the ones I used before</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you use a good cream as that helps to minimize the discomfort that you get from the device.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most important positive reaction that I love the most and that is it tightens the skin and smooths it out, meaning when I was applying my make-up you could see my skin droop.</li>
            <li>Got to try this free for review, very sturdy, high quality, clean and works great!</li>
            <li>The biggest difference I&#x27;ve seen is that the skin care products I use immediately after using the derma roller are able to be absorbed much faster and much more effectively.  </li>
            <li>The following is an added aside for other brave hearts (you and you alone know your skin&#x27;s tolerance the best):  </li>
            <li>This product is meant to stimulate collagen for stretch marks, enlarged pores, acne, blackheads, wrinkles abd fine lines, crows feet, and it is also used to tighten up saggy skin.</li>
            <li>Have to say I have noticed an improvement in my skin from the first time, seems to be in better condition with more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li>It contains 540 1.0 mm needles on a roller meant to roll on your face and body to stimulate collagen production and help reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I used this for about 4 weeks and noticed my pores shrinking and my fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li>MY FINE LINED SKIN.  </li>
            <li>Then apply the serum you want to absorb more quickly because using this product will help the serum you use absorb more quickly.</li>
            <li>ideally you should apply something afterwards since your skin is open and will absorb a serum quickly.</li>
            <li>The results are already VERY evident!  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super quick and easy!</li>
            <li>Use your own judgement if you wish to use this more frequently than described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because I have HUGE pores on my face, cellulite on my legs, a ton of stretch marks, and some scars I&#x27;d like to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>I received the derma roller for free.</li>
            <li>definitely helps face serums and creams absorb better and work more effectively.</li>
            <li>The product is light, sturdy and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product if you want to improve your skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>Nothing can get rid of stretch marks, but this product does do a great job of changing there external appearance through epidermal changes.</li>
            <li>A light touch and a couple of minutes is all it takes to glide the roller on your face</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I can feel that it&#x27;s more easily absorbed.  </li>

            <li>like I have seen videos just a light tickle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most exciting process</li>
            <li>While the helpful usage guides and tips are appreciated, the over-zealous show of enthusiastic emails asking for feedback are not.</li>
            <li>It still gives a redness to the skin with just a light pressure.</li>
            <li>Since using it , and applying the make-up I noticed a tightened smooth</li>

            <li>I received this for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly examined this roller before use, for any defects such as bent needles and everything looked great.</li>
            <li>I used it once a day every 2-3 days with light pressure.</li>
            <li>have received this product free for product review purposes.</li>
            <li>Great price, visible results in only 4 weeks,</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this</li>
            <li>I am a wound care nurse, and I know how important the collagen is for our skin.</li>
            <li>and it still hurts like my skin has been lightly bruised.</li>
            <li>I  was given it free to review.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just super easy to use, the rolling doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can easily do this twice a week.</li>
            <li>So far so good does seem to help complexion somewhat.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it on cellulite yet, but have on my wrinkles and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>if your face is sensitive this may be a good size for you.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It does work good, my sister loves it so far</li>
            <li>I am seeing good results so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I personally really like it and believe that I will make this part of my beauty regimen maybe once a week or so nothing more as too much of a turnover may not be a good thing?</li>
            <li>Not going to lie it kind of ticks me off that my skin is that sensitive to it while majority of people seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I have to admit this product has really helped diminish my stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and can definitely say I love this derma roller!!</li>
            <li>As someone that is always looking for ways to improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Petunia Skincare Derma Roller as my first derma roller I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li>I am loving the derma roller so far!!</li>
            <li>but I did notice the rosehip oil I use on my face absorbed a lot more quickly after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li>I think the benefits of stimulating collagen production, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing large pores while smoothing skin are the ones I am most wanting to see.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best companies I&#x27;ve dealt with on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve dealt with a few!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it can be used on your face or on your body because you get so many benefits in so many different locations from one product.</li>
            <li>but she was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Not only are my stretchmarks and scars MORE visible than ever, my cellulite is now MORE visible than ever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I&#x27;ve had no ill affects of using this more often than recommended.</li>
            <li>My smile lines are going away!</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it because I have superficial acne scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after reading 16 pages of the majority of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Derma rolling is very good for anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that it does sting when using the roller, but it is very worth it!</li>
            <li>This derma roller appears to trigger new collagen and elastin production and the skin renews and my skin feels nice and tighter.</li>
            <li>find that this needle size is super comfortable</li>
            <li>my fave is smooth because I&#x27;m currently using proactiv + which surprisingly is working quite well.</li>
            <li>then rinse and clean roller.</li>
            <li>like the needles kinda exfoliated my skin while at the same time making the appearance of any scar kind of vanish plus with the produts your face has more absourbion..</li>
            <li>I am not using any special serums or anything and am using it about twice a week.</li>
            <li>product scared me a little at first but after getting it I was actually very impressed.</li>
            <li>I also do the back of my hands because I see them more and can better judge the effects - it does seem to be working to get rid of some of the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed and loved about this product was it was completely sealed in a wrap.</li>
            <li>This is the first product of this kind I have tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything.</li>
            <li>I am using it twice a week for better results and my skin is really glowing and feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li>Love the product, save so much money from seeing dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Also, it will take more time for the pokes to heal if you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>it is to soon to see full results</li>
            <li>it is to soon to see full results</li>
            <li>it actually feels good on your skin .</li>
            <li>Shes been using it daily for 2 weeks and its looking good.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>but my pores are ofcourse still full of grime if I squeeze it</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I cant wait to see how much it will improve after more rolling.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and was actually kind of relaxing in a way.  </li>
            <li>After using the Derma Roller the products had a much more intense absorption.  </li>
            <li>reviews.com glad I tried this thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful just a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>and I can not judge it, but initially sounds good</li>
            <li>One other thing I would highly recommend using a serum after rolling not an oil or lotion because they say that serum penetrates the best.</li>
            <li>Takes a little time to get used to but feels good!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and pretty painless.</li>
            <li>Amazing results because i notice my large pores are minize and my skin feel much smoothing</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>But after researching and talking with people who do have experience, most said if done properly you can use it more often.</li>
            <li>and you learn quickly...</li>
            <li>You also learn not to go too quickly.</li>
            <li>received this roller free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own, and are not influenced by outside sources.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.It helped with the cellulite I was experiencing, as being pregnant for 8 months</li>
            <li>I can FEEL the serums I use after this working better, it makes my face tighter after use, and I&#x27;m sure my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>Since using this my skin has become more clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this roller appears to be great quality and the results seem promising.</li>
            <li>im rolling needles on my face its SUPER invigorating.</li>
            <li>This is a very intriguing and exciting skin care implement that I put to use right away.  </li>
            <li>But looks great, very small and glad it came with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Derma Rollers are also great for minimizing dark spots or age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Derma Roller, which comes in it&#x27;s own case and sealed in a bag, is also a much better construction compared to my other roller.</li>
            <li>I might need to go to larger needles for some of my issues I think, but for what it has done I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it!</li>
            <li>The roller leaves a tingling prickly feeling afterwards,its not unpleasant though.</li>
            <li>Derma rollers have many purposes to them when used correctly and rolled across the area you need it can heal cellulite, acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles among many other uses.</li>
            <li>particular Derma Roller is helping my S/O to minimize his acne scarring on his cheeks, the improvements are impressive even with just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare does a good job of giving basic instructions on the box making this easy to start using even if you&#x27;re completely new to all</li>
            <li>VERY quickly, that it does not require much pressure at all.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite skin care find ever!!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I have seen a difference with in the first week of using!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;m pretty excited about receiving the Petunia Skincare Derma Roller to review.</li>
            <li>but it is very squeaky!!  </li>
            <li>My first time using a derm roller, but I like it!</li>
            <li>but if u do works really well!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m seeing more results with this roller for less money than all the serumsand lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is easy to open up and be able to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it really will help with the fine lines over time.</li>
            <li>If you are not using Vitamin C serum, I recommend others to use good quality lotion right after the dermaroller because it will leave your skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>If this is something you would use everyday, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>Ive used it and cant really see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>But with anything worth your time, it takes your time.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get used to the needles but its worth it.</li>
            <li>my honest opinion  and written after receiving the product sponsored by Petunia and using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Comes with complete instructions, care, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find a cream that reduces them a bit, but I&#x27;ve never had much success with them shrinking long-term.</li>
            <li>I have only used the roller twice (2 weeks apart) but it worked great and no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>So far it has helped her skin feel healthy and helped with the pores and acne areas.  </li>
            <li>So far she is happy with this but will reserve final judgement with some longer term use.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li>She is not afraid of needles</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>And the moisturizer seems to be absorbed quicker and deeper.</li>
            <li>does indeed help lotion to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and helps the moisturizer  penetrate much better.</li>
            <li>If there is anything to take away from this, spending for a 540 needle model is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I tell myself it’s worth it because think of all the blood flow going to my face.</li>
            <li>I feel it definitely is worth a try I am using mine on my stretch marks</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>My main concern, like most, is that my pores are large on my cheeks</li>
            <li>After using the derma roller every other day for a week with the 1mm needles I did notice a huge difference, probably of 60% reduction, which is unheard of for me and really is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality product and I have been pleased with many of my other Petunia Skincare products as well.</li>
            <li>Pretty great little device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll actually go back through after about half an hour and add more just to make sure I&#x27;m nice and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that I highly recommend to anyone looking to clear up their skin.</li>
            <li>All right</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I moisturized right after I rolled my face.</li>
            <li>Even though I had no idea how to use it when I got it, the directions are right on the box</li>
            <li>but I use it faithfully right before I put on my retinol  serum at night.</li>
            <li>At first, there is pain in more sensitive ares like the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I was afraid the first time, but the roller dont damage the skin, is very easy use in the face, I like so much ....</li>
            <li>but certainly was not painful.  </li>
            <li>and I was super excited to try something new..</li>
            <li>in all I think the Petunia 1.0 mm 540 needle derma roller is a fantastic high quality item and would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles, and lesson acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The directions were pretty easy to follow, I didn&#x27;t apply any pressure, just normal pressure when rolling (I did about 10 rolls in each direction).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that all women be super careful in the handling, washing and storing of their derma roller (no need to infect your own face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m focusing more on my acne scars and yet to see better results but my hyperpigmentation around my chin and upper lip area has completely vanished.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product , I think however this product should be used with some kind of serum, moisturizer for better penetration of the nutrients deep into the skin</li>
            <li>When applying make sure you use a steady pace with normal pressure.</li>
            <li>Derma rollers are said to make your skin firmer, help smooth facial scars, stimulate collagen and elastin production, help with scar removal and fading stretch marks, stimulate hair growth as while as diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>While these are some of the many benefits of using a derma roller there are many other benefits as well!!</li>
            <li>I think the stainless steel needles really do make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen those videos showing how derma roller really can work on the face and after I&#x27;ve tested on my leg, I have the confident to use it on my face now.</li>
            <li>-WOW it did hurt and my skin turned bright red -</li>
            <li>As, everything I do I read the instructions and made sure my face was clean and dry before using this product.</li>
            <li>I do recommend you go at your own pace and only do as much as you feel your skin can handle, you can always increase and make adjustments as you go along.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this 1 day but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Been using it regularly and am beginning to see a difference in my fine lines and deeper wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li>and the pain wasn&#x27;t very intense</li>
            <li>This is a very unusual device in the area of skincare.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind a little ouch to look good.</li>
            <li>This Derma Roller is now both my absolute favorite go-to micro-needling device and a major step up from what I was using before.</li>
            <li>Quality is actually a little better than I expected, the plastic handle has a nice weight to it and the carrying case is sturdy and one I&#x27;ll actually use since having a wheel of needles just laying around doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li>The derma roller is also pretty well made, and the handle is sturdy.</li>
            <li>but I am willing to keep on trying.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this product being used on YouTube by woman who stated she works for a certified Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>But be gentle with the product just gently hold it and maneauver with thumb and index finger and thumb to lightly glide the product over the surface of your desired area but be gentle with it</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I remembered when I first used the derma roller, after watching so many youtube videos, I could only test on one my scar on the leg.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll surely come back to share my visible results.</li>
            <li>since i am using the same moisturizer for years i saw a tad bit of a glow and more hydration after using derma roller.</li>
            <li>The idea of rolling over 500 needles across the skin on my face was pretty daunting to me.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about using this at first</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, it was something I have to get used to.  </li>
            <li>So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days.</li>
            <li>and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li>Saw results the first time i used this roller</li>
            <li>A couple days a week is all you need to use this derma roller, and make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it/sterilizing it properly after each use.</li>
            <li>We make sure to pour 90% rubbing alcohol over ours to kill any potential nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a derma roller</li>
            <li>It never shows scratches on my face (only mostly the fattest thinnest part of my body makes the scratches.</li>
            <li>give it a try and see what you think - not expensive to try either.  </li>
            <li>But hey, I&#x27;m willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I watched a video on YouTube on derma rolling first.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt funny at first</li>
            <li>well microneedles to be exact</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first dermaroller</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much Petunia Skincare!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I used it really lightly on forehead and side of face where my skin is mostly clear.</li>
            <li>so I tested it on a scar on my leg first.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  </li>
            <li>My skin results are joyous and wow!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different options and uses for this Derma Roller by Petunia</li>
            <li>I found that doing it at night is so much better, because your face will become red.</li>
            <li>My face is far from smooth.</li>
            <li>and it seems to do exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li>but i am willing to be patience and continue using it.</li>
            <li>My skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li>I got a compliment on my skin the first day I used.</li>
            <li>and I can see a real difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I was most concerned about, like the hyperpigmented and acne-scar areas, and worked my way around my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Derma Roller for a few weeks and am delighted with the way my skins feels.</li>
            <li>Wow, that tingles!!!!</li>
            <li>My face is bright and tight now!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it isn&#x27;t as noticeable, but when I am outside or my skin gets hot, the damage shows up more readily.</li>
            <li>There is no need to press hard, lightly rolling it across your skin is quite effective.</li>
            <li>it is really feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I really have not seen much difference to my fine lines or dark spots with the Derma Roller itself, I find that it does help the Vitamin C serum attack discoloration better than it does on</li>
            <li>Hopefully with proper use, time, and incorporating of the Vita C serum, along with my collagen mask and cream regimen I will be able to see some real results.</li>
            <li>I did not like it on the scalp though because my hair is super long and thin so it was pulling it out to much,so i stopped that,but I wish I could have kept it up though because id love some more healthy growth to come out of my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first time I used the derma roller (pain level was very mild and didn&#x27;t bother me), I could see results the following morning.</li>
            <li>They are known to cause some pain, but the feedback about its benefits has been positive- be it</li>
            <li>They are known to cause some pain, but the feedback about its benefits has been positive- be it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was a bit nervous, but it really works well.</li>
            <li>I have no doubts that I will see more results using this dermal roller long term.</li>
            <li>I also read online that you can use it on stomachs, arms and pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li>I have bumpy skin and when I used it regularly, my skin started becoming even, smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very intimidated when I first got it</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty much just  going to test it in one area again another day and see if anything happens.  </li>
            <li>Now my skin is acne free I still do have some light scar, I have used many strength and different type peels to get rid of the old scar but they&#x27;re not completely gone.</li>
            <li>I use it on my trouble areas (cheekbones and nose, mostly) and my skin is already looking much more clear after just a week of use.  </li>
            <li>This does work and I&#x27;m having good results, but get lazy and don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can see that some of my more recent acne scars are improving, while the older scars haven&#x27;t really changed much, but those may take more time anyways.</li>
            <li>the idea sounds really cool but after using it for a week, the only difference I saw in my skin was I broke out so much!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to see the long term results on this.</li>
            <li>In natural light and most other lighting it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have seen these around and have heard about them a lot, but honestly I was slightly intimidated by how they work.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and it only takes a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I looked into it and it is basically collagen induction therapy, it has been around for ~15 years and seems like it can be safe as long as you keep the needles and the skin reasonably sterile.</li>
            <li>They are always looking for products like this and since its easy and works why not?I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>,also my skin is super sensitive so that could be why,too.</li>
            <li>Not that I have issues with my skin sagging because I don&#x27;t, but I am a preventative type of person when it comes to certain aspects of my life and skincare is one of them.  </li>
            <li>She doesn’t have cellulite but uses for areas that has problem acne and large pores.  </li>
            <li>but it can help with increased large pores.</li>
            <li>I have extremely large pores and using this product has improved that.</li>
            <li>This is something that is supposed to help with scarring, wrinkles, elasticity, large pores, and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>new face!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any other experience to compare with, but I think Petunia Skincare&#x27;s packaging is really suitable for a dermal roller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently, this tool is used to treat acne scars, deep scars and stretch marks, sagging skin, wrinkles and fine lines, cellulite, large pores, hyperpigmentation and lax skin and elasticity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller!</li>
            <li>Even though I was not able to use the product exactly as instructed I was still able to get results!  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a very high quality and construction.</li>
            <li>The change isn&#x27;t huge yet (in the sense that they&#x27;re still there), but there is a very noticeable, positive difference after only two weeks.</li>
            <li>A little instruction/cleaning enclosure would&#x27;ve been nice instead.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t ever used a derma roller previously; honestly they frightened me a little bit.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants softer clearer skin!</li>
            <li>However, they did not hurt as much as I thought they would.</li>
            <li>I used it with amlactin lotion, and now they feel much, much softer.</li>
            <li>I feel it helps really enhance the mask.</li>
            <li>I mastered all my courage and 1st rolled the roller on my hand to check how much it hurts, to my surprise it did not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>wow, it was absorbed in seconds.</li>
            <li>My skin never absorbs anything that fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the roller and how it is working on my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin is smoother and the products you put on after treatment really absorb into the skin instead of sitting just on the surface.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken pictures, so I pre-apologize for those reading this review.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink too much water</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say much about the product for now.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to see the result I expected however my skin face is looking better</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it hurts really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>Will take a while to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>Purchasing another one very soon.</li>
            <li>Really isn&#x27;t that noticeable....</li>
            <li>So I read the directions really well</li>
            <li>So much so it garnered unsolicited comments and questions about what I was doing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use it straight on my face in case</li>
            <li>This really did help me out a lot with my sun spots and damage skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>The ones on my knees have been there a lot longer however and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change on them yet.  </li>
            <li>Really like these, helps with product getting where it should</li>
            <li>however my skin feels much softer and smoother where i have been using it.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it as much on my skin</li>
            <li>It hurts I need a cream that deadens the skin a bit to really put pressure on the roller -</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars</li>
            <li>I was really debating if i wanted to try one of these as I had never had one</li>
            <li>my skin is absorbing my creams and serums a lot</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the roller....</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>I do not apply that much pressure to it.</li>
            <li>I really haven’t noticed it</li>
            <li>I use this primarily for acne scars, but also to achieve smaller pores.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my guess is those reviewers were being too aggressive trying to get fast results.</li>
            <li>If you think about the fact that all those needles are piercing your skin, sanitation really makes sense.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this item..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while, but haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>A light, even pressure is sufficient for the tiny needles to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if I really notice any benefit to my skin yet.</li>
            <li>Since I started using the derma roller, my skin has become much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my skin feel prepped and ready to absorb anything I put on it.</li>
            <li>I only applied light pressure and was amazed that I still saw results.  </li>
            <li>and i read the reviews saying products absorb into your pores much faster.</li>
            <li>Its way better than what I expected .  </li>
            <li>and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and</li>
            <li>and I am ready to try.</li>
            <li>I could really feel them working much faster.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it hurt that much,</li>
            <li>i did feel like my skin was tighter and much smoother and softer</li>
            <li>I really like how substantial the the handle is as well.</li>
            <li>I just use it lightly and my face turns beat red.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t see so much of a difference</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and product arrived as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and have been seeing real results.</li>
            <li>really helped with preparing for this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely painless (it was for me).</li>
            <li>#34;sinks in&amp;#34; and my make up glides on much smoother.</li>
            <li>I immediately applied a hyaluronic acid serum immidoately after rolling, then a very hydrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After about a month more of use I expect to almost be clear of them totally.  </li>
            <li>The most sensitive area was definitely my forehead and nose.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy for such a smaller roller.</li>
            <li>Rolling gently does not cause any pain; just make sure you avoid sensitive areas such as around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It;s a 1.00mm needles which is the common good size in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>The surface of the back of my hands looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;The spot on the back of my right leg is a mystery.</li>
            <li>It fades away pretty quickly and I then apply my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>on my first trial, i used a new lotion sample, and broke out it a rash.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dare to use it again because the scar I have is right near my heart.</li>
            <li>after the very first use followed by my regular skin regimen, I saw very noticeable results!</li>
            <li>This model&#x27;s sharp needles do not leave any visible prick marks and feels much more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>overall i am pretty much liking this derma roller, got it as a review purposes but will be using this product in future and will be putting an updated review as i used it more.</li>
            <li>My only real caution would be to keep the derma roller and your skin while using meticulously clean.</li>
            <li>I have seen these mentioned in several magazines, and by beauty bloggers, and was excited to try one.</li>
            <li>Agree with other reviewers it seems to help my night creams penetrate better; have noticed some firming of skin.</li>
            <li>This can be used on other parts of the body, but I&#x27;m sticking to my face, where I feel it will have the most benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.It reduced minor wrinkles and fine lines</li>
            <li>received the Premium Derma Roller – 1.0 mm 540 Needles High Quality Surgical Stainless Steel Microneedle Roller for Face and Body.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.. seems high quality for the reduced price...</li>
            <li>The first two pictures are me AFTER rolling for two weeks, and the last photo is me right BEFORE rolling (none of these pictures are filtered/edited).</li>
            <li>I have had professional needing done (200-250 a pop) and they use a numbing agent first because they would use needles that would go deeper to have the impact you would need.</li>
            <li>Overall I think the derma roller is a cool invention</li>
            <li>So far the results have been promising!</li>
            <li>Test first to see how vigorous you need to be with your own skin - I had a little peeling without doing too much and definitely like the results!</li>
            <li>Since I am new to dermal rollers, I&#x27;m so grateful that Petunia Skincare has so much information on their packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a slight pinch</li>
            <li>Well after using this roller one night the results were better than all of my treatments with my previous roller combined.</li>
            <li>My skin is pink after using it, but can easily be covered by makeup if I use it in the morning, and redness is gone by morning if I use it at night.</li>
            <li>This product is an add benefit and improves the 3 main collagen which are Plumping, Firming, and Elasticity.</li>
            <li>scar, while not puffy is really red at times, especially when I get out of the shower I wish my camera could capture it better, but picture one is pre treatment, picture two is immediately after</li>
            <li>and it said to roll over the affected area with steady pressure in all 4 directions for 10 times.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try to keep themselves looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and hope the results over the next couple of months are worth it.  </li>
            <li>The main reason for knocking off a star was the incessant emails from the seller.</li>
            <li>I got fraxel laser treatments several years ago and they helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Scary but very cool..works great..</li>
            <li>and I thought it was good,but the needles are super tiny</li>
            <li>The needles are super tiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it mainly to remove acne scars, so</li>
            <li>The needles are quality and if properly cared for, should last many uses.</li>
            <li>However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  </li>
            <li>In order to concentrate healing in a particular area is highly intriguing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Serums, especially Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic acid and a very rich moisturizer are key.</li>
            <li>Excited to see what the results of long time usage will be.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even the needles look high quality.</li>
            <li>This product has titanium needles 600 1.0 mm a high quality medical-grade titanium micro needles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product .body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the derma roller yet, but I will give it a high rating until I have reason not to.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to those wanting to make added skin care improvements.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using a vitamin C serum after use.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Takes a little time but if you are consistent, you can see fine lines gradually fade.</li>
            <li>the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband.</li>
            <li>At first I applied with light pressure because it does hurt a little.</li>
            <li>The whole roller has a sterile, professional look and feel to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The derma roller really helps clear that up.</li>
            <li>but I tried it and just got done with the 4th week, and wow I seen a real difference in my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Ouch not again need a real professional for this one</li>
            <li>It looks scary but it feels great to your face</li>
            <li>The thought of running tiny needles over my skin was both intriguing and nerve wracking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing worth noting is this 1.0mm length gave surprisingly better results than my much more painful 1.5mm roller.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there is a (probably more expensive) properly produced version of this which might be effective, but this is not it.</li>
            <li>First off, i bought this product for stretch marks on my abdomen, so I can&#x27;t really speak to anything acne related or for my face.</li>
            <li>but maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it more than a few times.</li>
            <li>This helps with common problems, you can use it in the privacy of your own home and it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;~ Superficial acne scarring</li>
            <li>This helps with common problems, you can use it in the privacy of your own home and it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>It made it easier for the serum that I was using, to absorb, and my face looked fresh as soon as the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband usually sees me go through so many skin care products that he really doesn&#x27;t notice if my face looks different/better/worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;- helps open up pores for serums and moisturizers to get absorbed</li>
            <li>Will update after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using this product since I don&#x27;t know if this is a normal occurrence or not.</li>
            <li>However, the redness did not last too long, so just use it at night on a weekend like it suggests and no one will know :)</li>
            <li>No complaint at all.</li>
            <li>I’m going to try a few more times and see if my skin thickens up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a good price, exfoliation is the name of the game these days, and this one fills the bill.</li>
            <li>After the dermaroller, my skin is slightly red and dry but it does make my skin absorb vitamin C serum better.</li>
            <li>It did help my acne scars on my face,i didn’t use it on my knee where I have a big scar because the skin there is super sensitive and</li>
            <li>Dark marks are fading very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My better half was excited to try this for improving her skin and although I personally would be nervous about trying what looks like a medieval torture device, she was eager to try it.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that my face is a lot smoother, and pores are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li>I do feel some tightness in are of overlapping and very light pink skin next day</li>
            <li>I was a little bit scared to use this when I first got it, but Petunia&#x27;s customer service walked me right through it!  </li>
            <li>I think the 540 needles made a large difference in not only the results but how much pain there</li>
            <li>I have only used this tool once so far, so I cannot give a full review, but I wanted to let you know how I am liking it so far.  </li>
            <li>:) So far it does seem to have made my skin appear a little tighter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% up for trying new things, so when this product popped up on my Tomoson I had to go for it.</li>
            <li>I wake up with new skin.</li>
            <li>Obviously you are not going to want to apply too much pressure as you roll across your face because OUCH, that would really hurt.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe the fantastic results in such a short time.</li>
            <li>do not have really any major skin issues on my face</li>
            <li>As far as results, I noticed that my skin absorbed serums better (less left on the surface of my skin) and generally felt softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sensitive oily skin and highly prone to hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>would also like to add that this is a very professional company.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed off my Indian Healing Clay mask, gently patted dry, then applied Dr. Song&#x27;s facial serum which contains 20% vitamin C+E with Hyaluronic Acid, then followed by a lovely moisturizer from my local health food store, 98% organic Shea Butter infused with Coconut &amp; Papaya.  </li>
            <li>significantly reduces cellulite, wrinkles and other skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>I think it works, but would have to be worked into a consistent skin regimen, and it just doesn&#x27;t work into my current routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first one of this length and at first glance I was extremely intimidated</li>
            <li>but I started first using it on my thighs for stretch marks and cellulite, then worked my way up to using it on my back for my acne scars!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that in this short of time I can see a difference, but I am willing to keep using the derma roller until I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out.</li>
            <li>My skin results are joyous and wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>so this is my experience so far!</li>
            <li>Makes face red at first...</li>
            <li>If you have deep under the skin acne or post acne marks, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to use a vitamin C serum directly afterwards!</li>
            <li>Wild looking tool!</li>
            <li>Using a dull roller can cause more harm than good, I still have prick marks from when my last one went dull and needed to be retired.</li>
            <li>, otherwise you can always rinse with hot water before use and deep clean once or every other month.  </li>
            <li>0.5 mm is recommended for light acne scars, mild chicken pox scars, thinning hair and mild anti-aging treatment.</li>
            <li>perhaps only 3x weekly and stay away from sensitive under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;I tested on my forearms first, to get used to using it and see how it felt.</li>
            <li>At first its a little uncomfortable with the needles but the more i did it the more relaxed</li>
            <li>For the greater part of last year I had been doing micro-needling (Derma Rolling) treatments at home with a 1.5mm roller that had considerably less needles than this one.</li>
            <li>I think that was due more to the strange angles of trying to roll over the side of my nose than anything else.</li>
            <li>I have large pores around my nose and they seem to be smaller.</li>
            <li>You don’t want to go to deep into the skin as you can irritate it more or even make you bleed a little.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and honestly tried really hard to make this work – in any way, for any result.</li>
            <li>This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li>It comes with a clear case that the Derma Roller snaps into.</li>
            <li>i bought this in hopes i could use it to clear my acne.</li>
            <li>So far I have not used the roller.</li>
            <li>Apart from using it on my face I am also currently using the derma roller on the stretch marks, which I got during pregnancy; I really hope they will eventually fade out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working really well and definitely has helped my skin appearance a lot</li>
            <li>Got this in two days, which pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li>dermaroller treatments gently prick the layers of skin on the scalp or around the hair line to open the pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that it will help with some pigmentation issues on one cheek, as well as a scar near my temple from a childhood fall.</li>
            <li>I was far too intimidated by the needles.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product..</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my face so far about 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any experience with derma rollers before this, but I was completely intrigued by it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally very worried about trying this out, not only have I no experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li>It has also flattened old scars and makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>Noticed nothing in a month..except some sensitive spots on my cheek like a mosquito bite look..</li>
            <li>So far</li>
            <li>This raises a doubt about whether the product is genuine or just a sham.</li>
            <li>I also when I was a child I was bitten by a dog and it left scaring and since using this product it helped the scars not to become very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is working beautifully so far.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that if I keep rolling they will be gone completely.</li>
            <li>but I surprised myself with my bravery</li>
            <li>I am using it all over my face, but also targeting areas of old acne scars and sun damage (brown spots).</li>
            <li>The Petunia Skincare Derma Roller is an interesting product to say the least.</li>
            <li>Or near acne.</li>
            <li>SO SOFT AFTER.A MUST BUY FOR ALL WOMAN.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have so far seen a bit of softening on a troublesome line I have on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>but so far it meets my expectations</li>
            <li>use it at night and ask  up with a soft face.</li>
            <li>To see my complete review please go to http://tomboyangel.net/derma-roller-petunia-skincare-review/</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a painless experience</li>
            <li>so you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that the scars almost immediately improved in size, darkness, and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like the results I have seen thus far.</li>
            <li>if i&#x27;m busy.</li>
            <li>but I try to use it as frequently as I can. .</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had this about a month</li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;ve completely forgotten about it.</li>
            <li>I moisturize directly after</li>
            <li>So far I like this derma roller.</li>
            <li>After so much research about this product I finally decided to purchase one.</li>
            <li>This derma roller by Petunia Skincare is also made of the highest quality medical grade stainless steel</li>
            <li>but they are soft to roll</li>
            <li>Do NOT apply too much pressure or your face will be beat red for over a day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it looks, simply because the weight is distributed.</li>
            <li>my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>I had read in magazines and seen on TV presentations good things about but always frightening of pain stop me.</li>
            <li>The needles were really sharp and it should be interesting to see how long this particular roller will last.</li>
            <li>and I was a little hesitant to use it at first despite the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>My hope is with more needles, this Petunia model will last longer than my other one did, which was only eight uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before the 1st use it is recommended to rinse the roller in hot water and then start using and after 3-4 use it has to be deep cleaned which is a little lengthy process, where you have to use rubbing alcohol and bleach to deep clean it</li>
            <li>(it can be used on any part of the body) - and, while your skin will be slightly reddened, I&#x27;ve found it goes away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Directions for cleaning, rolling, and other tips are right on the box</li>
            <li>I love how my skin is starting to feel tight and it&#x27;s definitely looking healthier and brighter.</li>
            <li>I choose this item because the price was right after researching other products which are $200</li>
            <li>microneedling process breaks down scar tissue and stimulates blood flow to generate healthy new tissue, making scars become less noticeable over time.</li>
            <li>All of these Derma Rollers were originally created to be single use disposables for derm offices and Med spas but since it&#x27;s only us using it (these should never be shared!), they can last through a number of at home treatments.</li>
            <li>The needles aren&#x27;t as long and don&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility.</li>
            <li>I should not have waited so long, this derma roller really does fix and repair your skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>To help reduce stretch marks, cellulite, wrinkles and fine lines by simply adding a few minutes of derma roller treatment to your night time skin care regime 2-3 times a week,It stimulates collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li>you can easily irritate skin if you use excessively hard.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the Derma Roller for less than a week and already notice my pores becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li>I  think one small round spot have gotten lighter but I have to use it few more times to be sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep at it to try and stimulate collagen and will be sure to always have a back up roller for when they start to become dull.</li>
            <li>You can use this roller alone or before your other products -- I&#x27;ve found it really helps them absorb into your skin much quicker when used before, which means the products are actually getting into your skin, where they can get to work, instead of just sitting on the outer layer twiddling their thumbs!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally up for trying new things....</li>
            <li>i use it in other places like elbow and knee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable compared to other skin care companies</li>
            <li>it really works and i saw a major change in my skin after the 3rd week of use since i could only use it once a week.</li>
            <li>It is painful at first and makes my fair skin red but beauty is pain!!</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skincare routine is pretty much very same and simple each day , using same products for years.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I did have to muster a little courage in my heart as this procedure sounded unusually foreign to me; too many rave reviews bolstered my courage.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical but after having a baby 2 years ago, my skin has started to age very quickly and I was willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit hesitant to use this as I was surprised to see all the little needles but got the courage and did test it out.</li>
            <li>Seeing as our collagen production slows down dramatically as we get older this product aids in upsetting the Dermis (the lower layer of the skin) so that it produces collagen faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li>and I know that stretch marks have to do with the dermis not the epidermis at least primarily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generally used on the face</li>
            <li>I was more afraid at first and tried it on my hand</li>
            <li>The professional actually says,”If</li>
            <li>So far used only twice and skin feels like it has been awakened after decades of sleep~</li>
            <li>I used it and my skin was slightly sensitive afterwards but that feeling was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used this product for scars on my arm.  </li>
            <li>The roller is attached with tiny plastic nubs that snap into the handle and the plastic is so soft you can peel the nubs off with a fingrnail.</li>
            <li>I could go out in public without feeling quite so self conscious.</li>
            <li>think one of my old scars is getting smaller.</li>
            <li>/&gt; be gentle and careful - use on face</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far on my face.</li>
            <li>I have moderate acne scarring and this thing has completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of old scars.</li>
            <li>My face was red and felt a like it was burning after use but the next day if felt normal.</li>
            <li>My face stayed red for about an hour or two and subsided throughout the night and was completely back to normal in the morning.  </li>
            <li>is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles</li>
            <li>is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles</li>
            <li>I have always been interested in natural skin care options to avoid harsh chemical treatments</li>
            <li>I am the kind of person (weird-</li>
            <li>It very clearly helps your skin absorb product, and later the same day my skin felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money and if you are serious about your appearance, I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Petunia&#x27;s other products, they&#x27;re Hyaluronic serum with Vitamin C and their Revitalize Eye serum which is absolutely amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in cellulite or stretch marks yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using the roller too long, so I&#x27;m honestly surprised I have seen any results!</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like it is made out of high quality materials that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>the difference in person seems much more dramatic than what my camera is catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you may want to test is a small area first.</li>
            <li>After many false starts, I finally worked up the courage to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hurts a little the first time you use it</li>
            <li>since i got this i used it once, its kinda hurt at first and little bit of blood</li>
            <li>At first I had to get used to the little needly feeling</li>
            <li>At first, I was a little nervous to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little intimating at first use</li>
            <li>You barely feel the tiny needles, but you do feel the fuller skin afterward.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you walk down the aisle or anything!!  </li>
            <li>These seem very sharp and it doesn&#x27;t cause much pain at all,unlike the titanium needles.</li>
            <li>and I think this contributed to it becoming dull so quickly, leaving behind prick marks and actually injuring my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I am seeing some results as far as my pores being minimized.</li>
            <li>I decided to use it on my face for multiple deep scars and I barely needed to use any pressure at all.</li>
            <li>It was scary at first but worth it at the end</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I rolled my entire face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I mean pain and beauty are one and the same right!?  </li>
            <li>There is a high absorbent of active ingredients that helps with faster healing and healthier</li>
            <li>There is a high absorbent of active ingredients that helps with faster healing and healthier</li>
            <li>The first few rolls were a little uncomfortable, but not painful at all, and I got used to the &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; feeling fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried about how much pressure to use with the derma roller.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little during use, a few minutes later feels like a light sunburn, within an hour</li>
            <li>It is pretty painless and there is very little redness the next day.  </li>
            <li>This is not a paid sponsorship and I only wrote this review because if you&#x27;re anything like me, you are scouring the reviews good or bad.</li>
            <li>Very horrifying at first, but once you use it it&#x27;s amazing!</li>

            <li> Very nice dermaroller.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but I am hooked on derma rolling, the results after just 1 week are amazing!</li>
            <li> I have read many wonderful reviews</li>
            <li> I kind of had to talk myself into this one!</li>
            <li> Every woman should own one of these!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given this product for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly really thrilled with this, and will keep it up!</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Also, the microneedle roller is a perfect size, making it easy to roll around the contours of the face and</li>
            <li> , it felt good, no pain at all, then I rolled it on my face and neck too.  </li>
            <li> It feels good once it&#x27;s over</li>
            <li> Good Product, met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The roller feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> surprisingly, it works</li>
            <li> It is good to use if you are using hydrolonic acid or a lotion afterwards because it would absorb well</li>
            <li> In addition, 1mm is the optimum needle length to treat a variety of skin concerns.</li>
            <li> Always remember to get rollers from trusted brands, I trust Petunia because the quality of their rollers are superior to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and this seems to be a good choice if you are on the lookout for one.</li>
            <li> For my scars I apply rosehip oil after derma rolling since it is good for reducing scars.  </li>
            <li> the skin around my temples looks really good -</li>
            <li> but I did get good results with my temples again where I have acne scars</li>
            <li> My face feels really good since I started using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> This derma roller is good quality and comes in a sealed packaged.  </li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> but it feels so good in your skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon recommend some good pairings</li>
            <li> the gf loved this.</li>
            <li> Even quality of plastic storage case was of superior design and quality.</li>
            <li> Feels good on face.</li>
            <li> 540 needles rolling across the face didn&#x27;t seem very appealing.</li>
            <li> very interesting product.  </li>
            <li> was really impressed with how well my moisturizer absorbed into my skin afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to use this at night, apply the serum right before bed.</li>
            <li> its a very excellent product for fine lines &amp; wrinkles each time i use the derma roller my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>

            <li> Who would have thought someone would ever say &amp;#34;I love rolling 540 needles all over my face?&amp;#34; -- I never thought I would have, but using a Derma Roller has become a favorite addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> This thing is actually better than my Microdermabrasion machine and my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>

            <li> I have used a couple derma rollers and have to say this one by Petunia is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Your skin can get more refined and even toned if you keep using it in your routine.</li>
            <li> I received product free to review but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I used to have bumps all over my arms and legs and the Derma-Roller works like magic.  </li>
            <li> gave a 5 star rating because it works great and is very well built.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin absorbs my body butter SO much more than untreated areas.</li>
            <li> The best overall effect is my skin feels so much more firmer and plumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin but you begin to notice more blood flow to that area.</li>
            <li> It will make your skin look better feel youthful and more rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> If it helps my face better absorb the moisturizer</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better</li>
            <li> more product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope the redness goes away soon, since I have to use a lot more concealer when going out now because of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review and add another star since it is rated as working for that.  </li>
            <li> love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> I assume it will just look better as the days go by</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~ Creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products more able to penetrate the skin at a deeper level than just surface application&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;~ Creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products more able to penetrate the skin at a deeper level than just surface application&lt;br</li>
            <li> finishing looks ok.</li>

            <li> Okay more about the Petunia roller....</li>

            <li> My skin just looked more plump and glowing.</li>
            <li> I guess it was okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with my derma roller.</li>
            <li> You would want to rub vertical , horizontal  and diagonally to get the most of the product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love having the Derman Roller as part of my nightly skin care roution.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to learn and review this product exchange for free.</li>

            <li> As much as I spend on face products, it&#x27;s nice to know they can actually penetrate my skin and give the the greatest benefit for my money when I apply them after using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I genuinely saw a much better absorption and results from the skin care products I had already been using.  </li>
            <li> far it has worked great</li>
            <li> Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li> never have I read so many 5 star comments in a row all by customers that receive their products free.</li>
            <li> I honestly am surprised at the great price for the product I got.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin really absorbs lotions and serums better, which seems to make them more effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> So I cannot comment about it, other than the recipient was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li> The dermal roller itself has its own hard plastic case that the roller fits perfectly in.</li>
            <li> I love this Derma Roller so easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> but I did find it easy to use</li>
            <li> but I did find it easy to use</li>
            <li> They have made this an easy and convenient way to get these treatments at home.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning, no rusting after washes.</li>
            <li> If you can pluck your eyebrows, you can easily do this.  </li>
            <li> but you can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with quality materials and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Care and cleaning seem easy.</li>
            <li> rinse the roller with water, and perhaps rinse with rubbing alcohol as well to be sure its clean.</li>
            <li> it was great!It was painless for me and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a easy  to hold handle</li>
            <li> The needles are not as strong as the ones I used before</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you use a good cream as that helps to minimize the discomfort that you get from the device.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most important positive reaction that I love the most and that is it tightens the skin and smooths it out, meaning when I was applying my make-up you could see my skin droop.</li>
            <li> Got to try this free for review, very sturdy, high quality, clean and works great!</li>
            <li> The biggest difference I&#x27;ve seen is that the skin care products I use immediately after using the derma roller are able to be absorbed much faster and much more effectively.  </li>
            <li> The following is an added aside for other brave hearts (you and you alone know your skin&#x27;s tolerance the best):  </li>
            <li> This product is meant to stimulate collagen for stretch marks, enlarged pores, acne, blackheads, wrinkles abd fine lines, crows feet, and it is also used to tighten up saggy skin.</li>
            <li> Have to say I have noticed an improvement in my skin from the first time, seems to be in better condition with more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li> It contains 540 1.0 mm needles on a roller meant to roll on your face and body to stimulate collagen production and help reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 4 weeks and noticed my pores shrinking and my fine lines disappearing.</li>
            <li> MY FINE LINED SKIN.  </li>
            <li> Then apply the serum you want to absorb more quickly because using this product will help the serum you use absorb more quickly.</li>
            <li> ideally you should apply something afterwards since your skin is open and will absorb a serum quickly.</li>
            <li> The results are already VERY evident!  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Use your own judgement if you wish to use this more frequently than described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I have HUGE pores on my face, cellulite on my legs, a ton of stretch marks, and some scars I&#x27;d like to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> I received the derma roller for free.</li>
            <li> definitely helps face serums and creams absorb better and work more effectively.</li>
            <li> The product is light, sturdy and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product if you want to improve your skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> Nothing can get rid of stretch marks, but this product does do a great job of changing there external appearance through epidermal changes.</li>
            <li> A light touch and a couple of minutes is all it takes to glide the roller on your face</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I can feel that it&#x27;s more easily absorbed.  </li>

            <li> I received a free product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> like I have seen videos just a light tickle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most exciting process</li>
            <li> While the helpful usage guides and tips are appreciated, the over-zealous show of enthusiastic emails asking for feedback are not.</li>
            <li> It still gives a redness to the skin with just a light pressure.</li>
            <li> Since using it , and applying the make-up I noticed a tightened smooth</li>

            <li> I received this for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly examined this roller before use, for any defects such as bent needles and everything looked great.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day every 2-3 days with light pressure.</li>
            <li> have received this product free for product review purposes.</li>
            <li> Great price, visible results in only 4 weeks,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this</li>
            <li> I am a wound care nurse, and I know how important the collagen is for our skin.</li>
            <li> and it still hurts like my skin has been lightly bruised.</li>
            <li> I  was given it free to review.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just super easy to use, the rolling doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can easily do this twice a week.</li>
            <li> So far so good does seem to help complexion somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it on cellulite yet, but have on my wrinkles and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> if your face is sensitive this may be a good size for you.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It does work good, my sister loves it so far</li>
            <li> I am seeing good results so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I personally really like it and believe that I will make this part of my beauty regimen maybe once a week or so nothing more as too much of a turnover may not be a good thing?</li>
            <li> Not going to lie it kind of ticks me off that my skin is that sensitive to it while majority of people seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this product has really helped diminish my stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and can definitely say I love this derma roller!!</li>
            <li> As someone that is always looking for ways to improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Petunia Skincare Derma Roller as my first derma roller I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li> I am loving the derma roller so far!!</li>
            <li> but I did notice the rosehip oil I use on my face absorbed a lot more quickly after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li> I think the benefits of stimulating collagen production, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing large pores while smoothing skin are the ones I am most wanting to see.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best companies I&#x27;ve dealt with on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve dealt with a few!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it can be used on your face or on your body because you get so many benefits in so many different locations from one product.</li>
            <li> but she was excited to get it.</li>
            <li> Not only are my stretchmarks and scars MORE visible than ever, my cellulite is now MORE visible than ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I&#x27;ve had no ill affects of using this more often than recommended.</li>
            <li> My smile lines are going away!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it because I have superficial acne scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading 16 pages of the majority of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Derma rolling is very good for anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that it does sting when using the roller, but it is very worth it!</li>
            <li> This derma roller appears to trigger new collagen and elastin production and the skin renews and my skin feels nice and tighter.</li>
            <li> find that this needle size is super comfortable</li>
            <li> my fave is smooth because I&#x27;m currently using proactiv + which surprisingly is working quite well.</li>
            <li> then rinse and clean roller.</li>
            <li> like the needles kinda exfoliated my skin while at the same time making the appearance of any scar kind of vanish plus with the produts your face has more absourbion..</li>
            <li> I am not using any special serums or anything and am using it about twice a week.</li>
            <li> product scared me a little at first but after getting it I was actually very impressed.</li>
            <li> I also do the back of my hands because I see them more and can better judge the effects - it does seem to be working to get rid of some of the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed and loved about this product was it was completely sealed in a wrap.</li>
            <li> This is the first product of this kind I have tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything.</li>
            <li> I am using it twice a week for better results and my skin is really glowing and feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li> Love the product, save so much money from seeing dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Also, it will take more time for the pokes to heal if you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> it is to soon to see full results</li>
            <li> it is to soon to see full results</li>
            <li> it actually feels good on your skin .</li>
            <li> Shes been using it daily for 2 weeks and its looking good.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> but my pores are ofcourse still full of grime if I squeeze it</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and I really love it.</li>
            <li> and I cant wait to see how much it will improve after more rolling.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and was actually kind of relaxing in a way.  </li>
            <li> After using the Derma Roller the products had a much more intense absorption.  </li>
            <li> reviews.com glad I tried this thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful just a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> and I can not judge it, but initially sounds good</li>
            <li> One other thing I would highly recommend using a serum after rolling not an oil or lotion because they say that serum penetrates the best.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to but feels good!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pretty painless.</li>
            <li> Amazing results because i notice my large pores are minize and my skin feel much smoothing</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> But after researching and talking with people who do have experience, most said if done properly you can use it more often.</li>
            <li> and you learn quickly...</li>
            <li> You also learn not to go too quickly.</li>
            <li> received this roller free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own, and are not influenced by outside sources.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.It helped with the cellulite I was experiencing, as being pregnant for 8 months</li>
            <li> I can FEEL the serums I use after this working better, it makes my face tighter after use, and I&#x27;m sure my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Since using this my skin has become more clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this roller appears to be great quality and the results seem promising.</li>
            <li> im rolling needles on my face its SUPER invigorating.</li>
            <li> This is a very intriguing and exciting skin care implement that I put to use right away.  </li>
            <li> But looks great, very small and glad it came with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Derma Rollers are also great for minimizing dark spots or age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Derma Roller, which comes in it&#x27;s own case and sealed in a bag, is also a much better construction compared to my other roller.</li>
            <li> I might need to go to larger needles for some of my issues I think, but for what it has done I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it!</li>
            <li> The roller leaves a tingling prickly feeling afterwards,its not unpleasant though.</li>
            <li> Derma rollers have many purposes to them when used correctly and rolled across the area you need it can heal cellulite, acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles among many other uses.</li>
            <li> particular Derma Roller is helping my S/O to minimize his acne scarring on his cheeks, the improvements are impressive even with just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare does a good job of giving basic instructions on the box making this easy to start using even if you&#x27;re completely new to all</li>
            <li> VERY quickly, that it does not require much pressure at all.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite skin care find ever!!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference with in the first week of using!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;m pretty excited about receiving the Petunia Skincare Derma Roller to review.</li>
            <li> but it is very squeaky!!  </li>
            <li> My first time using a derm roller, but I like it!</li>
            <li> but if u do works really well!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m seeing more results with this roller for less money than all the serumsand lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is easy to open up and be able to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it really will help with the fine lines over time.</li>
            <li> If you are not using Vitamin C serum, I recommend others to use good quality lotion right after the dermaroller because it will leave your skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> If this is something you would use everyday, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Ive used it and cant really see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> But with anything worth your time, it takes your time.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get used to the needles but its worth it.</li>
            <li> my honest opinion  and written after receiving the product sponsored by Petunia and using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Comes with complete instructions, care, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find a cream that reduces them a bit, but I&#x27;ve never had much success with them shrinking long-term.</li>
            <li> I have only used the roller twice (2 weeks apart) but it worked great and no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> So far it has helped her skin feel healthy and helped with the pores and acne areas.  </li>
            <li> So far she is happy with this but will reserve final judgement with some longer term use.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> She is not afraid of needles</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> And the moisturizer seems to be absorbed quicker and deeper.</li>
            <li> does indeed help lotion to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and helps the moisturizer  penetrate much better.</li>
            <li> If there is anything to take away from this, spending for a 540 needle model is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I tell myself it’s worth it because think of all the blood flow going to my face.</li>
            <li> I feel it definitely is worth a try I am using mine on my stretch marks</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> My main concern, like most, is that my pores are large on my cheeks</li>
            <li> After using the derma roller every other day for a week with the 1mm needles I did notice a huge difference, probably of 60% reduction, which is unheard of for me and really is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality product and I have been pleased with many of my other Petunia Skincare products as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty great little device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll actually go back through after about half an hour and add more just to make sure I&#x27;m nice and moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I highly recommend to anyone looking to clear up their skin.</li>
            <li> All right</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I moisturized right after I rolled my face.</li>
            <li> Even though I had no idea how to use it when I got it, the directions are right on the box</li>
            <li> but I use it faithfully right before I put on my retinol  serum at night.</li>
            <li> At first, there is pain in more sensitive ares like the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I was afraid the first time, but the roller dont damage the skin, is very easy use in the face, I like so much ....</li>
            <li> but certainly was not painful.  </li>
            <li> and I was super excited to try something new..</li>
            <li> in all I think the Petunia 1.0 mm 540 needle derma roller is a fantastic high quality item and would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles, and lesson acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The directions were pretty easy to follow, I didn&#x27;t apply any pressure, just normal pressure when rolling (I did about 10 rolls in each direction).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that all women be super careful in the handling, washing and storing of their derma roller (no need to infect your own face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m focusing more on my acne scars and yet to see better results but my hyperpigmentation around my chin and upper lip area has completely vanished.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product , I think however this product should be used with some kind of serum, moisturizer for better penetration of the nutrients deep into the skin</li>
            <li> When applying make sure you use a steady pace with normal pressure.</li>
            <li> Derma rollers are said to make your skin firmer, help smooth facial scars, stimulate collagen and elastin production, help with scar removal and fading stretch marks, stimulate hair growth as while as diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> While these are some of the many benefits of using a derma roller there are many other benefits as well!!</li>
            <li> I think the stainless steel needles really do make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen those videos showing how derma roller really can work on the face and after I&#x27;ve tested on my leg, I have the confident to use it on my face now.</li>
            <li> -WOW it did hurt and my skin turned bright red -</li>
            <li> As, everything I do I read the instructions and made sure my face was clean and dry before using this product.</li>
            <li> I do recommend you go at your own pace and only do as much as you feel your skin can handle, you can always increase and make adjustments as you go along.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this 1 day but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Been using it regularly and am beginning to see a difference in my fine lines and deeper wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li> and the pain wasn&#x27;t very intense</li>
            <li> This is a very unusual device in the area of skincare.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind a little ouch to look good.</li>
            <li> This Derma Roller is now both my absolute favorite go-to micro-needling device and a major step up from what I was using before.</li>
            <li> Quality is actually a little better than I expected, the plastic handle has a nice weight to it and the carrying case is sturdy and one I&#x27;ll actually use since having a wheel of needles just laying around doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li> The derma roller is also pretty well made, and the handle is sturdy.</li>
            <li> but I am willing to keep on trying.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this product being used on YouTube by woman who stated she works for a certified Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> But be gentle with the product just gently hold it and maneauver with thumb and index finger and thumb to lightly glide the product over the surface of your desired area but be gentle with it</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I remembered when I first used the derma roller, after watching so many youtube videos, I could only test on one my scar on the leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll surely come back to share my visible results.</li>
            <li> since i am using the same moisturizer for years i saw a tad bit of a glow and more hydration after using derma roller.</li>
            <li> The idea of rolling over 500 needles across the skin on my face was pretty daunting to me.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about using this at first</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it was something I have to get used to.  </li>
            <li> So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days.</li>
            <li> and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li> Saw results the first time i used this roller</li>
            <li> A couple days a week is all you need to use this derma roller, and make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it/sterilizing it properly after each use.</li>
            <li> We make sure to pour 90% rubbing alcohol over ours to kill any potential nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a derma roller</li>
            <li> It never shows scratches on my face (only mostly the fattest thinnest part of my body makes the scratches.</li>
            <li> give it a try and see what you think - not expensive to try either.  </li>
            <li> But hey, I&#x27;m willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched a video on YouTube on derma rolling first.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt funny at first</li>
            <li> well microneedles to be exact</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first dermaroller</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much Petunia Skincare!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I used it really lightly on forehead and side of face where my skin is mostly clear.</li>
            <li> so I tested it on a scar on my leg first.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  </li>
            <li> My skin results are joyous and wow!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different options and uses for this Derma Roller by Petunia</li>
            <li> I found that doing it at night is so much better, because your face will become red.</li>
            <li> My face is far from smooth.</li>
            <li> and it seems to do exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li> but i am willing to be patience and continue using it.</li>
            <li> My skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li> I got a compliment on my skin the first day I used.</li>
            <li> and I can see a real difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I was most concerned about, like the hyperpigmented and acne-scar areas, and worked my way around my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Derma Roller for a few weeks and am delighted with the way my skins feels.</li>
            <li> Wow, that tingles!!!!</li>
            <li> My face is bright and tight now!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it isn&#x27;t as noticeable, but when I am outside or my skin gets hot, the damage shows up more readily.</li>
            <li> There is no need to press hard, lightly rolling it across your skin is quite effective.</li>
            <li> it is really feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I really have not seen much difference to my fine lines or dark spots with the Derma Roller itself, I find that it does help the Vitamin C serum attack discoloration better than it does on</li>
            <li> Hopefully with proper use, time, and incorporating of the Vita C serum, along with my collagen mask and cream regimen I will be able to see some real results.</li>
            <li> I did not like it on the scalp though because my hair is super long and thin so it was pulling it out to much,so i stopped that,but I wish I could have kept it up though because id love some more healthy growth to come out of my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first time I used the derma roller (pain level was very mild and didn&#x27;t bother me), I could see results the following morning.</li>
            <li> They are known to cause some pain, but the feedback about its benefits has been positive- be it</li>
            <li> They are known to cause some pain, but the feedback about its benefits has been positive- be it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was a bit nervous, but it really works well.</li>
            <li> I have no doubts that I will see more results using this dermal roller long term.</li>
            <li> I also read online that you can use it on stomachs, arms and pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li> I have bumpy skin and when I used it regularly, my skin started becoming even, smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very intimidated when I first got it</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty much just  going to test it in one area again another day and see if anything happens.  </li>
            <li> Now my skin is acne free I still do have some light scar, I have used many strength and different type peels to get rid of the old scar but they&#x27;re not completely gone.</li>
            <li> I use it on my trouble areas (cheekbones and nose, mostly) and my skin is already looking much more clear after just a week of use.  </li>
            <li> This does work and I&#x27;m having good results, but get lazy and don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can see that some of my more recent acne scars are improving, while the older scars haven&#x27;t really changed much, but those may take more time anyways.</li>
            <li> the idea sounds really cool but after using it for a week, the only difference I saw in my skin was I broke out so much!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to see the long term results on this.</li>
            <li> In natural light and most other lighting it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have seen these around and have heard about them a lot, but honestly I was slightly intimidated by how they work.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and it only takes a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> I looked into it and it is basically collagen induction therapy, it has been around for ~15 years and seems like it can be safe as long as you keep the needles and the skin reasonably sterile.</li>
            <li> They are always looking for products like this and since its easy and works why not?I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ,also my skin is super sensitive so that could be why,too.</li>
            <li> Not that I have issues with my skin sagging because I don&#x27;t, but I am a preventative type of person when it comes to certain aspects of my life and skincare is one of them.  </li>
            <li> She doesn’t have cellulite but uses for areas that has problem acne and large pores.  </li>
            <li> but it can help with increased large pores.</li>
            <li> I have extremely large pores and using this product has improved that.</li>
            <li> This is something that is supposed to help with scarring, wrinkles, elasticity, large pores, and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> new face!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other experience to compare with, but I think Petunia Skincare&#x27;s packaging is really suitable for a dermal roller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, this tool is used to treat acne scars, deep scars and stretch marks, sagging skin, wrinkles and fine lines, cellulite, large pores, hyperpigmentation and lax skin and elasticity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller!</li>
            <li> Even though I was not able to use the product exactly as instructed I was still able to get results!  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a very high quality and construction.</li>
            <li> The change isn&#x27;t huge yet (in the sense that they&#x27;re still there), but there is a very noticeable, positive difference after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> A little instruction/cleaning enclosure would&#x27;ve been nice instead.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever used a derma roller previously; honestly they frightened me a little bit.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants softer clearer skin!</li>
            <li> However, they did not hurt as much as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> I used it with amlactin lotion, and now they feel much, much softer.</li>
            <li> I feel it helps really enhance the mask.</li>
            <li> I mastered all my courage and 1st rolled the roller on my hand to check how much it hurts, to my surprise it did not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> wow, it was absorbed in seconds.</li>
            <li> My skin never absorbs anything that fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the roller and how it is working on my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is smoother and the products you put on after treatment really absorb into the skin instead of sitting just on the surface.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken pictures, so I pre-apologize for those reading this review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink too much water</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say much about the product for now.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to see the result I expected however my skin face is looking better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it hurts really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Will take a while to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> Purchasing another one very soon.</li>
            <li> Really isn&#x27;t that noticeable....</li>
            <li> So I read the directions really well</li>
            <li> So much so it garnered unsolicited comments and questions about what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use it straight on my face in case</li>
            <li> This really did help me out a lot with my sun spots and damage skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> The ones on my knees have been there a lot longer however and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change on them yet.  </li>
            <li> Really like these, helps with product getting where it should</li>
            <li> however my skin feels much softer and smoother where i have been using it.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it as much on my skin</li>
            <li> It hurts I need a cream that deadens the skin a bit to really put pressure on the roller -</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars</li>
            <li> I was really debating if i wanted to try one of these as I had never had one</li>
            <li> my skin is absorbing my creams and serums a lot</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the roller....</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> I do not apply that much pressure to it.</li>
            <li> I really haven’t noticed it</li>
            <li> I use this primarily for acne scars, but also to achieve smaller pores.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my guess is those reviewers were being too aggressive trying to get fast results.</li>
            <li> If you think about the fact that all those needles are piercing your skin, sanitation really makes sense.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this item..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, but haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> A light, even pressure is sufficient for the tiny needles to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if I really notice any benefit to my skin yet.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the derma roller, my skin has become much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my skin feel prepped and ready to absorb anything I put on it.</li>
            <li> I only applied light pressure and was amazed that I still saw results.  </li>
            <li> and i read the reviews saying products absorb into your pores much faster.</li>
            <li> Its way better than what I expected .  </li>
            <li> and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and</li>
            <li> and I am ready to try.</li>
            <li> I could really feel them working much faster.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it hurt that much,</li>
            <li> i did feel like my skin was tighter and much smoother and softer</li>
            <li> I really like how substantial the the handle is as well.</li>
            <li> I just use it lightly and my face turns beat red.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t see so much of a difference</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and product arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and have been seeing real results.</li>
            <li> really helped with preparing for this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely painless (it was for me).</li>
            <li> #34;sinks in&amp;#34; and my make up glides on much smoother.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied a hyaluronic acid serum immidoately after rolling, then a very hydrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After about a month more of use I expect to almost be clear of them totally.  </li>
            <li> The most sensitive area was definitely my forehead and nose.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy for such a smaller roller.</li>
            <li> Rolling gently does not cause any pain; just make sure you avoid sensitive areas such as around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It;s a 1.00mm needles which is the common good size in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> The surface of the back of my hands looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;The spot on the back of my right leg is a mystery.</li>
            <li> It fades away pretty quickly and I then apply my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> on my first trial, i used a new lotion sample, and broke out it a rash.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dare to use it again because the scar I have is right near my heart.</li>
            <li> after the very first use followed by my regular skin regimen, I saw very noticeable results!</li>
            <li> This model&#x27;s sharp needles do not leave any visible prick marks and feels much more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> overall i am pretty much liking this derma roller, got it as a review purposes but will be using this product in future and will be putting an updated review as i used it more.</li>
            <li> My only real caution would be to keep the derma roller and your skin while using meticulously clean.</li>
            <li> I have seen these mentioned in several magazines, and by beauty bloggers, and was excited to try one.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers it seems to help my night creams penetrate better; have noticed some firming of skin.</li>
            <li> This can be used on other parts of the body, but I&#x27;m sticking to my face, where I feel it will have the most benefit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.It reduced minor wrinkles and fine lines</li>
            <li> received the Premium Derma Roller – 1.0 mm 540 Needles High Quality Surgical Stainless Steel Microneedle Roller for Face and Body.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. seems high quality for the reduced price...</li>
            <li> The first two pictures are me AFTER rolling for two weeks, and the last photo is me right BEFORE rolling (none of these pictures are filtered/edited).</li>
            <li> I have had professional needing done (200-250 a pop) and they use a numbing agent first because they would use needles that would go deeper to have the impact you would need.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the derma roller is a cool invention</li>
            <li> So far the results have been promising!</li>
            <li> Test first to see how vigorous you need to be with your own skin - I had a little peeling without doing too much and definitely like the results!</li>
            <li> Since I am new to dermal rollers, I&#x27;m so grateful that Petunia Skincare has so much information on their packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a slight pinch</li>
            <li> Well after using this roller one night the results were better than all of my treatments with my previous roller combined.</li>
            <li> My skin is pink after using it, but can easily be covered by makeup if I use it in the morning, and redness is gone by morning if I use it at night.</li>
            <li> This product is an add benefit and improves the 3 main collagen which are Plumping, Firming, and Elasticity.</li>
            <li> scar, while not puffy is really red at times, especially when I get out of the shower I wish my camera could capture it better, but picture one is pre treatment, picture two is immediately after</li>
            <li> and it said to roll over the affected area with steady pressure in all 4 directions for 10 times.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try to keep themselves looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and hope the results over the next couple of months are worth it.  </li>
            <li> The main reason for knocking off a star was the incessant emails from the seller.</li>
            <li> I got fraxel laser treatments several years ago and they helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Scary but very cool..works great..</li>
            <li> and I thought it was good,but the needles are super tiny</li>
            <li> The needles are super tiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it mainly to remove acne scars, so</li>
            <li> The needles are quality and if properly cared for, should last many uses.</li>
            <li> However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  </li>
            <li> In order to concentrate healing in a particular area is highly intriguing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Serums, especially Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic acid and a very rich moisturizer are key.</li>
            <li> Excited to see what the results of long time usage will be.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even the needles look high quality.</li>
            <li> This product has titanium needles 600 1.0 mm a high quality medical-grade titanium micro needles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product .body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the derma roller yet, but I will give it a high rating until I have reason not to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to those wanting to make added skin care improvements.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using a vitamin C serum after use.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time but if you are consistent, you can see fine lines gradually fade.</li>
            <li> the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband.</li>
            <li> At first I applied with light pressure because it does hurt a little.</li>
            <li> The whole roller has a sterile, professional look and feel to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The derma roller really helps clear that up.</li>
            <li> but I tried it and just got done with the 4th week, and wow I seen a real difference in my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Ouch not again need a real professional for this one</li>
            <li> It looks scary but it feels great to your face</li>
            <li> The thought of running tiny needles over my skin was both intriguing and nerve wracking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing worth noting is this 1.0mm length gave surprisingly better results than my much more painful 1.5mm roller.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is a (probably more expensive) properly produced version of this which might be effective, but this is not it.</li>
            <li> First off, i bought this product for stretch marks on my abdomen, so I can&#x27;t really speak to anything acne related or for my face.</li>
            <li> but maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it more than a few times.</li>
            <li> This helps with common problems, you can use it in the privacy of your own home and it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;~ Superficial acne scarring</li>
            <li> This helps with common problems, you can use it in the privacy of your own home and it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> It made it easier for the serum that I was using, to absorb, and my face looked fresh as soon as the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband usually sees me go through so many skin care products that he really doesn&#x27;t notice if my face looks different/better/worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;- helps open up pores for serums and moisturizers to get absorbed</li>
            <li> Will update after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this product since I don&#x27;t know if this is a normal occurrence or not.</li>
            <li> However, the redness did not last too long, so just use it at night on a weekend like it suggests and no one will know :)</li>
            <li> No complaint at all.</li>
            <li> I’m going to try a few more times and see if my skin thickens up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a good price, exfoliation is the name of the game these days, and this one fills the bill.</li>
            <li> After the dermaroller, my skin is slightly red and dry but it does make my skin absorb vitamin C serum better.</li>
            <li> It did help my acne scars on my face,i didn’t use it on my knee where I have a big scar because the skin there is super sensitive and</li>
            <li> Dark marks are fading very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My better half was excited to try this for improving her skin and although I personally would be nervous about trying what looks like a medieval torture device, she was eager to try it.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that my face is a lot smoother, and pores are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> I do feel some tightness in are of overlapping and very light pink skin next day</li>
            <li> I was a little bit scared to use this when I first got it, but Petunia&#x27;s customer service walked me right through it!  </li>
            <li> I think the 540 needles made a large difference in not only the results but how much pain there</li>
            <li> I have only used this tool once so far, so I cannot give a full review, but I wanted to let you know how I am liking it so far.  </li>
            <li> :) So far it does seem to have made my skin appear a little tighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% up for trying new things, so when this product popped up on my Tomoson I had to go for it.</li>
            <li> I wake up with new skin.</li>
            <li> Obviously you are not going to want to apply too much pressure as you roll across your face because OUCH, that would really hurt.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the fantastic results in such a short time.</li>
            <li> do not have really any major skin issues on my face</li>
            <li> As far as results, I noticed that my skin absorbed serums better (less left on the surface of my skin) and generally felt softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sensitive oily skin and highly prone to hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> would also like to add that this is a very professional company.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed off my Indian Healing Clay mask, gently patted dry, then applied Dr. Song&#x27;s facial serum which contains 20% vitamin C+E with Hyaluronic Acid, then followed by a lovely moisturizer from my local health food store, 98% organic Shea Butter infused with Coconut &amp; Papaya.  </li>
            <li> significantly reduces cellulite, wrinkles and other skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> I think it works, but would have to be worked into a consistent skin regimen, and it just doesn&#x27;t work into my current routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first one of this length and at first glance I was extremely intimidated</li>
            <li> but I started first using it on my thighs for stretch marks and cellulite, then worked my way up to using it on my back for my acne scars!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that in this short of time I can see a difference, but I am willing to keep using the derma roller until I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out.</li>
            <li> My skin results are joyous and wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> so this is my experience so far!</li>
            <li> Makes face red at first...</li>
            <li> If you have deep under the skin acne or post acne marks, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to use a vitamin C serum directly afterwards!</li>
            <li> Wild looking tool!</li>
            <li> Using a dull roller can cause more harm than good, I still have prick marks from when my last one went dull and needed to be retired.</li>
            <li> , otherwise you can always rinse with hot water before use and deep clean once or every other month.  </li>
            <li> 0.5 mm is recommended for light acne scars, mild chicken pox scars, thinning hair and mild anti-aging treatment.</li>
            <li> perhaps only 3x weekly and stay away from sensitive under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;I tested on my forearms first, to get used to using it and see how it felt.</li>
            <li> At first its a little uncomfortable with the needles but the more i did it the more relaxed</li>
            <li> For the greater part of last year I had been doing micro-needling (Derma Rolling) treatments at home with a 1.5mm roller that had considerably less needles than this one.</li>
            <li> I think that was due more to the strange angles of trying to roll over the side of my nose than anything else.</li>
            <li> I have large pores around my nose and they seem to be smaller.</li>
            <li> You don’t want to go to deep into the skin as you can irritate it more or even make you bleed a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and honestly tried really hard to make this work – in any way, for any result.</li>
            <li> This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li> It comes with a clear case that the Derma Roller snaps into.</li>
            <li> i bought this in hopes i could use it to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> So far I have not used the roller.</li>
            <li> Apart from using it on my face I am also currently using the derma roller on the stretch marks, which I got during pregnancy; I really hope they will eventually fade out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working really well and definitely has helped my skin appearance a lot</li>
            <li> Got this in two days, which pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li> dermaroller treatments gently prick the layers of skin on the scalp or around the hair line to open the pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that it will help with some pigmentation issues on one cheek, as well as a scar near my temple from a childhood fall.</li>
            <li> I was far too intimidated by the needles.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product..</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face so far about 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any experience with derma rollers before this, but I was completely intrigued by it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally very worried about trying this out, not only have I no experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li> It has also flattened old scars and makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Noticed nothing in a month..except some sensitive spots on my cheek like a mosquito bite look..</li>
            <li> So far</li>
            <li> This raises a doubt about whether the product is genuine or just a sham.</li>
            <li> I also when I was a child I was bitten by a dog and it left scaring and since using this product it helped the scars not to become very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is working beautifully so far.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that if I keep rolling they will be gone completely.</li>
            <li> but I surprised myself with my bravery</li>
            <li> I am using it all over my face, but also targeting areas of old acne scars and sun damage (brown spots).</li>
            <li> The Petunia Skincare Derma Roller is an interesting product to say the least.</li>
            <li> Or near acne.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT AFTER.A MUST BUY FOR ALL WOMAN.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have so far seen a bit of softening on a troublesome line I have on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> but so far it meets my expectations</li>
            <li> use it at night and ask  up with a soft face.</li>
            <li> To see my complete review please go to http://tomboyangel.net/derma-roller-petunia-skincare-review/</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a painless experience</li>
            <li> so you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that the scars almost immediately improved in size, darkness, and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like the results I have seen thus far.</li>
            <li> if i&#x27;m busy.</li>
            <li> but I try to use it as frequently as I can. .</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had this about a month</li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;ve completely forgotten about it.</li>
            <li> I moisturize directly after</li>
            <li> So far I like this derma roller.</li>
            <li> After so much research about this product I finally decided to purchase one.</li>
            <li> This derma roller by Petunia Skincare is also made of the highest quality medical grade stainless steel</li>
            <li> but they are soft to roll</li>
            <li> Do NOT apply too much pressure or your face will be beat red for over a day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it looks, simply because the weight is distributed.</li>
            <li> my face is so soft.</li>
            <li> I had read in magazines and seen on TV presentations good things about but always frightening of pain stop me.</li>
            <li> The needles were really sharp and it should be interesting to see how long this particular roller will last.</li>
            <li> and I was a little hesitant to use it at first despite the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hope is with more needles, this Petunia model will last longer than my other one did, which was only eight uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before the 1st use it is recommended to rinse the roller in hot water and then start using and after 3-4 use it has to be deep cleaned which is a little lengthy process, where you have to use rubbing alcohol and bleach to deep clean it</li>
            <li> (it can be used on any part of the body) - and, while your skin will be slightly reddened, I&#x27;ve found it goes away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Directions for cleaning, rolling, and other tips are right on the box</li>
            <li> I love how my skin is starting to feel tight and it&#x27;s definitely looking healthier and brighter.</li>
            <li> I choose this item because the price was right after researching other products which are $200</li>
            <li> microneedling process breaks down scar tissue and stimulates blood flow to generate healthy new tissue, making scars become less noticeable over time.</li>
            <li> All of these Derma Rollers were originally created to be single use disposables for derm offices and Med spas but since it&#x27;s only us using it (these should never be shared!), they can last through a number of at home treatments.</li>
            <li> The needles aren&#x27;t as long and don&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility.</li>
            <li> I should not have waited so long, this derma roller really does fix and repair your skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> To help reduce stretch marks, cellulite, wrinkles and fine lines by simply adding a few minutes of derma roller treatment to your night time skin care regime 2-3 times a week,It stimulates collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li> you can easily irritate skin if you use excessively hard.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Derma Roller for less than a week and already notice my pores becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li> I  think one small round spot have gotten lighter but I have to use it few more times to be sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep at it to try and stimulate collagen and will be sure to always have a back up roller for when they start to become dull.</li>
            <li> You can use this roller alone or before your other products -- I&#x27;ve found it really helps them absorb into your skin much quicker when used before, which means the products are actually getting into your skin, where they can get to work, instead of just sitting on the outer layer twiddling their thumbs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally up for trying new things....</li>
            <li> i use it in other places like elbow and knee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable compared to other skin care companies</li>
            <li> it really works and i saw a major change in my skin after the 3rd week of use since i could only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> It is painful at first and makes my fair skin red but beauty is pain!!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skincare routine is pretty much very same and simple each day , using same products for years.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I did have to muster a little courage in my heart as this procedure sounded unusually foreign to me; too many rave reviews bolstered my courage.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but after having a baby 2 years ago, my skin has started to age very quickly and I was willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit hesitant to use this as I was surprised to see all the little needles but got the courage and did test it out.</li>
            <li> Seeing as our collagen production slows down dramatically as we get older this product aids in upsetting the Dermis (the lower layer of the skin) so that it produces collagen faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li> and I know that stretch marks have to do with the dermis not the epidermis at least primarily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s generally used on the face</li>
            <li> I was more afraid at first and tried it on my hand</li>
            <li> The professional actually says,”If</li>
            <li> So far used only twice and skin feels like it has been awakened after decades of sleep~</li>
            <li> I used it and my skin was slightly sensitive afterwards but that feeling was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used this product for scars on my arm.  </li>
            <li> The roller is attached with tiny plastic nubs that snap into the handle and the plastic is so soft you can peel the nubs off with a fingrnail.</li>
            <li> I could go out in public without feeling quite so self conscious.</li>
            <li> think one of my old scars is getting smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt; be gentle and careful - use on face</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far on my face.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne scarring and this thing has completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of old scars.</li>
            <li> My face was red and felt a like it was burning after use but the next day if felt normal.</li>
            <li> My face stayed red for about an hour or two and subsided throughout the night and was completely back to normal in the morning.  </li>
            <li> is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles</li>
            <li> is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles</li>
            <li> I have always been interested in natural skin care options to avoid harsh chemical treatments</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person (weird-</li>
            <li> It very clearly helps your skin absorb product, and later the same day my skin felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money and if you are serious about your appearance, I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Petunia&#x27;s other products, they&#x27;re Hyaluronic serum with Vitamin C and their Revitalize Eye serum which is absolutely amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in cellulite or stretch marks yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using the roller too long, so I&#x27;m honestly surprised I have seen any results!</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like it is made out of high quality materials that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> the difference in person seems much more dramatic than what my camera is catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you may want to test is a small area first.</li>
            <li> After many false starts, I finally worked up the courage to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts a little the first time you use it</li>
            <li> since i got this i used it once, its kinda hurt at first and little bit of blood</li>
            <li> At first I had to get used to the little needly feeling</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little nervous to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little intimating at first use</li>
            <li> You barely feel the tiny needles, but you do feel the fuller skin afterward.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you walk down the aisle or anything!!  </li>
            <li> These seem very sharp and it doesn&#x27;t cause much pain at all,unlike the titanium needles.</li>
            <li> and I think this contributed to it becoming dull so quickly, leaving behind prick marks and actually injuring my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I am seeing some results as far as my pores being minimized.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it on my face for multiple deep scars and I barely needed to use any pressure at all.</li>
            <li> It was scary at first but worth it at the end</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I rolled my entire face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I mean pain and beauty are one and the same right!?  </li>
            <li> There is a high absorbent of active ingredients that helps with faster healing and healthier</li>
            <li> There is a high absorbent of active ingredients that helps with faster healing and healthier</li>
            <li> The first few rolls were a little uncomfortable, but not painful at all, and I got used to the &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; feeling fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how much pressure to use with the derma roller.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little during use, a few minutes later feels like a light sunburn, within an hour</li>
            <li> It is pretty painless and there is very little redness the next day.  </li>
            <li> This is not a paid sponsorship and I only wrote this review because if you&#x27;re anything like me, you are scouring the reviews good or bad.</li>
            <li> Very horrifying at first, but once you use it it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> so when I didn&#x27;t see results the first few weeks, I was not surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a thumbs up or down but are looking forward to using it over the next month to see how much of an improvement can be gained on her scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ultimately I have gotten no positive results from this product and would caution anyone who wants to try dermarolling to choose a carefully produced roller to protect your skin and maybe even get some benefit.</li>
            <li> are fine and the redness usually would subside after a few hours.</li>
            <li> My skin still turned very pink but this lasts about 24 hours and my skin is on the rather sensitive side.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical honestly at first, but I did my research and have been rolling, then applying vitamin C serum on my stomach afterwards and have seen SO much improvement in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I would get the full benefits from using it less often than the recommended several times per week.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really hurt, just a little stinging during and after, and I didn&#x27;t bleed (yay!).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no magic, it just a smart invention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roller for less than a month, but I have definitely seen some results so far.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to do periodic mild glycolic acid peels at home combined with a topical retinoid and you will see immediate, dramatic lasting improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that it will help reduce some of the cellulite I have and maybe the appearance of my stretchmarks though I&#x27;m not confident it will reduce their appearance much since they&#x27;ve been there for 24 years now.</li>
            <li> There was only minor redness after the session.  </li>
            <li> I will update later once I have been using it for a month or two for long term results.</li>
            <li> I have only used this tool once, but I look forward to using it again for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was still left with minor scarring, which I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve tried this long enough to see any noticeable results just yet</li>
            <li> I keep forgetting to check how long my face is red for after</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet.</li>
            <li> It is not for someone with really sensitive skin and will leave you skin a little irritated and red.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 because I haven&#x27;t had it for very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to get a size bigger, but for now, this has seriously improved my stomach to the point where I&#x27;m not totally terrified to wear a bikini this summer!!</li>
            <li> and after that my skin starts peeling off and finally get so dry ...</li>
            <li> her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area turned pink shortly after having the roller used over it but that was about the only discomfort.</li>
            <li> after the week and a half, I noticed only subtle changes, and my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be absorbing the cellulite cream any better or worse.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that after a few uses I decided to also use on my chest which is red and splotchy and has small red spots and in general just has not been aging very well, and I feel like I&#x27;ve noticed some results there as well.</li>
            <li> This is not a new concept, but before you could only do this at your doctor.</li>
            <li> and I don’t know if my skin is just sensitive or what, but it hurts a little to use.</li>
            <li> I read and heard some bad reviews in using not this brand but just a derma roller and it kind off made me a bit worried, so</li>
            <li> at least  that is how I felt, but again I could had applied too much pressure on my neck area and chest.</li>
            <li> but I persevered because I was told you needed at least that length to see any real results.</li>
            <li> I am posting this review long before I&#x27;m qualified to review.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.</li>
            <li> And the theory of causing minor damage (Minor folks, don&#x27;t go to town, you shouldn&#x27;t bleed or anything)</li>
            <li> I actually expected it to be larger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to hear about this, but I intend on using this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using mine for stretch marks and have seen minor improvements</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try on of these.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any results, but I guess it works, judging from other&#x27;s responses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice--which is an every other week schedule for me.</li>
            <li> This comes packaged extremely well in medical grade sterile wrapping.</li>
            <li> She has been using this every other day on areas of the face and body and then applies moisturizer since this helps open the pores.  </li>
            <li> That being said, after finding the pressure that works for me, I used it every other day, and definitely noticed a difference in how my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to wait too long to write the review (in case I forgot!)</li>
            <li> Immediately after using the Derma Roller, I applied some other facial products I have been using.  </li>
            <li> I used around two times a week, and within the third use I noticed a little different in skin texture.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that it feels very strange, but it did not hurt me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think its very long.</li>
            <li> so my face is too dry</li>
            <li> My skin was a bit dry and peely the week afterwards</li>
            <li> wash your forearm and dry.</li>
            <li> I have had dry and scarred skin on my face for years...</li>
            <li> Used it 4-5 times only found it to be slightly more painful than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I just received  this product  last nite and used it last night after ive cleaned and dried my face</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare works hard to live up to all of their claims and strive to over-deliver their consumers expectations.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that the moisturizer is definitely getting down deeper into my skin with this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if its due to the roller or not, but I haven&#x27;t had any new acne since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> and she found it to be pretty painful, just an FYI for newbies to real hardcore skin care.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, I&#x27;m in the medical field</li>
            <li> and i can totally see i slight of a difference ,</li>
            <li> My previous Derma Roller only had around 192</li>
            <li> Otherwise your skin can feel very dry.</li>
            <li> She washes her face and uses this at night due to some minor redness that is causes.  </li>
            <li> I rolled about once every other day, but not for a long period of time, probably about 10-20 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> I need to give it some time to see if I notice an improvement in my skin, and also to see how long the product remains sharp.</li>
            <li> My pores look a little smaller and my skin looks tighter.</li>
            <li> I only get little redness on my forehead sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little bit of softening of a line I have on my forehead and my pores are definitely reducing in size.</li>
            <li> is a tiny little thing and it does look intimidating to put the needles against the skin</li>
            <li> I picked my knees to start with, as the skin there was very rough and dry.</li>
            <li> It sits comfortably in your palm and doesn&#x27;t feel awkward when you roll.</li>
            <li> However, it is more painful than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I had mental images of blood, puncture wounds, and pain.</li>
            <li> I never really heard of a derma roller before</li>
            <li> The pain was minimal as the microneedles passes through the skin.  </li>
            <li> Roughly once every 2-3 weeks for your body, and every 3-4 for your face.</li>
            <li> I used the serum with and without this derma roller and saw no real difference in how the serum worked.</li>
            <li> It is needles though, so it was to be expected.  </li>
            <li> and I pressed a bit harder -</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, so</li>
            <li> If not, I felt a bit of a tingling sensation after rolling the dermal roller a few times on the same spot on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully as described and especially take precaution to soak your derma roller implement in alcohol for at least 15-20 minutes prior to each use.  </li>
            <li> THERES ALSO NOT MUCH PAIN,</li>
            <li> however, be careful to use a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have any scent or additives that might cause a rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I follow the directions carefully and learned how to use it.</li>
            <li> It even has a no skid indentation to help prevent it from slipping out of your grasp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I can already see a difference.</li>
            <li> I developed a skin condition that required leaving all my regular skin regimen behind.</li>
            <li> The usually white splotches are less noticeable!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a little something there, I am just blind to what I am seeing!</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use it since it&#x27;s also suppose to help with pigmentation and acne scars and since I have Melasma and some old acne scars I am anxious too see how well it works on those!  </li>
            <li> also my skin feels like itts actually  starting  to  breathe compared to feeling irritated or clogged or just plain  </li>
            <li> I mean you can definitely feel it rolling on your face, but if you had other things done such as laser, Microderm, peels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long will it takes to get those new skin, but I&#x27;m doing it slowly, once a week.</li>
            <li> Strange... different... slowly noticing changes in scar on stomach.</li>
            <li> While this looks like a scary product, it really isn&#x27;t as long as you follow directions and use it gently.</li>
            <li> Its not completely painless, to me it felt like little stings</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have stopped using it everyday and noticed my skin returning back to its previous state.</li>
            <li> and I have used it every other day since I got it.  </li>
            <li> Professionals use needles of sizes 2.0 and 2.5mm, but that treatment is usually performed under topical anesthesia.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say that this was really scary for me.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t wait to use it (every other day) because I notice a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> It is actually smoothing out the bumps that I have had for years that are not pimples, but just a small bump that I don&#x27;t like being there but do not want to go to a dermatologist for.</li>
            <li> however that were done every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few scars on my knees since I was a kid and another on my hand for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a vitamin C serum on some days and a retinol serum on the other days just</li>
            <li> When I first noticed it, I assumed it was something silly, like an ingrown hair from shaving or a pimple type bump.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day with the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a dermaroller for quite awhile now but kept procrastinating due to some horror stories about other brands.</li>
            <li> Also using it every other day.</li>
            <li> and I will try it on other areas.  </li>
            <li> Beware this product can cause extreme heat, welts and itching to your face after use.  </li>
            <li> And like the other reviewers suggested I would recommend rolling at night and applying a serum afterwards then your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The spikes look scary at first, though.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes but I have noticed that my skin is smoother  and roster than its been in a long time .</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and wrinkles, not that optimistic it will work on wrinkles, but I am very curious about acne scars.</li>
            <li> It rolled smoothly and wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I expected even with using quite a bit of pressure due to the thickness of the scar in that area.</li>
            <li> It is also recommended to apply a active ingredient or  skin care product for a faster absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT use on active acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> It says dont use on active acne</li>
            <li> I have used 2 other derma rollers prior to this purchase that had titanium needles and they seemed dull.</li>
            <li> I used Petunia Skincare&#x27;s every other day for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers state, it does not cause any bleeding, just redness, and a slight tingling/ pinching sensation.  </li>
            <li> Genius product that lets your creams and serums work extra hard for you.</li>
            <li> Fortunately they weren&#x27;t bad when I began this treatment, so it may take longer for those with deeper scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My goal is to get ride of some dark spots</li>
            <li> I have dark age spots on my face and they are lighter than before.</li>
            <li> Neither one of us have ever used a Derma Roller before and those needles really looked scary.</li>
            <li> All you would need to do is to pick the needle size that suits your requirement and move the roller up and down on the affected area.</li>
            <li> My sister followed the directions and she went up and down and sideways like it said to do,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve gone down a lot</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any dramatic results yet</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like there&#x27;s less of a chance of germs getting all over the roller during shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After use the areas do seem slightly itchy, but of course your going to immediately moisturize, and that tends to help.</li>
            <li> It feels tighter and the lines are less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My neck skin isn&#x27;t as leathery looking and the lines between my eyebrows are reduced slightly.</li>
            <li> JUST A SLIGHT PRICK.MY FACE FEELS</li>
            <li> I noticed slight improvement with the acne scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> you will feel a slight tingling, and the skin will be slightly reddened.</li>
            <li> The sensation the dermaroller gives is a slight prickling feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> With all dermarollers, you do have a slight discomfort, but I feel like using the .5mm</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you use it, because those little pins can hurt!</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit afraid to use it, because it looked like it would hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my dark spots have been fading little by little and my face is a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> but honestly I&#x27;m really shocked of how quickly it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said that it did sting a little when applying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a little change in my skin, nothing drastic yet.</li>
            <li> So, that being said I&#x27;ve used it on my stomach for stretch marks and on my arm for a scar three times each in a little under two weeks.</li>
            <li> well and little textured nubs to prevent slips.</li>
            <li> You roll across your problem area and you feel little pricks.</li>
            <li> bleeding, little discomfort&lt;br /&gt;small</li>
            <li> I hear about people getting things like laser treatments, derm abrasion, injections and even prescription medications, all pricey and even more painful than the Derma Roller!</li>
            <li> I hear about people getting things like laser treatments, derm abrasion, injections and even prescription medications, all pricey and even more painful than the Derma Roller!</li>
            <li> This little tool can make your wrinkles and blemishes and anything else fade away.</li>
            <li> When I received it I was actually a little scared.</li>
            <li> Before using Petunia Skincare’s 1.00 mm 540 Needles Derma Roller the moisturizer I was using seemed to absorb a little into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The rolling to me felt like little bee stings.</li>
            <li> Once I got the chance to use it, I was honestly a little scared.  </li>
            <li> The roller helps to stimulate collagen and it takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> So I followed the directions and found this derma roller to be a little harsh.</li>
            <li> I worked up the nerve to try this little needle roller on my face after watching a few videos on how it is done-one I watched was like torture with the women bleeding quite a bit-</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this derma roller about 6 weeks ago, I&#x27;ve used it a few times as instructed.</li>
            <li> This should be used as part of your skin care routine, and you will see results when your skin begins to rebuild after a few months of continual use.</li>
            <li> Results can take a few weeks to appear.</li>
            <li> Results can take a few weeks to appear.</li>
            <li> There is a few minutes where my skin feels ....slightly irritated.</li>
            <li> These are her comments on the derma roller after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> This product did work for me after a few uses my skin appeared tighter and smoother, but I don&#x27;t think this is for me.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother after a few weeks of using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I have a few visible bumps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rolling for about a month but have forgotten a few times to use it.</li>
            <li> It seems to me like the skin tightened up after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I recommend anyone with uneven skin tone or scars on your face, try derma rolling.</li>
            <li> I’ve used this a few times</li>
            <li> I knew it from Germany and they are quite expensive professional treatments</li>
            <li> THE ROLLER IS HEAVY DUTY KIND.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M</li>
            <li> After my second time (in three days) is trying it my face was SERIOUSLY GLOWING!</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews was the only reason why I decided to just try it since it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> At first i was scared because of all the small little needles it wasn&#x27;t that painful</li>
            <li> My mom has psoriasis pretty badly.</li>
            <li> I found it very uncomfortable on my thigh, but not as much on my face.</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do...getting rid of dark spots slowly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive products when this will do the same job for less!</li>
            <li> It was bit painful first couple of times maybe because I was pressing it little too hard.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised because it was not as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li> This was so not worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad and the results are so worth the small discomfort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie its a little brutal not bad but</li>
            <li> I gathered up my courage to use this and was VERY RELIEVED that it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> Frequency of usage can be once or twice in a week, not more, since the skin needs some gap to heal.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.e or twice in a week, not more, since the skin needs some gap to heal.</li>
            <li> I only used the derma roller once on my nose a week or so ago and my nose is still hyper-pigmented unfortunately, and I sort of wish I would have skipped that area.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I would like rolling needles across my face.  </li>
            <li> , I was quite scared and anxious to try the derma roller.</li>
            <li> Ill report back in a few weeks when i see results!</li>
            <li> The very first time it feels weird and even a little bit painful</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if they mean like bumps that are visible or that you can feel or just acne prone skin period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad, and I&#x27;m someone who has a very sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I applied their Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid for dull skin and</li>
            <li> (of course don&#x27;t press too hard.)</li>
            <li> I did not press hard-</li>
            <li> I tried to just press as hard as I could handle</li>
            <li> My skin was so dull looking before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> But I would not rub too hard, because I could see it hurting if not used correctly.</li>
            <li> but this is just hard to swallow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m little confused about the instructions to use.  </li>
            <li> As always I spot tested to see if my sensitive skin would react badly</li>
            <li> it feels like stinging or at least with me</li>
            <li> so its producing collagen) , even when I&#x27;m delicately rolling the thing..</li>
            <li> Compared to going to see a specialist the healing time can take up to weeks to months, but while using this product healing time can be from hours to at least 2 weeks that I have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li> I have scars from puberty and slowly</li>
            <li> I mean, how can a bunch of needles help my skin?  </li>
            <li> the needles were a bit scary the first time but they aren&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> Even if I get the acne under control I was always left with dark spots(so annoying)</li>
            <li> but the thought of piercing my skin with a roller full of needles was terrifying.</li>
            <li> Apply only the required amount of pressure, since it can be quite painful if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> One video I watched with a dermatologist issued a serious warning against this.</li>
            <li> don’t get me wrong, this could scare anyone, she used it on her forehead scar and its fading slightly.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little scary concept</li>
            <li> While I have to say it&#x27;s a little weird running needles over your face</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> it just felt a little weird</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any sort of numbing and, though the sensation is a little uncomfortable, I didn&#x27;t find it to be painful (and my pain tolerance is very low!).</li>
            <li> I have bad acne during different climate change and my pores gets clogged.</li>
            <li> The only downside I noticed was that it almost feels like you have a bad sunburn on your face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit painful but BEAUTY IS PAIN.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t push too hard!  </li>
            <li> The needles seem very dull.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s NEEDLES!</li>
            <li> It is also called &amp;#34;a poor man&#x27;s laser treatment&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I immediately followed the derma roller procedure by using Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask with apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hate pain - well it hurt and was quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am not paid to give a false opinion for products or services that I review.</li>
            <li> I did not use this item due to some bad reactions from others who have used NOT this brand but just a Dema Roller.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should use it or not, 4-5 pins are bent, unable to rate it since i am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> quite scary and evil looking at first</li>
            <li> It is slightly painful, but it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to use this on my face as I tend to be afraid of needles and that this contained 540 needles at 1.oomm</li>
            <li> Finger crossed hope to see what the dramatic improvement soon.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, but it&#x27;s not too painful.</li>
            <li> Needles are dull- would not purchase again!!</li>
            <li> It hurts so badly , and causes marks on the face may be because of the needle they are dull</li>
            <li> One problem is that this dermaroller is shoddily produced and the rows of needles are visibly uneven which causes a terrible snagging and pulling on your skin.</li>
            <li> but, anyway this is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> but I ordered the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles were honest-to-God not affected.</li>
            <li> sorry this review is just to let you ladies/gents know that did not use it.</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> Sounds scary I know</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive derma rollers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after reading all the reviews I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When this came I was kinda skeptical  </li>
            <li> read all the reviews before trying and some of them are scary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it twice a week and have found that it is not that uncomfortable and does not draw blood</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this will be another item I will have to return.</li>
            <li> I promise it isnt as scary as it looks or sounds.</li>
            <li> this just seem to be all contrived.</li>
            <li> The package arrived within 2 days of ordering, but unfortunately I had to wait for my acne to subside before I could use the dermaroller, otherwise the acne would spread.  </li>
            <li> Very poor service.  </li>
            <li> I slathered my face with hyaluronic acid serum to try to cut down on the snagging (which feels really awful as well as being terrible for your skin) to little avail.</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid of needles and thinking about 540 needles on my skin gave me a shiver.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am always a skeptic so when I didn&#x27;t see results the first few weeks, I was not surprised. But with anything worth your time, it takes your time. I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but if you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it. I have scars from puberty and slowly but surely they are fading. I&#x27;ve only had this for about a month now but it was one of the best buys of this year for me. Genius product that lets your creams and serums work extra hard for you. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive products when this will do the same job for less! This is not a paid sponsorship and I only wrote this review because if you&#x27;re anything like me, you are scouring the reviews good or bad.</li>
            <li> I am posting this review long before I&#x27;m qualified to review. So far I have not used the roller. I developed a skin condition that required leaving all my regular skin regimen behind. (So maybe someday....) Here&#x27;s what I do know. I have a derm roller from another company, same specs, and I would be embarrassed to tell you what I paid for it. This is a good price, exfoliation is the name of the game these days, and this one fills the bill.</li>
            <li> I have had this product now for two weeks and I have used it every other day since I got it.  The results are already VERY evident!  Great product.  Does just what it says.  Dark marks are fading very quickly.  After about a month more of use I expect to almost be clear of them totally.  TRY IT.  WORKS!</li>
            <li> I received the derma roller for free. At first, I was a bit afraid to use it, because it looked like it would hurt a lot. However, they did not hurt as much as I thought they would. I picked my knees to start with, as the skin there was very rough and dry. I used it with amlactin lotion, and now they feel much, much softer. My knees are actually smooth again! The derma roller is also pretty well made, and the handle is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice and beginning to see results.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to call this a scam but the product I received is at best defective. Perhaps there is a (probably more expensive) properly produced version of this which might be effective, but this is not it. I&#x27;ve used it several times and honestly tried really hard to make this work – in any way, for any result. One problem is that this dermaroller is shoddily produced and the rows of needles are visibly uneven which causes a terrible snagging and pulling on your skin. One video I watched with a dermatologist issued a serious warning against this. I slathered my face with hyaluronic acid serum to try to cut down on the snagging (which feels really awful as well as being terrible for your skin) to little avail. Ultimately I have gotten no positive results from this product and would caution anyone who wants to try dermarolling to choose a carefully produced roller to protect your skin and maybe even get some benefit. I would recommend to do periodic mild glycolic acid peels at home combined with a topical retinoid and you will see immediate, dramatic lasting improvement in your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, gets your products INTO your skin better, &amp; gives a Rosetta glow</li>
            <li> I love this Derma Roller so easy to use and clean. Thank You</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I cant&#x27; tell any difference.</li>
            <li> The needles aren&#x27;t as long and don&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought. It&#x27;s more of a slight pinch I was more afraid at first and tried it on my hand and it hurt much more on my hand then on my face. I feel like this has helped a lot with my acne and the scars. I like to wash my face then use the roller before doing a clay mask. I feel it helps really enhance the mask. Definitely would buy a roller with longer needles if you can tolerate it.</li>
            <li> definitely helps face serums and creams absorb better and work more effectively.</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid of needles and thinking about 540 needles on my skin gave me a shiver. I mastered all my courage and 1st rolled the roller on my hand to check how much it hurts, to my surprise it did not hurt at all. Rater I felt a tingling feel when rolled on my hand. So I went ahead and rolled it on my forehead 1st, it felt good, no pain at all, then I rolled it on my face and neck too.  After I rolled it vertically, horizontally and diagonally (as said on the instruction on the box) I applied their Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid for dull skin and wow, it was absorbed in seconds. My skin never absorbs anything that fast. After all the TLC to my skin it is really feeling smooth and soft.  I am using it twice a week for better results and my skin is really glowing and feels smoother than before. Apart from using it on my face I am also currently using the derma roller on the stretch marks, which I got during pregnancy; I really hope they will eventually fade out. It may take months for all the stretch marks to fade but I am willing to keep on trying.  Before the 1st use it is recommended to rinse the roller in hot water and then start using and after 3-4 use it has to be deep cleaned which is a little lengthy process, where you have to use rubbing alcohol and bleach to deep clean it, otherwise you can always rinse with hot water before use and deep clean once or every other month.  My recommendation is for the price of $18.77 I would keep on buying it again and again and also give it as a gift to friends and family and I know everyone would appreciate this.    I received the product for free for testing and reviewing, the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Strange... different... slowly noticing changes in scar on stomach. Those are the words my test daughter used when asked how this was working for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that it did sting a little when applying but nothing overly painful and she has sat for tattoos so the needle idea doesn&#x27;t bother her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area turned pink shortly after having the roller used over it but that was about the only discomfort. Lotion applied to the area settled the redness down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a thumbs up or down but are looking forward to using it over the next month to see how much of an improvement can be gained on her scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Thinking of buying for my daughters for stocking stuffers. Went out to grocery store with out any make up &amp; ran into some girls I know. When I said I was embarresed to be out with no make up they were amazed. I feel my skin looks better now than it has in 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Derma Roller for a few weeks and am delighted with the way my skins feels.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product being used on YouTube by woman who stated she works for a certified Dermatologist.  She demonstrated how to use it and mentioned that the product is used to stimulate collagen.  Seeing as our collagen production slows down dramatically as we get older this product aids in upsetting the Dermis (the lower layer of the skin) so that it produces collagen faster than it normally would. I think the product is a great beauty tool.  You roll it across your skin horizontally, vertically and diagonally avoiding the eye area.  There is no need to press hard, lightly rolling it across your skin is quite effective. It is not necessary to roll until it bleeds, which I have seen on YouTube with this tool as well.  I have been using it once a week for 10 weeks now and my skin is firmer and plumper than before using this.  Not that I have issues with my skin sagging because I don&#x27;t, but I am a preventative type of person when it comes to certain aspects of my life and skincare is one of them.  I have a morning and evening skincare routine and I wear SPF daily.  This product is an add benefit and improves the 3 main collagen which are Plumping, Firming, and Elasticity.</li>
            <li> I bought this derma roller about 6 weeks ago, I&#x27;ve used it a few times as instructed. I&#x27;ve seen a little change in my skin, nothing drastic yet. It feels good once it&#x27;s over and I like the tightness my face feels. I&#x27;ll keep using it. Much better than Botox.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Have been using the dermal roller for several months now my skin seems to  brighter and tighter. I would recommend this product to anyone regardless of age.</li>
            <li> The needles are not as strong as the ones I used before but still works well and I wish the roller came in wider diameter.</li>
            <li> Good Product, met my expectations. Takes a bit to get used to the needles but its worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes but I have noticed that my skin is smoother  and roster than its been in a long time . I definitely will continue using  it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, just awesome</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is great. The product is light, sturdy and ergonomic. I&#x27;ve sensitive oily skin and highly prone to hyperpigmentation. My reason to order this item was to use it in tandem with Vitamin C serum and get rid of acne scars and darker areas around my skin. It was bit painful first couple of times maybe because I was pressing it little too hard. After the dermaroller, my skin is slightly red and dry but it does make my skin absorb vitamin C serum better. I am using this twice a week and I&#x27;m seeing great results so far. I&#x27;m focusing more on my acne scars and yet to see better results but my hyperpigmentation around my chin and upper lip area has completely vanished. If you are not using Vitamin C serum, I recommend others to use good quality lotion right after the dermaroller because it will leave your skin dry and flaky. Overall it is a great product if you want to improve your skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I really like the roller and how it is working on my skin. The first time I used it I was a bit nervous, but it really works well. I feel my skin is smoother and the products you put on after treatment really absorb into the skin instead of sitting just on the surface. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants softer clearer skin!</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken pictures, so I pre-apologize for those reading this review. First off, i bought this product for stretch marks on my abdomen, so I can&#x27;t really speak to anything acne related or for my face. I was pretty skeptical, I&#x27;m in the medical field and I know that stretch marks have to do with the dermis not the epidermis at least primarily. Reading other reviews was the only reason why I decided to just try it since it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. I have to admit this product has really helped diminish my stretch marks!!! The only way I can attribute the change is by using this product, must cause epidermal changes over the dermis thereby diminishing the outside appearance of them. I&#x27;ve been using the roller 5x a week and then put lotion on afterward. I&#x27;ve been using the roller for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed about a 20-25% reduction. May not sound like much but honestly I&#x27;m really shocked of how quickly it&#x27;s helping. In conclusion, I&#x27;ll say I think this product is legit! Nothing can get rid of stretch marks, but this product does do a great job of changing there external appearance through epidermal changes.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again for myself and my daughter! I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> received quickly; product as advertised; rolling was fairly painless...results promised are to be seen after a while. Will update after several uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using the derma roller for about two weeks. I have read many wonderful reviews and I decided to give it a try. This company is * Awesome  they come out with the finest products. This derma roller for the face is cute &amp; slender. But be gentle with the product just gently hold it and maneauver with thumb and index finger and thumb to lightly glide the product over the surface of your desired area but be gentle with it you can easily irritate skin if you use excessively hard. My face looks great and my hands but my chest and neck broke out in a rash. I dont quite get it but, anyway this is not for the faint of heart.  Use it accordingly,  it feels like stinging or at least with me it felt like if you ever experienced a light sunburn well at least  that is how I felt, but again I could had applied too much pressure on my neck area and chest. I still have my derma toller and I use more on my face and hands to tighten and renew the skin to get tighter, firmer skin. This is not a toy and should be handled with care and folliw up with proper cleaning with alcohol. This product is meant to stimulate collagen for stretch marks, enlarged pores, acne, blackheads, wrinkles abd fine lines, crows feet, and it is also used to tighten up saggy skin. I would definitely recommend this product , I think however this product should be used with some kind of serum, moisturizer for better penetration of the nutrients deep into the skin so you can see excellent results.</li>
            <li> Works well as intended. I use this about twice a week. It is slightly painful, but it&#x27;s sharp! what do you expect?. After about 2 days my skin will show signs of dryness but subsides rapidly. For people who are looking for a one time miracle roller with amazing results immediately, this is not it. This should be used as part of your skin care routine, and you will see results when your skin begins to rebuild after a few months of continual use.</li>
            <li> It came in perfect conditions, nice package, just as its advertised, have used it only once, 2 weeks ago since arrival but can see already some improvement in my face</li>
            <li> This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> Its as what i expect❤️</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I ordered the wrong thing. need return shipping address label</li>
            <li> It hurts a little the first time you use it but then you get used to it. It&#x27;s been working really well and definitely has helped my skin appearance a lot</li>
            <li> Who would have thought someone would ever say &amp;#34;I love rolling 540 needles all over my face?&amp;#34; -- I never thought I would have, but using a Derma Roller has become a favorite addition to my skincare regimen. You can use this roller alone or before your other products -- I&#x27;ve found it really helps them absorb into your skin much quicker when used before, which means the products are actually getting into your skin, where they can get to work, instead of just sitting on the outer layer twiddling their thumbs! ;-) I use this twice a week,  after I wash my face and use my toner - then I &#x27;roll&#x27; and follow that with the hyaluronic serum and moisturizer.  A light touch and a couple of minutes is all it takes to glide the roller on your face (it can be used on any part of the body) - and, while your skin will be slightly reddened, I&#x27;ve found it goes away fairly quickly.  Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t use it right before you walk down the aisle or anything!!  I received this in order to review &amp; provide honest feedback. Oh, this also comes sealed just like any surgical tool would be and comes with a case to store in and travel with!</li>
            <li> This is the best derma roller I have used yet. I think the stainless steel needles really do make a huge difference. I have used 2 other derma rollers prior to this purchase that had titanium needles and they seemed dull. These seem very sharp and it doesn&#x27;t cause much pain at all,unlike the titanium needles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this. I had deep lines forming on my forehead. Within a month of using it about twice a week and following up with a anti wrinkle moisturizer they are just gone! Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> For now I am leaving this product at 4 stars only because I&#x27;ve only used it twice on my age spots/rather scars from glycolic acid, on my forehead. I  think one small round spot have gotten lighter but I have to use it few more times to be sure. I took before pictures so I will post it later a month from now with after pics.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink too much water so my face is too dry becouse i am &amp;#34;pregnant&amp;#34;, even i moistening my skin by water cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can i use it in other places like elbow and knee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Got this in two days, which pleasantly surprised me. I heard about this roller thru a friend and when she told me about the needles, I was horrified. But she had very good things to say about it. I have acne scars and wrinkles, not that optimistic it will work on wrinkles, but I am very curious about acne scars. I won&#x27;t use this until the weekend, cause I read about redness so can&#x27;t say much about the product for now. But looks great, very small and glad it came with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works well, I will probably buy another for my mom and update my review.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend. Thanks</li>
            <li> Getting in love with the derma roller! In fact, this is my second derma roller but both are from different sellers. I remembered when I first used the derma roller, after watching so many youtube videos, I could only test on one my scar on the leg. And I am so happy with the result, it seems that the skin is renew and ease the scar away. So far, I have seen those videos showing how derma roller really can work on the face and after I&#x27;ve tested on my leg, I have the confident to use it on my face now. My goal is to get ride of some dark spots cause by the sun. I&#x27;m not sure how long will it takes to get those new skin, but I&#x27;m doing it slowly, once a week. I&#x27;m so glad to learn and review this product exchange for free. I&#x27;ll surely come back to share my visible results. Love the product, save so much money from seeing dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love using this! It is painful at first and makes my fair skin red but beauty is pain!! This thing is actually better than my Microdermabrasion machine and my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I have seen these mentioned in several magazines, and by beauty bloggers, and was excited to try one. I tried it on my thigh, and my face where I have some scaring from various accidents, and picking at pimples. I found it very uncomfortable on my thigh, but not as much on my face. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any results, but I guess it works, judging from other&#x27;s responses. I highly suggest you use a good cream as that helps to minimize the discomfort that you get from the device.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing. Petunia Skincare works hard to live up to all of their claims and strive to over-deliver their consumers expectations. All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility. All products are Made in the USA.  Petunia Skincare posts on their website that their products “yield results with no hype included”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller! I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Premium Derma Roller – 1.0 mm 540 Needles High Quality Surgical Stainless Steel Microneedle Roller for Face and Body. It comes with a clear case that the Derma Roller snaps into. The size of the needle can be 0.5mm, 1.0mm or 1.5mm. 0.5 mm is recommended for light acne scars, mild chicken pox scars, thinning hair and mild anti-aging treatment. The 1.0 mm needles can be used for deep acne scars, surgery scars, cellulite and stretch marks. The 1.5 mm needle is used for very deep scars and severe cases of cellulite. Professionals use needles of sizes 2.0 and 2.5mm, but that treatment is usually performed under topical anesthesia. All you would need to do is to pick the needle size that suits your requirement and move the roller up and down on the affected area. Apply only the required amount of pressure, since it can be quite painful if you press too hard. Also, it will take more time for the pokes to heal if you apply too much pressure. Frequency of usage can be once or twice in a week, not more, since the skin needs some gap to heal. They are known to cause some pain, but the feedback about its benefits has been positive- be it acne marks correction or filling up cellulite marks. Results can take a few weeks to appear. The procedure has some pre and post care guidelines. Make sure that you follow them correctly in order to achieve best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.e or twice in a week, not more, since the skin needs some gap to heal.

            <li> This is one of the best companies I&#x27;ve dealt with on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve dealt with a few! What great communication after the order, during and after along with great instructions for using the product etc. I thought it was a little scary concept but know that the skin has to be &amp;#34;stimulated&amp;#34; for the collagen to get going again. Been using it regularly and am beginning to see a difference in my fine lines and deeper wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see why all the 5 stars all it is poking your face with a needle. You can grab a brush or comb and do the same thing all over your face</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers it seems to help my night creams penetrate better; have noticed some firming of skin. Only thing that drives me nuts is that the wheel on mine is &#x27;squeaky&#x27; so it&#x27;s noisy...it&#x27;s like I need oil it or something.  I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Great! Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s super quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Pretty great little device. I cleanse my face, tone with rose water, then use the derma roller. After I use Jojoba oil and carrot seed oil as a moisturizer. After my second time (in three days) is trying it my face was SERIOUSLY GLOWING! This is going to be a permenant part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say that this was really scary for me. I&#x27;m totally up for trying new things.... but the thought of piercing my skin with a roller full of needles was terrifying.I had mental images of blood, puncture wounds, and pain. After many false starts, I finally worked up the courage to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was impressed by how easy it was to use. It didn&#x27;t really hurt, just a little stinging during and after, and I didn&#x27;t bleed (yay!). Since I am new to dermal rollers, I&#x27;m so grateful that Petunia Skincare has so much information on their packaging. Directions for cleaning, rolling, and other tips are right on the box so you don&#x27;t have to go searching for more information anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t have any other experience to compare with, but I think Petunia Skincare&#x27;s packaging is really suitable for a dermal roller.The dermal roller itself has its own hard plastic case that the roller fits perfectly in. The case comes in a sealed plastic and foil bag, and then it is boxed. It makes me feel like there&#x27;s less of a chance of germs getting all over the roller during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The roller feels good in your hand. It sits comfortably in your palm and doesn&#x27;t feel awkward when you roll. It looks and feels like it is made out of high quality materials that will last a long time. I would have liked to have a rubber grip of some sort on the handle, but it isn&#x27;t slippery so I really can&#x27;t complain. Even the needles look high quality. The whole roller has a sterile, professional look and feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using this roller for less than a month, but I have definitely seen some results so far. My pores look a little smaller and my skin looks tighter. I have also noticed that my skin really absorbs lotions and serums better, which seems to make them more effective. I have no doubts that I will see more results using this dermal roller long term. Honestly, I&#x27;m seeing more results with this roller for less money than all the serumsand lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I absolutely love that it can be used on your face or on your body because you get so many benefits in so many different locations from one product. I think that if you&#x27;re looking for more bang for your buck, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> At first I applied with light pressure because it does hurt a little. Now I can&#x27;t wait to use it (every other day) because I notice a difference in my complexion. It is actually smoothing out the bumps that I have had for years that are not pimples, but just a small bump that I don&#x27;t like being there but do not want to go to a dermatologist for. I really do love this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> surprisingly, it works</li>
            <li> It is good to use if you are using hydrolonic acid or a lotion afterwards because it would absorb well and I would recommend it for that reason. For scars, I think you would need to go to a doctor&#x27;s office to have that done. I have had professional needing done (200-250 a pop) and they use a numbing agent first because they would use needles that would go deeper to have the impact you would need.</li>
            <li> I love it....easy to use and a improvement on my face.</li>
            <li> My skincare routine is pretty much very same and simple each day , using same products for years. since i got this i used it once, its kinda hurt at first and little bit of blood comes out, i used it as described in instructions and after using i applied my serum and moisturizer and i can totally see i slight of a difference , since i am using the same moisturizer for years i saw a tad bit of a glow and more hydration after using derma roller. overall i am pretty much liking this derma roller, got it as a review purposes but will be using this product in future and will be putting an updated review as i used it more.</li>
            <li> This is one of a kind product we should all own ,it came just as described . I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this product is.I have never tried a product like this but now I have .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a derma roller for acne, scar treatment and stretch marks,it has  540 titanium 1.0 mm micro needles to promotes hair regrowth - significantly reduces cellulite, wrinkles and other skin blemishes.This is a  painless safe and effective home use micro needling roller, this is suitable for men and women to use on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microneedling process breaks down scar tissue and stimulates blood flow to generate healthy new tissue, making scars become less noticeable over time. Imagine your increased confidence and self-esteem as you look in the mirror and see your acne scars gradually fade away.To help reduce stretch marks, cellulite, wrinkles and fine lines by simply adding a few minutes of derma roller treatment to your night time skin care regime 2-3 times a week,It stimulates collagen and elastin production.

This improves the absorption of over the counter topical lotions or sprays, and stimulates hair follicle regrowth.This product has titanium needles 600 1.0 mm a high quality medical-grade titanium micro needles. Titanium has attributes most relevant in a variety of surgical applications, including micro needling. Titanium is a more precious and costly metal when compared with steel. In addition, 1mm is the optimum needle length to treat a variety of skin concerns. Also, the microneedle roller is a perfect size, making it easy to roll around the contours of the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested this product mind you it is to soon to see full results but I did find it easy to use and I do recommend using a serum for better results and ease of use of the derma roller .It is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles but it really doesn&#x27;t .Even if you are afraid of needles this won&#x27;t bother you . I highly recommend this product .body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested this product mind you it is to soon to see full results but I did find it easy to use and I do recommend using a serum for better results and ease of use of the derma roller .It is not painful , you would think it would be with all these small needles but it really doesn&#x27;t .Even if you are afraid of needles this won&#x27;t bother you . I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this thing sort of looks a bit like a torture device. The idea of rolling over 500 needles across the skin on my face was pretty daunting to me. I kind of had to talk myself into this one! I didn&#x27;t use any sort of numbing and, though the sensation is a little uncomfortable, I didn&#x27;t find it to be painful (and my pain tolerance is very low!). I don&#x27;t want to overdo it, so I&#x27;ve only used this twice--which is an every other week schedule for me. I&#x27;m hoping that it will help with some pigmentation issues on one cheek, as well as a scar near my temple from a childhood fall. This can be used on other parts of the body, but I&#x27;m sticking to my face, where I feel it will have the most benefit. Sample provided for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I never really heard of a derma roller before but I&#x27;m glad that I did.  I was hesitant about using this at first but it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  The first time I tried it, it was something I have to get used to.  The pain was minimal as the microneedles passes through the skin.  I can definitely notice the difference when I apply cream afterwards and I can feel that it&#x27;s more easily absorbed.  By purchasing this item, you also get an instructional ebook that is emailed to you on how to obtain one.  I&#x27;m glad I am able to take advantage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was received for free for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The longer you use it the more it hurts</li>
            <li> So I’m going to be honest here. When I received this package for review from Petunia Skincare I was stoked about the serums, but when I saw the derma-roller I was like, “What sorta medieval torture device is this?!”The serums worked great! As always I spot tested to see if my sensitive skin would react badly and it didn’t *phew!* So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days. My wrinkles were honest-to-God not affected. They are still there smiling at me &#x3D;) Now this derma-roller I did not attempt to use. I was far too intimidated by the needles. That said, I would go to a licensed esthetician or acupunturist and let them do it! The box has warnings about cleaning the needles thoroughly to avoid infection. Yeah, I was like, “All right… hell no I’m not using this thing.” But I was curious…here is a podcast by thebeautybrains.org discussing whether dermal rolling actually works. The question and answer begins at the 6:20 mark. The cons of derma-rolling at home start at 15:48 . The professional actually says,”If you’re not bleeding, it’s not working.” (18:18) I will let the professionals take it away and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  So I cannot comment about it, other than the recipient was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter seems crazy to me but she was excited to get it. All she wanted for christmas</li>
            <li> Saw results the first time i used this roller</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> So far used only twice and skin feels like it has been awakened after decades of sleep~</li>
            <li> Great item and service.  It does what it is suppose to do...getting rid of dark spots slowly.  As the saying goes - &amp;#34;no pain, no gain.&amp;#34;  Petunia skincare sent the roller on Sunday and I received it on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product.. I have used it  only twice so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to see the result I expected however my skin face is looking better and I think with the time I will be able to see better results.</li>
            <li> sorry this review is just to let you ladies/gents know that did not use it. I read and heard some bad reviews in using not this brand but just a derma roller and it kind off made me a bit worried, so I did not use this item due to some bad reactions from others who have used NOT this brand but just a Dema Roller. Sorry... I returned it unused.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the derma roller yet, but I will give it a high rating until I have reason not to.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Haven&#x27;t received so many compliments in regards to my youthful appearance in years!l It doesn&#x27;t hurt when rolled on faced as directed  (of course don&#x27;t press too hard.)</li>
            <li> I have seen these around and have heard about them a lot, but honestly I was slightly intimidated by how they work. They have tiny sterile needs that poke into your skin. Sounds scary I know BUT what it does is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;By rolling the needles over yours skin, it leaves microscopic puncture wounds, this in turn sends a message to your body to produce more collagen. As you are healing, more collagen is produced and it plumps out your wrinkles and fine lines. If you suffer from hyper-pigmentation. or acne scarring, it will also noticeably reduce the discoloration. This is not a new concept, but before you could only do this at your doctor. They have made this an easy and convenient way to get these treatments at home. I used it and my skin was slightly sensitive afterwards but that feeling was gone by the next day. Do this up to 3 times a week for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple derma rollers and have to say this one by Petunia is my favorite. It&#x27;s just super easy to use, the rolling doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can easily do this twice a week. Derma rolling is very good for anyone who wants to have younger looking skin. I use derma rolling for collagen production and reduction of scars. My regime consists of rolling twice a week. I suggest once a week if you&#x27;re a newbie to this, and using retinol to reduce scars or post acne marks within days. Retinol and Vitamin E can visibly reduce scars quicker. But of course rolling is just not for these things, they help get rid of wrinkles and help with anti-aging. Your skin can get more refined and even toned if you keep using it in your routine. Always remember to get rollers from trusted brands, I trust Petunia because the quality of their rollers are superior to others I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend them. This review by me is 100% my honest opinion  and written after receiving the product sponsored by Petunia and using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face so far about 1-2 times a week. I don&#x27;t think it hurts really. I only get little redness on my forehead sometimes. I think this is helping my pores and also blackheads. I really like this product and would recommend you try it. Easy to use and clean too. I received product free to review but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Will take a while to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Works as well as the expensive derma rollers. Comes with complete instructions, care, and is easy to clean. Effective on both face and body. Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice dermaroller. Easy cleaning, no rusting after washes. I keep it in the acrylic case it came with. Purchasing another one very soon.</li>
            <li> I love it...it shipped very quickly and they also included guides on how to use the derma roller, why you should stick to the schedule and also how to clean the product.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects. I am also ordering a larger one for scars and cellulite. The smaller one should be used for the face and the longer needles for the rest of the body.  Great Customer Service!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. Not only are my stretchmarks and scars MORE visible than ever, my cellulite is now MORE visible than ever!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This is an independent review. Only used it twice since I got it and one of those times was today. Have to say I have noticed an improvement in my skin from the first time, seems to be in better condition with more of a glow to it. I have large pores around my nose and they seem to be smaller. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles. My skin was a bit dry and peely the week afterwards but maybe this is normal. Will continue to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped smooth out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount if I would try it and give my opinion to how it works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did. I used to have bumps all over my arms and legs and the Derma-Roller works like magic.  They are all gone. I don&#x27;t have acne but I understand that it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 5 star rating because it works great and is very well built.</li>
            <li> I received this item free in exchange for my unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any experience with derma rollers before this, but I was completely intrigued by it&#x27;s claims. Specifically use on scars and stretch marks. And the theory of causing minor damage (Minor folks, don&#x27;t go to town, you shouldn&#x27;t bleed or anything) In order to concentrate healing in a particular area is highly intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally very worried about trying this out, not only have I no experience with this type of product. But on the instructions it advises using sparingly. Roughly once every 2-3 weeks for your body, and every 3-4 for your face. But after researching and talking with people who do have experience, most said if done properly you can use it more often. So, that being said I&#x27;ve used it on my stomach for stretch marks and on my arm for a scar three times each in a little under two weeks. Use your own judgement if you wish to use this more frequently than described in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ve had no ill affects of using this more often than recommended. After use the areas do seem slightly itchy, but of course your going to immediately moisturize, and that tends to help. Personally I&#x27;m using a shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate affects I notice that my skin absorbs my body butter SO much more than untreated areas. I&#x27;ll actually go back through after about half an hour and add more just to make sure I&#x27;m nice and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks, while visibly the difference (if any) Really isn&#x27;t that noticeable....however after the second use, my deeper marks seem to feel flatter and tighter, so this is definitely doing something, and I cant&#x27; wait to see how this has changed things in say a month or two from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scar, while not puffy is really red at times, especially when I get out of the shower I wish my camera could capture it better, but picture one is pre treatment, picture two is immediately after and then the thirdis a couple days later. the difference in person seems much more dramatic than what my camera is catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to see the long term results on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Derma Roller before I was given this one to try out. So I read the directions really well and it said to roll over the affected area with steady pressure in all 4 directions for 10 times. Then apply the serum you want to absorb more quickly because using this product will help the serum you use absorb more quickly. So I followed the directions and found this derma roller to be a little harsh. It is not for someone with really sensitive skin and will leave you skin a little irritated and red. It&#x27;s best to use this at night, apply the serum right before bed. The redness will be gone by morning. I used the serum with and without this derma roller and saw no real difference in how the serum worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I decided to take a chance with this 1.0mm Derma Roller by Petunia Skincare. For the greater part of last year I had been doing micro-needling (Derma Rolling) treatments at home with a 1.5mm roller that had considerably less needles than this one. It was incredibly painful but I persevered because I was told you needed at least that length to see any real results. Well after using this roller one night the results were better than all of my treatments with my previous roller combined. I think the 540 needles made a large difference in not only the results but how much pain there was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Derma Roller, which comes in it&#x27;s own case and sealed in a bag, is also a much better construction compared to my other roller. It&#x27;s definitely ergonomic with the thumb well and little textured nubs to prevent slips. The needles were really sharp and it should be interesting to see how long this particular roller will last. Using a dull roller can cause more harm than good, I still have prick marks from when my last one went dull and needed to be retired. With this roller, zero actual holes can be seen in the skin. My skin still turned very pink but this lasts about 24 hours and my skin is on the rather sensitive side. I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Petunia&#x27;s other products, they&#x27;re Hyaluronic serum with Vitamin C and their Revitalize Eye serum which is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I really have not seen much difference to my fine lines or dark spots with the Derma Roller itself, I find that it does help the Vitamin C serum attack discoloration better than it does on it&#x27;s own. It has also flattened old scars and makes my skin smoother. So much so it garnered unsolicited comments and questions about what I was doing. It also causes my skin to peel and regenerate faster. Serums, especially Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic acid and a very rich moisturizer are key. Otherwise your skin can feel very dry. The best overall effect is my skin feels so much more firmer and plumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep at it to try and stimulate collagen and will be sure to always have a back up roller for when they start to become dull. Petunia Skincare sent a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Derma rollers have many purposes to them when used correctly and rolled across the area you need it can heal cellulite, acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles among many other uses. This comes packaged extremely well in medical grade sterile wrapping. It is easy to open up and be able to use. You roll across your problem area and you feel little pricks. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin but you begin to notice more blood flow to that area. It will make your skin look better feel youthful and more rejuvenated. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it more than a few times. So far, I have been happy with it. I&#x27;m hoping it really will help with the fine lines over time. If it helps my face better absorb the moisturizer then it&#x27;s worth the price. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the instructions/cleaning procedures are on the box. Over time, the box will get ratty so you need to cut the information off. A little instruction/cleaning enclosure would&#x27;ve been nice instead. Not a deal breaker by any means.</li>
            <li> A couple days a week is all you need to use this derma roller, and make sure you&#x27;re cleaning it/sterilizing it properly after each use. Can you imagine the type of stuff that gets on this as you&#x27;re rolling it all over your face? We make sure to pour 90% rubbing alcohol over ours to kill any potential nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Derma Roller is helping my S/O to minimize his acne scarring on his cheeks, the improvements are impressive even with just a few weeks of use. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it goes over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were sent this in order to try out and give our opinion on.</li>
            <li> Still getting the hang of using this - but I think it is helping on my sun damage skin!!</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Prompt dilivery.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever used a derma roller previously; honestly they frightened me a little bit. I used Petunia Skincare&#x27;s every other day for about a week and a half. I used it on my thigh where I have some cellulite issues. I didn&#x27;t want to use it straight on my face in case I would experience some skin problems. I used it each night, rolling gently in multiple directions as recommended. After each session I immediately applied my cellulite cream. after the week and a half, I noticed only subtle changes, and my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be absorbing the cellulite cream any better or worse. I&#x27;m kind of on the fence with this product. I think it works, but would have to be worked into a consistent skin regimen, and it just doesn&#x27;t work into my current routine.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> Great product ! I have seen a difference with in the first week of using!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a derma roller and I have have to say this is probably one of the greatest thing ever!  I feel like I can breath through my skin. ITS SO REFRESHING AFTERWARDS!! I have bad acne during different climate change and my pores gets clogged. The derma roller really helps clear that up.</li>
            <li> This really did help me out a lot with my sun spots and damage skin. It was scary at first but worth it at the end .Warning if you got plans do not use this before or in the morning you will look like a tomato for the rest of the day. Here is my video review on the product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2wp0oWWxpy4</li>
            <li> So far so good does seem to help complexion somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have only used this tool once so far, so I cannot give a full review, but I wanted to let you know how I am liking it so far.  It is a bit painful.  I won&#x27;t lie.  It is needles though, so it was to be expected.  It is definitely tolerable.  If you can pluck your eyebrows, you can easily do this.  It was easy to use and it only takes a couple of minutes.  I have not tried it on cellulite yet, but have on my wrinkles and so far, so good.  There was only minor redness after the session.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try to keep themselves looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and hope the results over the next couple of months are worth it.  No pain, no gain right?  It comes with a nice plastic case with a troth for easy roller cleaning.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this item for 2 weeks and used it only three times.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used this product for scars on my arm.  As other reviewers state, it does not cause any bleeding, just redness, and a slight tingling/ pinching sensation.  I shower before using this at night, and disinfect it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;no bleeding, little discomfort&lt;br /&gt;small time commitment&lt;br /&gt;better skin texture&lt;br /&gt;absorb more product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;needs to be replaced every 6 months/ will get blunt&lt;br /&gt;small chance of infection</li>
            <li> Overall I think the derma roller is a cool invention and this seems to be a good choice if you are on the lookout for one. I decided to try this product because I have HUGE pores on my face, cellulite on my legs, a ton of stretch marks, and some scars I&#x27;d like to get rid of.  I&#x27;ve never found a good solution to my huge pores.  Using witch hazel as my toner keeps them somewhat manageable, and every once in a while I&#x27;ll find a cream that reduces them a bit, but I&#x27;ve never had much success with them shrinking long-term. After using the derma roller every other day for a week with the 1mm needles I did notice a huge difference, probably of 60% reduction, which is unheard of for me and really is amazing.  I only used the roller this often on my cheeks, because that is where the biggest of my pores are and I didn&#x27;t want to stress out the rest of my skin if I didn&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would.  The most sensitive area was definitely my forehead and nose.  I only used the derma roller once on my nose a week or so ago and my nose is still hyper-pigmented unfortunately, and I sort of wish I would have skipped that area.  I hope the redness goes away soon, since I have to use a lot more concealer when going out now because of it.  My cheeks however that were done every other day are fine and the redness usually would subside after a few hours. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in cellulite or stretch marks yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using the roller too long, so I&#x27;m honestly surprised I have seen any results! If I do find results after a month or so of use on my cellulite and stretch marks I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review and add another star since it is rated as working for that.  I&#x27;ve had a few scars on my knees since I was a kid and another on my hand for quite a long time.  The scarring on my hand was from a burn and actually is going away! The ones on my knees have been there a lot longer however and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change on them yet.  For my scars I apply rosehip oil after derma rolling since it is good for reducing scars.  My face I&#x27;ve been using a vitamin C serum on some days and a retinol serum on the other days just so I don&#x27;t overapply anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the derma roller is great for pore reduction.  I hope the results will last even after I stop, but I haven&#x27;t tested that out yet. I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;ve had however and the pain wasn&#x27;t very intense even though​ the needles are decently big.  I might need to go to larger needles for some of my issues I think, but for what it has done I&#x27;m very satisfied. I received a free product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It hurts so badly , and causes marks on the face may be because of the needle they are dull</li>
            <li> For a couple days after I rolled this around my skin. You can see the scratch marks looks Like my cat took all 5 nails to my skin. It never shows scratches on my face (only mostly the fattest thinnest part of my body makes the scratches. It then feels kinda Like a sunburn) So, it creates wounds (so collegen will heal the area ...so its producing collagen) , even when I&#x27;m delicately rolling the thing..then, I put my hydrolaronic acid type cream to my face &amp; its supposed to work. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a Month &amp; the 1st time it looked like I could see all the tiny holes in my face which I didn&#x27;t like cause it looks like big pores. I rolled it on stretch marks. Noticed nothing in a month..except some sensitive spots on my cheek like a mosquito bite look..used it 3 times as suggested, used face creams after ..not much different. So far</li>
            <li> Really like these, helps with product getting where it should</li>
            <li> Great customer service, arrived as posted... This product has changed my skin and is a great value at this price! Very happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> I have only used the roller twice (2 weeks apart) but it worked great and no complaints so far.  Excited to see what the results of long time usage will be.</li>
            <li> I received this derma roller 3 days ago and began using it immediately. It seems to be a very high quality and construction. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any dramatic results yet however my skin feels much softer and smoother where i have been using it.  I can also see that my scars starts to lighten up. I will update later once I have been using it for a month or two for long term results.</li>
            <li> I have used it along with rosehip oil, i do notice some changes but not radical after 3 times! I don&#x27;t know if it is me but I don&#x27;t feel it as much on my skin like I have seen videos just a light tickle</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Doesnt even hurt!!!</li>
            <li> Every woman should own one of these! I should not have waited so long, this derma roller really does fix and repair your skin. Every week my skin looks, younger, smoother. People have been asking me if I had work done it works that great! I would recommend that all women be super careful in the handling, washing and storing of their derma roller (no need to infect your own face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this needle size is super comfortable if your face is sensitive this may be a good size for you.</li>
            <li> love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> I have used the derma roller 1 to 2xs a week and I can see a big difference in my skin. I have dark age spots on my face and they are lighter than before.At first I had to get used to the little needly feeling but it&#x27;s a great product and it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice and sturdy for such a smaller roller. Very reasonable compared to other skin care companies</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after reading all the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. After only three weeks I am seeing noticeable results! My smile lines are going away!</li>
            <li> The roller fell off the handle the 2nd time I used it. The roller is attached with tiny plastic nubs that snap into the handle and the plastic is so soft you can peel the nubs off with a fingrnail.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Petunia 1mm Derma Roller. I&#x27;m little confused about the instructions to use.  Instructions on the box it came in says: use it 1-3 times a week for face and 2-4 times a week for body. Instructions on your website (petuniaskincare.com) says: use it once every 3-4 weeks on face and once every 2-3 weeks for body. Instructions provided in the automated mails from Petuniaskincare I received after the purchase of the product  says: use it once every 4-6 weeks for face and once every 2-4 weeks for body.  This raises a doubt about whether the product is genuine or just a sham.</li>
            <li> I worked up the nerve to try this little needle roller on my face after watching a few videos on how it is done-one I watched was like torture with the women bleeding quite a bit- so that scared me.  But I put on my big girl pants and gave it a try.  I have sensitive skin and hate pain - well it hurt and was quite uncomfortable.  I rolled it according to instructions and just gritted my teeth -WOW it did hurt and my skin turned bright red - I did not press hard- I tried to just press as hard as I could handle and I made it.    Lots of read skin and then I finished up with a serum and moisturizer that helps sooth the skin.  This morning my skin was no longer red and the skin around my temples looks really good - I assume it will just look better as the days go by and then I will try this again next week.    I did it again and I pressed a bit harder - It hurts I need a cream that deadens the skin a bit to really put pressure on the roller - but I did get good results with my temples again where I have acne scars so I will be doing it again next week.  Once a week is how often I will try this product for now - I am happy so far with the results and expect my skin to just improve -    Beauty is pain!!! In this case it really is painful - but a chemical peels must be painful also......or the pains of aging....give it a try and see what you think - not expensive to try either.  Under 20 bucks!!!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;m pretty excited about receiving the Petunia Skincare Derma Roller to review. I was initially scared of it, I mean it&#x27;s NEEDLES! And needles poke, hurt and make HOLES! But hey, I&#x27;m willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to kid you, it is not like rubbing rose petals on your skin. The very first time it feels weird and even a little bit painful and you learn quickly... VERY quickly, that it does not require much pressure at all. You also learn not to go too quickly. You simply roll it over your skin. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to test is a small area first. At first, there is pain in more sensitive ares like the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the derma roller for several weeks, but I am already seeing and feeling differences. I have been using it on my face, arms, hands, and a spot on the back of my leg. There is a few minutes where my skin feels ....slightly irritated. It fades away pretty quickly and I then apply my regular moisturizer. My face feels really good since I started using the Derma Roller. It feels tighter and the lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;My forearms have sun damaged areas from years ago. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t as noticeable, but when I am outside or my skin gets hot, the damage shows up more readily. As I have used the Derma Roller, the damage appears to be lighter. The usually white splotches are less noticeable!  The surface of the back of my hands looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;The spot on the back of my right leg is a mystery. When I first noticed it, I assumed it was something silly, like an ingrown hair from shaving or a pimple type bump. But then it didn&#x27;t go away. And I hit it with the razor and it bled. My mom has psoriasis pretty badly. It is on the backs of her legs and her her forearms and I was afraid this was the beginning of that for me. With the short time I have been using the roller, the spot has been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the following things, Derma Roller can help:&lt;br /&gt;~ Superficial acne scarring&lt;br /&gt;~ Deep scars and stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;~ Sagging skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;~ Bumpy dimply skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continued use you&#x27;ll get:&lt;br /&gt;~ Firmer and thicker skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars&lt;br /&gt;~ Stimulate collagen and elastin production&lt;br /&gt;~ Help with scar removal and stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;~ Stimulate hair growth&lt;br /&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;~ Save money from surgical and laser treatments&lt;br /&gt;~ Can be used on any part of the skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products more able to penetrate the skin at a deeper level than just surface application&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;From the short time I have been using it, I can see and feel a difference and I will continue to use it! I hear about people getting things like laser treatments, derm abrasion, injections and even prescription medications, all pricey and even more painful than the Derma Roller! This helps with common problems, you can use it in the privacy of your own home and it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;~ Superficial acne scarring&lt;br /&gt;~ Deep scars and stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;~ Sagging skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;~ Bumpy dimply skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continued use you&#x27;ll get:&lt;br /&gt;~ Firmer and thicker skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Help smooth facial scars&lt;br /&gt;~ Stimulate collagen and elastin production&lt;br /&gt;~ Help with scar removal and stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;~ Stimulate hair growth&lt;br /&gt;~ Diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;~ Save money from surgical and laser treatments&lt;br /&gt;~ Can be used on any part of the skin&lt;br /&gt;~ Creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products more able to penetrate the skin at a deeper level than just surface application&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;From the short time I have been using it, I can see and feel a difference and I will continue to use it!

            <li> I was really debating if i wanted to try one of these as I had never had one and I&#x27;m not sure if I would like rolling needles across my face.  I washed it according to the instructions and then went to town.  I started on my face, there are instructions on how to use it as well with a diagram of how you should roll the derma roller.  I was really happy about that because I had no idea how to use one. It also comes with a nifty plastic case and you are supposed to wash it every 3-4 days after the initial washing. I received this to test and give my honest opinion and I was afraid to try it but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  I thought it would hurt really bad but it wasn&#x27;t an issue and it didn&#x27;t hurt which is great if you are a coward when it comes to needles like myself. My skin condition seems to have inproved a bit in the short time I have been using it.  I moisturized right after I rolled my face. So far so good. I actually expected it to be larger but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the size.  I also read online that you can use it on stomachs, arms and pretty much anywhere you have stretch marks to help tighten the skin.  I have only tried this on my face but I think I might use it on my stomach after having kids.</li>
            <li> My better half was excited to try this for improving her skin and although I personally would be nervous about trying what looks like a medieval torture device, she was eager to try it.  These are her comments on the derma roller after a few uses.  This derma roller is good quality and comes in a sealed packaged.  She washes her face and uses this at night due to some minor redness that is causes.  Rolling gently does not cause any pain; just make sure you avoid sensitive areas such as around the eyes.  She doesn’t have cellulite but uses for areas that has problem acne and large pores.  She has been using this every other day on areas of the face and body and then applies moisturizer since this helps open the pores.  So far it has helped her skin feel healthy and helped with the pores and acne areas.  So far she is happy with this but will reserve final judgement with some longer term use.  I will update the review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this dermaroller! It&#x27;s my first one of this length and at first glance I was extremely intimidated but I started first using it on my thighs for stretch marks and cellulite, then worked my way up to using it on my back for my acne scars! It&#x27;s not the most exciting process but I do feel like my scars are getting softer and breaking up also my skin is absorbing my creams and serums a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> This definitely takes some getting used to, and you will have to adjust your pressure until you find what works for you. That being said, after finding the pressure that works for me, I used it every other day, and definitely noticed a difference in how my skin looked.  It made it easier for the serum that I was using, to absorb, and my face looked fresh as soon as the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this roller, but may cut back to once a week, since I have already achieved my desired results, I will just use it now as maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this roller free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own, and are not influenced by outside sources.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should use it or not, 4-5 pins are bent, unable to rate it since i am unable to use it. finishing looks ok.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It takes a bit to get used to but you can see results very quickly. My skin feels fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed and loved about this product was it was completely sealed in a wrap. I purchased one prior that was open and I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder how many people touched this.&lt;br /&gt;We are talking about tiny needles that can carry just about anything. Okay more about the Petunia roller....It;s a 1.00mm needles which is the common good size in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Just to answer any questions before we proceed they do not hurt more like a tickle if anything!&lt;br /&gt;I do not have really any major skin issues on my face so I use this for cellulite on my thighs. I use this and some cream once a day. I follow as the box says and roll is all directions. I recommend anyone using this do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I do not get paid to review products or services, unless stated. All opinions about products that I review are 100% my own. I am not paid to give a false opinion for products or services that I review.</li>
            <li> 540 needles rolling across the face didn&#x27;t seem very appealing. I looked into it and it is basically collagen induction therapy, it has been around for ~15 years and seems like it can be safe as long as you keep the needles and the skin reasonably sterile. It is also called &amp;#34;a poor man&#x27;s laser treatment&amp;#34;. You barely feel the tiny needles, but you do feel the fuller skin afterward.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the roller....as compared to its brand name counterpart&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but after having a baby 2 years ago, my skin has started to age very quickly and I was willing to give it a shot. I am 34, always looked much younger but in the last couple of years have begun to look my age with tiny wrinkles popping up here and there and my skin just loosing it&#x27;s youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used the derma roller (pain level was very mild and didn&#x27;t bother me), I could see results the following morning. My skin just looked more plump and glowing. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. I have some acne scars and those keep getting lighter after every use as well. My husband usually sees me go through so many skin care products that he really doesn&#x27;t notice if my face looks different/better/worse. He noticed after I used the derma roller and said I look refreshed and glowing!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a week and am in love!!!&lt;br /&gt;All my friends will be getting this tiny mid-evil torture device for heir birthdays this year!</li>
            <li> What it does is it firms and tightens the skin by stimulating collagen and elastin production. It can help with scars and stretch marks and also stimulate hair growth. It does work good, my sister loves it so far and she enjoys it. This little tool can make your wrinkles and blemishes and anything else fade away. Tightens and strengthens your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this tool is used to treat acne scars, deep scars and stretch marks, sagging skin, wrinkles and fine lines, cellulite, large pores, hyperpigmentation and lax skin and elasticity. My sister followed the directions and she went up and down and sideways like it said to do,and she went under her eyes and around her mouth because she has frown lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing all those needles, she was afraid to try it. Neither one of us have ever used a Derma Roller before and those needles really looked scary. I was really surprised because it was not as painful as I expected. When you get used to rolling it on your face it actually feels good on your skin . She is not afraid of needles don’t get me wrong, this could scare anyone, she used it on her forehead scar and its fading slightly. Shes been using it daily for 2 weeks and its looking good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 6 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. It does show some improvement for a short while but doesn&#x27;t tend to last. I guess it was okay for the price. The main reason for knocking off a star was the incessant emails from the seller. While the helpful usage guides and tips are appreciated, the over-zealous show of enthusiastic emails asking for feedback are not.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with my derma roller. quite scary and evil looking at first but it feels so good in your skin. absolutely wonderful amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the derma roller for about a month now. I watched a video on YouTube on derma rolling first. The video shows that you are supposed to draw blood. I do not apply that much pressure to it. It still gives a redness to the skin with just a light pressure. I am seeing good results so far. My neck skin isn&#x27;t as leathery looking and the lines between my eyebrows are reduced slightly. So I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to review the petunia skincare derma roller. I was a little skeptical to use this on my face as I tend to be afraid of needles and that this contained 540 needles at 1.oomm so I thought they were so tiny they may not hurt or I may not notice it. As, everything I do I read the instructions and made sure my face was clean and dry before using this product. Make sure you clean the affected area of the skin the most. When applying make sure you use a steady pace with normal pressure. You don’t want to go to deep into the skin as you can irritate it more or even make you bleed a little. You would want to rub vertical , horizontal  and diagonally to get the most of the product. It is also recommended to apply a active ingredient or  skin care product for a faster absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some advantages I am going to tell you about which I noticed worked for me, it may not for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.It reduced minor wrinkles and fine lines I have been experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.It helped with the cellulite I was experiencing, as being pregnant for 8 months I noticed that I could tell the beginning signs of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 I also when I was a child I was bitten by a dog and it left scaring and since using this product it helped the scars not to become very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I really haven’t noticed it but it can help with increased large pores. But, if you have them I recommend trying out this product to see if it will help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. This is the most important positive reaction that I love the most and that is it tightens the skin and smooths it out, meaning when I was applying my make-up you could see my skin droop. Since using it , and applying the make-up I noticed a tightened smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here are some advantages, I have experienced some , some may have not but here they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You have the visible and improvements which I have noticed since using the product for 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This is cheaper then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Compared to going to see a specialist the healing time can take up to weeks to months, but while using this product healing time can be from hours to at least 2 weeks that I have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  As, going to a specialist you can have a increase of them damaging the skin. This product leaves no permanent damage as the needles are so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. There is a high absorbent of active ingredients that helps with faster healing and healthier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved the product , it is very worth the price, as I got this free for doing this review.cheaper then having to go to a dermatologist  which can cost a pretty penny when your on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.

            <li> I have only used this tool once, but I look forward to using it again for a long time. I use this primarily for acne scars, but also to achieve smaller pores. I got fraxel laser treatments several years ago and they helped tremendously. I could go out in public without feeling quite so self conscious. However, while the discoloration was gone and they weren&#x27;t as deep, I still had some rolling scars. In natural light and most other lighting it&#x27;s not noticeable. I was still left with minor scarring, which I don&#x27;t want. I want flawless skin. This is working beautifully so far. The change isn&#x27;t huge yet (in the sense that they&#x27;re still there), but there is a very noticeable, positive difference after only two weeks. They&#x27;ve gone down a lot and I can tell that if I keep rolling they will be gone completely. Fortunately they weren&#x27;t bad when I began this treatment, so it may take longer for those with deeper scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also great for your skin&#x27;s complexion and pore size. Progressively makes pores smaller and makes your skin look great. I highly recommend this product for anyone. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to hear about this, but I intend on using this product for the rest of my life. Keeps your skin looking young and beautiful, regardless of scars.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> When this came I was kinda skeptical  but I tried it and just got done with the 4th week, and wow I seen a real difference in my acne scars. I&#x27;m not going to lie its a little brutal not bad but well worth it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product results were amazing. Recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product feels amazing on my skin.  I was fearful that it would hurt and I wouldn&#x27;t use it, but I surprised myself with my bravery and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I love how my skin is starting to feel tight and it&#x27;s definitely looking healthier and brighter. My skin was so dull looking before I started using this product. I have even been using it around my eye area to help with saggy, baggy under-eye imperfections.  This product is worth the money and if you are serious about your appearance, I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li> While this looks like a scary product, it really isn&#x27;t as long as you follow directions and use it gently. I have been using the derma roller for about a month now and have seen great results. I use it twice a week and just roll with gentle firm pressure. I did occasionally hear some popping sounds, but only saw blood around my nose. I think that was due more to the strange angles of trying to roll over the side of my nose than anything else. As far as results, I noticed that my skin absorbed serums better (less left on the surface of my skin) and generally felt softer. I am using it all over my face, but also targeting areas of old acne scars and sun damage (brown spots). I wouldn&#x27;t say that in this short of time I can see a difference, but I am willing to keep using the derma roller until I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews before trying and some of them are scary. After using this product, my guess is those reviewers were being too aggressive trying to get fast results. My only real caution would be to keep the derma roller and your skin while using meticulously clean. If you think about the fact that all those needles are piercing your skin, sanitation really makes sense. You don&#x27;t want to introduce something (bacteria, dirt, make-up) into your skin that will cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think the Petunia 1.0 mm 540 needle derma roller is a fantastic high quality item and would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this item..the idea sounds really cool but after using it for a week, the only difference I saw in my skin was I broke out so much!! I rolled about once every other day, but not for a long period of time, probably about 10-20 minutes each time. The first two pictures are me AFTER rolling for two weeks, and the last photo is me right BEFORE rolling (none of these pictures are filtered/edited).</li>
            <li> I am happy to get a derma roller ! My client was happy with the faceshow .</li>
            <li> Ouch not again need a real professional for this one</li>
            <li> I am still unsure of this product. I have been using this product for a while, but haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference. I&#x27;m sure there is a little something there, I am just blind to what I am seeing! This is a great product that I will continue to test out and see what new results I get!</li>
            <li> Must admit a lil scared applying all the needles to my face...but it&#x27;s not so bad and the results are so worth the small discomfort! I used it every other day with the Vitamin C Serum and after a week I could feel a difference in my skin, after two weeks of use I could see some changes too. I love having the Derman Roller as part of my nightly skin care roution.</li>
            <li> Got to try this free for review, very sturdy, high quality, clean and works great! saw a huge reduction in my acne scars!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product for review. As a product, this Derma Roller seems like a very good product. It&#x27;s made with quality materials and is easy to use. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I simply think a Derma Roller is not something I want to add to my regular beauty routine. I could see me doing it once every couple of weeks - but I&#x27;m not sure I would get the full benefits from using it less often than the recommended several times per week.  Even though I had no idea how to use it when I got it, the directions are right on the box and it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out. Obviously you are not going to want to apply too much pressure as you roll across your face because OUCH, that would really hurt. A light, even pressure is sufficient for the tiny needles to glide across your skin. It does not hurt if you do it correctly. In fact, I actually kind of liked how it felt rolling on my cheek areas.  I have only used this a few times, so I can&#x27;t say if I really notice any benefit to my skin yet. I think the benefits of stimulating collagen production, reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing large pores while smoothing skin are the ones I am most wanting to see. If you&#x27;re up for trying one of the latest trends in beauty, I&#x27;d say go for it! This is a quality product and I have been pleased with many of my other Petunia Skincare products as well.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty tool. It is amazing. I have been using it for a month and have seen a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> this is a quality roller.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly and seems good quality and was as described. I&#x27;m using it twice a week and have found that it is not that uncomfortable and does not draw blood (I don&#x27;t use any numbing products.) My skin is pink after using it, but can easily be covered by makeup if I use it in the morning, and redness is gone by morning if I use it at night. I need to give it some time to see if I notice an improvement in my skin, and also to see how long the product remains sharp. I may go with a 1.5 roller next.</li>
            <li> its a very excellent product for fine lines &amp; wrinkles each time i use the derma roller my skin feels and looks so much better. My face has a youthful appearance with a radiant even tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% up for trying new things, so when this product popped up on my Tomoson I had to go for it. The Petunia Skincare Derma Roller is an interesting product to say the least. It contains 540 1.0 mm needles on a roller meant to roll on your face and body to stimulate collagen production and help reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It can help reduce the appearance of scars and cellulite as well as smooth skin ( this is from the collagen). This product did work for me after a few uses my skin appeared tighter and smoother, but I don&#x27;t think this is for me. Its not completely painless, to me it felt like little stings and I&#x27;m not a fan of beauty is pain. I would recommend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind a little ouch to look good. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love my derma roller!!  I have aging skin with severe patches of dryness.  Since I started using the derma roller, my skin has become much softer and smoother.  I love the glow after the rolling. And the moisturizer seems to be absorbed quicker and deeper. I will never stop using it!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy! I even began seeing a difference, by using my derma roller &amp; applying a cream before bed. I wake up with new skin. Just be sure to follow cleaning instructions. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase</li>
            <li> Derma roller great way to help set your moisturizer and open up your pores. It looks scary but it feels great to your face it is a must try. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit hesitant to use this as I was surprised to see all the little needles but got the courage and did test it out. It felt funny at first but I got use to it and rolled my entire face with no issues. My face was red and felt a like it was burning after use but the next day if felt normal. I used it at night for this reason!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1576bff45b2d11fcbcd3107c5bed1b7b]] Many would flinch at the word needle and I would be one of those people. I am not scared of needles but 540 needles, well microneedles to be exact, I was quite scared and anxious to try the derma roller. I gathered up my courage to use this and was VERY RELIEVED that it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. If not, I felt a bit of a tingling sensation after rolling the dermal roller a few times on the same spot on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;- helps open up pores for serums and moisturizers to get absorbed&lt;br /&gt;- great to use on my cellulite too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think when I started using the Derma Roller. I was worried it would hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s actually quite invigorating. It really helps my skin feel prepped and ready to absorb anything I put on it. I feel like it absorbs my serums/lotions much better now. My skin feels smoother after a few weeks of using the Derma Roller. I&#x27;ve found myself looking forward to the days I use the Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review, but my opinion was not influenced by this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Takes a little time but if you are consistent, you can see fine lines gradually fade. Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife says her skin is 100% better after using this product, but how can you in Improve a hundred percent on a perfect 10</li>
            <li> Like the roller but it&#x27;s too soon to know if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try out courtesy of Tomoson and Petunia Skincare, and review. I&#x27;m receiving no compensation for it, just so everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first dermaroller and I really like it! I can FEEL the serums I use after this working better, it makes my face tighter after use, and I&#x27;m sure my pores are getting smaller. DO NOT use on active acne breakouts. Or near acne. It will hurt, bleed, and do all kinds of awful stuff. And possibly infect the rest of your face. Please don&#x27;t do this, people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of my old scars is getting smaller. I&#x27;m honestly really thrilled with this, and will keep it up! It&#x27;s not that bad, and I&#x27;m someone who has a very sensitive face. It&#x27;s a tiny bit painful but BEAUTY IS PAIN. It&#x27;s not too bad though, because it doesn&#x27;t deter me. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much Petunia Skincare!</li>
            <li> This is a very intriguing and exciting skin care implement that I put to use right away.  I did have to muster a little courage in my heart as this procedure sounded unusually foreign to me; too many rave reviews bolstered my courage.  Thank you to the brave pioneers!  I would highly recommend this product to those wanting to make added skin care improvements.  Follow the directions carefully as described and especially take precaution to soak your derma roller implement in alcohol for at least 15-20 minutes prior to each use.  The following is an added aside for other brave hearts (you and you alone know your skin&#x27;s tolerance the best):  I immediately followed the derma roller procedure by using Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask with apple cider vinegar.  I rinsed off my Indian Healing Clay mask, gently patted dry, then applied Dr. Song&#x27;s facial serum which contains 20% vitamin C+E with Hyaluronic Acid, then followed by a lovely moisturizer from my local health food store, 98% organic Shea Butter infused with Coconut &amp; Papaya.  My skin resulted in a soft, glowing, radiant, pink hue immediately.  The next day, I continued in faithfully applying Dr. Song&#x27;s serum and moisturizer.  I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles, and lesson acne scars.  My skin results are joyous and wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!  WHAT A GREAT BEAUTY TOOL,AND VERY AFFORDABLE. THERES ALSO NOT MUCH PAIN,JUST A SLIGHT PRICK.MY FACE FEELS SO SOFT AFTER.A MUST BUY FOR ALL WOMAN.</li>
            <li> This item DOES work, BUT you have to use it religiously for the results to last. I used this for about 4 weeks and noticed my pores shrinking and my fine lines disappearing. I have bumpy skin and when I used it regularly, my skin started becoming even, smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have stopped using it everyday and noticed my skin returning back to its previous state. For the price (and it&#x27;s Prime eligible, woo!) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great deal. If this is something you would use everyday, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely large pores and using this product has improved that. I was very intimidated when I first got it but when I started using it, I noticed an improvement on the areas of my face that I used it on. So far so good. Pretty impressive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Even though I was not able to use the product exactly as instructed I was still able to get results!  Because I have sensitive skin I was a little worried about how much pressure to use with the derma roller.  I only applied light pressure and was amazed that I still saw results.  I used the derma roller on my face and neck area.  I have so far seen a bit of softening on a troublesome line I have on my forehead.  The biggest difference I&#x27;ve seen is that the skin care products I use immediately after using the derma roller are able to be absorbed much faster and much more effectively.  I can&#x27;t wait to be able to increase the pressure being used with the derma roller as well as the frequency.</li>
            <li> I just received this today.. The needles seem very dull. And some of the needles are bent. Unfortunately this will be another item I will have to return. Would Love to have someone tell me a good brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results within a week. Thank you</li>
            <li> i bought this in hopes i could use it to clear my acne. and i read the reviews saying products absorb into your pores much faster. Well since I have acne I was nervous about using this. I used it really lightly on forehead and side of face where my skin is mostly clear. It says dont use on active acne but I&#x27;m not sure if they mean like bumps that are visible or that you can feel or just acne prone skin period. cus my fave is smooth because I&#x27;m currently using proactiv + which surprisingly is working quite well. I have a few visible bumps but my pores are ofcourse still full of grime if I squeeze it so I&#x27;m pretty much just  going to test it in one area again another day and see if anything happens.  For people who arent suffering from acne just try it.  Im at odds cus i wasnt going to return it.</li>
            <li> This is something that is supposed to help with scarring, wrinkles, elasticity, large pores, and hyperpigmentation. I was excited to use it because I have superficial acne scarring on my cheeks. It is also supposed to help stimulate collagen production--which is important for helping get rid of wrinkles! I noticed slight improvement with the acne scarring on my face. I have only used it a month, so we will see my results over time. So far the results have been promising! I received this for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Was afraid to use at first but its not painful like I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I just tried twice but haven&#x27;t seen any difference...Expect to see some difference</li>
            <li> No! It made me break out. Something I never do.</li>
            <li> I like the derma roller and believe I&#x27;m starting to see results. I&#x27;ve been rolling for about a month but have forgotten a few times to use it. It does make my skin feel smoother. I&#x27;m using mine for stretch marks and have seen minor improvements hopefully it keeps up the work, but so far I&#x27;m very happy. P.s. the needles were a bit scary the first time but they aren&#x27;t bad at all just don&#x27;t push and remember they&#x27;re helping you</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and I really love it. It does exactly what I expected. I only gave it 4 because I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but so far it meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I was always scared to use one of these. I was given one free to give my honest opinion of it. Well, it isnt so bad. I feel as if my moisturizer works better after using this. I promise it isnt as scary as it looks or sounds.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I choose this item because the price was right after researching other products which are $200+.  I can not speak for the results because I have only used it twice. It does make my skin feel great afterwards. It&#x27;s well made and looks to last me a while. Care and cleaning seem easy.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the next 24 hours after using this. The only downside I noticed was that it almost feels like you have a bad sunburn on your face for the rest of the day. So I suggest doing it later in the day and also maybe on a day where you having nothing to do the next day.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have only used it once - but seems to function as I would imagine it to. As to the results, I would need to report later.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skin Care sent me this to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  I have been testing it out for several weeks now and I really think this handy tool is working!  While I have to say it&#x27;s a little weird running needles over your face it&#x27;s a fantastic idea that works!  Since using this my skin has become more clear and smooth.  I am going to continue to use it since it&#x27;s also suppose to help with pigmentation and acne scars and since I have Melasma and some old acne scars I am anxious too see how well it works on those!  I think this product should be a staple in every beauty routine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a dermaroller for quite awhile now but kept procrastinating due to some horror stories about other brands. I thoroughly examined this roller before use, for any defects such as bent needles and everything looked great. I was still nervous to use it on my face so I tested it on a scar on my leg first. It rolled smoothly and wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I expected even with using quite a bit of pressure due to the thickness of the scar in that area. I decided to use it on my face for multiple deep scars and I barely needed to use any pressure at all. After one use, a rather deep scar between my eyebrows has already started to fill in some and I cant wait to see how much it will improve after more rolling. The redness only lasted about a day. Overall, this roller appears to be great quality and the results seem promising. I also want to say that I do not work for this company nor have been paid for my review.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised. I was worried that the needles would hurt, but they do not, except for if you accidentally roll it too close to your eyes. I have been using it only on my face for a couple weeks now. I haven&#x27;t seen any instant results, but it does take time. My skin does seem smoother than it was before. I am not using any special serums or anything and am using it about twice a week. I am still using it, so hopefully I will get some results after some time. I didn&#x27;t want to wait too long to write the review (in case I forgot!) so this is my experience so far!</li>
            <li> Welp!  Its way better than what I expected .  I ordered it December 1st and it came December 4th... It was supposed to come December 5th-8th n I didn&#x27;t even do prime tho ...It&#x27;s a must buy! Fast shipping.. seems high quality for the reduced price... Thank yaww 😍    I just finished using it may be about 7 hours ago when I received it and it instantly showed different in my face ....my acne bumps are going away a lot sooner!!! Thank you again</li>
            <li> Miracle!! Makes face red at first... use it at night and ask  up with a soft face. If you have deep under the skin acne or post acne marks, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a very unusual device in the area of skincare. When I was asked to try it to review it I was intrigued. I wasn’t sure what to expect.  When I received it I was actually a little scared. I can tell you that it feels very strange, but it did not hurt me. But I would not rub too hard, because I could see it hurting if not used correctly. I used it a lot in my tummy and thigh areas for cellulite before I put on some lotion. The Derma Roller stimulates collagen production for tighter, firmer, smoother skin. It also creates multi micro-channels in the skin, allowing products to penetrate the skin at a deeper level.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased the Derma Roller and I was a little hesitant to use it at first despite the positive reviews.  I have always been interested in natural skin care options to avoid harsh chemical treatments so I was willing to give it a try.  My main concern, like most, is that my pores are large on my cheeks and I wash my face daily but was not seeing any results until I used the Derma Roller.  I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and was actually kind of relaxing in a way.  I have only been using the Derma Roller for less than a week and already notice my pores becoming smaller.  As much as I spend on face products, it&#x27;s nice to know they can actually penetrate my skin and give the the greatest benefit for my money when I apply them after using the Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now. It&#x27;s generally used on the face but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it so I&#x27;ve been using it on my tummy, my outer thighs and parts of my derriere. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, though I imagine it would if you were to apply a lot of pressure while using it. I am hopeful that it will help reduce some of the cellulite I have and maybe the appearance of my stretchmarks though I&#x27;m not confident it will reduce their appearance much since they&#x27;ve been there for 24 years now. :) So far it does seem to have made my skin appear a little tighter but I&#x27;ll keep using it and check back with a further review.    Update after 2 weeks of use:  I can definitely feel the results in my skin, it feels softer, smoother and tighter than before. I&#x27;m going to start using it on my face despite not liking the feeling. Also using it every other day. I am loving the derma roller so far!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product.  I mean, how can a bunch of needles help my skin?  It didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  However, I took the plunge and so far, the results seem positive.  I was using this by itself for the first several days I had it and I just gently rolled it over my skin.  It seems to me like the skin tightened up after a few days of use.  I came back and read the reviews and ended up ordering the Vitamin C Serum.  I have rosacea and didn&#x27;t really think this roller and the serum would do anything to help with that; I was mostly hoping for improvement in the appearance of my pores and the little wrinkles that I blame on my husband. :)  After using the vitamin C serum along with the roller, my husband remarked that my face didn&#x27;t seem so red.  I will continue to use both products and will update when I have more solid results to report.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how this thing works. All I can say is - it does!! It somehow promotes collagen growth, which means you have a way to turn back time on your wrinkles, lose those acne scars, enlarged pores, and cellulite! I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I am seeing some results as far as my pores being minimized. Just be careful when you use it, because those little pins can hurt!</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations! It takes some getting used to, but I am hooked on derma rolling, the results after just 1 week are amazing! I recommend anyone with uneven skin tone or scars on your face, try derma rolling.</li>
            <li> I had research Derma Rollers for some time. I had read in magazines and seen on TV presentations good things about but always frightening of pain stop me. Well, I want to have my skin rejuvenate with oxygen and extra amount of all ingredients given by my face cream meaning need to try.&lt;br /&gt;I come across Petunia Derma Roller 1 mm 540 needles and I am ready to try. Company claim that they product “yield results with no hype included”. Derma Roller by Petunia feels amazing on my skin.  I rolled it horizontally, vertically, and diagonally about 10 times per area.  Immediately after using the Derma Roller, I applied some other facial products I have been using.  I genuinely saw a much better absorption and results from the skin care products I had already been using.  Before using Petunia Skincare’s 1.00 mm 540 Needles Derma Roller the moisturizer I was using seemed to absorb a little into my skin.  After using the Derma Roller the products had a much more intense absorption.  I could really feel them working much faster. Since I was using this on my face around my nose and cheek areas as well as my neck I used it once a day every 2-3 days with light pressure. I do feel some tightness in are of overlapping and very light pink skin next day but its looks more like a glowing skin than inflammation. I have noticed a little bit of softening of a line I have on my forehead and my pores are definitely reducing in size. My skin resulted in a soft, glowing, radiant, pink hue immediately. I am in hopes to achieve my ultimate goal to smooth out fine laugh lines around my outer eye area, diminish forehead wrinkles. My skin results are joyous and wow!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different options and uses for this Derma Roller by Petunia and I will try it on other areas.  I do recommend you go at your own pace and only do as much as you feel your skin can handle, you can always increase and make adjustments as you go along.  I highly recommend using this derma roller.</li>
            <li> for one time use,brock another day</li>
            <li> Great item.  Cant wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> Already can see improvement on size of pores on my face. Hope this improvement continues.</li>
            <li> When I used this, all that happened was my scars started to look beat red and they even bled!! I was using it as shown, when I moved in different positions I picked it all the way up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dare to use it again because the scar I have is right near my heart. This was so not worth the money for me!! From now on I&#x27;m just gonna say to myself my surgery scars are a memory of bravery so Instead of trying to get rid of them I&#x27;ll just keep them.</li>
            <li> very interesting product.  does indeed help lotion to be absorbed by the skin.  however, be careful to use a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have any scent or additives that might cause a rash.&lt;br /&gt; be gentle and careful - use on face perhaps only 3x weekly and stay away from sensitive under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;I tested on my forearms first, to get used to using it and see how it felt. rinse the roller with water, and perhaps rinse with rubbing alcohol as well to be sure its clean. wash your forearm and dry. roll gently but firmly as instructions state, back-and-forth, up-and-down, across.  then rinse and clean roller. you will feel a slight tingling, and the skin will be slightly reddened. don&#x27;t push too hard!  on my first trial, i used a new lotion sample, and broke out it a rash. this was my fault. the 2nd time i used a lotion with no scent and had no problems.  my skin does feel more moisturized and looks better.</li>
            <li> Ordered by mistake will return when I get it.</li>
            <li> I finally got the courage to actually try this out on my skin. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve tried this long enough to see any noticeable results just yet but I did notice the rosehip oil I use on my face absorbed a lot more quickly after using the derma roller. I definitely watched several videos on how to use the derma roller before actually putting it to use on my face. So far it&#x27;s been a painless experience and I do feel like it&#x27;s been working. After another week of use I&#x27;ll be updating my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product free for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this 1 day but so far so good. Quality is actually a little better than I expected, the plastic handle has a nice weight to it and the carrying case is sturdy and one I&#x27;ll actually use since having a wheel of needles just laying around doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea. Will update after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Great price, visible results in only 4 weeks, using 2 x a week.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. It leaves your skin feeling soft and helps the moisturizer  penetrate much better.</li>
            <li> Scary but very cool..works great..</li>
            <li> I LOVE my derma roller by petunia skincare. I&#x27;ve been using it for stretch marks on my stomach, and it works SO WELL. I was skeptical honestly at first, but I did my research and have been rolling, then applying vitamin C serum on my stomach afterwards and have seen SO much improvement in my stretch marks. I can&#x27;t WAIT to see what this bad boy does after 6 months. I&#x27;d really like to get a size bigger, but for now, this has seriously improved my stomach to the point where I&#x27;m not totally terrified to wear a bikini this summer!! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Very poor service.  Beware this product can cause extreme heat, welts and itching to your face after use.  If you contact the company they will turn things around and they don&#x27;t seem to understand.  I have stopped using this product since I don&#x27;t know if this is a normal occurrence or not.</li>
            <li> Almost 3 Weeks of use and my scars and pores are already fading. This Dermaroller is a life saver! Highly recommend using a vitamin C serum after use. OZ naturals vitamin C serum has worked miracles along side this in my routine.</li>
            <li> hate, caused me to break out, my aesthetics technician was shocked I could buy one without a license, she said they have to go through a TON of training to use them as they can cause serious scaring and are NOT a tool for the layperson. It sits in my drawer now and I wont use it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my face and feel like I saw immediate results. I use the roller followed by a serum that I also purchased On Amazon called Oz naturals vitamin C amino blend Etc. I didn&#x27;t feel like it hurt that much, I mean you can definitely feel it rolling on your face, but if you had other things done such as laser, Microderm, peels Etc this is similar to those so you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised. One of my friends who has never had any of these things done tried the roller and she found it to be pretty painful, just an FYI for newbies to real hardcore skin care.  She probably just isn&#x27;t used to having things like that on her face! I mean pain and beauty are one and the same right!?  I personally really like it and believe that I will make this part of my beauty regimen maybe once a week or so nothing more as too much of a turnover may not be a good thing? At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard. I would like to mention that after a few uses I decided to also use on my chest which is red and splotchy and has small red spots and in general just has not been aging very well, and I feel like I&#x27;ve noticed some results there as well. I would recommend this purchase and I think it will save you a lot of money because they offer this at many derma spas and salons but why on earth would you pay them to do it when you can do it yourself? One other thing I would highly recommend using a serum after rolling not an oil or lotion because they say that serum penetrates the best. Amazon recommend some good pairings so do some googling read the reviews to determine which serum is best for you and your skin condition.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous to try this product because i am terrified of needles but when i finally got the courage to try it out it was great!It was painless for me and so easy to use.It comes with a plastic case for storage.It has a easy  to hold handle so it wont slip and great design.I have been using it for about two weeks and i can already feel my skin getting tighter.I will definitely keep it up.so far it has worked great and i have been telling all of my friends about it.They are always looking for products like this and since its easy and works why not?I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had dry and scarred skin on my face for years... after the very first use followed by my regular skin regimen, I saw very noticeable results! It very clearly helps your skin absorb product, and later the same day my skin felt smoother and softer. I use various cremes and lotions, and for scars I use Mederma... I was very pleasantly surprised that the scars almost immediately improved in size, darkness, and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that it does sting when using the roller, but it is very worth it! Make sure you disinfect thoroughly with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, rinse it with warm water, and wash your face well before every use.&lt;br /&gt;Also important! My face was very red after using it... and actually, when I applied honey to my face that night (which I do daily), my face became very red again. However, the redness did not last too long, so just use it at night on a weekend like it suggests and no one will know :)</li>
            <li> I love this derma roller.  I had the opportunity to receive this derma roller free in return for an honest review.  At first, I was a little nervous to try it out.  The thought of running tiny needles over my skin was both intriguing and nerve wracking.  I looked at the instructions which stated to run the roller over my face 10 times in vertically, horizontally and diagonally.&lt;br /&gt;The roller is very good quality and as I started to use it, I found it made my face tingle but certainly was not painful.  The roller was very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;When I was done, my face felt tingly but did not look blotchy (see photo).&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with how well my moisturizer absorbed into my skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is brighter, smoother and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that this is a very professional company.  I would definitely order any of their products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;If you have been on the fence about purchasing a derma roller, I encourage you to try this one!</li>
            <li> Dont work but hurt instead</li>
            <li> At first i was scared because of all the small little needles it wasn&#x27;t that painful it just felt a little weird i did feel like my skin was tighter and much smoother and softer i&#x27;m using this product for my stretch marks it does look like its helping still testing tho</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this but it is very squeaky!!  The squeak doesn&#x27;t really bother me because I am getting great results from using this along with my Joy and Karma Hyloronic Acid serum.</li>
            <li> Very horrifying at first, but once you use it it&#x27;s amazing! I did it at night and in the morning. I found that doing it at night is so much better, because your face will become red. It does hurt a little, but it&#x27;s not too painful. My skin is noticeably smoother after one week of using this amazing roller.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get worked up over the needles. They&#x27;re not that bad. Soak a wash cloth in warm/hot water, and put it on your face for a couple of minutes before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, but the opinion is my own. Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li> ****Disclaimer**** I received these products for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I want to talk about the derma roller,i did see some results but I have yet to use it a ton since I just got it,but It works and I like the results I have seen thus far.It did help my acne scars on my face,i didn’t use it on my knee where I have a big scar because the skin there is super sensitive and it didn’t want to hurt that area.I did try this on my face though and I thought it was good,but the needles are super tiny but I could feel them and they did somewhat hurt,but you get used to it,also my skin is super sensitive so that could be why,too.I did not like it on the scalp though because my hair is super long and thin so it was pulling it out to much,so i stopped that,but I wish I could have kept it up though because id love some more healthy growth to come out of my head.The roller leaves a tingling prickly feeling afterwards,its not unpleasant though.</li>
            <li> Test first to see how vigorous you need to be with your own skin - I had a little peeling without doing too much and definitely like the results!</li>
            <li> The sensation the dermaroller gives is a slight prickling feeling. I only used it once so I would have to update my info later on but it made my skin softer.</li>
            <li> It works as described. No complaint at all. I follow the directions carefully and learned how to use it. There&#x27;s no magic, it just a smart invention. I am a wound care nurse, and I know how important the collagen is for our skin. I suffered from terrible acne since I was 13. My face is far from smooth. I would say my skin is way better now. I didn&#x27;t have to go through any surgical procedure, just do this self treatment in regular basis from 3x a week sometimes once a week if i&#x27;m busy. Thank you for this simple solution.</li>
            <li> I received the Derma roller to try and provide my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product scared me a little at first but after getting it I was actually very impressed. I haven&#x27;t had the derma-roller for a month yet but I try to use it as frequently as I can. . When I first started using it, I rolled my entire face for a few minutes. Now, since I&#x27;ve gotten use to it its about 5 minutes. I used it bout twice a week.  I&#x27;ve noticed my dark spots have been fading little by little and my face is a lot smoother. I have acne prone skin and I think the Derma Roller has been helping with the reduction of the acne.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I use mine 1-2 times a week.  Seems well made.  Great delivery time.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the money.</li>
            <li> This Derma Roller is now both my absolute favorite go-to micro-needling device and a major step up from what I was using before. If there is anything to take away from this, spending for a 540 needle model is well worth it. My previous Derma Roller only had around 192 and I think this contributed to it becoming dull so quickly, leaving behind prick marks and actually injuring my skin. All of these Derma Rollers were originally created to be single use disposables for derm offices and Med spas but since it&#x27;s only us using it (these should never be shared!), they can last through a number of at home treatments. My hope is with more needles, this Petunia model will last longer than my other one did, which was only eight uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing worth noting is this 1.0mm length gave surprisingly better results than my much more painful 1.5mm roller. I was told that the longer needle length would produce more pronounced results but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve found. This model&#x27;s sharp needles do not leave any visible prick marks and feels much more gentle on the skin. I really like how substantial the the handle is as well. It even has a no skid indentation to help prevent it from slipping out of your grasp. Petunia Skincare does a good job of giving basic instructions on the box making this easy to start using even if you&#x27;re completely new to all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Derma Roller in conjunction with Petunia&#x27;s Revitalize Eye Serum and neroli infused Hyaluronic Acid serum along with a Vitamin C serum from another seller here on Amazon and it&#x27;s been working wonders. Serums are key and 1.00mm it is from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample for review was provided by Petunia Skincare.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had this about a month and it seems to do exactly as it says it will. It stings a little during use, a few minutes later feels like a light sunburn, within an hour or so I&#x27;ve completely forgotten about it. I keep forgetting to check how long my face is red for after but I don&#x27;t think its very long. I also do the back of my hands because I see them more and can better judge the effects - it does seem to be working to get rid of some of the fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance. I am the kind of person (weird- I know) who will go to the dentist and decline the Novocaine when having dental work done on fillings and tooth filings. The rolling to me felt like little bee stings. I have only used it twice so far on my face. And like the other reviewers suggested I would recommend rolling at night and applying a serum afterwards then your moisturizer. Cleanliness on your face and for the device is crucial to avoid infection. I will continue to use it in hopes of seeing results.</li>
            <li> ، i am from KSA i like this derma roller it is amazing i am in love with it  it also arrived to me in just one week حبيت هالديرما رولر جربتها وكانت ممتازه وصلتني خلال اسبوع من الطلب للسعوديه</li>
            <li> the gf loved this. works like a charm. great quality.</li>
            <li> Wow, that tingles!!!! but using it cautiously, I think it will bring great results. Looking forward to using it again and again.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I have moderate acne scarring and this thing has completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I highly recommend to anyone looking to clear up their skin.</li>
            <li> I’ve used this a few times and I don’t know if my skin is just sensitive or what, but it hurts a little to use. I don’t apply a lot of pressure. I just use it lightly and my face turns beat red. I tell myself it’s worth it because think of all the blood flow going to my face. But the thing is even hours and hour later I’ll touch my forehead and it still hurts like my skin has been lightly bruised. Not going to lie it kind of ticks me off that my skin is that sensitive to it while majority of people seem to be enjoying it. I’m going to try a few more times and see if my skin thickens up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received these products for free my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Used it 4-5 times only found it to be slightly more painful than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I actually I used it I feel it definitely is worth a try I am using mine on my stretch marks and I was super excited to try something new..and I got link from dollar reviews.com glad I tried this thanks</li>
            <li> Amazing product... I used around two times a week, and within the third use I noticed a little different in skin texture. I purchased because I still have acne scar from years ago when I had  acne. Now my skin is acne free I still do have some light scar, I have used many strength and different type peels to get rid of the old scar but they&#x27;re not completely gone. Hopefully with proper use, time, and incorporating of the Vita C serum, along with my collagen mask and cream regimen I will be able to see some real results. I&#x27;ll give it time.</li>
            <li> This is awful! It breaks your skin and leaves marks for like two days! I&#x27;m going to return.</li>
            <li> The derma roller was delivered fast, works great and has substantially reduced the appearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading 16 pages of the majority of 5 stars. Well now it seems 99% of the comments are from people who got the product for free for &amp;#34;Their honest and unbias opinion&amp;#34;. Now I&#x27;m just turned off, never have I read so many 5 star comments in a row all by customers that receive their products free. I feel now that I don&#x27;t believe any of it and this has never happen to me on Amazon. I always weighed my opinion on comments but this is just hard to swallow so I will pass. Try again this just seem to be all contrived.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the previous reviews. I&#x27;ll be honest i have only used it twice now but i don&#x27;t see so much of a difference but i am willing to be patience and continue using it. I use a Clinique serum after using this product too. It&#x27;s not painful just a tingly sensation. Finger crossed hope to see what the dramatic improvement soon. I&lt;br /&gt;Also i haven&#x27;t used it on my stretch marks just my face. I will start that this week. Maybe then i will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit scared to use this when I first got it, but Petunia&#x27;s customer service walked me right through it!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt- it feels more like a mini-massage on your face.  I use it on my trouble areas (cheekbones and nose, mostly) and my skin is already looking much more clear after just a week of use.  I moisturize directly after and I can tell that the moisturizer is definitely getting down deeper into my skin with this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> After 1 week I seen results in the way my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I just got my derma roller 2 days ago so i have yet to see any results but i can feel them. The needles are super tiny so once you get over the initial shock of OMG im rolling needles on my face its SUPER invigorating. As of now i have been using mg own face product i hope to soon have the petuna skincare Vitamin C serum I can then let you all know how the two work together.  Ill report back in a few weeks when i see results! Xoxo &lt;3&lt;3</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of weeks together with a vitamin C cream only. I cannot believe the fantastic results in such a short time. I watched an instructional video on proper usage. Yes, it does make your face red after using it, but it is gone the next morning. I&#x27;m 46 and look much younger. It is reversing all of my sun damage!</li>
            <li> Quality of construction, ease of use and ergonomics are excellent.  Even quality of plastic storage case was of superior design and quality.</li>
            <li> I found the Premium 1.0 mm 540 Needles Derma Roller  very easy to use and stimulating.  The tingling facial feeling after a treatment does take a bit of getting accustomed to; however, there is no pain to the process.  You are in charge of the amount of pressure to apply to the roller.  This derma roller appears to trigger new collagen and elastin production and the skin renews and my skin feels nice and tighter.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and product arrived as described. It&#x27;s a little intimating at first use but you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite skin care find ever!! I honestly am surprised at the great price for the product I got. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I can already see a difference. I&#x27;m using it mainly to remove acne scars, so if you also have it, definitely try this out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and have been seeing real results. My skin overall looks better. Will definitely keep using this product</li>
            <li> Ive used it and cant really see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Best investment for my skin ever !</li>
            <li> My first time using a derm roller, but I like it!</li>
            <li> I got this have used as indicated no results yet hope it works as explained. Too soon for the results.</li>
            <li> So far I like this derma roller. Honestly at my age I don&#x27;t know if it is working but I use it faithfully right before I put on my retinol  serum at night. It&#x27;s easy to use and I like it better than the derma roller I bought before.</li>
            <li> I am going out on a limb here...I think it may be working.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to but feels good!</li>
            <li> After so much research about this product I finally decided to purchase one. Imagine my surprise when I found it for this price! I was going to pay 99.00. Customer service is excellent also! They answered every question I had. I definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of old scars.</li>
            <li> it really works and i saw a major change in my skin after the 3rd week of use since i could only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> has any one used this for stretch marks? has the stretch marks gone away?</li>
            <li> I just received  this product  last nite and used it last night after ive cleaned and dried my face and i have to say i was shocked by the results  its like the needles kinda exfoliated my skin while at the same time making the appearance of any scar kind of vanish plus with the produts your face has more absourbion.. also my skin feels like itts actually  starting  to  breathe compared to feeling irritated or clogged or just plain  dirty  would recommend  this to  anyone with a skin condition</li>
            <li> As someone that is always looking for ways to improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Petunia Skincare Derma Roller as my first derma roller I have ever tried!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and can definitely say I love this derma roller!! I have seen a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin since receiving this derma roller!! Derma rollers are said to make your skin firmer, help smooth facial scars, stimulate collagen and elastin production, help with scar removal and fading stretch marks, stimulate hair growth as while as diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. While these are some of the many benefits of using a derma roller there are many other benefits as well!! This derma roller by Petunia Skincare is also made of the highest quality medical grade stainless steel so it&#x27;s built to last!! I definitely recommend this Petunia Skincare derma roller to everyone!! I was so happy to receive this Petunia Skincare derma roller from the company to test and share my opinion!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results yet. But product is just as it was described.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use the Derma roller.  It is pretty painless and there is very little redness the next day.  I&#x27;m hoping for great results.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This does work and I&#x27;m having good results, but get lazy and don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I was using a .5mm dermaroller and decided it was time to upgrade to the 1.0mm. With all dermarollers, you do have a slight discomfort, but I feel like using the .5mm really helped with preparing for this. I love dermarollers because I have acne scars and hyper pigmentation and these are GREAT for that. I&#x27;ve seen them fade with prolonged use as well as with my own skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this and possibly upgrade in the future.</li>
            <li> I got a compliment on my skin the first day I used.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Fast shipping. Wrapped great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done two sessions of derma rolling. Amazing results because i notice my large pores are minize and my skin feel much smoothing but my acne scars will take more time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the derma roller twice a week for about a month now so I have not seen the extent of the results but I am definitely noticing that my scars are fading and my skin is looking more radiant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> I had to read all about derma treatments and needles in tissue regeneration again before I used this one.  I knew it from Germany and they are quite expensive professional treatments available.&lt;br /&gt;This is a tiny little thing and it does look intimidating to put the needles against the skin but they are soft to roll and I use it now 3 times a week and have no marks or scratches in the skin.</li>
            <li> Have only used twice but I like the results! I can tell that my face is a lot smoother, and pores are becoming less visible. Do NOT apply too much pressure or your face will be beat red for over a day. My recommendation is to use a vitamin C serum directly afterwards!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moZPZOGA703VW9]]I received this product to review on my blog. All the opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Needles OH MY! Finally sucked it up and tried my Derma Roller by Petunia Skincare. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try on of these. This is absolutely painless (it was for me). The roller has a great design and can easily be used at home, with no problems. I decided to make a short video on this product. I was impressed with it. I would recommend this product to others that are looking for this type of treatment. The needles are quality and if properly cared for, should last many uses. This is the first product of this kind I have tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with anything.</li>
            <li> must follow directions but if u do works really well!! new face!! scar almost gone</li>
            <li> I love it!! It works great and I can see a real difference in my skin! Thank you Derma Roller!</li>
            <li> The package arrived within 2 days of ordering, but unfortunately I had to wait for my acne to subside before I could use the dermaroller, otherwise the acne would spread.  Once I got the chance to use it, I was honestly a little scared.  I started on the areas of my face I was most concerned about, like the hyperpigmented and acne-scar areas, and worked my way around my entire face.  The directions were pretty easy to follow, I didn&#x27;t apply any pressure, just normal pressure when rolling (I did about 10 rolls in each direction).  The first few rolls were a little uncomfortable, but not painful at all, and I got used to the &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; feeling fairly quickly.  My face stayed red for about an hour or two and subsided throughout the night and was completely back to normal in the morning.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can see that some of my more recent acne scars are improving, while the older scars haven&#x27;t really changed much, but those may take more time anyways. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if its due to the roller or not, but I haven&#x27;t had any new acne since I started using it.  I&#x27;m hoping to purchase a vitamin c serum to apply after rolling since ideally you should apply something afterwards since your skin is open and will absorb a serum quickly. I&#x27;ll try to continue using it every 1-2 weeks and update my review on any improvement of the acne scars.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I was afraid the first time, but the roller dont damage the skin, is very easy use in the face, I like so much ....</li>
            <li> Love this product! Reviewing this product for my unbias and honest opinion @Got it for free. At first its a little uncomfortable with the needles but the more i did it the more relaxed i was and actually enjoyed the message! My skin on my theighs are starting to look smoother and im feeling more confindent!</li>
            <li> Wild looking tool! I can tell a big difference even after one use.  Glad I bought this.  My moisturizer actually &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; and my make up glides on much smoother.</li>
            <li> Makes skin absorb lotion more easily. Feels good on face.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pretty painless. I have had it for only two weeks. Can&#x27;t wait to see results. I have used it three times a week.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it! As a forewarning, these are like spike rollers. It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it looks, simply because the weight is distributed. The spikes look scary at first, though. I think this company is really reliable and good quality!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I  was given it free to review.  The roller helps to stimulate collagen and it takes a little getting use to but the results are worth it.  Its simple to use.</li>
            <li> Received item within exactly 7 days!!! perfectly packed, it does help the skin, you will see your skin improving day by day. I use it with my blemish fix cream that I got from the pharmacy. I am so happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Needles are dull- would not purchase again!!</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels great now! This has helped reduce fine lines, and acne scars! My pores look smaller even! my face is so soft. I like using this at night, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any marks, or trying to put makeup on! I love using this 2x a week, than using a moisturizer. My face is bright and tight now! Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and I can not judge it, but initially sounds good</li>
            <li> SO pleased with this product. I immediately applied a hyaluronic acid serum immidoately after rolling, then a very hydrating moisturizer. Words can&#x27;t even describe the difference in my skin after just one time! Better than the $300 IPL treatment I had done before. I am extremely pleased with this product. However, it is more painful than anticipated. I purchased some lyticane ointment and it helped A LOT. Have recommended this product to several friends already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne prone skin since I was like 16 &amp; I&#x27;m now 27.. Even if I get the acne under control I was always left with dark spots(so annoying) I used fading creams, face wash etc but nothing worked... &amp; then I ran across Derma rolling !! It made a difference in my skin within 2weeks... I&#x27;m not even gonna finish writing, I will let the before and after picture do the talking lol</li>
            <li> You should have a list of Possibles effects or how should I look like after use this ... I was looking and feeling like I had a sunburn at the beach per days and after that my skin starts peeling off and finally get so dry ... Still I don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;Why I have faith and I going to do it again after one month but I don&#x27;t notice anything  on my face ...</li>
            <li> best derma roller.  I LOVE IT.  I NOTICED THAT IT IS HELPINE  MY FINE LINED SKIN.  WHEN I FOND MY SKIN CAN TOLERATE IT,&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT THREE TIMES A WEEK.  I&#x27;VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY PROBLEM OF USING IT.  THE ROLLER IS HEAVY DUTY KIND.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO GLADE I FOND THIS DERMA ROLLER.</li>
