            <li>love this cologne</li>
            <li>I was able to buy another one</li>
            <li>The gamble paid off, it smells great, fresh, clean and masculine without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells clean &amp; fresh,</li>
            <li>This fragrance from Lacoste is right there with those others in terms of distinction, projection, masculinity and longevity of bouquet.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time ;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never EVER bought a fragrance without trying it out first.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t help but to wonder if it got hot maybe when it was shipped or if it&#x27;s just a defective batch of cologne or something.  </li>
            <li>I bought this exact cologne 5 years ago  on a cruise and thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>It was epic being able to buy a big bottle since its discontinued.</li>
            <li>Cologne is very sensitive to being stored at too hot of a temperature sometimes</li>
            <li>It smells so manly and sexy, last all day long.</li>
            <li>Just as an indicator for readers to have an idea of my &#x27;preferred taste&#x27; in scents and in no particular order, I wear Luna Rossa, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, Dolce &amp; Gabana (original pour homme), Polo Sport, Carolina Herrera, Escape and Egoiste Platinum.</li>
            <li>I DO KNOW this most recent bottle does not last long at all (30min, maybe an hour).</li>

            <li> I get compliments all the time ;)</li>
            <li> Pump from the container broke the second week of use</li>
            <li> I gambled on this purchase because I&#x27;d never smelled it before and I&#x27;ve never EVER bought a fragrance without trying it out first. The gamble paid off, it smells great, fresh, clean and masculine without being overpowering. Just as an indicator for readers to have an idea of my &#x27;preferred taste&#x27; in scents and in no particular order, I wear Luna Rossa, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, Dolce &amp; Gabana (original pour homme), Polo Sport, Carolina Herrera, Escape and Egoiste Platinum. This fragrance from Lacoste is right there with those others in terms of distinction, projection, masculinity and longevity of bouquet. I&#x27;d recommend this as a daytime or Spring/Summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> I give this cologne five stars it met all of my expectations. Great gift. I recommend this to anyone that loves a good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!  I love it!!! Great seller!</li>
            <li> love the smell and size..this is a xmas gift for my husband and im sure he will be amazed of the size like I was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Cologne before and it is by far the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.  However, when I ordered this time the scent does not seem to last.  Cologne is very sensitive to being stored at too hot of a temperature sometimes and I can&#x27;t help but to wonder if it got hot maybe when it was shipped or if it&#x27;s just a defective batch of cologne or something.  Either way I DO KNOW this most recent bottle does not last long at all (30min, maybe an hour). I would purchase another bottle if I knew the scent would last longer but as of now I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite cologne to wear. It smells clean &amp; fresh, nothing flowery or musky about it.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites and after I found it on here and determined it was legit I actually got a couple bottles. Great deal and smell. I&#x27;m not an expert but this must have a decent amount of the oils because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this  scent for my husband.It smells so manly and sexy, last all day long. Just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Great cologne!</li>
            <li> It was epic being able to buy a big bottle since its discontinued. Thanks guys. I hope you guys get more bottles</li>
            <li> Dont last long smell like fake</li>
            <li> love this cologne I bought this exact cologne 5 years ago  on a cruise and thanks to amazon I was able to buy another one</li>
            <li> My dad loves this scent and has run out of it, so he thinks my sister is the one who gives it to him, but its not!</li>
