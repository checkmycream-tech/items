            <li>nice primer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and great price and service!</li>
            <li>wonderful, i love the light it gives to my skin and the texture is just silky and smooth</li>
            <li>Well the shipping went great, came before the expected date in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and under my bbcream (from Étude house)</li>
            <li>But I still like it very much.    !!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait:)</li>
            <li>After she or whoever I heard VDL from I did my research on the product and many people say they love it.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>Makes my face glowy. :)</li>
            <li>Better to mix with foundation.</li>
            <li>However, it looks really luminous under foundation in a good way (not like toy glitter spray or something).</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and shinning</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is one of the best primers I have tried.</li>
            <li>My face looked paler and super shiny compared to my neck.  </li>
            <li>other than that pretty good :)</li>
            <li>Just alone it makes my skin look more luminous, but not glittery or highly glossy.</li>
            <li>natual and pretty !</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a shiny, healthy, natural look.</li>
            <li>Though it looks stunning on the hand and is very beautifully illuminating,  I found it hard to use as it left a white cast on the face.</li>
            <li>Make my skin look healthy all day long</li>
            <li>Just ordered this thanks to my beauty guru bubzbeauty.</li>
            <li>It is packed very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really silky and sparkly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>After seeing how much bubzbeauty talks about this primer, i knew i had to buy it.</li>
            <li>The primer is absorbed into your skin winthin a second.</li>
            <li>It illuminates your face really nicely without it being overly &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; (if you know what I mean).  </li>
            <li>like i do you might want to use it right before a dinner event and not for the daily use.</li>
            <li>it makes my bbcream look pretty and not dry and caked on.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m not sure about the product quite yet, I&#x27;ve only used it about once.</li>

            <li> Just ordered this thanks to my beauty guru bubzbeauty. Hope it&#x27;s just as nice on my skin!! I&#x27;ll update my review once it arrives. Can&#x27;t wait:)</li>
            <li> Good! Feel moisture and a little shiny after use this mixed with foundation.</li>
            <li> wonderful, i love the light it gives to my skin and the texture is just silky and smooth, i use it every day as a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and texture of this product.  I would never knew this product until I watch BubzBeauty on YouTube.</li>
            <li> a little bit lighter than my skin tone , just a tiny little bit . but after I used it ,i realize my skin looks awesome ! natual and pretty !</li>
            <li> Great primer!  It illuminates your face really nicely without it being overly &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; (if you know what I mean).  I only dab a little amount on 5 points on my face: forehead, nose bridge, both cheeks, and chin.  Also, I believe this is the one and only primer that hasn&#x27;t made me break out!!  NICE!! :)</li>
            <li> Make my skin look healthy all day long</li>
            <li> Not sure exactly (because I forgot already) but I think I learned about VDL from Bubz Beauty.  But anyways...  After she or whoever I heard VDL from I did my research on the product and many people say they love it.  And honestly I do too!!  It&#x27;s very light and under my bbcream (from Étude house) it makes my bbcream look pretty and not dry and caked on.  Also it&#x27;s very sparkly, like when you pump a small bit of it out you can see (what I think) glitter particles.  But I still like it very much.    !!! EDIT !!!  (12/02/2015)  I did learn this from Bubz  If you&#x27;d like to watch her review click/copy the link: [...]  She starts talking about the primer @ 6:08</li>
            <li> i LOVE IT. My skin looks smooth and shinning</li>
            <li> this is sooo amazing i got this after i saw bubzbeauty Korean haul video from youtube!&lt;br /&gt;sooo good! I want to repurchase this one again.&lt;br /&gt;and I also ordered this with VDL cushion they goes well together</li>
            <li> It is packed very well. The primer is absorbed into your skin winthin a second. It does illuminate your skin and stay long. Good product.</li>
            <li> I did not realize there would actually be specks of glitter in here! However, it looks really luminous under foundation in a good way (not like toy glitter spray or something). Can make your makeup a little pale.</li>
            <li> Well the shipping went great, came before the expected date in perfect condition. :) I&#x27;m not sure about the product quite yet, I&#x27;ve only used it about once. it seems really nice. it&#x27;s really silky and sparkly. does help with some of my redness. However, I do have a little bit of acne and dark marks from it, that doesn&#x27;t dull with the product(let alone my foundation). other than that pretty good :)</li>
            <li> Great item! This primer works well with or without makeup. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. The seller also provides great customer service. A+ service!</li>
            <li> amazing product it made my skin glow. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> After seeing how much bubzbeauty talks about this primer, i knew i had to buy it. Seriously this is one of the best primers I have tried. I especially love mixing it with my foundation. Highly recommend this product and great price and service!</li>
            <li> if you have oily skin like i do you might want to use it right before a dinner event and not for the daily use.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. Makes my face glowy. :)</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this stuff is amazing! I was not expecting to love it as much as I did. Just alone it makes my skin look more luminous, but not glittery or highly glossy. It adds just a *bit* of dewiness to my foundation which I loooooove! Can&#x27;t wait to mix it with my foundation and apply.</li>
            <li> Though it looks stunning on the hand and is very beautifully illuminating,  I found it hard to use as it left a white cast on the face. My face looked paler and super shiny compared to my neck.  I suggest using this as an illuminater for ur cheekbones and forehead, definitely not your entire face.</li>
            <li> After applying this product, it highlights your skins.</li>
            <li> nice primer. It gives your skin a shiny, healthy, natural look. Better to mix with foundation.</li>
