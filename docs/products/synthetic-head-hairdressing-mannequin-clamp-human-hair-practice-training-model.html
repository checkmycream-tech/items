            <li>than that it&#x27;s a good head</li>
            <li>Although my daughter likes it, it isn&#x27;t a good product.  </li>
            <li>prompt service and good price</li>
            <li>receive item 25 days before estimated delivery date so that was good.</li>

            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>the hair comes out very easily as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for braiding and setting for beginners like myself, &amp; the price is exceptional for the head &amp; the table clamp.</li>
            <li>My teenagers love trying to braid hair.</li>
            <li>More of a toy than any thing</li>
            <li>but still okay</li>
            <li>great for young kids do not buy if your expecting to flatiron and curl or use for cosmetology</li>
            <li>Hair gets tangled easily and falls out.</li>
            <li>so it suits its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>cheap price</li>
            <li>the hair falling off the doll save your money and invest it on something else much more worth it people.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 13 yr old practicing different braid styles and even make up she loves it!</li>
            <li>but it has a full head of hair</li>
            <li>I ordered this product on the Nov. 23rd, it arrived on December 12th, Which is fairly quickly coming from China.</li>
            <li>Good for minimal practices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent quality for such a cheap price. :-)</li>
            <li>I love the stand that comes with it and will definitely order again.</li>

            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>i wanted a dummy doll with real synthetic hair on it</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and it arrived pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>so far everyone says its a good doll but takes a little to long to come</li>
            <li>opted to give it to my 1 year old to play with...</li>
            <li>becuase it was with a gift from an old cousin in the hair</li>
            <li>But it sheds and barely I used the thing..</li>
            <li>head has barely hair,  and the hair comes off just of looking at it.</li>
            <li>this doll is garbage there is barely any hair on this doll to begin with.</li>
            <li>Works well for my 8 year old granddaughter but it will not last too long.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great for young kids do not buy if your expecting to flatiron and curl or use for cosmetology the product is basically a doll for children.</li>
            <li> I like the structure of the head it&#x27;s nice an put together only problem I had was the hair kept coming out the hair was coming out time I took it out of the pack other than that it&#x27;s a good head I would of gave 5 if the hair didn&#x27;t keep coming out</li>
            <li> Hair was falling out as soon as i got it and rub my fingers through it. Its thin as hell tried returning it the same day i received it and couldnt. Overall u get what u pay for and i wasted my money. Very unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She likes it to practice braids and whatnot.  It&#x27;s decent quality for such a cheap price. :-)</li>
            <li> Terrible. Didnt come together or with instructions! Hair gets tangled easily and falls out.</li>
            <li> very bad quality all hair falling very quicly</li>
            <li> Nice product for a good price. My teenagers love trying to braid hair.</li>
            <li> Hair was hard when it arrived at my home and tangle badly within a week.</li>

            <li> Nice but hair got nappy</li>
            <li> Good for minimal practices. Not a good grade of synthetic hair to really practice on. Sold on it because it did come with the mannequin AND stand.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WORST THING EVER.. I was trying to learn how to braid . The hair is extremely thin. Then I thought to myself to keep it for my daughter. But it sheds and barely I used the thing.. In the process of returning it.</li>
            <li> It is as expected. Works well for my 8 year old granddaughter but it will not last too long. More of a toy than any thing but thats what I wanted it for so it suits its purpose just fine. Hair does fall out but not too badly. Have not tried any heat but hair is not real so don&#x27;t think it will work. I did receive it in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great item to practice braids on!</li>
            <li> Although my daughter likes it, it isn&#x27;t a good product.  The moment I took it out of the package,  the hair started shedding. Its hard to style cuz it tangles a lot.  Well, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it...very pleased...thanks</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> prompt service and good price</li>
            <li> Hair shed so much hard to practice on with hair falling out....cheap price so u get what u paid for</li>
            <li> receive item 25 days before estimated delivery date so that was good.

            <li> I ordered this product on the Nov. 23rd, it arrived on December 12th, Which is fairly quickly coming from China. 1. You cannot use heat to straighten or curl the hair, the synthetic will burn. I also had to add a grease based hair product to keep the hair from tangling in knots &amp; being pulled out. It&#x27;s pretty good for braiding and setting for beginners like myself, &amp; the price is exceptional for the head &amp; the table clamp.</li>
            <li> I bought to practice my braiding. Hair tangles alot but still gets the job done. Also, I have problems with keeping the stand still but still okay</li>
            <li> the hair is very thin, not full.  the scalp shows a lot.  the hair comes out very easily as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 13 yr old practicing different braid styles and even make up she loves it!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and it arrived pretty quickly.</li>

            <li> The hair tangles and falls out a lot.</li>
            <li> this doll is garbage there is barely any hair on this doll to begin with. the hair falling off the doll save your money and invest it on something else much more worth it people.</li>
