    <ol>
            <li>I assumed that it would be good since their eyeshadow are awesome.</li>
            <li>It is a good blush.</li>
            <li>so this amazon option is good).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the Physicians Formula blushes before, but don&#x27;t love this one.  </li>
            <li>Nice Blush, but broke after being in my purse for a while, and I never dropped my purse, falls apart easy</li>
            <li>More like a powder.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like you have added a lot of unnatural bronzey color, but is more like a healthly glow.  </li>
            <li>And too light!</li>
            <li>I like this pretty good.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>make up, the blush works fine alone.</li>
            <li>This blush barely shows up at all, even on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a few years ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This blush gives just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li>Color of outer blush much more tan than picture with not much pink hue.</li>
            <li>The compact itself is pretty flimsy too.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about their products are the prices, which are pretty reasonable compared to some of the other organic cosmetics available.</li>
            <li>The color is so light that you really can&#x27;t tell if you put any on at all - nearly transparent.</li>
            <li>It is a great company just not a good one for me.</li>
            <li>Smells very earthy</li>
            <li>They are natural too but twice as much money!</li>
            <li>I bought this blush on the reviews that it was highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The compact is pressed so tightly that it&#x27;s hard to get any on the brush, and I even use a good quality brush instead of the cheap one that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The case is extremely flimsy and comes apart easily.  </li>
            <li>This is very, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>She says it just gives her a natural look without looking too made up.</li>
            <li>Also likes the natural paper packaging it comes in.</li>
            <li>very subtle nice for summer</li>
            <li>The color is very faint and does not show up on my face very well, dissapointed because I heard this was a good brand.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find affordable, organic blush, which is not easy.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m going to have to splurge and buy bare minerals or jane iredale blush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other products from Physicians Formula&#x27;s organic line, and none of them work very well.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear dramatic makeup, generally I try to keep my makeup looking pretty natural.</li>
            <li> This is a solid, dry brick of color you cannot apply to your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get on; doesn&#x27;t give much color.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe i bought one that was old and dried out</li>
            <li> but other reviewers had the same experience!</li>
            <li> Though this is my second package from the line (the other a bronzer) that after a bit of use the hinge starts coming loose and tears apart.</li>
            <li> (if I really look for it, it&#x27;s a small line sometimes hidden or not where you think it would be and even some drug store don&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a bold blush with no shimmer, and I was wrong on both.</li>
            <li> Very hard pressed,difficult to use,not much color.</li>
            <li> closed</li>
            <li> Natural can mean anything.  </li>
            <li> I have not found any other blush to compare.  </li>
            <li> Its too bad because I wanted an afforable blush that was eco friendly and doesnt contain and</li>
            <li> I wish I could find one that is a little safer than this one.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Some color shows up on the brush or kleenex but puts very little color, if any, on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money is the bottom line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as a brick I&#x27;ve tried brushes, kleenex to try to get color on my face.</li>
            <li> The blush was too hard to apply to your face and cheeks</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed!</li>
            <li> The color doesnt even come off on the brush its so hard!</li>
            <li> However you can hardly get any product on the brush and if you do you don&#x27;t notice it on your face!</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock!  </li>
            <li> The two-tones just make things worse.</li>
            <li> hard as a rock!!</li>
            <li> but this was a fail.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice Blush, but broke after being in my purse for a while, and I never dropped my purse, falls apart easy</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a bold blush with no shimmer, and I was wrong on both. This has almost no color and it&#x27;s so shimmery that the tiniest application makes me look like a Cullen.</li>
            <li> Color of outer blush much more tan than picture with not much pink hue. More like a powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush on the reviews that it was highly pigmented. I can&#x27;t see it on my face. It is a good blush. It is a great company just not a good one for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear dramatic makeup, generally I try to keep my makeup looking pretty natural. This blush barely shows up at all, even on my fair skin. The compact is pressed so tightly that it&#x27;s hard to get any on the brush, and I even use a good quality brush instead of the cheap one that comes with it. The compact itself is pretty flimsy too. I feel like the lid would fall off before i even used a quarter of the product. I&#x27;ve used several other products from Physicians Formula&#x27;s organic line, and none of them work very well. The only good thing about their products are the prices, which are pretty reasonable compared to some of the other organic cosmetics available. You get what you pay for though.</li>
            <li> very subtle nice for summer</li>
            <li> hard as a rock!! The color doesnt even come off on the brush its so hard! I thought maybe i bought one that was old and dried out but other reviewers had the same experience! Its too bad because I wanted an afforable blush that was eco friendly and doesnt contain and toxic stuff but this was a fail. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to splurge and buy bare minerals or jane iredale blush. They are natural too but twice as much money!</li>
            <li> This blush gives just the right amount of color.  I like to brush it on under my eyes, cheeks, and along the sides of my face.  It doesn&#x27;t look like you have added a lot of unnatural bronzey color, but is more like a healthly glow.  I have not found any other blush to compare.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry and leave off the foundation make up, the blush works fine alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as a brick I&#x27;ve tried brushes, kleenex to try to get color on my face. Some color shows up on the brush or kleenex but puts very little color, if any, on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. I purchased this product a few years ago and it worked great. Whatever they did to change the product was a mistake.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Dollar Tree. I assumed that it would be good since their eyeshadow are awesome. However you can hardly get any product on the brush and if you do you don&#x27;t notice it on your face! The two-tones just make things worse.</li>
            <li> The color was so off. Almost peachy! And too light! I was super disappointed! I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The blush was too hard to apply to your face and cheeks</li>
            <li> I like this pretty good. I wish I could find one that is a little safer than this one.</li>
            <li> Smells like crayons, doesn&#x27;t show. Waste of money. I bought because of the price. Could give it to my  daughter for play make up.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I was excited to find affordable, organic blush, which is not easy. This is a solid, dry brick of color you cannot apply to your face. I used the included brush and couldn&#x27;t get any of the color on the brush. Even if I &amp;#34;chiseled&amp;#34; at it, it wasn&#x27;t breaking up into a powder that I could apply.</li>
            <li> This is very, very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was organic.When I received it says it is 12 percent organic!False advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the Physicians Formula blushes before, but don&#x27;t love this one.  The case is extremely flimsy and comes apart easily.  The color is so light that you really can&#x27;t tell if you put any on at all - nearly transparent.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock!  Doesn&#x27;t even show up on the brush.  Waste of money is the bottom line!</li>
            <li> Very hard pressed,difficult to use,not much color.</li>
            <li> It is definitely organic. Smells very earthy</li>
            <li> My wife had ordered this once before and tried another brand but came back to this one. She says it just gives her a natural look without looking too made up. Goes on easy and stays on throughout the day. Also likes the natural paper packaging it comes in. Would recommend trying!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get on; doesn&#x27;t give much color.  Have to use over and over to get color on.</li>
            <li> The color is very faint and does not show up on my face very well, dissapointed because I heard this was a good brand.</li>
            <li> I like the Physician Formula Organic Wear line for being an affordable organic make up option that I can buy her on amazon or at any drugstore (if I really look for it, it&#x27;s a small line sometimes hidden or not where you think it would be and even some drug store don&#x27;t carry it anymore so this amazon option is good). Though this is my second package from the line (the other a bronzer) that after a bit of use the hinge starts coming loose and tears apart. Thank god there s a magnet that keeps it closed otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have a cover for it. So that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Please do not fall for this corporation nonsense regarding the word \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  Natural can mean anything.  These products are NOT organic.  Companies are now allowed to use the word organic as in \\&quot;organic wear\\&quot;, but that does not make it organic. And it is NOT.  Do your homework and we can rid ourselves of these fake companies that do nothing more but pollute the earth and deceive the public. You are basically putting a bunch of toxic chemicals on your face along with genetically modified corn and soy.</li>
