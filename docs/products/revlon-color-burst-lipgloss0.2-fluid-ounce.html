            <li>This is a really nice lipgloss.</li>
            <li>Gives your face a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Product feels nice on the lips, but requires more than one application for it to show.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth feel, moisturizes well!  </li>
            <li>The gloss still remains on the rims of my lips for whatever reason,  but I kind of like it better that way.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wantef</li>
            <li>and I will most likely continue buying Revlon&#x27;s lip glosses.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It makes my lips appear bigger and more</li>
            <li>I can mix it with any other lip color if I want to or just leave it alone for a nice shine</li>
            <li>It provides soooo much shine when you first apply it,  but I also adore the effects it gives my pout while it&#x27;s wearing off.</li>
            <li>✔ Large variety of colors&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the seller shipped the product fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Not for African Americans with a medium to light brown tone.</li>
            <li>The color is too light and frosted; could only be worn in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Very glossy but in the picture the gloss looks</li>
            <li>a little bit more tan</li>
            <li>I surprised her when I was able to find it in a few clicks of the keyboard.</li>
            <li>natural color, really shiny and glossy but not sticky applicator brush is soft</li>
            <li>Nice subtle color with a hint of richness to it.  </li>
            <li>If there is any drug store makeup products that are capable of keeping up with high end products, it would definitely be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday and it can be put on lightly for a subtle tint, or you can put it on more heavily for a more concentrated color effect.</li>

            <li> It does tend to be a little thick when it is first applied, but it creates a milky texture</li>
            <li> Not sticky, no funny taste just wished it lasted a little longer</li>
            <li> but the product feels too thick when applied and doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> ✔ 1 bottle has lasted me 6 months with everyday wear</li>
            <li> No overwhelming scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference at all though!</li>
