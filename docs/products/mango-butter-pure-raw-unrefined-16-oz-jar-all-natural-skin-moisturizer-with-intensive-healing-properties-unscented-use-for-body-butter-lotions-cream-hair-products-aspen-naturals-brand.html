            <li>I immediately took notice of how nice it smells.</li>
            <li>(I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t stop one from adding their own flavoring/scent and making a mixture if they so choose.  </li>

            <li>Love, love this stuff!</li>

            <li>Customer service is very nice and courteous and shipping was lightning fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li>This came out creamy, rich and smells so good.</li>
            <li>It smells like a very very light coco butter.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and looks like I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the lid was cracked and product unsealed when I received mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all, I love it.</li>
            <li>i thought it would smell better then</li>

            <li>I have mixed it with coconut oil and Shea butter (the company sent me a great recipe) and I have even used it by itself.</li>

            <li>The heel on my foot is  smooth again and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li>The actual product is great.</li>
            <li>My calluses are staying smooth and I am not having hand rips.</li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it very much since the day I bought until now</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for my soap making.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin and just an all over product.  </li>
            <li>really great for dry skin- knees, elbows, feet.. etc.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a great smell, but there was no greasy or oily feeling, and it soaked right into my skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is unscented, so I can use as much as I&#x27;d like without the worry of smelling &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; around others.</li>
            <li>Love this mango butter, leaves your skin feeling very moisturized</li>
            <li>Love the butter,  Skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>There is a full pound of Mango Butter solids in one container.</li>
            <li>Not bad to be unusable (2/10 on the scale)</li>
            <li>It melts with body heat into a beautiful oil and a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m really loving the consistency!</li>
            <li>Mango Butter works great on my face and the aged spots on my hands!</li>
            <li>so I will definitely find many more uses.  </li>
            <li>You gain a loyal customer</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I was very interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s scent free --</li>
            <li>Made up a whipped butter last night!!!,,,, So far so good, my hair looks very mosturized!! :)</li>
            <li>but I found that it really was a bit like butter and that it could be rubbed onto your skin fairly easily.</li>
            <li>I melted and mixed this with olive oil and coconut oil for an amazing body cream.</li>
            <li>I love natural things like this because I can even put it on my baby.</li>
            <li>but if you warm it up with your hands it will soften enough for you to rub.</li>
            <li>I have so far use so many lotions and creams,  but this product beat them all.  </li>
            <li>Packaging is exactly as shown, came full up to the rim.</li>
            <li>LOVE how it leaves my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love natural things.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid at room temperature, but melts really nicely when rubbed in your hands and on your skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbed well.  </li>
            <li>It emulsifies in my hands super easily and keeps my hair VERY VERY soft and moisturised.  </li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product, I was expecting something that was the consistency of pudding, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the container and found it filled to the top of the jar with something a bit more solid.</li>
            <li>Also great for dry hair ends and very natural</li>
            <li>it soaks right into my skin and has no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>My preference is right from the jar.  </li>
            <li>The warmth of body temperature makes it very easy to spread across the skin, but because of it&#x27;s consistency, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and deeply moisturizes even the driest skin.</li>
            <li>WaaaaLaaaa, great looking feet and the dry areas are now very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick,  luscious and works best mixed with an oil to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a large amount of residue.</li>
            <li>Smooth and natural feeling on freshly shaved legs--</li>
            <li>I especially like the level of customer service from your initial note to me, saying that you would work with me until I was happy.</li>
            <li>The Mango Butter came very fast.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using mango butter</li>
            <li>It has a higher melting point like coconut oil so as soon as you take it out the heat of your hands starts to melt the product.</li>
            <li>It is VERY moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter itself was helping, but adding mango has made is pretty stellar.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it especially after a shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and essential oils but this works much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the lotion recipe you provided!</li>
            <li>(I love cocoa butter but the scent overpowers the essential oils).</li>
            <li>I had recently purchased essential oils that also have soo many benefits and can mix it easily with them for scent.</li>
            <li>And thanks for the very fast service, and forgive my tardiness in leaving feedback..</li>
            <li>It soaks in pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry and this stuff works magic.  </li>
            <li>This is a large jar of mango butter, so you have plenty to experiment with.</li>
            <li>I had never used any pure butter like this before.</li>
            <li>It is pure and no scent just like is says.</li>
            <li>This mango butter blends beautifully with Ivory Raw Shea butter (ordered from Amazon 3lbs for only $7)</li>
            <li>Definitely a chap stick substitute and the jar is huge.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so fast</li>
            <li>Very displeased and wI&#x27;ll NOT be buying from Aspen again.</li>
            <li>I have used it straight too</li>
            <li>I did put some on my hair very shiny ,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a very generously sized 16 oz tub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amused that everything melted but not so much having to get the grease of each item.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this brand and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Even with the consistency, it melts and absorbs fast onto the scalp, hair, and skin.  </li>
            <li>Really does work well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really lather this stuff on, so</li>
            <li>I have been making my own body butter at home and wanted to try something that did not have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>Then I went back and read the full description</li>
            <li>I rub the butter on my calluses, then dremel them down, then finish off with more butter.  </li>
            <li>Finding a new container for the mango butter isn&#x27;t what I planned for!</li>
            <li>This butter is super crumbly and gritty.</li>
            <li>I have bad eczema and this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>In fact, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be soft enough to use as a body moisturizer because of how solid it appeared.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun trying different recipes for body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li>specially if you have a dry skin like me</li>
            <li>A huge plus was my dry dish cleaning hands were so soft from using this on my sunburn.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove from the container, and melts into a liquid easily in my double boiler or simply between my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works as a UA/UVB protectant because my skin has become very sensitive to direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>Third, despite the consistency, it absorbs right away into the skin and hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li>It came in little compacted solid grains of mango butter, kind of like the texture of couscous.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and always wear flipflops</li>
            <li>im new to mango butter</li>
            <li>The consistency seems strange at first but even using it straight</li>
            <li>The mango butter has a unique texture that is very hard to the touch, but goes on quite smooth after it is warmed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>and it made my heels very soft</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and melts well when heated.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel VERY soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Elbows are now soft like a baby&#x27;s hiney!</li>
            <li>Just warm a little between your fingers so that it liquefies and apply wherever you have dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>The description says its not scented but mine clearly has a scent.</li>
            <li>natural treatment for the skin</li>
            <li>I have been a long time user of coconut oil, and this was my first purchase of mango butter.</li>
            <li>It absorbs leaving my skin soft but not greasy by morning.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s never happened for me before in my 5 year natural hair journey so far.</li>
            <li>I always read customer reviews and decided that since I use them so much and rely on them for my purchases I needed to start giving my opinion back.</li>
            <li>all natural</li>
            <li>So far I have used on my cracked heels and it has help a lot.</li>
            <li>I can say, that it makes a good hard soap in combination of other oils.</li>
            <li>I used it raw on my hands out of the generous 16 ounce jar and it is incredibly smooth leaving the skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It is smooth raw, has some grit.</li>
            <li>I used it right out of the jar, but after looking at other reviews, wanted to try whipping it.</li>
            <li>Great as a base for home made lotions, but I use it straight after liquefying it in my hands.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this container is going to last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and never had a problem so that is definitely a plus for me.</li>
            <li>I did expect there to be a mango scent on first thought of the name, but I see the benefits of mixing it unscented with other products.  </li>
            <li>Very Buttery...does the trick on dry chapped hands!</li>
            <li>I keep using it as long as I&#x27;m busy busy</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as solid as Shea Butter, but isn&#x27;t exactly soft either..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it as a moisturizer so far</li>
            <li>I really like the texture as its not grainy like some other butters.</li>
            <li>Even using it plain right out of the jar</li>
            <li>so I was a little taken aback when I first opened the jar.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight gritty texture on first feel.  </li>
            <li>I have type 4b kinky natural hair, that always used to feel dry and would break with the slightest manipulation.  </li>

            <li> I immediately took notice of how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>

            <li> Love, love this stuff!</li>

            <li> It smells like a very very light coco butter.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and looks like I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the lid was cracked and product unsealed when I received mine</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it very much since the day I bought until now</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my soap making.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin and just an all over product.  </li>
            <li> really great for dry skin- knees, elbows, feet.. etc.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a great smell, but there was no greasy or oily feeling, and it soaked right into my skin.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is unscented, so I can use as much as I&#x27;d like without the worry of smelling &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; around others.</li>
            <li> Love this mango butter, leaves your skin feeling very moisturized</li>
            <li> Love the butter,  Skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> There is a full pound of Mango Butter solids in one container.</li>
            <li> Not bad to be unusable (2/10 on the scale)</li>
            <li> It melts with body heat into a beautiful oil and a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m really loving the consistency!</li>
            <li> Mango Butter works great on my face and the aged spots on my hands!</li>
            <li> so I will definitely find many more uses.  </li>
            <li> You gain a loyal customer</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s scent free --</li>
            <li> Made up a whipped butter last night!!!,,,, So far so good, my hair looks very mosturized!! :)</li>
            <li> but I found that it really was a bit like butter and that it could be rubbed onto your skin fairly easily.</li>
            <li> I melted and mixed this with olive oil and coconut oil for an amazing body cream.</li>
            <li> I love natural things like this because I can even put it on my baby.</li>
            <li> but if you warm it up with your hands it will soften enough for you to rub.</li>
            <li> I have so far use so many lotions and creams,  but this product beat them all.  </li>
            <li> Packaging is exactly as shown, came full up to the rim.</li>
            <li> LOVE how it leaves my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love natural things.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid at room temperature, but melts really nicely when rubbed in your hands and on your skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbed well.  </li>
            <li> It emulsifies in my hands super easily and keeps my hair VERY VERY soft and moisturised.  </li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I was expecting something that was the consistency of pudding, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the container and found it filled to the top of the jar with something a bit more solid.</li>
            <li> Also great for dry hair ends and very natural</li>
            <li> it soaks right into my skin and has no greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> My preference is right from the jar.  </li>
            <li> The warmth of body temperature makes it very easy to spread across the skin, but because of it&#x27;s consistency, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and deeply moisturizes even the driest skin.</li>
            <li> WaaaaLaaaa, great looking feet and the dry areas are now very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick,  luscious and works best mixed with an oil to rub on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a large amount of residue.</li>
            <li> Smooth and natural feeling on freshly shaved legs--</li>
            <li> I especially like the level of customer service from your initial note to me, saying that you would work with me until I was happy.</li>
            <li> The Mango Butter came very fast.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using mango butter</li>
            <li> It has a higher melting point like coconut oil so as soon as you take it out the heat of your hands starts to melt the product.</li>
            <li> It is VERY moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> and it is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter itself was helping, but adding mango has made is pretty stellar.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it especially after a shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and essential oils but this works much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the lotion recipe you provided!</li>
            <li> (I love cocoa butter but the scent overpowers the essential oils).</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased essential oils that also have soo many benefits and can mix it easily with them for scent.</li>
            <li> And thanks for the very fast service, and forgive my tardiness in leaving feedback..</li>
            <li> It soaks in pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry and this stuff works magic.  </li>
            <li> This is a large jar of mango butter, so you have plenty to experiment with.</li>
            <li> I had never used any pure butter like this before.</li>
            <li> It is pure and no scent just like is says.</li>
            <li> This mango butter blends beautifully with Ivory Raw Shea butter (ordered from Amazon 3lbs for only $7)</li>
            <li> Definitely a chap stick substitute and the jar is huge.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so fast</li>
            <li> Very displeased and wI&#x27;ll NOT be buying from Aspen again.</li>
            <li> I have used it straight too</li>
            <li> I did put some on my hair very shiny ,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a very generously sized 16 oz tub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amused that everything melted but not so much having to get the grease of each item.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this brand and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Even with the consistency, it melts and absorbs fast onto the scalp, hair, and skin.  </li>
            <li> Really does work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really lather this stuff on, so</li>
            <li> I have been making my own body butter at home and wanted to try something that did not have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Then I went back and read the full description</li>
            <li> I rub the butter on my calluses, then dremel them down, then finish off with more butter.  </li>
            <li> Finding a new container for the mango butter isn&#x27;t what I planned for!</li>
            <li> This butter is super crumbly and gritty.</li>
            <li> I have bad eczema and this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> In fact, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be soft enough to use as a body moisturizer because of how solid it appeared.</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun trying different recipes for body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> specially if you have a dry skin like me</li>
            <li> A huge plus was my dry dish cleaning hands were so soft from using this on my sunburn.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove from the container, and melts into a liquid easily in my double boiler or simply between my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works as a UA/UVB protectant because my skin has become very sensitive to direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> Third, despite the consistency, it absorbs right away into the skin and hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li> It came in little compacted solid grains of mango butter, kind of like the texture of couscous.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and always wear flipflops</li>
            <li> im new to mango butter</li>
            <li> The consistency seems strange at first but even using it straight</li>
            <li> The mango butter has a unique texture that is very hard to the touch, but goes on quite smooth after it is warmed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> and it made my heels very soft</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and melts well when heated.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel VERY soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Elbows are now soft like a baby&#x27;s hiney!</li>
            <li> Just warm a little between your fingers so that it liquefies and apply wherever you have dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> The description says its not scented but mine clearly has a scent.</li>
            <li> natural treatment for the skin</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of coconut oil, and this was my first purchase of mango butter.</li>
            <li> It absorbs leaving my skin soft but not greasy by morning.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s never happened for me before in my 5 year natural hair journey so far.</li>
            <li> I always read customer reviews and decided that since I use them so much and rely on them for my purchases I needed to start giving my opinion back.</li>
            <li> all natural</li>
            <li> So far I have used on my cracked heels and it has help a lot.</li>
            <li> I can say, that it makes a good hard soap in combination of other oils.</li>
            <li> I used it raw on my hands out of the generous 16 ounce jar and it is incredibly smooth leaving the skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It is smooth raw, has some grit.</li>
            <li> I used it right out of the jar, but after looking at other reviews, wanted to try whipping it.</li>
            <li> Great as a base for home made lotions, but I use it straight after liquefying it in my hands.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this container is going to last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and never had a problem so that is definitely a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I did expect there to be a mango scent on first thought of the name, but I see the benefits of mixing it unscented with other products.  </li>
            <li> Very Buttery...does the trick on dry chapped hands!</li>
            <li> I keep using it as long as I&#x27;m busy busy</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as solid as Shea Butter, but isn&#x27;t exactly soft either..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a moisturizer so far</li>
            <li> I really like the texture as its not grainy like some other butters.</li>
            <li> Even using it plain right out of the jar</li>
            <li> so I was a little taken aback when I first opened the jar.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight gritty texture on first feel.  </li>
            <li> I have type 4b kinky natural hair, that always used to feel dry and would break with the slightest manipulation.  </li>
            <li> I plan on researching other ways I can use this Mango Butter, but my elbows definitely have never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t  intrude on other products or irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency seems weird at first but even using it straight</li>
            <li> Texture was dry and gritty.</li>
            <li> Neutral smell, easily absorbed and the size will last at least a month even with everyday use.</li>
            <li> This makes me question how long the product has been sitting around.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a moisturiser in my hair, both on wash day (on wet hair), and mid week (on dry hair).  </li>
            <li> I need something that truly helps penetrate my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my legs and my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> I melt this with coconut butter to make sugar scrub for my dry legs in the winter.</li>
            <li> only that I have a dark spots in my skin and 3-4 times using it...</li>
            <li> I have used it on my feet which become very dry from running around barefoot in the summer</li>
            <li> My cuticles are not dry anymore and no more dry itchy dry skin for me.  </li>
            <li> It is a little gritty.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a second round of this mango butter.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say how it works in soap yet, as it is still drying for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Little grains of mango butter were all over my other items shipped in the same box.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry due to all the paperwork I do</li>
            <li> Used with 1 cup raw Shea butter, 1/2 cup mango butter, 3 tbs olive oil and 40 drops of gardenia essential oil.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t understand how this is supposed to be used, but it confuses me that it is so hard/ dry and is hard to get out of the container to actually put on my body.</li>
            <li> so it I can layer it with other scents.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying its other uses.  </li>
            <li> You need to work a little to make it all melt or you will have little tiny hard pieces of mango butter left over.</li>
            <li> There was some slight leakage in shipping as it was shipped with a couple of other items I ordered and the bottom of the box was soaked with the oil in the butter, but there was no damage.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only negative.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, my lips are soft and subtle and the lines are GONE!</li>
            <li> I usually use Shea Butter, but it takes a lot of essential oils to mask the weird scent that natural Shea Butter has.</li>
            <li> The butter does have a slight cocoa butter like scent, but it disappears once you apply it to your face, body or hair.</li>
            <li> There is also a slight odor like the product is on its way to turning rancid.</li>
            <li> I find that it does have a slight scent although not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I took off two stars because of the damage and mess during shipping.</li>
            <li> On another note, I combined this with my shea butter and a little bit of lavender to make a hand cream for my eczema that I have on my hands.</li>
            <li> However, what I noticed after just a few seconds of scooping a bit of the mango butter into my hand, was that it began to soften and melt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that that is caused from not melting it down correctly; not sure if thats the case for this mango butter or not.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it would be bogged down and flat, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> the those dark spots are slowly gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> broken cap, unsealed ,dry cream</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about these things, but I just received my jar today and already used it on entire body and hair.</li>
            <li> The butter is a bit hard</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to make the lotion as the mango butter is so hard I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> At least place the tub of butter in a plastic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this when I received it but was very disappointed when I opened the jar.</li>
            <li> received the package today to find both the mango butters I ordered with broken lids and seals they were leaking into the box ...</li>
            <li> If the jar hadn&#x27;t broken apart during shipping, I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The butter is very hard and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is not as hard as shea butter or cold coconut oil</li>
            <li> hand you when you buy their product, but if you&#x27;re unhappy they act like it&#x27;s a hassle to give you what you want.</li>
            <li> No scent or bad taste when used on the lips.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was already a fan of coconut oil and now I am sold on mango butter!  I have mixed it with coconut oil and Shea butter (the company sent me a great recipe) and I have even used it by itself. The consistency seems weird at first but even using it straight it moisturizies without feeling greasy or sticky. I love natural things like this because I can even put it on my baby.</li>
            <li> Smooth and natural feeling on freshly shaved legs--</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, but upon receiving it, I opened it up an used it on my hands. My hands get very dry due to all the paperwork I do so I moisturize them quite often. I read that people use it on their body so I decided to use it, and man do my hands feel great. Awesome product,I am sure my wife will love it. The butter is a bit hard but if you warm it up with your hands it will soften enough for you to rub.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the lid was cracked and product unsealed when I received mine</li>
            <li> This is very good quality mango butter. I use it for moisturizing my skin and it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, I love it.</li>
            <li> The Mango butter is scent free and unrefined, but it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I used it raw on my hands out of the generous 16 ounce jar and it is incredibly smooth leaving the skin soft without feeling greasy. I&#x27;m going to use it as an all body moisturizer and in my hair next! This is my first time using mango butter and  I love it!</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I was expecting something that was the consistency of pudding, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the container and found it filled to the top of the jar with something a bit more solid. In fact, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be soft enough to use as a body moisturizer because of how solid it appeared. However, what I noticed after just a few seconds of scooping a bit of the mango butter into my hand, was that it began to soften and melt. The warmth of body temperature makes it very easy to spread across the skin, but because of it&#x27;s consistency, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and deeply moisturizes even the driest skin. I also love that it is unscented, so I can use as much as I&#x27;d like without the worry of smelling &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; around others. A little bit of this goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure this container is going to last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this. I stopped using drugstore and brand named lotions because they weren&#x27;t doing the job! I need something that truly helps penetrate my dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. i thought it would smell better then Shea or like actually mango but it doesn&#x27;t. but when you mix it with coconut oil and some vitamin e...etc it smells like cookies!!</li>
            <li> This mango butter is interesting! I&#x27;ve never tried another moisturizer like it. It is not as hard as shea butter or cold coconut oil but kind of in between. It has a higher melting point like coconut oil so as soon as you take it out the heat of your hands starts to melt the product. It is a little gritty. You need to work a little to make it all melt or you will have little tiny hard pieces of mango butter left over. It is VERY moisturizing! I love using it on my feet!&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> Good product will buy it again</li>
            <li> Received this today. It is a good sized jar. I did expect that it would smell like Mango but it does not. That&#x27;s my only negative. It smells a lot like Shea Butter and has that same melty texture. It feels great on and moisture immediately. I will keep this around. I do love Mango!</li>
            <li> going o use in my homemade soaps can&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> This mango butter is the best moisturizer! I use it on my hair and skin. It is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The perfect butter for body creams , I&#x27;m in love and so are family and friends</li>
            <li> Made up a whipped butter last night!!!,,,, So far so good, my hair looks very mosturized!! :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! So moisturizing,great for making DIY Body Butters!!!Aspen Naturals Cocoa Butter is amazing as well!!! Try them both!Excellent Quality!</li>
            <li> The mango butter has a unique texture that is very hard to the touch, but goes on quite smooth after it is warmed into the skin.  It has a slight gritty texture on first feel.  I have used it on my feet which become very dry from running around barefoot in the summer and it made my heels very soft which was a plus for me.  I did expect there to be a mango scent on first thought of the name, but I see the benefits of mixing it unscented with other products.  There was some slight leakage in shipping as it was shipped with a couple of other items I ordered and the bottom of the box was soaked with the oil in the butter, but there was no damage.  The lid did not break, but it looked like the leakage may have come from swelling in transit.  Perhaps a plastic outer bag would remedy the situation.  Overall a recommended product.</li>
            <li> Good quality mango butter</li>
            <li> Excellent Moisturizer for Skin and Hair I&#x27;m enjoying it very much since the day I bought until now I keep using it as long as I&#x27;m busy busy I have a lot of beauty product but this one works very good a couple of time using it you will see the huge changes on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural treatment for the skin specially if you have a dry skin like me this is really good and help me out for my problem .&lt;br /&gt;Not only that I have a dark spots in my skin and 3-4 times using it... anyway I apply this every twice a week only but only that and it&#x27;s so fast the those dark spots are slowly gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!</li>
            <li> Love the Mango Butter...so many uses for this!!</li>
            <li> Smelled like it had cocoa butter in with it .</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about these things, but I just received my jar today and already used it on entire body and hair. I was scared when I used it on my hair, I thought it would be bogged down and flat, but I was wrong. My hair is beautiful, shiny, and soft. I&#x27;m an aging woman and I have fine lines around my lips so I used it on my lips (like a chapstick) and on those lines around my lips. To my surprise, my lips are soft and subtle and the lines are GONE! I live in Florida and always wear flipflops so it is important that my feet look good. WaaaaLaaaa, great looking feet and the dry areas are now very soft and pretty. I also used it on my legs and my dry elbows. Elbows are now soft like a baby&#x27;s hiney! I will never use anything else!!! I used it right out of the jar, but after looking at other reviews, wanted to try whipping it. I whipped it and added some Jasmine scent to it, put it in another jar I had and now I have the best of both worlds. Some scented and some unscented that I will use in my hair. I love love love it and so happy I bought it. Customer service is very nice and courteous and shipping was lightning fast!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of coconut oil, and this was my first purchase of mango butter. I have to say I am sold on this product! I am having so much fun trying different recipes for body butters and lotions. This is a large jar of mango butter, so you have plenty to experiment with. It has a nice smooth texture and no odor. Even using it plain right out of the jar my skin just soaks it up, and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily like coconut oil does. Aspen Naturals has wonderful customer service too!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price for evaluation and review, but this in no way sways my opinion of this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Before I was given the chance to try this product out I have never heard of it. Let me tell you, this is one of the best butters I have ever used. Not only does it have a great smell, but there was no greasy or oily feeling, and it soaked right into my skin. I plan on researching other ways I can use this Mango Butter, but my elbows definitely have never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Love it cant wait to make my own scented lotions but for now works great all by itself!</li>
            <li> Love this!  So many uses!</li>
            <li> Lid was cracked and the safety seal had been removed. Very displeased and wI&#x27;ll NOT be buying from Aspen again.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin and just an all over product.  My cuticles are not dry anymore and no more dry itchy dry skin for me.  Also great for dry hair ends and very natural so I will definitely find many more uses.  Also great for any skin type.  My skin is very sensitive and never had a problem so that is definitely a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these. they are high quality and they Smell Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Use it for my lip balms in place of shea butter.</li>
            <li> Good butter.  Note that it does not smell like mango because this comes from the seed! I make my own skin care products and I have been wanting to try mango butter. It&#x27;s thick,  luscious and works best mixed with an oil to rub on smoothly. The only thing about it though is that it has a tiny bit of a chemical odour. Not bad to be unusable (2/10 on the scale) but it&#x27;s enough to probably make me try another mango butter. Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this when I received it but was very disappointed when I opened the jar. The &amp;#34;sealed for your protection&amp;#34; seal was not sealed and the product had dirt in it and looked like it had been used.</li>
            <li> Made some amazing lip balm with this!!</li>
            <li> Premium quality coco butter. Great as a base for home made lotions, but I use it straight after liquefying it in my hands. Straight it is a heavy moisturizer so I use it after bathing and before I crawl into bed. It absorbs leaving my skin soft but not greasy by morning.</li>
            <li> Great product... There are so many ways to utilize it...</li>
            <li> Tha Mango Butter  is  very nice and really nourish my skin.My skin is so smooth,soft and silky.I love it! TThank you for the recipe . I will not be without  my Mango Butter!</li>
            <li> The butter is very hard and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff! I use it in all of my homemade products. I&#x27;m not a fan of Shea butter and was struggling to find something else. This stuff is amazing! I have used it straight too and it made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Will order this again. This mango butter blends beautifully with Ivory Raw Shea butter (ordered from Amazon 3lbs for only $7) I used 1 cup of MB to 1/2 cup of SB using a ninja blender then blend 1/4 cup of coconut oil. PLEASE NOTE YOU DO NOT NEED TO MELT EITHER BUTTER ! A good quality butter will blended effortlessly. Add 15 drops of jasmine oil and 7 drops of lavender oil. This came out creamy, rich and smells so good. See pic below.</li>
            <li> I really love this mango butter.  It is very smooth and easy to apply to skin or hair.  It does not have a scent so it doesn&#x27;t  intrude on other products or irritate my sensitive skin.  I will continue to purchase products from this seller</li>
            <li> This is the best product in the market I have ever use. I have bad eczema and this is a wonderful product. I have so far use so many lotions and creams,  but this product beat them all.  The heel on my foot is  smooth again and my skin is softer. You gain a loyal customer</li>
            <li> I love this mango butter!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! I&#x27;m going to use it to make homemade lip treatment!</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could whip up my own hair &amp; body butters. The description says its not scented but mine clearly has a scent. It smells like a very very light coco butter. I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and looks like I&#x27;m glowing. So far so good. I did put some on my hair very shiny ,  you do have to warm it up with your hands.</li>
            <li> Aspen Naturals is a wonderful company to deal with.  The Mango Butter came very fast.  Had an issue and they took care of it immediately.  The actual product is great. Just warm a little between your fingers so that it liquefies and apply wherever you have dry skin issues. No scent or bad taste when used on the lips.  Haven&#x27;t tried making anything else with it like lotion or soap but I&#x27;m sure it rocks!</li>
            <li> This was received well sealed.  The butter is solid but melts almost instantly when you apply it to your skin.  It makes your skin feel very soft.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Texture was dry and gritty. It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> My favorite butter to use in my body butter is mango butter..it soaks right into my skin and has no greasy after feel.I love that mango butter doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it so it I can layer it with other scents.This brand is great it&#x27;s the first time ive used it and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I didn&#x27;t read the description well so I was a little taken aback when I first opened the jar.  Then I went back and read the full description and it is exactly as described.  I kind of wish that it did have a bit of mango scent, but that being said.  I love this product for all the calluses on my hands from CrossFit.  I rub the butter on my calluses, then dremel them down, then finish off with more butter.  My calluses are staying smooth and I am not having hand rips.</li>
            <li> This is a great butter to use for DIY lotions. It&#x27;s very soft and melts well when heated. It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fantastic mango butter! I purchased this because I LOVE making bath and body products at home. I&#x27;ve also come to notice that some of THE best recipes for bath and body products call for mango butter. I was very interested in seeing how this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a very generously sized 16 oz tub. I immediately took notice of how nice it smells. I usually use Shea Butter, but it takes a lot of essential oils to mask the weird scent that natural Shea Butter has. This mango butter on the other hand, smells awesome! It isn&#x27;t as solid as Shea Butter, but isn&#x27;t exactly soft either.. It is easy to remove from the container, and melts into a liquid easily in my double boiler or simply between my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it outright and it makes my skin feel VERY soft and hydrated. I made bath fizzes with it, and a VERY nice whipped body butter. I&#x27;m sooo happy with this mango butter! I can&#x27;t wait to try this to make more things. Very pleased with this purchase. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I am no mango butter expert but it seems like good stuff. I made lotion with it. Love how it turned out. Would and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t understand how this is supposed to be used, but it confuses me that it is so hard/ dry and is hard to get out of the container to actually put on my body.</li>
            <li> Packaging is exactly as shown, came full up to the rim. Smell is very, very mild. LOVE how it leaves my skin soft but not greasy. It melts when rubbing it between my palms. Its like in between shea butter and coconut oil. Cant wait to experiment with it.</li>
            <li> I melt this with coconut butter to make sugar scrub for my dry legs in the winter. It works great.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, jar arrived cracked but they offered to send a replacement at no cost. Product itself was undamaged. Going to be good for making homemade body butter!</li>
            <li> Pretty impressed with this stuff.  I use it as a moisturizer and my skin looks great.  Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> broken cap, unsealed ,dry cream</li>
            <li> I really like the texture as its not grainy like some other butters. I also like that there is virtually no smell to this. I&#x27;ve only used it as a moisturizer so far and it works great. I think it&#x27;s at a great price point for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, will probably order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to make of this product. It almost seemed crystallized but I found that it really was a bit like butter and that it could be rubbed onto your skin fairly easily. Definitely a chap stick substitute and the jar is huge. I can see crafters who make soap and beauty products putting this to good use too.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to make the lotion as the mango butter is so hard I can&#x27;t use it. I wish it had come creamy, like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Love this mango butter, leaves your skin feeling very moisturized</li>
            <li> Neutral smell, easily absorbed and the size will last at least a month even with everyday use.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!! I used it after being sunburned and kid you not my skin was healed in 2 days. No burning, cracking or peeling. A huge plus was my dry dish cleaning hands were so soft from using this on my sunburn. Now I use it all over. I love that it has NO scent.</li>
            <li> The product is good. It helped make a great body butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a suggestion. I give it a 3.5 star rating because the packaging was not airtight. In a time when tempatures are in the upper 90s. I would recommend having airthight packaging. It just happened to reach 100 on the day this package arrived, 113 heat index.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything in the box melted. Shea butter, cocoa butter etc. The others were in airtight sealed packaging. This mango butter is the one that leaked in the box and coated everything. It was just enough to cause a great mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amused that everything melted but not so much having to get the grease of each item.</li>
            <li> This made an awesome natural and pure addition to our homemade chapstick!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Packaged well and a great product to use for body butters. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so smooth! Especially my lips. I recommend. I am mixed and have no problems with this product. It also makes your hair grow! I will be buying a second round of this mango butter.  :)</li>
            <li> received the package today to find both the mango butters I ordered with broken lids and seals they were leaking into the box ...</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own skin care items and love it! It whipped up very nicely with my coconut oil and works wonders on your skin. I highly suggest this brand and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I am sooooo  150% happy with this product.  I have type 4b kinky natural hair, that always used to feel dry and would break with the slightest manipulation.  I use this product as a moisturiser in my hair, both on wash day (on wet hair), and mid week (on dry hair).  It emulsifies in my hands super easily and keeps my hair VERY VERY soft and moisturised.  I am really happy with this because shea butter just wasn&#x27;t doing it for my hair.  With mango butter my hair stays moisturised and soft, with good elasticity for two weeks!  That&#x27;s never happened for me before in my 5 year natural hair journey so far.</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of coconut oil and now I am sold on mango butter! I have mixed it with coconut oil and Shea butter (the company sent me a great recipe) and I have even used it by itself. The consistency seems strange at first but even using it straight it moisturizies without feeling greasy or sticky. I love natural things.  It makes my dry hands and feet feel awesome.</li>
            <li> This mango butter is very nice. I will be mixing it with zinc oxide to make a sunscreen for the summer. In the meantime, I will also use it on my skin to soften and help the eczema and psoriasis spots on my body. Good stuff. By the way, I received my product with the lid sealed and intact.</li>
            <li> feels great! now to add scents!</li>
            <li> I use this straight out the jar everyday I leave my house. This really works as a UA/UVB protectant because my skin has become very sensitive to direct sunlight. The butter does have a slight cocoa butter like scent, but it disappears once you apply it to your face, body or hair. Would definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Used with 1 cup raw Shea butter, 1/2 cup mango butter, 3 tbs olive oil and 40 drops of gardenia essential oil. Put it in my ninja and it&#x27;s heavenly for my growing baby belly!</li>
            <li> Love the butter,  Skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d my mango butter today. I&#x27;ve been out of mango butter for about two weeks, so I was very glad to get it. It is really a great product.  I like the size of and the feel of your product. I especially like the level of customer service from your initial note to me, saying that you would work with me until I was happy. That made an impression on me, because some companies smile and glad hand you when you buy their product, but if you&#x27;re unhappy they act like it&#x27;s a hassle to give you what you want. Thanks. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Using it to make body butter.</li>
            <li> This butter is super crumbly and gritty. I&#x27;ve read that that is caused from not melting it down correctly; not sure if thats the case for this mango butter or not.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Container opened and spilled 😡😡</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my soap making. I cannot say how it works in soap yet, as it is still drying for the next few weeks. I can say, that it makes a good hard soap in combination of other oils. On another note, I combined this with my shea butter and a little bit of lavender to make a hand cream for my eczema that I have on my hands. Remarkable difference. The shea butter itself was helping, but adding mango has made is pretty stellar. It is non-greasy, very moisturizing. Even my boyfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use my mango butter!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Love the texture!</li>
            <li> So many benefits of using mango butter, I had to give this a try.  I love the versatility of this product, and use it all over for hair and skin.  Even with the consistency, it melts and absorbs fast onto the scalp, hair, and skin.  I especially like it on the lips.  This mango butter is scent free so it can be use by women, children, and  men alike.  That doesn&#x27;t stop one from adding their own flavoring/scent and making a mixture if they so choose.  My preference is right from the jar.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Before I even removed the top I could smell the creamy goodness. There is a full pound of Mango Butter solids in one container.</li>
            <li> So moisturizing! I love the feel of it especially after a shower!</li>
            <li> When my mango butter arrived, the lid was totally shattered and separate from the jar. Little grains of mango butter were all over my other items shipped in the same box. This could have been a disaster if the box had been in warm temps! Packaging could use A LOT of improvement. At least place the tub of butter in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mango butter itself is very nice. It came in little compacted solid grains of mango butter, kind of like the texture of couscous. It&#x27;s solid at room temperature, but melts really nicely when rubbed in your hands and on your skin. Good quality with no noticable scent. I took off two stars because of the damage and mess during shipping. Finding a new container for the mango butter isn&#x27;t what I planned for! If the jar hadn&#x27;t broken apart during shipping, I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Absorbed well.  Can be used for anything like hair conditioner body lotion and sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love this product! My family has eczema and this has been a life saver! I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and essential oils but this works much better. I look forward to trying its other uses.  Still loving this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Need some more recipes for it Though. Really does work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Mango Butter works great on my face and the aged spots on my hands! Thank You</li>
            <li> Loved this! Very Buttery...does the trick on dry chapped hands!</li>
            <li> I melted and mixed this with olive oil and coconut oil for an amazing body cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice mango butter. Works great in my DIY lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make homemade whipped body butter with. It is perfect for what I was needing. It soaks in pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love that Amazon always has very true to descriptions.. I never worry about am I getting what I think I am getting. I always read customer reviews and decided that since I use them so much and rely on them for my purchases I needed to start giving my opinion back. I had never used any pure butter like this before. It is pure and no scent just like is says. I had recently purchased essential oils that also have soo many benefits and can mix it easily with them for scent. The best more immediate use of this product is the moisturizing benefit.. really great for dry skin- knees, elbows, feet.. etc. Another product type that has soo many uses you can&#x27;t go wrong.. all natural so you know its safe. I have read so many people use it for soaps, chap stick etc.</li>
            <li> i like it smells, it keep my elbows and knees smooth. definitely recommends the product</li>
            <li> So far I have used on my cracked heels and it has help a lot.</li>
            <li> im new to mango butter but I love this. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a large amount of residue. It melts with body heat into a beautiful oil and a little goes a long way, I&#x27;m really loving the consistency! My only complaints are the container arrived leaking and was covered in melted butter. There is also a slight odor like the product is on its way to turning rancid. This makes me question how long the product has been sitting around.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Thanks for the lotion recipe you provided! Will order again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I have been making my own body butter at home and wanted to try something that did not have a heavy scent. (I love cocoa butter but the scent overpowers the essential oils). Mango butter has an interesting texture. It is smooth raw, has some grit. I find that it does have a slight scent although not overpowering. It does not absorb as well as cocoa butter, feels more greasy. Its ok.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I use a daily regime of coconut butter on my hair and skin and it&#x27;s suited me well before, but this has changed my perspective entirely. First, it&#x27;s scent free -- I really lather this stuff on, so having it scent free is a HUGE plus. Now I don&#x27;t have to walk out of my house smelling like I just rolled around in a tub of coconuts (or mangos.) Second, the consistency is perfect: rich and creamy. Third, despite the consistency, it absorbs right away into the skin and hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li> Had not used this in the pat, but wanted to try it. It is the AAA alternative we have been searching for. And thanks for the very fast service, and forgive my tardiness in leaving feedback..</li>
            <li> Smells great... feels great...</li>
            <li> Love love love  mango butter!!!! This product is great</li>
            <li> Love mango butter!  I combined shea butter, mango butter, jojoba, and coconut oil together and it is heavenly!  My skin is so dry and this stuff works magic.  I love making my own body butters that I know exactly what the ingredients are.  No chemicals!!</li>
