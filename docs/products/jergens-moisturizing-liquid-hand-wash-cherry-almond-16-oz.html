            <li>Same, great product that we&#x27;ve used for years!</li>

            <li>so I am glad you have it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon carries this product.</li>
            <li>It smells good, feels soft and also washes hands good, ...</li>
            <li>love the feel &amp; the scent...</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s saying something...:)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>HAVE USED IT MANY TIMES, LOVE THE FRAGRANCE AND CONSISTANCY.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this soap.  </li>
            <li>For my niece she will wash her hands as often as possible just for the delightful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the smell.</li>
            <li>Clean soft hands and wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li>Have used this product before and think that it is the best product out there particularly with the scent that it offers.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it leaves your hands soft and smooth!!  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t remember if it did a good job of keeping hands from feeling dry after use, but I THINK it was good at keeping the hands soft and supple.</li>
            <li>SO WHY NOT BUY IT FOR HER AND ENJOY FOR HER AND ME.</li>
            <li>This 21 oz size is so much more economical than the 15 oz refills offered elsewhere, or the 7.5 oz dispenser bottles.</li>
            <li>But using this soap no matter how often I wash my hands stay smooth.</li>
            <li>AND HE SKIN IS SO SOFT AND SMELLS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS LEAVES ME FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>To my experience, I like this hand wash lotion over other more popular kinds.</li>
            <li>I love the cherry almond scent - this is the only hand soap that has it right.</li>
            <li>This has the old familiar cherry almond scent and is an economical size.  </li>
            <li>great product,have used it for years and now hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, the consistency is gentle, Thank you for offering it online.</li>
            <li>Makes hands soft and the smell is so sweet and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is the greatest and I am so disappointed that it is no longer readily available.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this soap and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love the traditional Jergens Lotion scent of this Jergens Hand Wash liquid soap, and it leaves my hands soft.</li>
            <li>I had to give away new dish towels because my cracked fingertips stuck to the loops like Velcro.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft as silk!</li>
            <li>My hands are super sensitive to all of the anti-bacterial ingredients in other soaps.  </li>
            <li>Soft and comfy on hands.  </li>
            <li>the cherry almond fragrance, leaves hands soft</li>
            <li>This soap is great for anyone who Does Not want to get sick this season, but wants to have soft hands, as well.</li>

I loved the smell then and still love it today!  Everytime I smell it, it reminds me of many happy days with her.  I would have given this product a 5 star rating except I received the product with part of the product all over the inside of the box.  The packing was insufficient to protect the product during shipping. One of the caps on one of the bottle shifted loose and the contents leaked out.  Perhaps the shipper can fix this problem in any future shipments..</li>

I came home and went on the internet and ordered my friend 3 bottles for her birthday.  She was so  thankful thatI had found this winderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stocking up on this handsoap for years. I cannot find it on the shelves in the stores nearby, and always turn to Amazon to order it. It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
