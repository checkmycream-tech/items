            <li>I also love the amount your get for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and everything... could be thicker formula</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it feels on my skins, that is why I bought 4 bottles, so I don&#x27;t have to run around and looks for this item.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database gives this lotion a perfect score of 0, the lowest possible health hazard.</li>
            <li>They give the coconut &amp; lemon scent a 2, which is better.  </li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to find something a bit more man scented that might be better for me.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman who doesn&#x27;t like most flowery, cloying scents, so this is almost-perfect.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good also.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing as easy as most lotions.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and the scent is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, kind of outdoorsy smell which I really enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively mild and healthier than most lotions, but it does have some troubling ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an awesome scent - a little like cologne but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>light on the skin, which I like,</li>
            <li>For 32 oz and a 0 EWG rating, the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill</li>
            <li>This is very light moisturizer which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This lotion has taken the place of so many products in so little space and money; I bet it&#x27;s even a great hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lady who loves simplifying ingredients and routines, maximizing profits, great lotion, and masculine scents, and I can really say this product has it all.</li>
            <li>Its been nice being able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t get the wife&#x27;s allergies fired up.i think I&#x27;ve got my final solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a thicker more moisturizing lotion without the aforementioned hazardous additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, in fact it&#x27;s very light and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>I loved the other scent of this lotion (the lemon one), but wanted something a bit more &amp;#34;mannish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Great product I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>A very nice lotion for dry climates.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely but leaves skin hydrated, soft, and supple.</li>
            <li>The product was damaged during the shipping process and the company &amp;#34;Everyone&amp;#34; took full responsibility for the damage.</li>
            <li>Works wonders for cooking and really makes my skin look twice as healthy.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell is not too overpowering and it wears off quickly, which I also like.</li>
            <li>for the lotion itself, it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s not runny and dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>lotion itself is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Wonderful rich smell, subtle citrus and cedar aroma is wonderfully fresh and pure, not invasive!</li>
            <li>It smells very woodsy, and is much more manly than other lotions which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion by far.  </li>
            <li>The fact it&#x27;s all natural as far as I can tell is good.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant, albeit odd fragrance when applying the lotion and the aroma wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that EO is trying to use as many natural ingredients as possible, and at the same time is honest in their practices by not labeling it organic.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very strong fragrance and is definitely not heavy-duty.</li>
            <li>We are really pleased with this lotion for the whole family - myself, my husband, and our 2 year old.  </li>
            <li>I mist be very unlucky as the both times I have received the lotion the top was smashed.. maybe the lid could be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Cedar scent doesn&#x27;t last long but still very nice</li>
            <li>I recommend highly: this combination of health, price and effectiveness are rare.  </li>
            <li>Its been several weeks, and i am incident free), and my wife has even smelled my arm right after i put it on, and didn&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself works very well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to moisture all that much</li>
            <li>i really like this coming from a man</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasing and it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like cedar or citrus... or anything in particular.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>A friend complimented me on my perfume, when I wasn&#x27;t even wearing any, and later confirmed it was the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>and this really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this lotion.</li>
            <li>It becomes too much for me to wear all day.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Such a fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li>plus is how much lotion you get for your money.</li>
            <li>The coconut oil is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large amount for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I love the product other than the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more manly - my wife will stick with the other lemon</li>
            <li>that* strong, and it seems to fade pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m not at all deterred from using the product despite the scent, so in my mind, that&#x27;s not all that large of a flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottles are very large and I am sure the product will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>However, I really can’t live with the smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d knock two stars off for this, but the scent isn&#x27;t *</li>
            <li>I like the lotion enough to purchase more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand enjoy fragrances.</li>
            <li>It smells nice for a guy to wear and it actually helps repel the bugs a little too.</li>
            <li>I live in an Arid zone and need moisturizer to keep my skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent not great but not too strong and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>How to be able to have lotions lets say that didn&#x27;t leave my wife rolling the window down in the car in the middle of winter.</li>
            <li>32 ounces per bottle is ALOT of lotion, this bottle will most likely last you all year long.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this brand of lotion again, but in a different fragrance (or a scentless version</li>
            <li>All of them, way to fragrant for my wife, who is extremely sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it only for someone with very lightweight moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-feel.  </li>
            <li>Now that is objective but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, not the greatst lotion however, rather thin and have had to apply several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li>a major</li>
            <li>I can barely smell the cedar</li>
            <li>to me , the odor is more of a sour cream / plain yoghurt.</li>
            <li>But I hated it and gave it away to other family members who are happy to receive a free item.  </li>
            <li>it smells manly enough and goes on easy, but there have been a few dry Arizona days where the lotion lost its potency</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent my entire married life fielding complaints about the various men&#x27;s personal care products i&#x27;d use.</li>

            <li> Normally I&#x27;d knock two stars off for this, but the scent isn&#x27;t *</li>
            <li> I like the lotion enough to purchase more in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand enjoy fragrances.</li>
            <li> It smells nice for a guy to wear and it actually helps repel the bugs a little too.</li>
            <li> I live in an Arid zone and need moisturizer to keep my skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> I find the scent not great but not too strong and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> How to be able to have lotions lets say that didn&#x27;t leave my wife rolling the window down in the car in the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> 32 ounces per bottle is ALOT of lotion, this bottle will most likely last you all year long.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this brand of lotion again, but in a different fragrance (or a scentless version</li>
            <li> All of them, way to fragrant for my wife, who is extremely sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it only for someone with very lightweight moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-feel.  </li>
            <li> Now that is objective but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, not the greatst lotion however, rather thin and have had to apply several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> a major</li>
            <li> I can barely smell the cedar</li>
            <li> to me , the odor is more of a sour cream / plain yoghurt.</li>
            <li> But I hated it and gave it away to other family members who are happy to receive a free item.  </li>
            <li> it smells manly enough and goes on easy, but there have been a few dry Arizona days where the lotion lost its potency</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my entire married life fielding complaints about the various men&#x27;s personal care products i&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be for men, but the other EO Products Everyone Lotions - although they smell better - receive slightly worse EWG ratings.</li>
            <li> The lotion is relatively thin, rubs on easily, and works well for moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised with the scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I get dry skin on my face in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Very strong bad smell.</li>
            <li> His hands get very dry in the winter and he detests any of my &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling lotions.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Also the lotion is very thin and slightly runny, and a few minutes after applying it, my skin is dry again and I need to apply more.</li>
            <li> Water based, not oily like some other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> so I will have to pour them into other bottles.</li>
            <li> the scent has grown on me, but EWG now says it is less healthy:  [...]  </li>
            <li> but I just found out that the EWG rating for this lotion changed to a 3 since I saw it, bought the lotion, and wrote my review, which is quite a step down from a 0.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not overbearing, it&#x27;s just subtle enough.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a lotion scent the family could use that wasn&#x27;t overtly girly (which is typical of what I have in the house).  </li>
            <li> Price is a little steep and shipping is steep but cant find this product alot of places.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be my everyday forever lotion...</li>
            <li> Seriously was a little bit skeptic on how it would smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find some all natural lotion without the bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno for years, but thought it was too thick</li>
            <li> Such as synthetic benzyl alcohol, which is dangerous for infants and mildly irritating (triggers allergies) for adults.</li>
            <li> Subtle smell, boyfriend uses it and loves it</li>
            <li> The worst part is I will be moving to a very cold and dry climate where this would have been so useful.</li>
            <li> I may try it on a Wheat Thin instead of my body.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Sorry if my review misled anyone...</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t want it to become my signature either!</li>
            <li> SORRY!!!</li>
            <li> They hate it too!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells amazing, plant based, and feels great on the skin. A wonderful brand and product!</li>
            <li> Seriously was a little bit skeptic on how it would smell. This stuff is great!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not overbearing, it&#x27;s just subtle enough. Water based, not oily like some other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Plus its cheap &amp; you get a good amount. I&#x27;m Very happy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large amount for a decent price. The lotion itself works very well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. Now that is objective but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to moisture all that much but I just started using it so I&#x27;ll update at a later date.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband in the cedar&amp;citrus scent.  His hands get very dry in the winter and he detests any of my &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling lotions.  This smells really good without being feminine smelling.  It sinks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after-feel.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i will never buy a different lotion again. i really like this coming from a man</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he is always complaining about finding a good lotion for men. He absolutely loves it. The smell is very pleasing and it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Good scent and a great consistency that absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Goes on very nice and smells nice for man or women who is woodsy!. Cedar scent doesn&#x27;t last long but still very nice</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like cedar or citrus... or anything in particular.&lt;br /&gt;Feels light on the skin, which I like, but I have no intent on using it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a stronger/better Pump. The price is truly fair for the quantity &amp; quality... I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  The scent is great as well.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not leave your skin feeling greasy.Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing as easy as most lotions.Has a very pleasant scent which is not overpowering.I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent of cedar and citrus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised with the scent of this lotion.  It smells like neither cedar nor citrus... to me , the odor is more of a sour cream / plain yoghurt. Thus, this is not a lotion for &amp;#34;every man&amp;#34;.  I may try it on a Wheat Thin instead of my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady who loves simplifying ingredients and routines, maximizing profits, great lotion, and masculine scents, and I can really say this product has it all. It&#x27;s lightweight and non-greasy while moisturizing. It&#x27;s a great value for the price, and works wonderfully as a face moisturizer and body lotion. A friend complimented me on my perfume, when I wasn&#x27;t even wearing any, and later confirmed it was the smell of this lotion. The only thing it does not have is SPF, which breaks me out. I stick to a separate sunscreen when I expect to be outside a lot anyways. This lotion has taken the place of so many products in so little space and money; I bet it&#x27;s even a great hair leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> We are really pleased with this lotion for the whole family - myself, my husband, and our 2 year old.  Though it&#x27;s labeled as a man lotion, it&#x27;s not too manly for me to use it.  It&#x27;s a fresh, kind of outdoorsy smell which I really enjoy.  It&#x27;s not greasy, in fact it&#x27;s very light and absorbs fast.  I feel good about putting it on our skin.  And the amount of lotion for the price is a heck of a deal - it&#x27;s a big bottle in my opinion.  (I usually love the Twig lavender baby lotion, but it&#x27;s too expensive)</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it&#x27;s not too greasy or watery. It soaks in nicely but leaves skin hydrated, soft, and supple. Also, the smell is not too overpowering and it wears off quickly, which I also like. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t want it to become my signature either!</li>
            <li> The lotion has a nice light scent, absorbs well into the skin, and continuously keeps the areas where applied moisturized. The product was damaged during the shipping process and the company &amp;#34;Everyone&amp;#34; took full responsibility for the damage. They were prompt in responding to my dissatisfaction of my damaged product and even more prompt in replacing it. Great Product...Better Customer Service! I will be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> Big container but whoever shipped this needs to figure out another way to cover the nozzle... maybe cap it off and include the pump in the packaging separately because there was lotion all over where it had leaked out of the nozzle during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the lotion itself, it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s not runny and dries fairly quickly.  Smells pretty good also.</li>
            <li> excellent for perfect skin</li>
            <li> Ordered this multiple times for a reason! Great product, good moisturizing without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion by far.  The combination of cedar and citrus is perfect and not overpowering.  I have very dry skin and this really works.&lt;br /&gt;  My second bottle this year.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell the cedar and  that&#x27;s the reason I bought the product. I should have shopped around more.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and consistency of this lotion. I plan to buy more and the soap that matches it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful rich smell, subtle citrus and cedar aroma is wonderfully fresh and pure, not invasive!</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this lotion. I love that EO is trying to use as many natural ingredients as possible, and at the same time is honest in their practices by not labeling it organic. I also love the amount your get for the price. However, I really can’t live with the smell. It does sort of smell like woods, but it just isn’t pleasing to me. It becomes too much for me to wear all day. The worst part is I will be moving to a very cold and dry climate where this would have been so useful. I was hoping this would be my everyday forever lotion...bummer.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 different flavors. Sorry to say I could not stand the smell. I gave them away. SORRY!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and everything... could be thicker formula</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a lotion scent the family could use that wasn&#x27;t overtly girly (which is typical of what I have in the house).  But I hated it and gave it away to other family members who are happy to receive a free item.  They hate it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my entire married life fielding complaints about the various men&#x27;s personal care products i&#x27;d use. All of them, way to fragrant for my wife, who is extremely sensitive to smells. I on the other hand enjoy fragrances. The conundrum? How to be able to have lotions lets say that didn&#x27;t leave my wife rolling the window down in the car in the middle of winter. I had found the soap by this same company at a local health food store, and decided to try the lotion (the wife had yet to complain about my soap. Its been several weeks, and i am incident free), and my wife has even smelled my arm right after i put it on, and didn&#x27;t have any complaints. Its been nice being able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t get the wife&#x27;s allergies fired up.i think I&#x27;ve got my final solution.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it feels on my skins, that is why I bought 4 bottles, so I don&#x27;t have to run around and looks for this item.  keep up the great work on this product.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, not the greatst lotion however, rather thin and have had to apply several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smells wonderful! I mist be very unlucky as the both times I have received the lotion the top was smashed.. maybe the lid could be a little more sturdy. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Dude wears it. I love it.</li>
            <li> smells a bit like butt.</li>
            <li> It smells manly, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s plant based with essential oils only.&lt;br /&gt;Will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> Everything about this lotion is great except the fragrance, which smells natural and masculine and outdoorsy and ... terrible. If you&#x27;re of the lumbersexual persuasion, the scent will appeal to you (probably); if you&#x27;re not of the lumbersexual persuasion, hopefully this comparison was illustrative. Normally I&#x27;d knock two stars off for this, but the scent isn&#x27;t *that* strong, and it seems to fade pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m not at all deterred from using the product despite the scent, so in my mind, that&#x27;s not all that large of a flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I love the product other than the scent. I will certainly buy this brand of lotion again, but in a different fragrance (or a scentless version and then I&#x27;ll add my own fragrance to it).</li>
            <li> I ordered this and thet body wash and although I like both of the scents, the pumps on both bottles didn&#x27;t work when I recieved them so I will have to pour them into other bottles.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. The fact it&#x27;s all natural as far as I can tell is good. It smells nice for a guy to wear and it actually helps repel the bugs a little too.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells good, works good and the bottle is large so it lasts along time.  The smell works well for men or women.</li>
            <li> Great product I have very dry skin and this is great for that. Price is a little steep and shipping is steep but cant find this product alot of places.</li>
            <li> Such a fantastic lotion. This is very light moisturizer which is exactly what I was looking for. It absorbs very quickly and the scent is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and I get dry skin on my face in the winter months. This is the perfect lotion to moisturize my skin but not get greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion through the manufacturer. It smells very woodsy, and is much more manly than other lotions which is a good thing. It is relatively mild and healthier than most lotions, but it does have some troubling ingredients. Such as synthetic benzyl alcohol, which is dangerous for infants and mildly irritating (triggers allergies) for adults. And Phenoxyethanol, which the Cosmetic Database rates it as a moderate hazard and notes cancer, allergic reactions, skin, eye and lung irritation, organ and neurotoxicity as possible effects of using products containing it. And Dimethicone which is made from silicone and forms a plastic barrier on your skin over time. Also the lotion is very thin and slightly runny, and a few minutes after applying it, my skin is dry again and I need to apply more. I&#x27;d prefer a thicker more moisturizing lotion without the aforementioned hazardous additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a major plus is how much lotion you get for your money. 32 ounces per bottle is ALOT of lotion, this bottle will most likely last you all year long.</li>
            <li> Subtle smell, boyfriend uses it and loves it</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very strong fragrance and is definitely not heavy-duty. I would recommend it only for someone with very lightweight moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li> Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database gives this lotion a perfect score of 0, the lowest possible health hazard. I find the scent not great but not too strong and not unpleasant. The lotion is relatively thin, rubs on easily, and works well for moisturizing my dry skin. For 32 oz and a 0 EWG rating, the price is fantastic. This is supposed to be for men, but the other EO Products Everyone Lotions - although they smell better - receive slightly worse EWG ratings. I recommend highly: this combination of health, price and effectiveness are rare.  1/23/14 correction - I have no idea why but I just found out that the EWG rating for this lotion changed to a 3 since I saw it, bought the lotion, and wrote my review, which is quite a step down from a 0.  I still like the price and how it works and the scent has grown on me, but EWG now says it is less healthy:  [...]  They give the coconut &amp; lemon scent a 2, which is better.  Sorry if my review misled anyone... I was misled myself by what must have been a mistake at EWG.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a working man. Smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it&#x27;s not too oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> Love them both. The coconut oil is better than I expected.  Works wonders for cooking and really makes my skin look twice as healthy.  My husband loves the woodsy scent of the lostion</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  I wanted to find some all natural lotion without the bad ingredients.  I have been using Aveeno for years, but thought it was too thick so I wanted to find something a bit more man scented that might be better for me.  I don&#x27;t want cancer in 20 years because of my lotion use, so this stuff checked out okay.  Overall it smells manly enough and goes on easy, but there have been a few dry Arizona days where the lotion lost its potency and I needed to reapply 8 hours later.  Overall its good, but not the best, but definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> I loved the other scent of this lotion (the lemon one), but wanted something a bit more &amp;#34;mannish&amp;#34;.  This fit the bill perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an awesome scent - a little like cologne but not overbearing. It&#x27;s definitely more manly - my wife will stick with the other lemon scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is not greasy and absorbs quickly. And the best part is that it&#x27;s not made from harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> Very strong bad smell. Not like cedar. Made me dizzy from the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who doesn&#x27;t like most flowery, cloying scents, so this is almost-perfect.  As a lotion it is nice and does the trick.  You get a huge bottle of it for the price, so it&#x27;s a good value besides.</li>
            <li> A very nice lotion for dry climates.  I live in an Arid zone and need moisturizer to keep my skin from drying out.  This has a pleasant, albeit odd fragrance when applying the lotion and the aroma wears off quickly.  All in all I like the lotion enough to purchase more in the near future.  UPDATE:  I ordered two more bottles of this lotion.  The bottles are very large and I am sure the product will last me a long time.</li>
