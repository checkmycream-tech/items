            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to tan my face in the tanning bed (and outdoors) and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come with a seal on the bottle, kind of worrisome as I&#x27;ve heard of places swithing lotions out with something cheaper.</li>
            <li>Neither of them had  a very strong smell, but the lotion I bought at the salon was definitely more pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>So far, its made my face look great!  </li>
            <li>But I needed one, since my face never tans as well as the rest of my body and noticed great color after the first use.</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth look and color.</li>
            <li>When I brought my bottle to the salon, the Picture Perfect lotion they have was completely different.</li>
            <li>Best facial tanning lotion does not break me out</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, but I just use normal tanning lotion now for my face, don&#x27;t see the need for &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; kind.</li>
            <li>not to strong and light weight</li>
            <li>This facial bronzer is very lovely!</li>
            <li>The absolute best facial bronzer lotion , I used it once</li>
            <li>It works great got my face dark in no time I love it</li>
            <li>and my hands aren&#x27;t always clean.  </li>
            <li>this is true to it&#x27;s advertised properties.</li>
            <li>It arrived quick..</li>
            <li>After just one use I see very bronze color in my face, this product was authentic and was exactly how described.</li>
            <li>I am willing to keep that in mind!</li>

            <li>Def recommend product to anyone having facial tanning issues &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I love this facial tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>But I really regret wasting my money and buying it off Amazon.</li>
            <li>The amazon lotion was a greyish pale color, and the real lotion I got at the salon was a warm,  lighter tan color.</li>
            <li>Tanning salons are selling it for about $30-40, so I highly recommend getting it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The $30 I spent on the REAL salon bottle was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a salon for the exact same bottle.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out or anything from it, I usually have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Dont read the negative comments as this is the real deal and from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and this made me break out pretty quick with few results :(</li>
            <li> my face is so sensitive, I tan usually during lunch</li>
            <li> Works really well if you are having a hard time getting your face tan!</li>
            <li> This was the first facial bronzer that I have ever tried, so I was a bit skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> and my face was a shade darker , and after several uses my face is very dark</li>
            <li> Not oily but still gets facial skin dark and sexi!!</li>
            <li> I was not totally satisfied with my personal results with this product.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount, it goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Once I used it, it not only felt lighter on my skin and didn&#x27;t clog up my pores, it also made my face at least a shade darker.</li>
            <li> I low key suspect that this lotion may be a fake...</li>
            <li> I do notice a little bronze but it isn&#x27;t obnoxious (which you don&#x27;t want for your face anyways).</li>
            <li> Not only did the lotion have a weird consistency, smell, and color (almost pale grey), but it clogged up my pores and made me breakout.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve put a small cleanser in my tanning bag that I use before putting this on.  </li>
            <li> I had obviously bought a FAKE lotion from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am naturally very pale so that may have something to do with my results.</li>
            <li> This is the first bad review I have ever written!</li>
            <li> The lotion felt heavy and uncomfortable on my face, and it also made my face several shades LIGHTER and very sickly and pale.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed and wasted my money</li>
            <li> Crazy peeps.</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed that it was expired by 2 months when I got it in.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

            <li> The product works well for me (read below) but i was disappointed that it was expired by 2 months when I got it in.  I got this because someone told me it would help with my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and my face has never burned since I began to use it. I do notice a little bronze but it isn&#x27;t obnoxious (which you don&#x27;t want for your face anyways). I will definitely buy again just not necessarily through this seller.   The lotion smelled, looked and felt just like the one I tried at the salon.</li>
            <li> I was not totally satisfied with my personal results with this product. I am naturally very pale so that may have something to do with my results. I am willing to keep that in mind! On my skin all it did was make me flushed looking...normal reaction to a tingle lotion....and then it went away.</li>
            <li> the smell isnt so great</li>
            <li> Best face tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, my face got SO tan after 3 times tanning! Love this stuff! Deffinitaly buying this lotion again in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works too!</li>
            <li> Works good. My face is very fair and I need a booster for my face area.</li>
            <li> It works great got my face dark in no time I love it</li>
            <li> This was the first facial bronzer that I have ever tried, so I was a bit skeptical about it. But I needed one, since my face never tans as well as the rest of my body and noticed great color after the first use. I got no breakouts or anything from it. And it&#x27;s 100% fragrance-free, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell. Tanning salons are selling it for about $30-40, so I highly recommend getting it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lotion expired february of this year. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yay, my face matches my body! I can never get my face to have any color...until now!</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone who tans, it&#x27;s awesome, &amp; smells very good too, makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> Yikes! I have somewhat sensitive skin and this made me break out pretty quick with few results :(</li>
            <li> Makes ur skin feel great moisturizer but not greasy at all didn&#x27;t make me break out and gave me great color just from one visit and no redness like when I don&#x27;t use face cream!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to tan my face in the tanning bed (and outdoors) and this is amazing.  I am prone to breakouts from time to time and this has not had any negative effects on my skin and the tanning of my face is beautiful.  No streak, not oily and allows adding of just enough color to go with the rest of my tan!</li>
            <li> Great price, worked well. I didn&#x27;t break out or anything from it, I usually have very oily skin and this was a good product for me.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this and she loved it!  I&#x27;ve never used a facial lotion while tanning b/c my face is so sensitive, I tan usually during lunch and my hands aren&#x27;t always clean.  but I&#x27;ve put a small cleanser in my tanning bag that I use before putting this on.  So far, its made my face look great!  You only need a very small amount, it goes a long way!  I do have larger pores, I&#x27;m a year round tanner, and this makes my face look great!  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> So far I love all things Designer Skin and this is true to it&#x27;s advertised properties.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tan my face at all!! I ended up using regular tanning accelerator and it worked. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 3 weeks now. It does make my skin soft, but it has not made my face any darker (&amp; I tan in beds with facial lamps). Also, it is supposed to have a cosmetic bronzer in it that makes your face instantly darker after each session- I have not seen any results. I low key suspect that this lotion may be a fake...</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion on Amazon since the salon I tan at was selling it for almost twice the price ($30). I tried the Amazon bottle and it didn&#x27;t make me darker at all. Not only did the lotion have a weird consistency, smell, and color (almost pale grey), but it clogged up my pores and made me breakout. The lotion felt heavy and uncomfortable on my face, and it also made my face several shades LIGHTER and very sickly and pale. When I brought my bottle to the salon, the Picture Perfect lotion they have was completely different. I had obviously bought a FAKE lotion from Amazon. The amazon lotion was a greyish pale color, and the real lotion I got at the salon was a warm,  lighter tan color. Neither of them had  a very strong smell, but the lotion I bought at the salon was definitely more pleasant smelling. Once I used it, it not only felt lighter on my skin and didn&#x27;t clog up my pores, it also made my face at least a shade darker. The $30 I spent on the REAL salon bottle was definitely worth it. But I really regret wasting my money and buying it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> The absolute best facial bronzer lotion , I used it once and my face was a shade darker , and after several uses my face is very dark</li>
            <li> Works great! Not oily but still gets facial skin dark and sexi!! Def recommend product to anyone having facial tanning issues &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Best facial tanning lotion does not break me out and I have acne smooths but no greasy at all and really gets my face dark ! This is a must buy !</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, but I just use normal tanning lotion now for my face, don&#x27;t see the need for &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; kind.</li>
            <li> Works really well if you are having a hard time getting your face tan! Not a fake, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Hasnt made my face any darker and caused me to break out something fierce. Completely disappointed and wasted my money</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Acne prone skin and no breakouts. Great color.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great on the face. Noticed I got darker after using a couple times.</li>
            <li> After just one use I see very bronze color in my face, this product was authentic and was exactly how described. BUY FROM THEETANMAN!!! I have yet to be ripped off by this company.</li>
            <li> This facial bronzer is very lovely! i use it every time i tan and it gives me really awesome results. No smell so its not going to assault your nose. It feels like a layer of concealer is put on your face, which it kinda is since it has the bb creme in it. It gives a very smooth look and color. id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cus I had heard great things about this product. its cheaper on here then in an tanning place you go to. it was a great fragrance too. not to strong and light weight and u can use indoor or outdoor tanning for just wear it on a daily bases. I love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with a seal on the bottle, kind of worrisome as I&#x27;ve heard of places swithing lotions out with something cheaper.</li>
            <li> Dont read the negative comments as this is the real deal and from the manufacturer.  I bought this at a salon for the exact same bottle.  Crazy peeps.</li>
            <li> FAKE! Do not buy. This is the first bad review I have ever written! I am extremely disappointed! After using this and my face breaking out terribly.... I took this tanning lotion to several tanning salons in my area to compare this lotion to theirs..(which was the exact same lotion) ITS NOT THE SAME!  It&#x27;s smells different, looks different. Do not wast your money</li>
            <li> I love this facial tanning lotion! It is wonderful :)</li>
            <li> It arrived quick.. Love it</li>
            <li> dont do any good at all.</li>
