            <li>I would imagine that if you are looking for something natural and of good quality for your skin, the smell will not deter you from using this wonderful oil.  </li>
            <li>It makes wonderful soap, and we use it straight out of the bag for our face cream.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT !!</li>

            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff A+++</li>
            <li>Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want all that stuff done ahead of time, you are going to pay more for your shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews regarding the Shea Butter and its aroma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I still love my Harlem and 125th</li>
            <li>I love the color and that it was not grainy at all.</li>
            <li>This was a better product, the packing was also better the Shea butter was a good clean grade easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and so do my family and relatives.</li>
            <li>and I love the creaminess of it.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this priduct - smell, color, grade and price.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchase more.</li>
            <li>Wonderful color (white does not stain) and and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Pure, clean, chemical and dye free 100% Shea butter for a great price!</li>
            <li>Like I said, I can&#x27;t be bothered when it is so good right out of the bag.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is wonderful, this is raw, it comes in a box wrapped in a plastic bag like is was cut from a &amp;#34;Shea Wheel&amp;#34; but it is really good quality.  </li>
            <li>You might get good result by whipping it first.</li>
            <li>It is pure and it is so good for so many things.</li>
            <li>I like Ivory grade better because the nutty smell is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>HalalEveryDay is THE best and the leaders in supplying excellent quality raw unrefined mango butter, I will not purchase this product from no other.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, creamy, and just lovely.  </li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars because I am completely 100% happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it had a strong odor-it smelled like shea.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I even use it with sweet almond oil to help make it more easily spreadable.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is as nice as the shea I have paid twice as much for!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, and not clumpy, but smooth.</li>
            <li>Works just fine for me in lotions and soap.</li>
            <li>So rich and creamy, it blends well with and gives body and substance to other oils for the foundation of beautiful body butter!</li>
            <li>It also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>This by far the best natural (organic) Shea butter I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>The product was neatly and securely packaged.</li>
            <li>Its so far so good.</li>
            <li>the butter was exactly as described - and it is a pretty good amount.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is good for the skin and is very easy to mix with olive oil or any other oil if desried.  </li>
            <li>It has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing on my type 4b natural hair!</li>
            <li>Their butter is nice and soft, but does have that Shea Butter smell.</li>
            <li>the same good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great to mix with other products or use alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed because I made my hair and body batch with various oils and still have some left over to store.</li>
            <li>The end result after whipping is a nice, light, white emollient.  </li>
            <li>Tremendous value.</li>
            <li>It very moisturizing and good for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this and many other natural products from this wonderful establishment!</li>
            <li>buy this and enjoy the great value and raw product.</li>
            <li>the shipping was pretty fast but the shea butter was ok</li>
            <li>The bag was very sturdy and the shea butter was enveloped in strong plastic.</li>
            <li>(I ordered mine in December) which is the most likely reason for it becoming rancid.</li>
            <li>The shipping is ALWAYS FAST and problem free.</li>
            <li>I had good results from the former and am expecting the same or better with this batch.</li>
            <li>The product itself was fresh and handled with care.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency with low scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks a mil for such a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My batch was not gritty and had a really nice &amp;#34;buttery/smooth&amp;#34; consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered pure Shea Butter from other sites and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>It arrived fresh, as if it had just been packed right before shipping.</li>
            <li>But what truly set the bar high for me with this company was how quickly I received my package!</li>
            <li>i had to contact the seller because of a mistake that i made and he took care of the issue right away.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get the problem made it easier to cut up in sections and re-wrap what I didn&#x27;t use right away.</li>
            <li>this is my first time using raw shea butter, so i have nothing to compare it against, but i am extremely happy with the product and the service.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering shea butter from Amazon, and I chose the right seller.</li>
            <li>Shipping is a bit pricey but very fast.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing!</li>
            <li>Firstly, it was not ivory, but a greenish, yellow, which did not look too appealing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say the seller is not good, I just prefer the quality of my unrefined ivory shea butter from another vendor best.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of Shea  </li>
            <li>and it was riding around in a hot truck</li>
            <li>I like the ivory better than the yellow butter.  </li>
            <li>4 stars only because the manner in which the product was wrapped could have been better.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>but overall was ok.  </li>
            <li>I like the beige better because it doesn&#x27;t impart a yellow tone to everything.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>For real!</li>
            <li>The 5 lb bag was so big that she separated the butter into more than a dozen jars and gave them to relatives and friends.</li>
            <li>Use it out of the bag, simple and hassle-free :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been using shea butter for over 15 years and this is the first time having this experience.</li>
            <li>I received the exact amount I ordered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived in a good, sturdy heavy mm, sealed plastic sack.</li>
            <li>Remember-this is raw shea butter, so it will have imperfections, but it hasn&#x27;t had all the good stuff stripped from it.  </li>
            <li>The color is right, the smell (though a very different smell compared to a lot of oils) is right and the price is right!  </li>
            <li>The price was right and this is the smooth white shea butter that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have been ordering this from Halal Everyday, and I am even more excited about it</li>
            <li>It arrived to me pretty fast.</li>
            <li>maybe they have super sensitive noses.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I will certainly reccommend to my soaping friends.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter was clean and free of any foreign bodies.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the yellow shea butter in this same product and it came in a large plastic container, was well filtered and worked wonderfully when whipped into a body butter.     </li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t have that).</li>
            <li>and I dont really have any complaints with its effects on my skin.</li>
            <li>As real as it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
            <li>The 5 pound bag really had a lot in it.</li>
            <li>My fault for expecting to much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the women and men who bring this product to us.</li>
            <li>She rescued the bag from the trash and gave it a try, and now she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This has been a very hefty bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well and came in a timely matter.</li>
            <li>i found pieces of string in it and black ash also the smell was very strong</li>
            <li>Used it for a healing balm mixed with other ingredients - good stuff.</li>
            <li>i made my first batch of whipped body butter yesterday and the only difficulty i am having is trying to figure out how much essential oil to use so that i can smell it over the shea butter :)  based on my experience</li>
            <li>Most people prefer to whip it or melt it into other concoctions.</li>
            <li>I diverted from my usual seller only because the price was great and the product reviews were favorable.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it in my products for the past two weeks and on its own.</li>
            <li>It was fresh, smooth and had little or no bits in it (from the hull of the nut).  </li>
            <li>ordered this back in March and will be ordering more here shortly, because I&#x27;m running out (</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone making skincare and hair products with it.</li>
            <li>My other brands of Shea melt and blend in easily.</li>
            <li>it takes a few washes to get ride of the oily stain but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I like the fact that it&#x27;s unrefined and has it&#x27;s normal smell and properties.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this product, when it came some of it was not totally wrapped up almost like it was leaking and</li>
            <li>No hard pieces just what it says shea butter....</li>
            <li>ow because of their new packaging.</li>
            <li>I use shea butter as a main ingredient in my hair and body product, along with mango and cocoa butter, and of course natural oils.</li>
            <li>, I put the jars in my dresser drawers as to keep it out of the light because I read somewhere that it should be kept in a dark place</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out my blog about natural hair!</li>
            <li>Initially it seemed OK, albeit a bit gray-toned, and I stored it while using my other brand which I</li>
            <li>It arrived secruely in a tight plastic bag inside a U.S. postal package box, which was just fine.</li>
            <li>Was a bit of a pain scraping the shea off the bag but not really a huge issue, I just used what I couldn&#x27;t easily transfer off the bag on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my children and my own skin, hair, small abrasions(high in vit E and A), and even on the skins of our traditional drums.</li>
            <li>My skin and hair is very soft and supple, and the scent is not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with the yellow or seek another supplier of real ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li>It takes so much to soften the butter to actually spread it</li>
            <li>Smells natural.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing the yellow and it has a much stronger scent compared to this ivory one.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally in winter I&#x27;ll use it straight on my skin, and it does not leave my skin greasy or sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not crumble in my hands like old shea butter.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to keep my feet soft and it is working.</li>
            <li>I make natural hair products and hand creams with it.</li>
            <li>Ivory is by far my fav .  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is definitely of high quality, especially compared to others on the market.  </li>
            <li>It really penetrates the skin and provides moisture all day long.</li>
            <li>This shea smelt so fresh with a firm, yet soft texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, as is, and I process it with emu oil or olive oil into whipped butter for personal use.  </li>
            <li>O_o</li>
            <li>It takes me a few months to go through 5 lbs, and in the bag it stays fresh as when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>so If you do buy this be prepared to store in in a large plastic container to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li>Works really well, does have a slight odor to it, but nothing that you can detect from a foot away.</li>
            <li>The butter is smooth, without bits on seed shell that can show up in other raw shea butters.</li>
            <li>Halalevery&#x27;s raw, grade A shea butter from Ghana is the first product of this nature purchased through Amazon for compounding.</li>

            <li> The texture of the ivory Shea butter is so much more creamer</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff A+++</li>
            <li> Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li> If you want all that stuff done ahead of time, you are going to pay more for your shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding the Shea Butter and its aroma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I still love my Harlem and 125th</li>
            <li> I love the color and that it was not grainy at all.</li>
            <li> This was a better product, the packing was also better the Shea butter was a good clean grade easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and so do my family and relatives.</li>
            <li> and I love the creaminess of it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this priduct - smell, color, grade and price.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchase more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful color (white does not stain) and and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Pure, clean, chemical and dye free 100% Shea butter for a great price!</li>
            <li> Like I said, I can&#x27;t be bothered when it is so good right out of the bag.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is wonderful, this is raw, it comes in a box wrapped in a plastic bag like is was cut from a &amp;#34;Shea Wheel&amp;#34; but it is really good quality.  </li>
            <li> You might get good result by whipping it first.</li>
            <li> It is pure and it is so good for so many things.</li>
            <li> I like Ivory grade better because the nutty smell is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> HalalEveryDay is THE best and the leaders in supplying excellent quality raw unrefined mango butter, I will not purchase this product from no other.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, creamy, and just lovely.  </li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because I am completely 100% happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it had a strong odor-it smelled like shea.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I even use it with sweet almond oil to help make it more easily spreadable.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is as nice as the shea I have paid twice as much for!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, and not clumpy, but smooth.</li>
            <li> Works just fine for me in lotions and soap.</li>
            <li> So rich and creamy, it blends well with and gives body and substance to other oils for the foundation of beautiful body butter!</li>
            <li> It also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> This by far the best natural (organic) Shea butter I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> The product was neatly and securely packaged.</li>
            <li> Its so far so good.</li>
            <li> the butter was exactly as described - and it is a pretty good amount.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is good for the skin and is very easy to mix with olive oil or any other oil if desried.  </li>
            <li> It has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing on my type 4b natural hair!</li>
            <li> Their butter is nice and soft, but does have that Shea Butter smell.</li>
            <li> the same good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great to mix with other products or use alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed because I made my hair and body batch with various oils and still have some left over to store.</li>
            <li> The end result after whipping is a nice, light, white emollient.  </li>
            <li> Tremendous value.</li>
            <li> It very moisturizing and good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this and many other natural products from this wonderful establishment!</li>
            <li> buy this and enjoy the great value and raw product.</li>
            <li> the shipping was pretty fast but the shea butter was ok</li>
            <li> The bag was very sturdy and the shea butter was enveloped in strong plastic.</li>
            <li> (I ordered mine in December) which is the most likely reason for it becoming rancid.</li>
            <li> The shipping is ALWAYS FAST and problem free.</li>
            <li> I had good results from the former and am expecting the same or better with this batch.</li>
            <li> The product itself was fresh and handled with care.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency with low scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks a mil for such a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My batch was not gritty and had a really nice &amp;#34;buttery/smooth&amp;#34; consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered pure Shea Butter from other sites and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> It arrived fresh, as if it had just been packed right before shipping.</li>
            <li> But what truly set the bar high for me with this company was how quickly I received my package!</li>
            <li> i had to contact the seller because of a mistake that i made and he took care of the issue right away.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get the problem made it easier to cut up in sections and re-wrap what I didn&#x27;t use right away.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using raw shea butter, so i have nothing to compare it against, but i am extremely happy with the product and the service.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering shea butter from Amazon, and I chose the right seller.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a bit pricey but very fast.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> This is the real thing!</li>
            <li> Firstly, it was not ivory, but a greenish, yellow, which did not look too appealing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say the seller is not good, I just prefer the quality of my unrefined ivory shea butter from another vendor best.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of Shea  </li>
            <li> and it was riding around in a hot truck</li>
            <li> I like the ivory better than the yellow butter.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars only because the manner in which the product was wrapped could have been better.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> but overall was ok.  </li>
            <li> I like the beige better because it doesn&#x27;t impart a yellow tone to everything.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> For real!</li>
            <li> The 5 lb bag was so big that she separated the butter into more than a dozen jars and gave them to relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> Use it out of the bag, simple and hassle-free :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for over 15 years and this is the first time having this experience.</li>
            <li> I received the exact amount I ordered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product arrived in a good, sturdy heavy mm, sealed plastic sack.</li>
            <li> Remember-this is raw shea butter, so it will have imperfections, but it hasn&#x27;t had all the good stuff stripped from it.  </li>
            <li> The color is right, the smell (though a very different smell compared to a lot of oils) is right and the price is right!  </li>
            <li> The price was right and this is the smooth white shea butter that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have been ordering this from Halal Everyday, and I am even more excited about it</li>
            <li> It arrived to me pretty fast.</li>
            <li> maybe they have super sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I will certainly reccommend to my soaping friends.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter was clean and free of any foreign bodies.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the yellow shea butter in this same product and it came in a large plastic container, was well filtered and worked wonderfully when whipped into a body butter.     </li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t have that).</li>
            <li> and I dont really have any complaints with its effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> As real as it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
            <li> The 5 pound bag really had a lot in it.</li>
            <li> My fault for expecting to much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the women and men who bring this product to us.</li>
            <li> She rescued the bag from the trash and gave it a try, and now she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This has been a very hefty bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well and came in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> i found pieces of string in it and black ash also the smell was very strong</li>
            <li> Used it for a healing balm mixed with other ingredients - good stuff.</li>
            <li> i made my first batch of whipped body butter yesterday and the only difficulty i am having is trying to figure out how much essential oil to use so that i can smell it over the shea butter :)  based on my experience</li>
            <li> Most people prefer to whip it or melt it into other concoctions.</li>
            <li> I diverted from my usual seller only because the price was great and the product reviews were favorable.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it in my products for the past two weeks and on its own.</li>
            <li> It was fresh, smooth and had little or no bits in it (from the hull of the nut).  </li>
            <li> ordered this back in March and will be ordering more here shortly, because I&#x27;m running out (</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone making skincare and hair products with it.</li>
            <li> My other brands of Shea melt and blend in easily.</li>
            <li> it takes a few washes to get ride of the oily stain but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I like the fact that it&#x27;s unrefined and has it&#x27;s normal smell and properties.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product, when it came some of it was not totally wrapped up almost like it was leaking and</li>
            <li> No hard pieces just what it says shea butter....</li>
            <li> ow because of their new packaging.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter as a main ingredient in my hair and body product, along with mango and cocoa butter, and of course natural oils.</li>
            <li> , I put the jars in my dresser drawers as to keep it out of the light because I read somewhere that it should be kept in a dark place</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out my blog about natural hair!</li>
            <li> Initially it seemed OK, albeit a bit gray-toned, and I stored it while using my other brand which I</li>
            <li> It arrived secruely in a tight plastic bag inside a U.S. postal package box, which was just fine.</li>
            <li> Was a bit of a pain scraping the shea off the bag but not really a huge issue, I just used what I couldn&#x27;t easily transfer off the bag on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my children and my own skin, hair, small abrasions(high in vit E and A), and even on the skins of our traditional drums.</li>
            <li> My skin and hair is very soft and supple, and the scent is not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with the yellow or seek another supplier of real ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> It takes so much to soften the butter to actually spread it</li>
            <li> Smells natural.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing the yellow and it has a much stronger scent compared to this ivory one.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally in winter I&#x27;ll use it straight on my skin, and it does not leave my skin greasy or sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not crumble in my hands like old shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to keep my feet soft and it is working.</li>
            <li> I make natural hair products and hand creams with it.</li>
            <li> Ivory is by far my fav .  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is definitely of high quality, especially compared to others on the market.  </li>
            <li> It really penetrates the skin and provides moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> This shea smelt so fresh with a firm, yet soft texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, as is, and I process it with emu oil or olive oil into whipped butter for personal use.  </li>
            <li> O_o</li>
            <li> It takes me a few months to go through 5 lbs, and in the bag it stays fresh as when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> so If you do buy this be prepared to store in in a large plastic container to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> Works really well, does have a slight odor to it, but nothing that you can detect from a foot away.</li>
            <li> The butter is smooth, without bits on seed shell that can show up in other raw shea butters.</li>
            <li> Halalevery&#x27;s raw, grade A shea butter from Ghana is the first product of this nature purchased through Amazon for compounding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly clean, with very few foreign items in it (like sticks).  </li>
            <li> This is raw, this is what your body wants.</li>
            <li> Ok so my 3 month old baby has crazy skin, it would get dry and peel..</li>
            <li> The color was a soft French white with the classic, unrefined markings of just a hint of pale green.</li>
            <li> I correctly guessed that she was expecting a cream that smelled &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, and explained to her that this was not a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, and was all natural, unprocessed and raw, and that the smell was the natural odor of the nuts which would dissipate only minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I keep having to filter out ash and other debris from it, which to me is a major annoyance.    </li>
            <li> It was half melted when it arrived at my door, but considering that it&#x27;s nearly 90 degrees</li>
            <li> If you are dry this will definitely help and it has longevity on the skin.</li>
            <li> I melt my other brands of  Shea butter in a double boiler and add to my regular lotions to make it richer and creamier.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the smell, but honestly the smell dissipates within minutes of applying and it really isn&#x27;t SO bad...</li>
            <li> But I was being lazy and tried to add the essential oil directly into the butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy Shea butter is double wrapped and sealed carefully.</li>
            <li> I researched a long while before I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very solid, does not mix well with other butters (leaves lumps) and was not well filtered.  </li>
            <li> Multi-purpose and a lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> tip to those who intend to whip it and infuse it with essential oils or other fragrance</li>
            <li> I create a mixture of Shea butter, and other essential oils</li>
            <li> But when I made it into soap, along with the essential oils and other ingredients, you don&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I finally tried melting some of this Shea in a double-boiler, and it immediately started turning dark gray.</li>
            <li> I will add essential oils to tone down the nutty smell when mixing body butters.</li>
            <li> There are others on Amazon who sell the same quality for less money, so until Saaqin drops the price again, look around.</li>
            <li> but I know get the same product for less money.</li>
            <li> but after I get done with that mess, I whip it with some extra virgin olive oil and its heaven!</li>
            <li> While there seems to be a little but of textural differences it works well enough for my creams.</li>
            <li> The shea butter was soft but yet hard.</li>
            <li> Once whipped I put it in 5 32oz jars with wide mouths that I got from Micheal&#x27;s and use it from there</li>
            <li> i added frangance to it and used 3x what i use on my other shea butter and still could not cover up the smell</li>
            <li> You do not need to buy any other type of shea.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I will be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> I tried another small batch and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> Would like to visit your store for other products.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, I received this is a box with a sealed bag inside.</li>
            <li> My advise would be to wait until the weather is not hot</li>
            <li> It all just looked dirty annd untidy and did not have the same raw, clean feel as the previous product I had bought.    </li>
            <li> Mine came in a large chunk with a few broken bits in the bag.  </li>
            <li> If you are dry get this product!!!</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated since it is raw and unrefined and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it to make it have some long duration shelf life....</li>
            <li> I rubbed some un-melted shea on my hand and found it to be very sticky and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> There will be leftover stuff sometimes in the butter-if you want to get the stuff out like the strings and specs, melt down what you&#x27;re going to use and filter through a strainer with a coffee filter.  </li>
            <li> It does have a SLIGHT nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I went through 2 1/2 of the 5 jars in the 3 three months and had previously gave the others away</li>
            <li> Previously I have used refined shea butter from another source.</li>
            <li> The longer you heat it the darker it becomes - almost black.</li>
            <li> that may not be for a little while yet.</li>
            <li> the shea butter arrived within a few days.  </li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>
            <li> : the product does retain heavily its raw nut smell, so it can overpower whatever you add.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem covering the smell of shea butter, and I&#x27;ve always used raw shea.  </li>
            <li> I didnt use the shea just raw, i made my Shae Souffle.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this shea raw butter 3 times.</li>
            <li> I saw very few pieces of nut/shell in mine.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed that it looked different and is not as creamy as the shea from the other vendor.</li>
            <li> They should at least use a Ziploc bag or something</li>
            <li> A serious amount for the price.  </li>
            <li> the smell of the shea butter was pretty awful.</li>
            <li> so the shea butter won&#x27;t look so sloppy and unorganized when it gets to the customer.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to unrefined shea butter!</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in plastic, and had another random plastic bag holding it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself using any of this product which is unfortunate because i got 5 lbs of it.</li>
            <li> This was a bad batch it got molded.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the quality; I&#x27;m just shocked at the price increase.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the reviews for the ivory, I ordered the 5 lb size and hate this product.</li>
            <li> As a long-time Shea butter user I am very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it came in an awful plastic bag.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.  It has great texture, scent, firmness and coloring.  It is exactly what it says it is.  I ordered 5 lbs (80 oz) and received just over that (81.35 oz) in a double sealed plastic bag.  Was a bit of a pain scraping the shea off the bag but not really a huge issue, I just used what I couldn&#x27;t easily transfer off the bag on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing! This can be applied to the skin as is, but I like to mix with veg. glycerin and avocado or jojoba oil.  It keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Will definitely order again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I previously bought the yellow shea butter in this same product and it came in a large plastic container, was well filtered and worked wonderfully when whipped into a body butter.     After seeing the reviews for the ivory, I ordered the 5 lb size and hate this product. Firstly, it was not ivory, but a greenish, yellow, which did not look too appealing. It is very solid, does not mix well with other butters (leaves lumps) and was not well filtered.  I keep having to filter out ash and other debris from it, which to me is a major annoyance.    Moreover, it came in an awful plastic bag.  It all just looked dirty annd untidy and did not have the same raw, clean feel as the previous product I had bought.    Will not buy it again.  I will stick with the yellow or seek another supplier of real ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to unrefined shea butter! It&#x27;s like crack for me now, yes this product comes in a double lined bag (so I would mail it to someone that is home to receive the package, cause IT WILL melt) and is a bear to try to wipe out of the bag that it comes in but after I get done with that mess, I whip it with some extra virgin olive oil and its heaven! It really penetrates the skin and provides moisture all day long. Some people complain about the smell, but honestly the smell dissipates within minutes of applying and it really isn&#x27;t SO bad...maybe they have super sensitive noses. It does have a SLIGHT nutty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this back in March and will be ordering more here shortly, because I&#x27;m running out (and I really can&#x27;t have that). Once whipped I put it in 5 32oz jars with wide mouths that I got from Micheal&#x27;s and use it from there, I put the jars in my dresser drawers as to keep it out of the light because I read somewhere that it should be kept in a dark place but I went through 2 1/2 of the 5 jars in the 3 three months and had previously gave the others away (I&#x27;m writing this review on June 16. 2011).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a friend whose mother has Psoriasis and she stated that it has helped her a lot because the shea butter moisturizes her skin so it doesn&#x27;t crack and cause her pain and she can apply it over her open sores and it doesn&#x27;t burn, she said she&#x27;s tried everything and this stuff is thebomb.com.</li>
            <li> Its so far so good. Ive been using it in my products for the past two weeks and on its own. I am happy with the results I have gotten and I dont really have any complaints with its effects on my skin. I do feel like it is a bit more smelly than others I have used but with fragrance oil that is cleared up.I like the product and I may purchase again. The packaging is temporary so If you do buy this be prepared to store in in a large plastic container to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> the shipping was pretty fast but the shea butter was ok i found pieces of string in it and black ash also the smell was very strong i added frangance to it and used 3x what i use on my other shea butter and still could not cover up the smell</li>
            <li> this is my first time using raw shea butter, so i have nothing to compare it against, but i am extremely happy with the product and the service.  the shea butter arrived within a few days.  i had to contact the seller because of a mistake that i made and he took care of the issue right away.  the butter was exactly as described - and it is a pretty good amount.  i made my first batch of whipped body butter yesterday and the only difficulty i am having is trying to figure out how much essential oil to use so that i can smell it over the shea butter :)  based on my experience, i would recommend this seller and will be using him again.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly as promised and packaged as in advertisement. I think that the product needs to be filtered before selling in order to remove the trash before mixing or packaging for use. Halalevery&#x27;s raw, grade A shea butter from Ghana is the first product of this nature purchased through Amazon for compounding. Previously I have used refined shea butter from another source. I had good results from the former and am expecting the same or better with this batch. JES, MD.</li>
            <li> buy this and enjoy the great value and raw product. You do not need to buy any other type of shea. This is raw, this is what your body wants.</li>
            <li> As real as it&#x27;s going to get. I make lotions for my family every year and they love it! Skin has never been softer! If you get it on your clothes... it takes a few washes to get ride of the oily stain but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say the seller is not good, I just prefer the quality of my unrefined ivory shea butter from another vendor best. I diverted from my usual seller only because the price was great and the product reviews were favorable. But I was disappointed that it looked different and is not as creamy as the shea from the other vendor. It takes so much to soften the butter to actually spread it &amp; I even use it with sweet almond oil to help make it more easily spreadable. I&#x27;m almost willing to just trash it and re order the product from my usual vendor. I am an avid user of Shea  I use it on my body and in my hair and after receiving and trying to use this product, I question how from Ghana this is.</li>
            <li> This was a bad batch it got molded. My first batch was excellent. I can&#x27;t say if it was my faults or the sellers. I had the Shea by the window sill. Ill try again when I need to make more butters.</li>
            <li> The product itself was fresh and handled with care. But what truly set the bar high for me with this company was how quickly I received my package! It&#x27;s creamy Shea butter is double wrapped and sealed carefully. It&#x27;s unrefined so there are minute traces of nut remnants. Over all I&#x27;d definitely shop here again! I use the butter in my hair &amp; my hair loves it!!! You can see the results at [...]. I don&#x27;t have a tutorial for it, but it&#x27;s what I used in my bentonite clay tutorial!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering shea butter from Amazon, and I chose the right seller. I love the amount I get for the price. I think I either got a deal or the price fluctuates, because this product was 16 dollars when I ordered it. I came back in two days and it had gone up to 26 dollars. O_o&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like the fact that it&#x27;s unrefined and has it&#x27;s normal smell and properties. The 5 pound bag really had a lot in it. I&#x27;m impressed because I made my hair and body batch with various oils and still have some left over to store. It was half melted when it arrived at my door, but considering that it&#x27;s nearly 90 degrees and it was riding around in a hot truck, that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this product is the packaging. It was wrapped in plastic, and had another random plastic bag holding it. They should at least use a Ziploc bag or something so the shea butter won&#x27;t look so sloppy and unorganized when it gets to the customer. But other than that, I will be using this seller again. Good amount for the price I paid and good quality!&lt;br /&gt;Check out my blog about natural hair![...]</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Pure, clean, chemical and dye free 100% Shea butter for a great price! I use it on my children and my own skin, hair, small abrasions(high in vit E and A), and even on the skins of our traditional drums. Excellent, healing, allergic-free lotion!</li>
            <li> I researched a long while before I made my purchase. Their butter is nice and soft, but does have that Shea Butter smell. It was easy to use, and not clumpy, but smooth. I use it for the items I make and sale online.</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 pounds of this Ivory Shea Butter from Saaqin (Halal Every Day) about 2 months back when it was only $12.  I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s jumped up in price.  It&#x27;s fairly clean, with very few foreign items in it (like sticks).  It&#x27;s got a very nice, nutty smell. Mine came in a large chunk with a few broken bits in the bag.  It&#x27;s very soft, as is, and I process it with emu oil or olive oil into whipped butter for personal use.  I have eczema and my husband has rosacea.  The end result after whipping is a nice, light, white emollient.  I can&#x27;t complain about the quality; I&#x27;m just shocked at the price increase.  There are others on Amazon who sell the same quality for less money, so until Saaqin drops the price again, look around.</li>
            <li> Very good price for very good product, came exactly how described.  I like the ivory better than the yellow butter.  Shea butter is good for the skin and is very easy to mix with olive oil or any other oil if desried.  Makes for a good body or hair cream.</li>
            <li> Best shea butter I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> It wasn´t Ivory&lt;br /&gt;But good as always</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Nice and silky. Color is great. Melts like a dream, mixes wonderfully. Smells natural. Love it.</li>
            <li> The texture of the ivory Shea butter is so much more creamer then the traditional yellow Shea butter. Please the smell isn&#x27;t as strong!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!  4 stars only because the manner in which the product was wrapped could have been better.  That being said, I will still purchase from this seller again!  It was fresh, smooth and had little or no bits in it (from the hull of the nut).  It&#x27;s amazing on my type 4b natural hair!</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome shea butter I have bought yet.  It is smooth, creamy, and just lovely.  I had been purchasing the yellow and it has a much stronger scent compared to this ivory one.  I just love this mildly scented one that has the perfect texture.  I use it to make body butters, and deodorant.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Nice consistency with low scent. Works well in soap and butters</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered pure Shea Butter from other sites and by far this is the best. Shipping is a bit pricey but very fast. I would order again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This shea butter arrived in a most impressive packaging. The bag was very sturdy and the shea butter was enveloped in strong plastic. This shea smelt so fresh with a firm, yet soft texture. The shea butter was clean and free of any foreign bodies. The color was a soft French white with the classic, unrefined markings of just a hint of pale green. I just love it and I will be ordering this shea butter again. I am African American with natural hair. I use shea butter as a main ingredient in my hair and body product, along with mango and cocoa butter, and of course natural oils.</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin and hair! I blend it up to make different creams and oils. It also shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Tremendous value. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and great stuff work for making what every you want.I love this stuff A+++ thank you</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for,smooth Shea butter,not gritty.</li>
            <li> The butter is smooth, without bits on seed shell that can show up in other raw shea butters. It arrived fresh, as if it had just been packed right before shipping. I have been ordering this from Halal Everyday, and I am even more excited about it ow because of their new packaging. It has always been and still is wrapped in plastic-wrap, but also comes in an airtight bag now. It takes me a few months to go through 5 lbs, and in the bag it stays fresh as when it arrived. Highly recommend for anyone making skincare and hair products with it. Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed. I realize it was unrefined Shae Butter but I did not expect it to be brownish.  My fault for expecting to much. So I continue to look.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product, when it came some of it was not totally wrapped up almost like it was leaking and the smell of the shea butter was pretty awful. I don&#x27;t see myself using any of this product which is unfortunate because i got 5 lbs of it.</li>
            <li> This batch had pieces of shell but overall was ok.  I didn&#x27;t expect the color to be yellowish because I ordered the Ivory grade.  I like Ivory grade better because the nutty smell is not as strong.  I will add essential oils to tone down the nutty smell when mixing body butters.</li>
            <li> Remember-this is raw shea butter, so it will have imperfections, but it hasn&#x27;t had all the good stuff stripped from it.  I like the beige better because it doesn&#x27;t impart a yellow tone to everything.  I didn&#x27;t find it had a strong odor-it smelled like shea.  If you don&#x27;t like the scent, then get deodorized.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem covering the smell of shea butter, and I&#x27;ve always used raw shea.  There will be leftover stuff sometimes in the butter-if you want to get the stuff out like the strings and specs, melt down what you&#x27;re going to use and filter through a strainer with a coffee filter.  If you want all that stuff done ahead of time, you are going to pay more for your shea butter.  Works just fine for me in lotions and soap.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Shea butter is the best stuff on earth. For real! Great to mix with other products or use alone. It did arrive in a plastic bag like everybody said but I don&#x27;t get the problem made it easier to cut up in sections and re-wrap what I didn&#x27;t use right away. Cooking it and making the whipped Shea butter for hair and lip products took some practice but now awesome! If you are dry get this product!!!</li>
            <li> HalalEveryDay is THE best and the leaders in supplying excellent quality raw unrefined mango butter, I will not purchase this product from no other. We only this quality butter in our brand, JourneysMother lotion pellets and lotion bars. The shipping is ALWAYS FAST and problem free. I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this and many other natural products from this wonderful establishment!</li>
            <li> The price was right and this is the smooth white shea butter that I was looking for.  No hard pieces just what it says shea butter.... quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding the Shea Butter and its aroma.  Some customers like it, others don&#x27;t.  I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it based on the \\&quot;don&#x27;ts.\\&quot;  I wanted the moisturizing benefits I heard it gave so that determined my decision to buy it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Yes, there is a smoky, burnt aroma but it is definitely a personal opinion as to whether you will like it or not.  The feeling it gives this \\&quot;southern girl\\&quot; is comfort.  Thanks to the women and men who bring this product to us.</li>
            <li> As a long-time Shea butter user I am very disappointed in this. Initially it seemed OK, albeit a bit gray-toned, and I stored it while using my other brand which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinarily I melt my other brands of  Shea butter in a double boiler and add to my regular lotions to make it richer and creamier. My other brands of Shea melt and blend in easily. Occasionally in winter I&#x27;ll use it straight on my skin, and it does not leave my skin greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I finally tried melting some of this Shea in a double-boiler, and it immediately started turning dark gray. The longer you heat it the darker it becomes - almost black. I tried another small batch and the same thing happened. I will not add blackish oil to my lotion, so I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I rubbed some un-melted shea on my hand and found it to be very sticky and difficult to apply. I do not want this product on my skin, so I threw away the remainder - almost 5 lbs! - in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A serious amount for the price.  I am more than happy with the purchase.  I will certainly reccommend to my soaping friends.  Great product and value for price.  I will definitely repurchase from this buyer.  Would like to visit your store for other products.  Thanks a mil for such a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT !! My family uses shea butter on a regular basis for our hair and skin. In the winter months we use quite a bit of it. With this purchase i&#x27;m ensured to have enough to go around. The product was neatly and securely packaged. I intend to purchase my shea butter from this seller.</li>
            <li> I stop going to 125th street in Harlem several years back for Shea Butter and this product is the reason why.  I still love my Harlem and 125th but I know get the same product for less money.</li>
            <li> I had great results from this butter I purchased. I love the color and that it was not grainy at all.</li>
            <li> Used it for a healing balm mixed with other ingredients - good stuff. Need alot of essential oils to mask smell of shea butter</li>
            <li> I received yellow shea butter instead of ivory which is in the des ription.  There seems to be some controversy as to whether or not the yellow is actually shea butter or not.  The last order I received was ivory.  While there seems to be a little but of textural differences it works well enough for my creams. I just wish I would have received what I ordered and paid for</li>
            <li> I purchashed it and it took no time to get to me. It very moisturizing and good for natural hair. Multi-purpose and a lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, I received this is a box with a sealed bag inside. Works really well, does have a slight odor to it, but nothing that you can detect from a foot away.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky and shiny&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because it doesn&#x27;t have added chemicals or alcohol in the mix</li>
            <li> I have to just say Thank you HalalEveryDay for providing me with the best sheabutter ever.. It arrived to me pretty fast. I want to say in about 2 to 3 business days, which was great. It arrived secruely in a tight plastic bag inside a U.S. postal package box, which was just fine. I wasnt worried how dolled up the package was but in fact, how great this product would be. The shea butter was soft but yet hard. It did not crumble in my hands like old shea butter. I didnt use the shea just raw, i made my Shae Souffle. Which is MAGNIFICENT!!!!!I just ordered another 5lb(dont judge me)lol. This is my daughrers and I, Go To moisture and would NEVER go back to regular store bought lotion. Again, Thank you HalalEveryDay for a great product. You have 2 customers (my daughter and i) for lfe....</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to use with my soap and body butter production.  I think this product is awsome.  It was delivered on time and it makes a wonderful soap and a scrumptious whipped body butter that melts when it touches your skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was a better product, the packing was also better the Shea butter was a good clean grade easy to use. I will order this one again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and so do my family and relatives. I gave a 5lb bag to my mother. The next day she told me she was throwing the entire bag out because, she said, &amp;#34;it had gone bad&amp;#34;. No it hadn&#x27;t. I correctly guessed that she was expecting a cream that smelled &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, and explained to her that this was not a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, and was all natural, unprocessed and raw, and that the smell was the natural odor of the nuts which would dissipate only minutes after application. She rescued the bag from the trash and gave it a try, and now she absolutely loves it. The 5 lb bag was so big that she separated the butter into more than a dozen jars and gave them to relatives and friends. Now everyone raves about it. Note that we all use the cream as is, out of the bag. Most people prefer to whip it or melt it into other concoctions. That would makes it easier to apply, but as a guy I can&#x27;t be bothered with the work. Use it out of the bag, simple and hassle-free :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip to those who intend to whip it and infuse it with essential oils or other fragrance: the product does retain heavily its raw nut smell, so it can overpower whatever you add. I tried adding lavender, rosemary, sage, and various citrus to it and didn&#x27;t like the result. But I was being lazy and tried to add the essential oil directly into the butter. You might get good result by whipping it first. Like I said, I can&#x27;t be bothered when it is so good right out of the bag.</li>
            <li> Ok so my 3 month old baby has crazy skin, it would get dry and peel..I tried aveeno, cetaphil, califonia baby and none of these products healed and moisturized my babies skin like the Shea butter...  I also use it on my hair and skin...I create a mixture of Shea butter, and other essential oils and wow...I can moisture everything</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I use it all over. I wanted to have enough to last and try different creams. It has not disappointed me. I still have a LOT left over and I love the creaminess of it. I have been using it to keep my feet soft and it is working. I use it on my face as well. Great product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This by far the best natural (organic) Shea butter I have ever bought.  The quality is wonderful and effective.  The price is unbeatable for the volume you receive.  My skin and hair is very soft and supple, and the scent is not harsh at all.  What a Blessing!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This shea butter was rancid when I received it.  Upon opening package, I threw it away immediately.  It was very disappointing.  I have been using shea butter for over 15 years and this is the first time having this experience.</li>
            <li> I used shea butter from head to toe. I make natural hair products and hand creams with it. I received the exact amount I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this priduct - smell, color, grade and price.  Ivory is by far my fav .  I will be purchase more.</li>
            <li> So rich and creamy, it blends well with and gives body and substance to other oils for the foundation of beautiful body butter! Wonderful color (white does not stain) and and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in a good, sturdy heavy mm, sealed plastic sack. Packed well to avoid shifting. When the time comes, I suspect I will recorder from this seller and expect the same good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that may not be for a little while yet. This has been a very hefty bang for my buck. And this makes me really happy.</li>
            <li> Love this product this is my go to winter product for the largest organ on the human body.  I want to bathe in Shea butter.  It has my skin glowing throughout the northeast region.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is definitely of high quality, especially compared to others on the market.  The color is right, the smell (though a very different smell compared to a lot of oils) is right and the price is right!  Personally, I don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter.  But when I made it into soap, along with the essential oils and other ingredients, you don&#x27;t smell it at all.  I would imagine that if you are looking for something natural and of good quality for your skin, the smell will not deter you from using this wonderful oil.  I chose 5 stars because I am completely 100% happy with my purchase.  As for it being rancid (which mine was not), it is definitely possible when buying any type of oil for it to become rancid.  My advise would be to wait until the weather is not hot (I ordered mine in December) which is the most likely reason for it becoming rancid.</li>
            <li> So I ordered mine in the middle of the summer and had no big problems with melting. It was packaged very well and came in a timely matter. My batch was not gritty and had a really nice &amp;#34;buttery/smooth&amp;#34; consistency. I saw very few pieces of nut/shell in mine. I mixed mine with some virgin olive oil and vitamin e and it works great. I might add some coconut oil the next time I mix some.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is wonderful, this is raw, it comes in a box wrapped in a plastic bag like is was cut from a &amp;#34;Shea Wheel&amp;#34; but it is really good quality.  I keep it refrigerated since it is raw and unrefined and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it to make it have some long duration shelf life.... just in case.  I use it and I have to tell you that it is goooood stuff.  If you are dry this will definitely help and it has longevity on the skin.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is as nice as the shea I have paid twice as much for! It makes wonderful soap, and we use it straight out of the bag for our face cream. I transfered it out of the bag into acontaner I already had. will buy more!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this shea raw butter 3 times. It is pure and it is so good for so many things. This is good quality shea butter.</li>
