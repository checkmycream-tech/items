            <li>I&#x27;m a prime user, so I get the 2-day free shipping.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable as a disposable razor</li>
            <li>but there are no painful nicks.</li>
            <li>I saw that you can set-up a delivery time to receive a new set of blades once a year or so, and that might be a good option, but my blades lasted a good year and a half to two years!</li>
            <li>These replacement part went right into place with fuss.</li>
            <li>It is easier and more economical to replace these parts of the razor than to have to replace the entire razor!</li>

            <li>Exactly what my husband has been looking for to fix his electric razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace the old foil and blade set with the new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the replacement shaver foil and blade set and found that it really does help to change those every so often.  </li>
            <li>Razor does not shave very close though.</li>
            <li>Works okay on short hair but takes a few more passes on longer leg and underarm hair.</li>
            <li>Did not use it yet, but it is the same thing as the original.  </li>
            <li>Price is high as the replacement costs almost as much as buying a replacement razor.</li>
            <li>So when I started looking for a new electric razor, I found this replacement set for the blades!</li>
            <li>and now I feel like I have a new razor again!</li>
            <li>however the sliding long-hair trimmer pulls and this does NOT replace that particular blade.</li>
            <li>These blades and foils made my wife&#x27;s electric razor work like new.</li>
            <li>By replacing the foils and blades, it&#x27;s like it being new again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realise how dul my old blades had gotten, what a difference!</li>
            <li>The subscription price is also discounted a little from the regular Amazon price, so that&#x27;s appealing.</li>
            <li>The shaver foil and blade set arrived early, as usual, and were incredibly easy to install.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I would rather buy a new shaver than use these replacement parts the next time.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, this does not have any replacement for the little blades that are connected to the foil</li>
            <li>I had a little bit of difficulty replacing the foils but the shaver works very well.</li>

            <li> These blades and foils made my wife&#x27;s electric razor work like new.</li>
            <li> These replacement part went right into place with fuss.It took longer to figure out how to remove the origional parts.</li>
            <li> Great to have this on hand so I ordered before I needed,,,I am sure it will be great when I need it</li>
            <li> we haven&#x27;t used the replacement yet, but should be fine, she loves the Panasonic ES2216PC shaver, I think I&#x27;ll get me one too!</li>

            <li> Exactly what my husband has been looking for to fix his electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic Wet/Dry razor for a while now.  I&#x27;ve ordered the replacement shaver foil and blade set and found that it really does help to change those every so often.  By signing up for the subscription, the replacements get sent to me at intervals that I choose, and I&#x27;m charged the current price for it. I get a reminder e-mail telling me it&#x27;s due to ship in case there is anything I want to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself has been great. It shaves really close and has functioned perfectly for me. I put it on the charger once a week or so, but have never run out of charge on it. By replacing the foils and blades, it&#x27;s like it being new again. The replacements are cheaper than buying a new razor each time it gets dull. The subscription price is also discounted a little from the regular Amazon price, so that&#x27;s appealing. I&#x27;m a prime user, so I get the 2-day free shipping. I feel like this is win-win all the way around.</li>
            <li> By replacing the head on my Panasonic it was like I had a new razor for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Glad I have refills so when I travel I won&#x27;t be without supplies. It is ok, however I am still looking for that perfect razor</li>
            <li> When one of my blades popped out of my razor, after using it often for at least 2-3 years, I thought it was done for! So when I started looking for a new electric razor, I found this replacement set for the blades! It was super easy to pop the old ones out and the new ones in...and now I feel like I have a new razor again! I saw that you can set-up a delivery time to receive a new set of blades once a year or so, and that might be a good option, but my blades lasted a good year and a half to two years!</li>
            <li> Note that this is for a WOMEN&#x27;S electric razor. I had a little bit of difficulty replacing the foils but the shaver works very well.</li>
            <li> The set arrived promptly, on the short side of the stated arrival time. The blade set fit perfectly.  I replace the blades annually, and have always ordered from Amazon for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> the replacement parts work in the panasonic and it is an ok product. Razor does not shave very close though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the blades which had grown duller by shaving. It only contains a set of inner blades and not the outer blades. It was also a time consuming to replace the foils as the instructions were not very clear and did not contain a lot of pictures with the instructions. Considering the price, I would rather buy a new shaver than use these replacement parts the next time.</li>
            <li> No it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered and it wasn&#x27;t what was shown on the picture. Plus that&#x27;s a women&#x27;s razor blade not men&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Ordered these replacements for my women&#x27;s wet/dry shaver (ES 4095??) that was deemed an &#x27;historic item&#x27; ...which must mean obsolete. I had the razor for, oh, about 15 years?? The replacements fit, but the razor stopped working soon after I purchased these, which is too bad because the new one doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well.  I will keep looking...</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the old foil and blade set with the new one. Works okay on short hair but takes a few more passes on longer leg and underarm hair. Not as comfortable as a disposable razor but there are no painful nicks. Price is high as the replacement costs almost as much as buying a replacement razor.</li>
