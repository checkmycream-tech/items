            <li>Great job</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful, distinctive fragrance, that makes you feel amazing while wearing it.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD ALSO.</li>
            <li>I received this from my husband as a gift after having a sample that I really loved.</li>
            <li>(But, I love the fragrance and hope it is never discontinued!)</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>Nice scent though</li>
            <li>Sometimes cheap is not always good.</li>
            <li>Fresh, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a very high end and great scent.</li>
            <li>AND IS SO CUTE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Jivago 24K for over 20 years and people are usually able to tell when I&#x27;m in a room.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, but do not like the atomizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>I love this perfume but there is a flaw in the spray top.</li>
            <li>-I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with buying it from neiman Smell good at first</li>
            <li>I am not too sure I like this perfume, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was but not the fault of the seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is not an authentic product.</li>
            <li>but it sure fool me the real one I use to put it on in the morning</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and sweet smelling can be come very intoxicating to me anyway</li>
            <li>Again, the fragrance is wonderful, but the spray bottle sucks!  </li>
            <li>You just keep working at it until you finally get something, then don&#x27;t move the nozzle -- you will loose that perfect contact that releases the spray.  </li>
            <li>everyone, she &amp;#34;showed&amp;#34; me how happy she was that evening, a few times.</li>
            <li>I received my favorite perfume and the nozzle on the bottle is not working properly.</li>
            <li>This perfume is my ultimate favorite on my wife.</li>
            <li>24K is a very versatile scent.  </li>
            <li>I have giving it to my sitter and buying me the real thing.</li>
            <li>I give an ABSOLUTE 5 star for the fragrance, the packaging, the delivery, the description and a 1 star for the spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li>So I really messed up when it came to getting my girlfriend her Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li>this item, she was ecstatic and we both couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>this one I&#x27;m lucky if I still smell 2 hours latter</li>
            <li>It is a classic addition to anyone&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li>The only downside with Jivago 24K Eau De Parfum is it only last for a few hours, so its best to layer this scent with Jivago 24K lotion.</li>
            <li>NONE OF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY, NOW, MY MOM DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A PRESENT, THANKS TO AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the perfume, the spray nozzle is hard to get the perfume to spray out.</li>
            <li>it hardly comes out of the bottle, would have given it a five star if that worked better.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low to find this perfume, had to order it on Christmas Eve, and received it at the exact time she started mentioning how diaappointed she was that I did not try harder to get it for her.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for her several years ago from a retail store for nearly 3 times the amount I bought it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the company(not the shipper) would go back to the old top(8-10 years ago)-other than that</li>
            <li>bottle top was broken</li>

            <li> bottle top was broken</li>
            <li> It is slightly defective which prevents me to spray completely.  </li>
            <li> I get so frustrated with the top that I take tools to open which leaves the bottle looking less desirable.</li>
            <li> As a last resort in the past, I have disassembled the bottle and placed the EDP in another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump on the bottle also did not function properly... :/</li>
            <li> No gotten compliments as expected!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the plastic tube feeding down to the bottom of the bottle for spraying.  </li>
            <li> I shake it, turn it upside down etc to get it to spray.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a watered down, heavily diluted version of the fragrance!!  </li>
            <li> This is Not a real product!!!!</li>
            <li> i hate that Neiman Marcus discontinued it because this is definitely not cutting it and doing the job for me.  </li>
            <li> Only a little perfume is sprayed when in use, it is annoying.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all!!</li>
            <li> Very irritating.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and has a strange sticker on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality and would certainly not recommend purchasing anything at all from this retailer.</li>
            <li> grrrr</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Very bad design!</li>
            <li> , THE SERVICE IS AWFUL, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT SOLVE MY PROBLEM, AND</li>

            <li> Jivago 24K is a very versatile scent.  It can be worn during the summer or winter without being a overpowering fragrance.  The only downside with Jivago 24K Eau De Parfum is it only last for a few hours, so its best to layer this scent with Jivago 24K lotion.</li>
            <li> I received my favorite perfume and the nozzle on the bottle is not working properly. It is slightly defective which prevents me to spray completely.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Well I thought I getting a great deal I think I&#x27;ll stick with buying it from neiman Smell good at first it looks like the same thing I&#x27;ve been using but it sure fool me the real one I use to put it on in the morning and it will stay with me for the rest of the day and morning this one I&#x27;m lucky if I still smell 2 hours latter Will never buy it online I have giving it to my sitter and buying me the real thing. Sometimes cheap is not always good.</li>
            <li> I give an ABSOLUTE 5 star for the fragrance, the packaging, the delivery, the description and a 1 star for the spray nozzle.  However, I have been wearing this fragrance (and everyone knows me by it) for 10+ years and the nozzle has always been an issue.  This order, same thing, you pump and pump the nozzle and can&#x27;t get anything out of it. You just keep working at it until you finally get something, then don&#x27;t move the nozzle -- you will loose that perfect contact that releases the spray.  As a last resort in the past, I have disassembled the bottle and placed the EDP in another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TOTALLY WISH Jivago would FIX this!  (But, I love the fragrance and hope it is never discontinued!)</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL GIFT ITEM. PACKAGED WELL AND IS SO CUTE. SMELLS GOOD ALSO. BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF AND AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A FRIEND</li>
            <li> My friend admired this fragrance from my collection, so I purchased it for her as a gift. She loves it!</li>
            <li> It smells like Jvago 24K, however, there&#x27;s no lingering fragrance about 30 minutes after it&#x27;s sprayed.  I&#x27;ve worn Jivago 24K for over 20 years and people are usually able to tell when I&#x27;m in a room.  This is definitely a watered down, heavily diluted version of the fragrance!!  i hate that Neiman Marcus discontinued it because this is definitely not cutting it and doing the job for me.  Not pleased at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain that this is not an authentic product. It smells completely different than the Jivago 24K that I had from Nordstrom. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality and would certainly not recommend purchasing anything at all from this retailer. I thought I would save some money, but I ended up with a substandard product. Very irritating.</li>
            <li> So I really messed up when it came to getting my girlfriend her Christmas gifts this year. I searched high and low to find this perfume, had to order it on Christmas Eve, and received it at the exact time she started mentioning how diaappointed she was that I did not try harder to get it for her. Considering that they were no longer mfg this item, she was ecstatic and we both couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the fast shipping. Great job everyone, she &amp;#34;showed&amp;#34; me how happy she was that evening, a few times.</li>
            <li> On time, and all&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, but do not like the atomizer.  It doesn&#x27;t have the plastic tube feeding down to the bottom of the bottle for spraying.  Instead, there is no tube.  I shake it, turn it upside down etc to get it to spray.  At the rate I&#x27;m going, I&#x27;ll have it for 20 yrs.  Again, the fragrance is wonderful, but the spray bottle sucks!  Very bad design!</li>
            <li> I am not too sure I like this perfume, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was but not the fault of the seller.</li>
            <li> It appears that the spray bottle does not work properly.  Only a little perfume is sprayed when in use, it is annoying.</li>
            <li> The perfume that I ordered did not smell like the Jivago that I have been wearing for years! I had my friend and Husband also give me their thoughts--they both agreed it wasn&#x27;t the same. The pump on the bottle also did not function properly... :/</li>
            <li> This is Not a real product!!!! The bottle is not even correct. JIVAGO has a gold and white gold(silver) design on the front of the bottle. This bottle is entirely gold in color. It smells awful and has a strange sticker on the bottle. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Fresh, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Grear price.</li>
            <li> bottle top was broken</li>
            <li> I love this scent it&#x27;s light and sweet smelling can be come very intoxicating to me anyway</li>
            <li> This perfume is my ultimate favorite on my wife. It smells incredible. At regular retailers, this item sells for over $150 bucks for the same perfume. This is a very high end and great scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the perfume, the spray nozzle is hard to get the perfume to spray out. Try and try to spray it bit it hardly comes out of the bottle, would have given it a five star if that worked better. Still trying to use it instead of sending it back or throwing the bottle away .......grrrr</li>
            <li> This is a valentines gift for my wife.  I purchased it for her several years ago from a retail store for nearly 3 times the amount I bought it through Amazon.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but there is a flaw in the spray top. This is the 4rd bottle I have had a problem with-even after shaking the bottle/or point downward as stated in the instructions. I get so frustrated with the top that I take tools to open which leaves the bottle looking less desirable. I wish that the company(not the shipper) would go back to the old top(8-10 years ago)-other than that-I love this fragrance. Shipping as stated-will purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from amazon LLC, and im a Prime Member, supposed to get it within 2 business days, WELL, THAT DIDNT HAPPEN, AMAZON, SCREWED UP EVERYTHING, THEY DIDNT GIVE ME MY PRIME, THE SERVICE IS AWFUL, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT SOLVE MY PROBLEM, AND NONE OF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY, NOW, MY MOM DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A PRESENT, THANKS TO AMAZON!, THIS IS THE LAST TIME I TRUST YOU, IM GOING TO START SHOPPING IN EBAY.</li>
            <li> No gotten compliments as expected! Nice scent though, the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I received this from my husband as a gift after having a sample that I really loved. It is a wonderful, distinctive fragrance, that makes you feel amazing while wearing it. It is a classic addition to anyone&#x27;s collection.</li>
