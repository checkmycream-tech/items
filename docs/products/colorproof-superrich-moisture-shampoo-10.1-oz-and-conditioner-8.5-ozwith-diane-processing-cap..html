            <li>Not that great- doesn&#x27;t smell as great as it ssys either.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner, I look forward to trying more of the Colorproof line.</li>
            <li>before I would go to the hair dresser every 4 weeks, now I go every 6 to 8 weeks and that mostly depends on if I need a trim or not.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>Great product makes my hair super soft !</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, mint almost.   </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It lasts about 6 months if you use it right</li>
            <li>exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Color proof is not only what Purology used to be,  it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Definitely extends my color and is helping me get my hair back to healthy after a 6 month attempt to lighten with my stylist.</li>
            <li>I love this product, you only need a pea size amount to shampoo your hair, it seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li>But other then its a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Anti frizz formula (pink bottle) works better for mature coarse frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I literally only have to use a nickel or dime size of shampoo and the price is so reasonable.  </li>

            <li> Since I have been using the Colorproof shampoo and rinse my color stays twice as long as.  </li>
            <li> While it is a bit pricy, I really only need to use half the amount of this shampoo as others I use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this along with smoothing locks and extreme shine serum also from this line.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like rosemary and feels minty..</li>
            <li> Purchased thru Amazon as this product is too expensive at salon.</li>
            <li> I used to use purology before it was bought out, but after it was bought out by Loreal, the shampoo was horrible.  </li>
